<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, seller was great and couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Does not work that well. Confused about the reviews.</li>
    <li> It was as stated in other reviews. Easy to use, heats up quickly, and my favorite part is the glove. It really stops the pain from handling hot hair. A++</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair straightener. Other reviewers mentioned that sometimes the straightener snags or pulls on hair. I noticed this a bit but it seemed only to happen when I squeezed too tightly on the straightener as I pulled it through my hair. Other than that slight issue it works great and straightens very effectively. The argan oil that come with it smells very nice and helps make my hair very soft and not feel dried out and burnt after straightening.  It also comes with a bag that you can put the straightener in after use. I find that very useful when traveling. I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool off before I pack it in my suitcase. It is also dual voltage so you can take it overseas. The seller was great and I received my order very quickly.  In my opinion, I think this is a great value and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Heat settings are not functional. At the very lowest setting, sometimes you can barely feel heat and other times it was hot enough to burn my hair. I&#x27;ve had to chop inches off my hair to remove the heat damaged ends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now and I Love it! There is a huge difference compared to my old one. I was hesitant to buy it since it is so cheap, but it&#x27;s awesome! Best value. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much better! It heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> It works well but not as well as what people are saying on here. I don&#x27;t think it leaves my hair super smooth and shiny. My cheap CORTEX flat iron did a better job with smoothing and also curling. But besides that, it works and it&#x27;s not the worst I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> GREAT straightener! I love it!</li>
    <li> This has been a great product. This item compares in performance and quality to the high dollars irons on the market. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great, would recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Leaves my very curly hair silky-straight!</li>
    <li> Great product for the cost! You could spend alot more for the same quality.  I did my research before purchase and so far very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this straightener.  It received such positive reviews, but when I tried it on my hair I found it snagged badly, and no matter what I did it felt like it was raking through my hair.  I do not recommend this product, and am sending it back.</li>
    <li> Prompt service - product delivered as promised. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have both another very popular brand and an HSI.  The HSI lasted twice as long as the other and worked just as well for a third of the cost. I just purchased my second one and love it!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Very good range for heat adjustment.  Does not pull/catch my hair like my last flat iron did. Love the sleeve so I can put it away immediately after use without leaving it to cool.</li>
    <li> I needed a spare flat iron to keep at my boyfriends house and didn&#x27;t want to spend another $100 on a flat iron. I was hesitant to buy a $40 flat iron assuming you get what you pay for, but after seeing it has 1300 reviews of 4 1/2 stars I figured it was worth a shot. I should&#x27;ve saved my money and put it towards a better quality iron. This is exactly what I would expect from a flat iron you can buy at Ross or TJ Maxx. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot, it pulls my hair(badly), and after only going over a few pieces I could literally see my hair breaking. I have really thick, curly hair, maybe it would work better for someone with thinner hair. I have a Croc flat iron that I absolutely love, I will be buying another one of those.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a straightener off amazon before and it broke within 3 weeks and just randomly stopped working. So I was iffy on getting this one but it was actually wonderful. Had it for a year and never once had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my mother-in-law and she loves it!  Which makes me very happy.  I have also noticed a positive difference in her hair.  Her hair is sleeker and smoother in part because she has a better flat iron.</li>
    <li> Loving it so far! Just wish it had automatic shut off and that&#x27;s why I gave the 4 star. However really love it and came with case and a glove and great hair product. Can&#x27;t beat the deal!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and great price</li>
    <li> Works great on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is light weight and it does a grest job. I am natural and it takes alot to get my hair straight,  this works and leaves it shiny!</li>
    <li> Perfect, Just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Great Product .. excellent service AAA+++</li>
    <li> still works great, wife loves it. With straighteners you get what you pay for. This will last.</li>
    <li> well, i like the temperature (and you can start using it in a min after you turned it on), though the handle is getting heated as well (not comfortable((</li>
    <li> Good and useful and wonderful price</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised...that the product is as good it said it was. Arrived on time and performs brilliantly....cheers  !</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that is often hard to straighten. This straightener doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair and only takes one pass to straighten it. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product!!</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair.  This tugged on my hair and made me appreciate the flat iron I was trying to replace.</li>
    <li> I am able to get the iron clear down to the root of my hair.  It moves very smoothly over my hair and straightens with one sweep.  It does leave my hair silky and straight..</li>
    <li> I wish the actual iron had a little more surface area ( my old professional one that I bought from a salon did ), but it does heat up nicely and is very light and portable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks and I really like it. The ability to adjust the heat is really nice since I have fine hair. Really good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I was using a Sedu for a couple years, which fizzled out, so I purchased this HSI brand.  This is described as &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; but I am doubting the claim.  My very thick hair was noticeably damaged after a couple weeks, I straighten it every other day.  I just can&#x27;t use this anymore.  Going back to the Sedu.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot so I bought 2: one for home and one to keep in my suitcase. I am in love with this straightener. Gets hot fast and makes my hair look great. Great product and fast prime shipping!</li>
    <li> Flat iron works great to straighten my wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I had to get a narrower flat iron due to a botched haircut :( This flat iron heats fairly quickly and there is a knob to adjust the heat setting depending on your type of hair. The cord has a nice rotating feature so that it doesn&#x27;t become twisted or tangled as you are moving it around your head. It also comes with a storage bag, glove for handling a hot iron, and a small vile of Argan oil which is a leave-in conditioner. The bag is fairly narrow and I cannot fit the cord inside which is a bummer. I don&#x27;t use it or the glove but perhaps if I traveled it would come in handy. The oil is very nice &amp; does make a difference in your hair. I&#x27;ve had the iron for about 4 months &amp; still have plenty of oil left. It saves my hair from becoming overly dry and leaves it soft &amp; silky feeling without looking greasy.</li>
    <li> Fast service!! Awesome straightener!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron for the price.  I like the temperature adjustment.  The plates aren&#x27;t as smooth as my old Chi, but it&#x27;s also $100 less.  I like it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my teenage niece.  She loves it.  She says its a big improvement over her old flat iron that she got at Target.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after reading the reviews.  I believed it was a good for what I thought I would be getting. It was delivered packaged nicely with a sleeve for the curling iron and a glove.  However, there were no directions as to the maintenance or how to use the items.  I also purchased the hair protecting spray.  No directions for that either.  I plugged in the flat iron and turned it on.  It did not get very hot, not even when I turned the dial all the way up.  So for the presentation, I give it 5 stars but for the operation I give it a single star because I cannot give it any less.  Sad Face....I thought I was getting a great product.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product so far!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and I just love the product. Easy to use and it leaves my hair straight and shiny!!!!</li>
    <li> As an 8 year CHI veteran, I was hesitant to switch brands when my trusty flat-iron finally gave out. Literally the best decision ever. HSI is so much cheaper, and just as good if not better than CHI. My only complaint is that the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light is on the side, which makes it difficult to see if laying flat on the counter. I am OCD and check to make sure it&#x27;s off several times before I leave, and this is annoying to me. Still worth it, though.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product, good for the price.  It&#x27;s a little heavy for a flat iron and it had a little over two year life span for me. I think that is worth the price considering how much other flat irons can be.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> This is my third straighter in 8 years. My last one was great, but I plugged it into a receptacle in Europe and it was ruined. I chose the HSI for the good reviews and I have not been disappointed. It heats fast, irons evenly and is very smooth. For the price I find it better than the Chi. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good: Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;Bad: Plug is large so I can&#x27;t have a blow dryer and this flat iron plugged in at the same time</li>
    <li> Gave it a shot, it didn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my hair - it dragged along and even pulled when I got to the ends. I returned. I am disappointed due to the many excellent reviews.</li>
    <li> It works well and is very easy to use. It heats up very fast and comes with a small bottle f Aryan oil and a travel bag, that I wish had a zipper on it. There is an indicator light that turns from red to green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased using this straight iron, versus a regular iron I bought at the store.</li>
    <li> So far the iron heats up quickly and it seems to do a quality job of straightening the kinks. It comes with a nice carrying case and glove.</li>
    <li> Good product and quick shipment but it is not as good as my Sedu. The Sedu is 3x the price though. For the price this is an excellent flat iron.  As good as the Chi I would say.</li>
    <li> no problems work great</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! I am on a hair growth journey and am trying to make sure I keep my hair relatively healthy (although I still heat style). I have been natural for three years, and this iron straightens my 3a,3b,and4a nape sooo well!! I use Carols Daughter Monoi collection and hair balm, along with my silk elements protection spray and Got2b protection spray just for the ends (its a bit oily) and my hair has grown so well the past three months and is bouncy! My hair does not revert and barely did the time my hair was completely rained on at an amusement park! Make sure to use a comb or brush to flat iron on your kinkier sections or the flat iron may slightly snag. Also, hard to curl with this flat iron, has anyone else experienced that?</li>
    <li> I was devastated when I broke a plate on the flat iron I had used for years.  My husband found this one on amazon and I decided to try it because it was cheap and the reviews were good. After using it for two weeks I must say that I love this flat iron!! Best purchase I have made in a long time. My hair remains straight,  frizz free and shiny all day, even on the extra humid days! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> works great for my afro-latina hair</li>
    <li> One word describes this flat iron!  AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Great product, great value!</li>
    <li> Worst One Ever!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I hadn&#x27;t gone by all the good reviews here....it is a really terrible product. I have long and soft hair that need just a little bit of more ironing to look better. This straightener pulls my hair every time I slide it through. Not smooth at all, the shape is not an easy grip to hold and the effects were BAD! It doesn&#x27;t really get the job done. Sigh!</li>
    <li> I never post reviews but seriously love this iron for my frizzy thick curls ! Pin straight hair and very little damage</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great!  Love the free sample of Argon oil that came with it.  Has a good feel in the hand,  not slippery.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener! Awesome value - highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a straightener that will leave your hair looking silky and healthy!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to heat up as hot as my older Revlon flat iron and didn&#x27;t run as smoothly through my hair.</li>
    <li> fantastic product ! i would recommend this product to anyone! good job👍</li>
    <li> I only plan on using this to curl my hair, so far it works well.</li>
    <li> I like it better than my chi. Hope it&#x27;s last as long too.</li>
    <li> The BEST flat iron I have owned. My daughter and daughter-n-law have both had to borrow for extended periods and loved it (both have very curly hair).</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the way my hair looks after using this product. I&#x27;ve owned 3 different straighteners (including a chi) and this is by far my favorite! Also came with a swanky pouch and argan oil leaving my hair silky smooth and not greasy. Fast shipping as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I have very thick, curly hair and this flat iron works great on it. I LOVE how my hair looks after styling it with this. I would give it more stars if I could!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to try and make my hair healthier so that I could grow it out. My old straightener was killing my ends. I have noticed a big difference with this one, it does far less damage. At first I thought it didn&#x27;t run smoothly enough through my hair, but that was my own fault because I didn&#x27;t let it heat up enough. Once it has fully heat up, the glide is very smooth. I think this is a great product and the carrying case is very pretty too.</li>
    <li> Been a Chi user for years. This has been a great inexpensive replacement.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, goes smoothly through hair, love the swivel cord</li>
    <li> I love it, and it was delivered incredibly quick!</li>
    <li> I have multiple issues with this product. First, this flat iron does not get hot. I had the dial turned up to the highest temperature setting and it was barely warm. Second, I don&#x27;t like that there is no way of knowing what temperature the flat iron is actually set to. The dial shows 410 degrees at the top and that&#x27;s it. Third, when you flip the switch to on there is no indicator light letting you know that it is in fact turned on. Last, I don&#x27;t like the placement of the controls. If I could give this flat iron zero stars I would.</li>
    <li> This will be perfect for international travel since it&#x27;s dual voltage. It&#x27;s not a small travel size, but it&#x27;s not advertised as such. Most appliances that give off heat, like flat irons and hair dryers, need a converter when you travel overseas. With this product you just need an adapter to fit in the plug-ins. Very convenient!!</li>
    <li> It is a great product</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this straightener!</li>
    <li> Would not heat up. Hit the reset button each time i plugged it in, but eventually even that did not work. Returned it</li>
    <li> My only complaint is there was no packing slip in the purchase. Hard to call someone with problems when there is no information in the package. Product is great!</li>
    <li> definitely not what I expected, it pulls my hair A LOT and it doesn&#x27;t heats up as I think a flat iron should.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but wish I would have gotten the larger size one.</li>
    <li> I love this iron!!! Leaves your hair smooth and silky! Totaly reccomend it!</li>
    <li> This straightener is okay. It gets the job done, but it takes a while to heat up and then it needs to reheat quite a bit during the same session</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, it works just as good, of not better than my flat iron that I paid well over $100.00 for.  I am very happy with my purchase! If you are on the fence, get it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and awkwardly curly/wavey/frizzy hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for a flat iron that will straighten my hair in somewhat of a timely matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I received this flat iron I was using a Chi, which was working fine, but I was wanting something that got hotter and sped up my straightening time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely say that this one gets hotter than the Chi, plus it&#x27;s really nice that it has a temperature dial, which the Chi does not. The only thing that the Chi does better than this is glide through me hair (which is why I gave it 4 stars not 5), the Chi provides a smoother glide over my hair. But with that being said, I would still recommend this one over the Chi because it works great and is about 1/4 the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a chi for 5 years, and my mom wanted one. i bought her this HSI instead and I&#x27;m about to make the switch. Amazing quality. I rate it over my chi.</li>
    <li> Works better than my old CHI! Great bargain</li>
    <li> I thought this straightener would be better than my old one, but I&#x27;m using the old one again. I don&#x27;t like the way it straightens my hair, the result is good, but to get there takes me long.</li>
    <li> I received a defected flat iron. After the first time I used it, the flat iron headed up then turned off. I had trouble turning it on. I have to play with the buttons on the outlet for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. my hair got stuck under the plates when I ran it thru&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s a pain to turn on (bc u have to hold down on the red button on the plug every time&lt;br /&gt;3. After the first use, the flat iron turns off every time it heats up&lt;br /&gt;4. I contacted the seller and they sent me the wrong flat iron (didn&#x27;t even check my order to see which one I bought)</li>
    <li> My hair has never been straighter!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m just not using it hot enough, but it hasn&#x27;t really produced that shiny sleek look I was hoping for. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed it rips my hair out. I would have bought the Chi if I were to go back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for what I paid. I did expect better, but it works well enough to get me happily through the day</li>
    <li> Very disappointing!  No auto shut-off, it pulls out hair on the edges of the plates, no improvement of my hair compared with a cheap flat iron.  Aragon oil can bought anywhere and used with any flat iron.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new flat iron and saw the reviews on his on so I decided to try it. I love it! My old flat iron pulled my hair out toward the ends of the plate and this one doesn&#x27;t. My stylist made a house visit to do my hair and fell in love with it as well. She says it&#x27;s definitely professional grade! I would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> This product works great! I was taken aback by how well it works! I was searching for a Chi ,when I can across this product but was skeptical of the price range . Definitely a great bang for your buck !</li>
    <li> Always had a chi before, but was tired of the $100 price tag. Super pleased with my new flat iron from HSI &amp; love the argan oil</li>
    <li> Thank you for your awesome product got it for my wife and she says she loves it, it defenetly beat andis flat iron. If i had onother 3 wifes ill buy three of them.</li>
    <li> This product works great! It leaves my hair smoothe and shiny. Straightens my hair quickly! I would highly recommend. Heats up quickly too!</li>
    <li> I was thinking I needed to spend a ton of money on a new flat iron. I had mine for 15 years and it finally gave out this year. With traveling a lot I wanted something that was durable, but I could easily replace if it broke. This product heats up fast and glides over my hair easily. I do need to take smaller chuncks than I normally would because the plate ends do grab my hard. Though, it does not take my any longer to do my hair. The travel pouch is nice, but it does not fit the cord in with the iron, (That would be really nice). I would buy this product again when my current one is done for.</li>
    <li> A coworker of mine had purchased this flat iron.  Well, one day she brought it into work.  I had asked her if she could straighten my hair for me.  WOW!  I was totally shocked how great my hair looked and even through the next day!  I Just had to purchase and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat!!  I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a great flat iron.  This works so much better than one I had paid 4 times as much!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the shipping speed, and the packaging. The Argan Oil, glove and satin storage bag are a nice perk for the price point. I really like the adjustable heat feature. I only give it 4 stars because I thought it would be a bit wider.</li>
    <li> Great iron for the price</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Works great!</li>
    <li> Love it love it!!! I just got my flat iron today and I wanted to try it right away. I tried without the oil to see how my hair looked and it works awesome, my hair shine beautifully. I only past the iron through my hair twice and was great, took me half the time that with my other one and didnt smell like burn hair!! (I bet works greater with the oil) best flat iron I ever tried. Sooo happy! :)</li>
    <li> Overall, very happy with this product. Easy to use and results exceed expectations. Be aware that it does get VERY hot! My hair is fine and thinner than it once was so I use the coolest setting and it&#x27;s still hot, but with very nice, smooth results. The only negative is the small size and location of the control settings...I have small hands and that tiny knob is still hard to get your fingers in there to adjust. Not a huge deal as I plan to leave it on the low setting, but if it were necessary to manipulate often it would be annoying. That aside, this is an excellent product at a great price. Very pleased and glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better. My hair didn&#x27;t like this at all :\</li>
    <li> Works perfectly....at long last...straight hair with ease!!!</li>
    <li> Thought it would be far superior to the one I already had, but it&#x27;s not. Same ol&#x27; same ol&#x27;. Catches/pulls just as much, even with straightener stuff put on my hair prior. It works, it&#x27;s just no better than any other.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Leaves my hair nice and bone straight. I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re coming up with better flat iron now a days and for lesser prices. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. Love!</li>
    <li> Great straightener, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought my girlfriend this straightner and let me tell you it is amazing! She loves it and surpasses the quality of the previous straighter I had bought her which was more expensive. It gets super hot fast without damaging her hair. I would definitely recommend...</li>
    <li> Needless to say based on the reviews I was really excited to find this straightener. The price was right at $39 and I was really anxious to get it. However, the light indicating when it was ready would go from solid green to red therefore not staying hot enough while I was trying to straighten it. I didn&#x27;t have time to wait for it to go back to green , straighten one piece of hair then wait again. I contacted the seller who was VERY helpful and sent me a new one out right away. However I had the same problem with the second one. I&#x27;ve been using straighteners for about 15 years and I&#x27;ve never had their lights go on and off from ready to not ready? Who has time for that? I&#x27;m very disappointed, but these both are going back ( thanks to a very polite seller!  ) unfortunately. I also want to mention I did try pressing the reset button several times like other reviewers mentioned but that never helped on either iron. What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> No auto shut-off, the shaft is oddly short. I don&#x27;t like much about this flat-iron but I&#x27;m keeping it due to being too lazy to send it back.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is wonderful.  Now, currently I live somewhere dry and don&#x27;t have to use this all the time, but for a trip to FL I used it daily.  Gotta love humidity! My hair looked just as straight and &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34; as it did out west.  I have thick course hair that easily waves.  Sometimes I just let it go, but having this tool in my inventory is a must! Also, use it daily on my new bangs.  love how it curls. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great and for the price it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Wife and daughter love it and was a good value.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron! Great value. I&#x27;ve tried other flat irons and this one is far better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before so I did a lot of research before I made this purchase.  I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare to but I&#x27;ve had the flat iron for about 2 weeks and so far I love it.  The cord has a swivel on it so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled while you&#x27;re trying to use it.  It has a temperature control and the pouch is really nice too.  I wish it had an automatic shut off.  I don&#x27;t think that will be a problem for me but it would be a nice feature.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 different flat irons in the same price range (2 from Target) and 1 from Amazon before I ended the journey with this one.  I did not give it 5 stars as my hair does not glide through the plates as easily as the flat iron I had previously that this one is replacing.  However, it does a decent job for a fair price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a half a year. Works well so far. It could use a clamp to hold the two sides together for traveling. It stays open all the time. I like how the temp and controls are inside, that way it doesn&#x27;t get turned off by accident while using.</li>
    <li> Works really well and my hair looks shiny every time I use this straightener</li>
    <li> Love how fast it heats up. It does a great job with just one time through. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Really good I like it</li>
    <li> First time using a flat iron and it&#x27;s great.  My hair is much more manageable.</li>
    <li> Actually, this is a gift for  a daughter&#x27;s birthday that is upcoming, but it was on her wish list. She always does a lot of research on the products she chooses so she must feel that this will be a great straightener</li>
    <li> Love this! I have never straighted my hair before, but as I get older my hair is getting a wave in the back. so I decided to try it. I am in love now. Made my hair looks so nice! I recommend this to anyone. It worked great on my first try. Thank you!</li>
    <li> So easy to use! I love the straight, sleek look it produces.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up to that hot of a temperature like it lists it going up to 400 something degrees. It still straightens but for how they advertise what a great brand this is I was unimpressed. I bought a better one from Walmart.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girl, she loves it so it must b really good! Saw her use it and looks like it works as advertised</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling soft and silky. The iron heats up quickly for those morning rushes. I have recommended it to a few people!</li>
    <li> This is just the tool I&#x27;ve been searching for and at just the right price!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s light and it does its job well. I take less time with this iron than with other ones I&#x27;ve previously purchased. Love that you can control the settings, although I always use it on high, since my hair is coarse and quite wavy. Loved the sample oil they sent, want to get it.</li>
    <li> Great iron fast shipping</li>
    <li> For the occasional straightener user, this has worked well for me. It gets hot fast and it came with a glove!! I really need the glove. The package also came with some hair products that I have not used and a bag to keep the straightener in. The cord is long and the product is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Product just as advertized</li>
    <li> Very nice Product for amazing price ..!!!  Thanks to amazon ..!!</li>
    <li> I love this iron! It heats quickly and you can easily adjust the heat setting for your hair. Very easy to use and the cord won&#x27;t get all tangled up. My hair looks so much better after using this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace the cheaper one I had purchased to keep in my motorhome, which I felt was burning up my hair!  This one is really nice, and the price was nice, too.  I have short hair and used it while a bit wet, and it came out very nicely indeed.  I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and the service.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. Works well and was less than half the price of other hair straighteners I considered.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair &amp; this product does a great job straightening it!</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for almost 6 months now. The last couple months I&#x27;ve noticed the temperature has been very temperment. I will have to straighten one layer, wait for it to heat back up then do a new layer. At first the flat iron was great but now it just doesn&#x27;t keep the temperature or keep my hair straight at all. I also bought two others for my sisters, they have also noticed the same problem starting to happen. I&#x27;ve read through some of the negative reviews and found that there are others that have the same problem and got a refund or replacement. I am hoping to return it and get a refund.</li>
    <li> It works as well as my hairdresser&#x27;s  very nicely packaged.  Great buy</li>
    <li> They dont stay hot. The green light turns off and on. Takes forever to flat iron my hair</li>
    <li> Writing this review for my wife as she dictates it to me.....  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This product is great, but my only wish is that it had an auto shut off feature!  Would definitely be a 5 star review if it had this feature.  The flat iron gets hot really fast and does not melt if it stays on for more than 8 hours!  Sadly, I know this from experience!  :) All in all, great product!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener after my T3 stopped working, and I was planning on getting another one until I came across this one. Well, there is obviously a reason the price was so drastically reduced from $199 to $34.99. First of all, it doesn&#x27;t straighten nearly as well as my T3 did. I had to pass it over the same piece of hair several times. (My hair is thick and is a little wavy underneath. Second, it does not glide smoothly over my hair at all and it also pulls. I thought at first maybe I had a picked up a too thick section of hair or that maybe I was clamping it too tightly, but after trying several techniques it still continued to pull my hair. I am very unimpressed with this straightener and am so thankful I didn&#x27;t pay the full price for it. I will definitely be getting a new T3.</li>
    <li> This is a great Flat iron.  Other flat irons can pull your hair or make ugly crimps.  This made straightening easy and fast.</li>
    <li> Product came well packaged and as ordered.  What more can I ask! I ordered three others of the same thing as gifts and this one is for me!  For the mney and excellent little flat iron.</li>
    <li> I needed one to get me by for 4 weeks while over in the States for work and after some research, this one came up as the best value for money.  Totally worth it as hair is naturally a massive frizz bomb.</li>
    <li> This has a good range of heat settings, the package is nice, the glove is usable. The straightener itself is good. The ceramic plates are a little rough on my hair, almost as if they don&#x27;t glide as smoothly as my last iron but for the price and availability of this flatiron I&#x27;d say I can deal with that. It works well for straight and curled styles.</li>
    <li> Truly a professional quality product.</li>
    <li> Handled my wife&#x27;s extremely thick hair with relative ease. Good functionality as well. Packaged and shipped appropriately.</li>
    <li> love this flat iron!!</li>
    <li> This is not what I was expecting, does not work as my original HerStyler I had. This one is not highquality like I was expecting, I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It was so refreshing not to have to pay hundreds of dollars for this product. It is every bit as good as Chi, Croc, Sedu for a fraction of the cost.  Customer service from Blue Novelties is sensational.  Don&#x27;t hesitate buying from them</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and evenly, and holds it&#x27;s temp well. I don&#x27;t have to take &amp;#34;breaks&amp;#34; to let it reheat. I had a CHI strightener prior to this that cost about double, and I&#x27;m happier with the HSI than I was with the CHI.</li>
    <li> I am a complete flat iron novice, but I have wanted one for a while. I knew I wanted a ceramic tourmaline flat iron and other reviews of this product were positive and the price was great so I bought one and it came a few days ago. I&#x27;ve used it twice and so far I am really glad I bought it. The size works for straightening and curling. I really like that it has an adjustable temperature dial because my hair is super fine and other irons I have used have been so hot that it seemed really damaging to my hair. Although the two times I have used this one my curls didn&#x27;t last very long so maybe I need to crank the heat up a bit. Luckily, I am in control of my own heat...with that little dial! The cord is really long, but I guess that is better than it being too short. I don&#x27;t know what to do with the glove. I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> i just recieved it today ,first thing i did was tried it and so far so good .&lt;br /&gt;item box received all squish but no damage to product.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;And for the price I&#x27;m really happy!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. I used it right. away, it heats up&lt;br /&gt;quickly and my hair is so soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Thanks, and I appreciate that the seller resolved the problem of the shipment getting lost and immediately sending me another one.  Very much appreciated!</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW ON 12/23/15: I have changed my review rating for this product from 4 stars to 3 stars. I have actually stopped using it and have gone back to using my old straightener. The HSI flat iron is just not comfortable to hold....it&#x27;s way too chunky and the surface of the straightener is not smooth.  There are pros and cons to this hair straightener. The plates do a good job of straightening my hair. However, I have relatively thin hair and was surprised how high I had to turn the dial to get the necessary heat level to properly straighten my hair. The dial and the off/on switch are below the plates on the inside and are a little awkward to get to, especially if you have big hands. However, the positive is that you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally moving the temperature dial while you&#x27;re straightening. The only other comment I would have is how the straightener feels in your hand. It&#x27;s a little chunky and could have been better designed to fit more comfortably in your hand.</li>
    <li> I never thought about using a flat iron but I developed a couple of cowlicks that were were driving me crazy. My hairdresser said maybe I should try a flat iron &amp; it worked. I&#x27;m very happy with my new purchase &amp; the results!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my sister and she LOVES it, so it deserves 5 stars</li>
    <li> What a great product. and the price was a steal.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! My hair looks and feels super smooth after using it! The oil that comes with it is great as well! I was skeptical but bought another bottle shortly after I ran out! Would recommend for everyone!</li>
    <li> Straightens nicely and quickly.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot and it pulls my hair. I should&#x27;ve follow my instinct and purchase KISS flat iron that I got for daughter two years ago and still works like a charm. Donating it to GOODWILL and ordering a KISS FLAT IRON! Waste of Money and time</li>
    <li> For the price, it is a pretty decent straightener. I had a Chi straightener before (double the price) and I can see the difference. This one kind of tugs at your hair and it does not heat as fast as the Chi straightener. I might keep it for a while and then repurchase the Chi..</li>
    <li> Everything I expected in an iron - my last iron was pretty cheap and didn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth and shiny as this one does. I highly recommend this especially for women with very curly hair. It straightens my hair perfectly every time.</li>
    <li> Love this iron, gets my hair super straight better than the Chi iron I replaced!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely impressed with this product. Within minutes it heats up and I  was able to straighten my curly hair effortlessly! Great investment! I also fell in love with the Argan oil, it was light weight with a pleasant scent and made my hair feel soft and shiny !!</li>
    <li> Very. Good, love, love love it.thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and very cost efficient.  Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> My girls and I are extremely pleased with the Flat iron and other products we ordered for black hair. We received everything in a timely manner. And the process was streamlined. Excellent products. 5 star</li>
    <li> This straightener works great. Its easy to use and it does the job with a minimum of passes over my hair.  My only complaint, and it is actually a big one, is that there is no automatic shut off.  I have actually left it on all day by mistake.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It works very well and heats up quickly. My only complaint is that it does not shut off automatically.</li>
    <li> It works if you use small clumps of hair.  It makes my hair less frizzy.  I would recommend this to anyone that does not have thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is appropriate quality for the price - I do find it a little &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34; and my hair gets caught in it a lot. I don&#x27;t use a straightener all that often, so it&#x27;s not enough to motivate me to replace it, but if I used a flat iron more I&#x27;d have sent this back / bought a more expensive one in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has variable heat and a handy carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a single black glove - I&#x27;m guessing to protect my hand from the heat?!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  My Chi broke and I rushed to a beauty store to buy another.  The prices were too expensive, so I decided to check online instead and saw the reviews for HSI flat iron.  I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve owned 2 Chi&#x27;s which were recommended by a hair stylist. I decided to try the HSI for the great reviews and price.  I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks and I love it. It is more sturdier than the Chi, and I like the temperature control feature to lower the temp so I can use it on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  I am happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied with this flat iron. We needed something quickly for travel, and it is well priced and very efficient. Product came right on time. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love my Ionic Tourmaline...I highly recommend</li>
    <li> The delivery was prompt and packaged well.  The flat iron works great and was an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent price. Heats fast and works well.</li>
    <li> I previously had a different, more expensive flat iron but I dropped it and it stopped working so I ordered this one and absolutely love it!!  I highly recommend it.  No need to spend double or triple the money.  This one even came with a glove and protective oil for hair.</li>
    <li> The HSI is a good hair product but I have to say that it pulls your hair a little. I bought this one so that when my girlfriends comes to my house she does not have to bring her Paul Mitchell with her. but other then that it is not bad.</li>
    <li> EDITED&lt;br /&gt;I had earlier written a review about a problem that we had with the flat iron, but that problem was resolved and the company sent us a replacement immediately. HSI has amazing customer service, which should give any potential customers peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron heats up quickly and makes the hair smooth and shiny. The temperature range is quite high, which makes straightening hair much easier. The Argan oil is also great. This is one of the best flat irons that I have owned, and definitely worth the purchase. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Item works better than any straighter I&#x27;ve ever tried. And there have been many! Temp heats quickly, but i never grt the sense my hair is &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;. Sturdy construction, great packaging, and a luxe padded carrying case. Super pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product. As advertised.</li>
    <li> I owned a Hair Art flatiron for years, worked wonders on my frizzy hair, until I dropped it and one of the plates broke off. I bought this one after reading the reviews, and although it&#x27;s a decent iron, it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the Hair Art iron. It takes a bit longer to heat up, and the green light that indicates it&#x27;s at temperature keeps going red after several swipes through my hair, which leads me to believe the temperature control is not that great. The most annoying thing is it snags at my hair if I have spillage over the edges of the iron. It should not be snagging anything but if I take too wide a section, it feels like I&#x27;m pulling hair out. Never had any issues of any kind with Hair Art. Still, serviceable iron.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot. it save a lot of time to make my hair look nice.&lt;br /&gt;you will like it.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a chi that I left out of town. I liked my chi but decided to try something new. This straightener heats up really fast but sometimes snags and pulls out my hair. I&#x27;ve tried smaller pieces and it helps but it takes longer because of this. I prefer my chi, especially since for almost $80 it didn&#x27;t have a digital display and pulls my hair out.</li>
    <li> Love this product heats up quickly and straightens my thick wavy hair</li>
    <li> Awful.  I used it once and it fried my ends and ripped out my hair.  There is a slight ridge on the surface, so it also left some kinks in my hair.  I have used a Chi for the past 6+ years and it always glided through my hair and left it soft and shiny.  This straightener left my hair kinky and damaged. My Chi finally bit the dust last week, and I ordered this one because of the great reviews.  I should have just ordered a new Chi.  This hair straightener is terrible.  Go for the Chi.</li>
    <li> Best product that you can get anywhere for this price. The service from this seller was even better, Great customer service answered all my questions previous my purchase. The product arrives in my home even earlier than what they promised. I strongly recommend this product and this selles.</li>
    <li> Very poor product. Doesn&#x27;t heat up and dosn&#x27;t straighten hair or leave it silky as it clams it would!</li>
    <li> I had a Chi straightener for years before it got fried and I purchased this one. I will never be buying another brand! I&#x27;m OBSESSED with this straightener. Heats up very quickly, has been very reliable, and takes care of my hair. I love the adjustable settings!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new Flat Iron. The one I had before was not doing the job. I was actually going to go with a different brand when my husband found the HSI. After seeing how many great reviews it had received, we decided to buy it. I absolutely love it! I have very thick wavy and frizzy hair. This product completely straightens it without leaving that puffy look. My hair stays straight even through the second day. I wouldn&#x27;t say it &amp;#34;shortens&amp;#34; straightening time only because my hair is very long. I still had to pass through sections 3-4 times but that&#x27;s because I like it really straight. The product arrived on time. When i opened it the flat iron did have a chemical smell but that&#x27;s like most new things. You have to break it in to get rid of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good flat Iron.</li>
    <li> Only tried it once but so far It seems to be a great product. Never used a flat iron before so have nothing to compare it to. Great price!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous hair iron for the price! I was surprised to see how much I love it; and the added bonus oil treatment was great!</li>
    <li> Lasted for a year or so and worked really well but the cord has started to short out.</li>
    <li> Perfect flat iron. Works better than I expected for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Aunt for her birthday. She wanted a CHI, but I knew that CHI could not deliver what it used to so many years ago. This leaves your hair silky and smooth. This is a great product for a great price. Look up my review for the HSI curling iron! It&#x27;s the same thing.</li>
    <li> This HSI flat iron with glove, pouch, and argan oil is what I had expected and I look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it but I liked that it arrived to my home rather quickly.  Based on other reviews this should be good.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this straightener. Most of the reviews were positive so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Just about 10 minuets after straightening my hair, it started to curl. I was so disappointed.. I had high hopes for this straightener.</li>
    <li> This came in a timely fashion. The extras (glove, oil, pouch) much appreciated. I almost sent it back though because I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on. I gave up and set it aside for a couple days. Then decided to give it one more shot. The reset button was hard to press. But once I got it going it heated up very fast and my hair stayed straight for two days after. Love the swivel cord too! I recommend!</li>
    <li> A+ product.  my girlfriend has been using it for a month and absolutely loves it.  the oil is a nice touch</li>
    <li> This flat iron does a great job.  It straightens my hair really well and leaves it shiny.  My hair is fairly curly when left to air dry, my last straightener was not doing the job anymore so I checked reviews on Amazon and came across this one.  I would definitely recommend this flat iron to others.  The packaging was well done and the shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> This is a great straigtener.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional so it would be nice if it had an automatic turn off.</li>
    <li> Not as hot as advertised.</li>
    <li> Today is April 22, 2015 and I have had my flat iron for a little over a month.  I am writing another review as a follow up to my initial review now that I have had it longer.  I am the sole user of the flat iron and I have still only used it on my bangs. I have noticed that the plates look like there is something on them.  I tried to wipe it with a clean piece of tissue thinking that maybe it was my heat protection product, and there was a brownish residue that came off.  I can&#x27;t tell if the plates are peeling or what&#x27;s going on.  It looks a little better since I rubbed them clean, but they still look like they&#x27;re a little scratched.  My concern is long term.  It&#x27;s only been a month of very minimal use and the plates appear to be getting damaged.  I had my Chi for 2 years and the plates still looked brand new.  Not sure this flat iron is going to last as long as they claim.  The ceramic/tourmaline ion plates do not seem to be holding up.</li>
    <li> It pulls my hair out and makes my hair smell burnt. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> amazing product honestly its a fantastic brand and it does not damage your hair great buy</li>
    <li> Read A LOT of reviews before buying one! It&#x27;s amazing how pricy these irons can get. At the time of purchase, I paid about $35. I was surprised how nice it was packaged for that price! It came with a heat glove, mini oil, and a beautiful iron bag. This would look like a pretty expensive gift!  It has a little hook built in for hanging, which is a nice feature. This was super easy to use (never used a flat iron before) and much safer than a traditional iron since the metal plate is incased. I adjusted the heat just above the lowest setting since my hair is dry from coloring it and trying to blow dry it straight! This did the job! No more burning the scalp or having bent hair and this can still make slight curls (bangs). It has cut down on the amount of product I use to get straight hair and has cut my hair time in half! I wish I had bought this years ago! I&#x27;m proud to say this is one of my best purchases yet!</li>
    <li> This iron does not get very hot even though it&#x27;s supposed to go up to 410 degrees.  I have used other irons that don&#x27;t go to this temperature but are hotter.  Additionally, as I used it, the heat was lost very fast and had to re-heat while I was using it.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron but oil was open and spilt all over iron and bag :-(. Plus there is no oil left</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my niece and we love it. Heats up quickly, and hair comes out looking great. Glove is handy too, especially when you&#x27;re in a rush!</li>
    <li> I am really really impressed with this hair iron. I thought i was getting a little thing for this amount of money, but I actually find myself recommending this product to all my friends with frizzy hair! Not only does this iron straighten curls and waves, it rids the hair of frizz and flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this for my bangs, it gives them a shine that lasts all day long, and there are no frizzy pieces! I also love the way it has a temp control, for if you have thinner hair like me you won&#x27;t burn anything out. I compared this to the HerStyler, and found they are very similar, but this one had a better price tag. Go with HSI.&lt;br /&gt;This iron also comes with a warranty on hsi website, where you can sign up and register yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this a five star rating because it exceeded my expectations, and it heats up quickly, it&#x27;s efficient and very reasonably priced here on amazon. I think it&#x27;s more expensive if you buy from their own site.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! It heats up quickly and you are able to set the temperature.  It works very well, and I have a nice straight shiny look when finished straightening.  I have used the CHI many time before, and I would say that it is a good inexpensive comparable to the CHI.  It also comes with a nice glove for your hand, which I thought was good to have. I am pleased that I chose this straightening iron!</li>
    <li> This one is cheap enough and save me a lot of money, comparing other same level products. And I also like the fast shipping service. everything is good.</li>
    <li> Works great and great price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the straightener at all, I have finer hair and I feel as though it gets caught on the hair. It is not a smooth &amp;#34;straightening&amp;#34; like my other one. I will be giving this one away (since unfortunately I can&#x27;t return this one) and buying a different one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used straighteners for about 15 years now. I find a quality straightener, stick to it, and then get another when they wear and tear over the years. This is the worst straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. $20 products at a local Walmart or Target will provide better value than this one. After using, I went out and purchased a $150 straightener to make sure I would not be disappointed again. Although I opted for a nicer product, this one definitely did not give me the value I expected. And I can&#x27;t return it after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> It worked great and the price was awesome!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works wonderful and I could not believe the price. My daughter wanted one for Christmas so I went to a local retailer and they wanted 130.00 for this flat iron. Imagine my surprise when I saw it on Amazon for 40.00! It heats up fast and cools down fast as well. I have very thick curly hair and this flat iron does a great job!</li>
    <li> It works and the results are fine, but sometimes it feels like hair gets caught it in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I normally use a low temp on my hair, and I wasn&#x27;t getting results so I was a little scared I&#x27;d made a wrong choice. I did, my hair was just too thick to respond to the low heat. For me, I have to use it on the highest temperature. I wouldn&#x27;t advise it, my hair has a lot of heat damage now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the heat damage, I love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale and it heats and straightens well. I just wish the plate was wider so it could straighten more hair.</li>
    <li> So, I purchased this straightener after being fed up with the low-quality one I&#x27;d been using- It fried my hair as much as it straightened.. Prior, I&#x27;d opted for a Chi; which, $100+ and a few months later, stopped working.. The HSI visibly smooths my tricky hair type (colored, thick &amp; brittle) and straightens effectively &amp; quickly, without being on the highest temp. I enjoy the additional perks of the package as well, although the Argan Oil leaked a little on the pretty pouch, I&#x27;m super pleased with this straightener &amp; what came with it, to be true to it&#x27;s description.. It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is very easy to use. I love the adjustable settings. The pouch comes in handy and the Argan oil treatment is wonderful. I received my product very quickly and I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife says; Not sure why there is so much hype about this iron.  It does an average job ... I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s spectacular ... I wonder how long it&#x27;s going to last?  Hopefully I&#x27;ll get a year out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion people are overrating this iron.  Maybe they had real bad irons to start out with.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron in high expectations after reading the reviews.  The flat iron worked great until 15 months later when it completely stop working.  It worked well one day and the next day it did not work at all. It was never dropped or mishandled and I would let it cool completely before storing in the storage bag it came with.  I would have expected something that cost $70 to last longer than 15 months.</li>
    <li> I had a flat iron that I loved but, unfortunately, made the mistake of leaving it on overnight and it burnt out.  I ordered this new one to replace it, with the hope that it would be as good.  It was better!  My hair is smoother and shinier than my other iron could ever get my hair to be.  I would highly recommend this company as well.  Fantastic shipping and product.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron, like all of the other reviewers mentioned. One of the plates broke on mine so it is inusable.</li>
    <li> Bought to use on trip to Spain - worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this flat iron. She has very long, think...extra think...curly hair. She was initially disappointed by the iron because it wasn&#x27;t a wet to dry iron. Now she loves it and is glad I purchased it. She flat irons her hair a few times a week. It leaves her hair looking great. I would definitely  buy another one of these. I have two daughters who straighten hair so the flat irons wars can be annoying.  I may spend the money to buy another one just to save myself from hearing their complaints.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I recently cut my hair short &amp; needed a 1 inch straightener . I found this product on Amazon.com The price was right &amp; the product works great. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying this from the 2 and 1 star reviews but I&#x27;m glad I pushed that aside.  I am extremely happy that I bought this because it is the best flat iron I have ever owned.  I usually buy irons bigger than this 1 inch iron but it works so much better!!  It heats up fast, and after using it for the first time today, I can say that my hair looks as straight as it did when I last put relaxer in.  I usually use \\&quot;One and Only\\&quot; argon oil, so I haven&#x27;t tried the HSI oil just yet.  The glove is great for controlling the iron and protecting your hand in the process, which aids in getting even better results with your hair.  The only thing is the indicator light kept flickering from green to red during use.  I&#x27;m not sure if that was supposed to happen.  Other than that it is an excellent product, a great buy at $39.99, and I will recommend this to everyone.  Ignore the low ratings, IT IS PERFECT!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves using this straightener. Doing her hair takes only 15 minutes instead of an hour, and it looks great. It also stays all day rather than getting messed up when moisture or heat comes along.</li>
    <li> Good product, heats up quickly and came with everything it said it would. Quick delivery. Would recommend this company to order from- the only reason I have this product 3 stars is because it does not work as well as my old one did and it was the same price. Remington wet to straight.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading reviews and comparing prices. Item arrived on time and packed well. The flat iron is a good one. I especially like that you can set the temperature. The protective bag is also nice and thick.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great flattening iron, daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Better than I expected! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Absolutely satisfied!! It works great on difficult to manage hair. I love it so much that I showed my mother the results and she purchased one and so did a friend of hers. It’s the best money we ever spent and the oil works great to!</li>
    <li> I bought this as I had read wonderful reviews on the product.  I replaced it with a Walmart special that was pulling my hair and did not heat as hot as needed.  So far, it works wonderful. The only downside is it does not automatically shut off like the other flat irons I have used and have left it on a couple of times.</li>
    <li> This Flat Iron was not even hot enough to straighten my hair.  I have fine hair and I usually don&#x27;t have any issues with it being straightened.</li>
    <li> Great buy, came with a lot of free extras that are top quality!  Would highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much HSI professional!</li>
    <li> I purchased one for a friend when her flat iron gave out, then I purchased one for myself after she said how much she liked it.  Seller sent package very quickly.  No problems.</li>
    <li> Item worked as advertised.  My daughter is very happy with the product.  Hair straightener works well and we are happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The flat iron worked just as it stated. My grandchild has very tight coily curly hair. Other flat irons typically left her hair dry and fried look without completely straightening her hair. HSI left her smooth, silky, straight and bouncy. it did not burn her hair or leave that burnt smell. I also have curly wavy hair but not as tight as her&#x27;s and loved the way HSI left my hair. I did not have to repeat several times to straighten a section of hair. I used the highest setting on both of our hair and it did not burn or dry the hair out. I highly recommend this product, especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> So I read all the good reviews about HSI professional, and decided to upgrade by buying this straightener. But I was disappointed the first time I used it. I have pretty much silky but frizzy hair which is wavy. The first time I used it, it took me double the time to straighten my hair. I let it pre-heat and when the green light flashed, I started using it. Every 30-40 seconds the light would switch back to red (heating stage). The second time I tried using it , I switched the temp setting to full heat (though I doubt my hair needs such a high temperature), I still faced the problem, where the light would switch between red- green, and it took forever for my hair to straighten. This product is definitely going to be returned.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m INLOVE with this hair straightener!  I was iffy about it but I&#x27;m glad I bought it!  Works great for straight or curls!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with this after reading the reviews that so many people loved it.  It dragged on my hair and pulled at it.  I felt like it was ripping my hair out.  I don&#x27;t know how the review are so good for this iron?  I&#x27;m thinking I maybe didn&#x27;t get the same one that everyone is raving about in the reviews.  I am returning it and have to pay for the shipping which is another disappointment.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Stopped working within a year of using. Only worth the price paid for it (maybe even less).</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I had a NANO ceramic that was awesome! It got super hot and made my hair soft and silky. This HSI one pulls my hair as I straighten down to the ends and doesn&#x27;t make my hair soft or straight. It was back to wavy less than an hour later. I would buy from a different company.</li>
    <li> It straightens great if you don&#x27;t have thick hair! Otherwise it snags and damages my hair. Looks like a nice iron just not the one for me</li>
    <li> It was working fine and its a good flat iron but i havent even had it a year and it doesnt work anymore:( i tried looking for the paper i recieved about the warranty but i cant find it.</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping!  Very pleased with this flat iron.  Fast and easy to use.  Smooth and silky soft hair in under 10 minutes.  Exceeded expectations.  Thanks reviewers!</li>
    <li> I love my new HSI Ceramic Straightener. It works wonderful on thick hair, doesn&#x27;t have that burn smell like a lot of others. I like that it can be used on all types of hair. I only need to make one pass on each part and it does the job!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair super shiny and Perfectly straight.  So glad I purchased it.  The argan oil that comes with the product is just one more thing that makes this purchase the perfect buying experience</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great and the price is not so bad. Before purchasing it I looked at other brands and other models because I wanted a top of the line flat iron however I quickly realized how ridiculous some of their prices are. And a higher price does not guarantee higher quality. I made my decission to get the HSI brand based on the Amazon reviews. In the past I&#x27;ve owned the Hot Tools brand with ceramic coated plates and the HSI seems to do a better job at straightening my hair. I reccommend the HSI flat iron, but of course I am saying this after only 2 uses. Who knows how the iron will hold over time but i will make an effort to update this review in the future.</li>
    <li> This iron exceeded my expectations completely! For the price you really get a high quality flat iron. This is my first flat iron, too, and it was easy to learn how to handle md get the look I want-straight, flipped, or curled.</li>
    <li> LEAVES MY HAIR SMOOTHE .. NO FRIZZING. GREAT WHEN USED WITH  HSI ARGAN OIL. 1ST FLAT IRON I OWN AND I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> With the amount of great reviews this flat iron has I was so excited to try it, once I received it I have to say I&#x27;m very disappointed. The plates are cheap and when passing them through my hair will snag and get caught on the plates for no apparent reason. I cleaned the plates just to see if it was residue but it continued to do it, my hair is fine and thin and this just wasn&#x27;t acceptable. When comparing side to side with a chi, the plates on the chi are much softer while this flat iron feels cheap and bulky. I really don&#x27;t know where this flat iron has got all of its great reviews when all I can hesitate with it is how horrendous my experience with it has been.  I am returning it for a better flat iron that won&#x27;t destroy my hair like this one will if I continue using it.</li>
    <li> Love this, works great and a great Price! :)</li>
    <li> Best flatiron hands down!! I have very thick/coarse kinky hair, but these babies made my hair feel like silk with just one pass! &amp; not to mention they weren&#x27;t even set on the highest setting. The oil is also great! If contemplating whether to purchase or not, no need! This item is definitely worth every single penny! Also love it&#x27;s packaging.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! So easy to use, and I love that the temperature settings are adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length, fine, thin, straight hair, so I was looking for a flat iron that: 1.) had 1&amp;#34; plates, 2.) could be adjusted below 360°F, and 3.) had Ceramic, Titanium, or Tourmaline plate material. This flat iron fits the bill!</li>
    <li> After asking my hair stylist which flat iron to purchase...and his reply was to go onto amazon...I found several that fit my needs and budget. So glad I decided on this HSI flat iron. Very easy to handle, light weight, nice accessories. Really like styling my hair now for a more sleek look; and even better when I&#x27;m in a humid climate to take away the wave/frizz. Have recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> This was my very first flat iron and I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with the HSI.  The iron itself is clearly a quality product and the accessories just add to the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 4 year old Corioliss straightener that seemed to be wearing out.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend much money and this one came highly recommended by a friend.  Compared to the Corioliss, the HSI is heavy and a bit bulky, which I supposed just takes getting used to.  Also, it seemed at first that it pulled my hair.  I realized I didn&#x27;t have to squeeze the plates together so hard to use it and that eliminated the pulling.  It straightens my hair in fewer passes than the Corioliss, and I like that it has an adjustable thermostat, which I didn&#x27;t have before.  It is impressively packaged in a sturdy box and comes with a nice satin insulated sleeve and a styling glove, and also a sample of Argan Oil. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, and only gave it 4 stars because of the heaviness and bulkiness.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron! I went natural a few months back and my hair is really, REALLY curly and dense. I wanted a flat iron that would get the job done without destroying my hair (i want to grow it out). After a lot of research, I decided to try it and the price helped me make my decision too (awesome price!) The first thing I noticed is that this flat iron gets hot SUPER fast, so if i was on limited time, that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Another thing is that it glides sooooooo easily along my hair which really surprised me. I thought it would take me a few runs to get a part straight because let&#x27;s face it, natural African American hair tends to be very stubborn. But no! I was able to finish my hair in about twenty-five to thirty minutes. My favorite thing is that it was able to straighten my hair with out crushing the volume. My hair looks so healthy! It&#x27;s sturdy too, i doubt it will kick the bucket anytime soon. So.... try it!</li>
    <li> I love the adjustable temperature setting and the slim body. The glove is quite useful, too.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I seen a stall set up in the mall and a man was selling this straightener. I went ahead and let him try it out on my hair and it was great! He even curled my hair with it (The plates pivot, which is awesome!). I wanted it instantly until he told me the price was $225 but he would give ME (haha!) a deal of $145. I said no thank you and I found this same straightener months later on Amazon 70% off making it $40! Yay for me!!!</li>
    <li> What a deal this was an excellent find for the price.  I even received the mini trial Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment and pouch, along with a glove.  The items works great on my hair as well as my daughters.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi flatiron before and I would honestly prefer that over the HSI. The HSI takes a long time to heat up and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets that hot. I have to turn it all the way up to 410 to get the utility that I want. It&#x27;s also a lot heavier and chunkier than the Chi.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail today. It was not what I expected. I thought I was getting this really nice, expensive flat iron for a steal! Nope. It looks like I spent $20 on it. It looks cheap, it feels cheap, and it tugged at my hair. Not at all what I expected. My $30 Wal-Mart straightener looks and works better than this one.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse and thick African American hair that has never been permed with a ton of heat damage. I used this iron with the olive oil heat protection serum along with the Argan oil for my ends and it works perfectly! Which the chi, it damaged my hair so much and I even used the Chi Iron guard which didn&#x27;t work very well since it was water based and it fried my hair off. My hair never stays straight and it soaks up every inch of humidity ever, but after using this iron my hair has a nice shine and doesn&#x27;t flare up as much which is HUGE!! My hair has never done this before. I purchased this for 40 buck and it is worth well over that amount. The shipping was fast, packaging was GREAT! I am so happy right now I could cry. If you are on the borderline just get it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> JANUARY 2017 UPDATE:  Three years later and I have no complaints! What a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, the best straighter I ever purchased. Heats up fast and makes my hair feel and look fabulous. Enough said, the price is fantastic JUST BUY IT already.....cheaper then the CHI and they all do the same thing!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this flat iron out, considering the great deal and reviews. However when I got the flat iron and began using it, I was disappointed. The indicator light starts out red and turns to green when ready, not sure if mine is defective but it goes between red and green the whole time it&#x27;s plugged in. I even tried leaving it for awhile to see if it was &#x27;warming up&#x27; but it turns to red as soon as I start to use it. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to get that hot and it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair. It kind of takes the frizz out for a moment but as soon as I brush it or walk outside it curls right back up. I have done everything from using tiny sections of hair and a comb to be sure everything is in the plates but I get the same results. I&#x27;ve tried over a few weeks time to see if it was just getting used to a different flat iron, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I had a 2 inch Chi turbo for over 9 years and it worked perfectly, I never had any issues. Then it died and I thought this would be a good replacement but I&#x27;m thinking it was a mistake.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the amazing Amazon customer reviews and am slightly disappointed. This flat iron does not get very hot and does not do a great job straightening my hair. Additionally, the plates aren&#x27;t as long as I&#x27;m used to, so I find my hair getting caught underneath them often.</li>
    <li> I got it and tried this one. I thought I was gonna cry the whole time. This iron doesn&#x27;t leave up to its hype. My hair just doesn&#x27;t slide at all inside the flat iron. It feels more like I&#x27;m pulling my hair. I have thick, coarse Asian hair and this iron works but takes forever. My 15minute routine was turned to 30+min. I have to go over my hair over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My T-Studio Remington works so much better. If it only comes with dual voltage or even a 220v, I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about using HSI&#x27;s. If shipping back to Amazon is free, I would return this. Very disappointed. Works like any other irons in Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline: I will keep it coz I got it for a pricier cost compared to others. I&#x27;ll use while in Asia &amp; Germany. :-( but will be using Remington&#x27;s T Studio while in US.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give salon results. It&#x27;s really just a straightener - doesn&#x27;t smooth or make hair silky looking. And the spray feels like it&#x27;s just water. It heats up though. Straightens hair. But at the ends it hurts because it doesn&#x27;t glide very smoothly.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and the product works as advertised!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work better than the other top brands Ive used before. I have Natural wave and wanted a straightner that would make it straight and silky and this jus doesn&#x27;t meet up to some of the others I&#x27;ve used. Very Disappointing</li>
    <li> Very nice iron, and came with nice packaging.  The iron has good heat settings, and heats up quickly.  Gets hot enough to effectively tame my hair.  Salon quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace a cheap one I bought years ago.  My hair is fine and normally frizzy (Florida).  With my old one my hair was still frizzy and the straight look didn&#x27;t last.  I&#x27;m so glad I did my research and decided to buy this one.  Combined with the argan oil sample it works wonderfully.  My hair is shiny, it stays straight for two days until I wash it again.  I am very happy with this item and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I already have very straight hair, but I use this to smooth and bend the ends. I also use it on my 6 yr old daughters when we need it to be less wild. It works for both. There is no pulling, and while the outside of the unit does get fairly hot, it is still very easy to use. Heats up in seconds!!!!! Great product!</li>
    <li> I needed a new straightener to replace my old one that was dying.  Based on reviews and price I chose this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It heats up quickly and it relatively gentle on my hair. I think it does a great job! (My hair is pretty thin, so I can&#x27;t speak to thicker hair).</li>
    <li> this is the first time i brought the ionic, so it is ok for me</li>
    <li> GREAT. WORKS WONDERS ON CURLY HAIR IN HUMID CONDITIONS AND STAYS FOR SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT DAMAGING HAIR SINCE HAS CONTROLS</li>
    <li> Works so well and so quick. Very reliable and user friendly. Have used the expensive hair straighteners and this one is just as good. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m basically inept at straightening my own hair from scratch so I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of this product for that but I have used it to touch up my salon blowout and it does a good job. Better quality/easier to use than other flat irons I&#x27;ve had, but again, I&#x27;m no expert.</li>
    <li> Love it,arrived very quickly</li>
    <li> Wow! It heats up so quickly and I love the different degree setting.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! Well worth the money</li>
    <li> This iron is fabulous.  It heats up immediately and the heat is easily adjustable.  It gets so much hotter than my previous iron and I am grateful I found this at such a fabulous price.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair which can sometimes be frizzy and this straightener leaves my hair looking like i got it professionally blown out every time.</li>
    <li> I have never found a flat iron that straightens my hair and my hair continue to stay straight even in rain and humidity! I am totally pleased and have recommended this iron to all my friends! Money well spent, arrived quickly and was packaged nicely! 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I love it.....perfect for maintaining my hair in between hair treatments!</li>
    <li> It does work very well. Very pleased overall with this product.</li>
    <li> Works amazing, heats quickly and glides smoothly through my hair!</li>
    <li> Most straighteners have normal plugs and hair dryers have larger plugs but this one has the larger plug so you can&#x27;t warm the straightener while drying your hair.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant and watched this product for awhile before ordering. I saw that there were so many good reviews but I just wasn&#x27;t sure because the price seemed too good to be true ($39.99), actually it was originally $49.99 from Amazon but then I saw it the next day for $39.99 through Blue Novelties, so I bought it and it really seems as good as everyone says. I use it for fairly fine hair that I just straighten the sections around my face and it keeps them straight all day. It hasn&#x27;t been too humid yet, but it seems like it works well even with humidity. Keeps my hair from looking scraggily by the end of the day! Much better than my straightener that I got from the local &amp;#34;superstore&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I checked out a lot of different flat irons before finally purchasing this one as a birthday gift for my niece.  She did not like it at all.  Gripe #1: It took too long to heat up. Gripe #2: It took several passes to straighten her hair. Gripe #3: It didn&#x27;t leave her hair soft and silky, like the other flat irons that you try out at the mall.  End result, I returned the HSI and bought her an ISO flat iron, which was not only cheaper, but gave her the desired results.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, this thing ROCKS!  I only need one pass, maybe 2 on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and it does not take long to do at all.  No agonizing story of hours and hours of madness and that burnt hair smell.  This product delivers.  My daughters hair type is a 3c, curly, even a bit kinky in some places but pretty easy to straighten with this appliance and the oil and conditioner that accompanies it.</li>
    <li> I bought this but, went back to, the chi.wasnt happy with product just the price I got it for 37.00.chi seems to, be the best.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up in just a few minutes! It also does the job really well. I would highly recommend this product. The only thing is I previously bought the same iron a few years back. It used to weigh more.</li>
    <li> Few passes for flat hair. Great price! This will make your hair flat and smooth in little time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  I had a cheap-o one I bought from a drug store because I refused to spend $$$ on a flat iron.  The cheap-o one died and after reading all the reviews I decided to buy this one.  Its great!  It heats up quickly and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is the best I have ever had!!! I have very curly dry hair and I have tried all sorts of things to straighten my hair, including getting it chemically straightened. But this straightener smoothed my hair to perfection with just one swipe over my hair!! Other straighteners I have used took about an hour and half to two hours to do my hair. That just shows you how curly my hair is. But this straightner only takes half an hour to forty-five mintues to do my hair. Yes, I do have a little help from some product, but regardless, this straightener is awesome!!! I highly highly reccommend buying this item!!!</li>
    <li> I needed a new straightener badly. I wanted to love this. I opened the package to plug it in and one plate was already cracked and the other had a chip missing. I don&#x27;t know if it was just error in sending a faulty one. Just disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far my daughter &amp; I love this iron. She actually said it works better than her Chi that she had for 4 years. Hopefully this one will outlast that one.</li>
    <li> Excellent. this is the most amazing flat iron I ever tried in my life. This flat iron is perfect for me</li>
    <li> The plates are a little small and it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to take my natural curl out. Also, it snags my hair. Don&#x27;t love it :-[</li>
    <li> worst flat iron I have ever used. too small and just overall did not work.</li>
    <li> i got this for my wife and she said it wasnt getting hot enough to do anything so i asked for a replacement one which they sent right away, but it was the same. now were having problems getting a refund for it when it was sent back to them over a month ago.</li>
    <li> Background: I have a really old chi from back when they were the best out there.  It is scratched so I wanted a new one.  Unfortunately many people including a couple stylists told me chi has not been as good lately so I tried something different.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot so alas I bought the HSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Performance: Nothing special.  It gets hot, but not as hot as my chi.  I have really curly hair so I had to go over it a few time. Regardless I ended up with straight hair eventually.  A super plus is the oil it comes with!  It made my hair so soft and shiny.  I will definitely invest more into that stuff.  I didn&#x27;t have the hair pulling problem like some people.  Maybe that is a technique thing.  One major downfall for me personally is that the straightener doesn&#x27;t open very far which hinders my control a little and I can&#x27;t hang it on the towel bar I hung my other one on.  That is why I went with 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is well made and comes with a lovely travel bag, however it does not seem to get as hot as it claims.  I have to turn it all the way up and even then it isn&#x27;t as hot as my Chia was.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this flat iron so much. Heats quickly with several choices for heat temp. Smooth plates do not snag my hair like previous irons I&#x27;ve used. Extra long swivel cord is perfect. Excellent product all the way around; worth every penny!</li>
    <li> After a friend&#x27;s recommendation, I bought this product to replace my ancient Chi that finally died. I have long, thick and wavy hair. This product removed the waves, but made my hair frizzy. It does not give you the nice sleek &#x27;n silky finish like the Chi irons. I finally gave up on it and ordered a Chi from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> There are many different items out there like this but I have found this item to be one of the best. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> From all the reviews I was reading I thought this would be a good straightener but I was mistaken.  I&#x27;m not sure if I may have gotten a defective straightener, but I am not to satisfied with the performance of the one I received.  I feel that it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near as hot as it says it does.  I run it through my hair once and it needs to heat up again.  Prior to this straightener I had a Remington that I loved that did the job no problem.  Now it just takes me longer to straighten my hair and it doesn&#x27;t look nearly as good as with my previous straightener.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and well made. It works as it should with know problems . My wife bought this item and has used it several weeks now and thinks its great !</li>
    <li> I wish it had an auto shut off feature. It would be 5 stars if it did.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mum. Everything seems great in the package. Not sure yet how it will work for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time, in great packaging and perfectly sealed.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this iron is amazing!</li>
    <li> Replacing one that was lost, if you have 4 girls in your house you MUST own a CHI!</li>
    <li> I truly think this is the BEST ceramic product!!  I have spent more than 4 times the money on one that wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as good.</li>
    <li> we was humm, will this be a good product, but just because of the size,&lt;br /&gt;you usually see bigger than this in professional places.&lt;br /&gt;but stop your horses right there.&lt;br /&gt;this little think, works very well in my wife hair. and she has a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I love the straightener and how affordable it is! Easy to curl my hair and glad that I didn&#x27;t go with a chi again.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, very happy with it.  Comparable to much more expensive CHI</li>
    <li> I  am really happy with this purchase.  I had been looking for a quality product at a reasonable cost and am most pleased to have found a professional grade tool that works great.  It was a plus to get the nice storage/travel bag.  The order process was easy and it arrived quickly and on time.  I would definitely order from this supplier again. I also like the follow-up from their customer service team to make sure I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very happy, works great and a great value.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I read the good &amp; bad reviews before purchasing this- and decided that I would trust the good since there are SO MANY. However, I am really sad to say that this straightener is a big disappointment. It snags my hair!!!!! AND my ends are left looking fried- Let me clarify- I have wavy, extremely healthy hair that is trimmed regularly &amp; has never been color treated and is rarely heat-treated (I never blow dry- only curl once in awhile) I used Redkin heat protectant plus the argan oil before straightening and it didn&#x27;t help. The snagging is very annoying as I pull the straightener down my hair. After using this tool my hair is left looking fried out. I wish I had trusted the bad reviews!!!</li>
    <li> The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that this iron takes more than 30 seconds to reach full heat. Other than that, it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  The Argan Oil makes my hair feel so silky, the flat iron straightens my hair and makes it look shiny.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. My daughter and I both use the iron and we are very happy with it. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  The flat iron works well.... but why are the controls on the inside where you can&#x27;t reach them unless you have really tiny fingers ;)</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned! Absolutely cannot live without it.  It&#x27;s very powerful even at a low setting - which keeps my hair damage-free. And it works perfectly to curl, too!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of all the great reviews, but buyer beware!  I&#x27;ve had many flat irons prior to this one, and after all the amazing reviews I thought I would give it a try.  This iron pulls your hair it does not flow smoothly through your hair like the chi.  I would not recommend this flat iron to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron about four years ago. It&#x27;s a really great iron. My hair is straightened perfectly each time. The only reason why I bought it again was because I hit my old one accidentally and it fell and broke. Just be careful where you put this thing because it&#x27;s ceramic. I had the old one for almost four years and it was still in great shape until it fell on the floor. It was still doing the same thing as it did the first time I used it, so I really trust this iron.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and works great! I would definitely recommend this product to others that may have thin or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Title says it all, item didn&#x27;t even work upon arrival. Returned for a refund. Didn&#x27;t order a replacement as item didn&#x27;t seem well made, cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> The flat iron works very well. I am very pleased with the product. I would recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I have been pleased with it.  Works great. Heats quickly. Does the job well. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I love it it took a little while to get here but it was worth the wait especially for the price I&#x27;m glad I bought it :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about as good as a grocery store flat iron. Compared to my stepdaughter&#x27;s Babybliss, this does not cut the mustard, or straighten the locks. They sent me another HSI, in case something was wrong with the first HSI. Same exact performance--sub par. I have thick, coarse, frizzy, colored hair, so I need a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> At first it works well. But after a couple of months, the product no longer heated up correctly. I always set in the middle of the temp gauge and sometimes it would literally scorch my hair and other times it would be so cool I could touch it with out getting burnt. Again this happened without me ever touching the temperature knob. I&#x27;m disappointed but for $40 what do you expect? I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;m not deviating from CHI flat irons any more.</li>
    <li> I was considering a more expensive straightener but when I saw all the great reviews this one got I had to try it. It works well and is a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Ordering this product started out a little challenging because somehow it got lost in the mail. When I didn&#x27;t receive it I emailed Amazon Customer service. OMG!!! I got an immediate response assuring me they were checking into the problem and in the meantime they had immediately refunded my money. The following day I received another email saying the item had been returned and if I wished to reorder they would pay for one day shipping. I must admit I wasn&#x27;t going to reorder but because of promptness with which they handled the problem, I reordered and received it in one day as promised. I used it on my daughters hair who is African American and has very thick and long hair. WOW!!!! we were shocked at how well it straightened her hair and it had bounce and body like crazy. The compliments she received where overwhelming! Everyone thought she had a relaxer. I have been spreading the word about this awesome product. Thanks again Amazon for the great customer service! I must also mention a great thanks to the seller. They also contacted me right away to let me know they were working on the problem. I am very appreciative for their great customer service as well.</li>
    <li> this  is not good for me. If you have really curly hair is not the best because the maximum temperature is not enough</li>
    <li> The item was exactly what I wanted.  I received the straightener very quickly and was very happy with its performance.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to a friend and the price was also good.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and so far it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I have never owned a flat iron before, but it&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and heats up really fast.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read all the thousands of reviews - but most were good so I decided to take a chance.  The price was right and the flat iron is a very solid piece.  So far works just fine - the plates are wider than my old one so I haven&#x27;t had any hair pull problems.  I already had their oil and that is fabulous stuff!</li>
    <li> the HSI straightener is great and the price was cheap&lt;br /&gt;i bought it for my daughtor and its the same one&lt;br /&gt;like they have at the mall where they do your hair for you&lt;br /&gt;but costs 120.00 .the hsi makes your hair smooth and straightens fast&lt;br /&gt;my daughtor loves it  and the price is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Great item and works well, I have many flat iron but this one is by far the best and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> my wife likes this flat iron. she likes to use it best while her hair is wet. This has eliminated time that it takes her to get ready in the morning.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase. It works well, its made well and I would buy it again if needed and lastly the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> I have used many different types of flat irons and curling irons. Saw this one at a kiosk and had them do a demo on my hair. I loved it but they wanted over 100.00 for it so I passed. I haven&#x27;t used one iron worth that amount. Found HSI on amazon for $40.00 and no shipping charges, so I gave it a try. It heats up very quickly and does the same job as the $100.00 one. I have very curly hair and even in humidity it keeps it the way I styled it in the beginning.Product does what it says and it leaves your hair soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other irons. Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!  Read the reviews &amp; they were right!  Really happy with it.</li>
    <li> Smoothes my hair out great. I love the HSI Argan oil that came with it. It leaves my hair very shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> I give 5 stars worked great on my hair and let Mr just say I have not had a perm in years and it got my hair straight would definitely buy this again and a FYI I am African American no mixed and my hair gets nappy lol Even works great on my weave so that&#x27;s a a plus in my book 😄</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron! I have fine hair, and it works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair either. Excellent buy!</li>
    <li> Omg I just love using this my hair is so soft and loos like I just stepped out of the hairdresser very proffesional they were way too expensive in the shop&#x27;s can&#x27;t beat amazon for there prices.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!!!!! I am in love &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great flay iron works beter then my Chi</li>
    <li> Electric turn off switch does not work. Not only it burned a piece of furniture but also it burned me a finger. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the price is excellent. I want to give it 5 stars; however, aftet 1 week of use the wall plug that contains the reset button came apart as I was unplugging it. I put it back together and it works for now but the reset button does not work. I am going to contact the manufacturer and see what my options are. I hope this is a  defect in this particular product as I was very pleased with the performance otherwise.***UPDATE*** I changed my rating to 5 stars. After contacting the seller they are replacing the defective product with a new one. I received a response from the seller within a few hours.</li>
    <li> Snags hair a bit. Otherwise,  great!</li>
    <li> This is a nice straightener that works better than my nano Baby Bliss.  I don&#x27;t think it performs as well as I anticipated it to based on the reviews but it definitely does a great job based on the price of it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Was looking at CHI straighteners, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the money. This straightener goes above and beyond my expectations. I love how it only takes less than a minute to heat up and is ready to go at full heat which is great when getting ready for work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great company to buy from. The product came so nicely packaged and even had little extras like a bag!</li>
    <li> i love this iron my chi stopped working so i thought i would try this iron! ilove it!</li>
    <li> My wife had to send it back after 1st use...pulled her hair like crazy she said. But she loved the slip cover and they let us keep it! So great customer service!!</li>
    <li> Does not seem to get hot enough.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance!</li>
    <li> Lovely straightener, great price. It heats up quickly and I use it mostly for curling, and it curls really great!</li>
    <li> This works fantastic and a lot less money than the Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used the HSI ceramic flat iron three or four times now, and I love it!  It heats up almost instantly, has easy heat adjustment, and takes no skill to use (I have never straightened my hair before).  It also comes with a storage bag that keeps the dust and moisture off when I&#x27;m not using it.  Great product and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> My wife has had this brand flat iron before and swears by it. She couldn&#x27;t believe the deal she got for this one this time around, and didn&#x27;t hesitate to order it. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Thanks!</li>
    <li> No so great, looking at the reviews I had expected very nice straitner. First off it takes a several strokes for the hair to straighten as it doesn&#x27;t heat up. I could not use it for curling as described.</li>
    <li> Very high quality flat iron. I could tell right away just by the feel of it, with it being solid, a little heavier than the average flat iron but not uncomfortably. Heats up immediately, which I love especially for when I&#x27;m in a hurry. The swivel cord is very convenient, as is the length of the cord--very long. Love this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron for a recent business trip to Hong Kong.  I used it with an adapter but did not have to do anything to have the electric converted.  Just plugged it in and used it.  A huge plus was that my hair looked great!  I think this is as good, if not better than my expensive flat iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this</li>
    <li> Very disappointing would NOT recommend. For the amount of money they trick you into spending on this you might as well buy a quality straightener. It&#x27;s low temp. It makes my hair staticky it takes forever to actually get it all straight it doesn&#x27;t get hot it&#x27;s way to heavy and it gives me a hand cramp holding it because I have it in my hand for ages trying to get one pieces straight. I guess if you have all ready straight hair that&#x27;s thin and don&#x27;t mind staticky hair then you should buy this.</li>
    <li> Best one I ever used. Leaves my hair so smooth, straight , and soft. I bought from Amazon after reading some of the reviews- very pleased.</li>
    <li> Item arrived within a week. Was well packaged and I plugged it in and it heated up fast. It&#x27;s a Christmas present so I haven&#x27;t actually tried it but it heated up fast.</li>
    <li> The packaging was very nice and appealing.  All promised contents were included.  I was visiting family in Florida and needed to straighten my hair.  My daughter-in-law gave me her HSI Professional flat iron to use.  When a flat iron could straighten my natural hair after being in the Florida humidity, I knew it was the flat iron for me.  Although I really enjoy this flat iron, what&#x27;s the difference between this and the digital one?</li>
    <li> This came in good tomming but the breaker on the plug keeps kicking and it&#x27;s not my plug because nothing else does it.</li>
    <li> This is my second one and it feels cheaply made. One good thing I did notice was they took extra precautions by adding a plastic piece on the each corner of the plates.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this hair straightener !</li>
    <li> This was a holiday gift for my daughter. so far so good !   works great.... fast delivery. GREAT price.    thank you !</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the iChi, and one third of the price!  My Daughter has difficult hair and she was afraid the product would not live up to expectations.  It works beautifully.  Really nice that it comes with a cool pouch as well.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great iron for the price. Used it on my sister&#x27;s coarse curly hair and it worked well. Only reason it&#x27;s not five stars is that I wish it was a little wider.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this item yet, but it works and the presentation of the items is great!  Ive never seen so many items in one box for a flst iron.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item, now I need to see how long it can endure.</li>
    <li> When I received the first one, I used it a couple of times, both with the oil and without.  I HATED it.  I felt like it was pulling, or catching, my hair.  I could not understand the reviews.  Amazon contacted me and I told them I was not happy with it and what it was doing.  They said it sounded like I might have received a defective product and they were willing to ship out a replacement.  I accepted and was looking forward to getting it.  The nice thing is, the one they replaced it with had the digital heat display and a different plug.  I travel often and hated the big box plug that was on the original one.  I was excited to try the new one.  It heated up quickly and the color display helped to indicate that it was ready.  I used it.  No hair snag!  The hair went through nice and smooth.  I have used this straightener many times since.  I have tried it with the oil and without.  As I stated in my review about the oil, I didn&#x27;t see a difference.  As for the straightener itself, it&#x27;s OK.  I had a 2&amp;#34; inexpensive one from Wal-Mart prior to this one.  I really don&#x27;t see what everyone loves about this one.  It works, I hate the smaller size, but I knew that when I purchased it.  My hair is extremely thick, long, and course.  Even taking the smaller size into account and doing much smaller chunks of hair, I feel like I have to pass through the hair more than once truly straighten it.  I have tried doing the soft curls with it, I can do it with the shorter pieces in the front but the sides and back, even taking small clumps, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to really want to curl it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, do I love it?  No.  Do I hate it?  No  Because of the compact size, it travels nicely.  I will probably purchase a different one with a larger plate to use at home.  I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Chi flat iron in the past.  When the first one died, I got another.  The second eventually started smoking and blew out the breaker. RIP. Thinking perhaps this professional flat iron required more electricity and is now a known fire hazard I looked on line for an alternative.  This flat iron was the most popular and the ratings were good--that is all I needed to know because I value the feedback of my fellow Amazonians!  I love my new HSI.  I love the fact I did not need to spend an additional $100 for a great flat iron.  And, the small bottle of Argan Oil that came along with it has me hooked.  Instead of spending $20 on a bottle of silkening mist that leaves your hair somewhat greasy looking by the end of the day, I rub a tiny amount of the oil primarily on the ends of my hair and get that silky look without the grease.  I thought I would be disappointed because I have long hair and it is only one inch, but that is not even an issue. I love my HSI!  Walmart was selling Revlon flat irons for around the same $$.  Those irons don&#x27;t even come close to the HSI.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have wavy, baby fine hair and there is a ton of it and it&#x27;s halfwsy down my back. This thing straightens it effortlessly!</li>
    <li> works great and does not leave a &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; smell on my hair.</li>
    <li> The perfect flat iron at a great price</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.  Overall great transaction.  Got the flat iron for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not what I expected.  For the price it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, I am happy with a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I have very wavy/curly hair which makes taming it a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Within 20 minutes of working on my hair, I had professional results, leaving my friends asking me where I go to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to order at first because of the low price; but now, the price is just one of the dozens of reasons why you should buy this ceramic straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot recommend it enough. Do what I did and help your hair by buying this!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Daughter in law loves it...</li>
    <li> Got this flat iron from Amazon warehouse, that was a great deal, low price, good quality, it leaves my hair silky and shiny. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now without a problem.</li>
    <li> I wanted a chi, but found this on a great deal on amazon. I got it and have been pleased with it. It does get very hot very quickly. I do have to run it over the same spot a few times before it&#x27;s all flat, but it&#x27; probably due to my hair. I have it set on a higher heat level and love that you can adjust it easily and it heats quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! And it literally arrived the day after I ordered it. I&#x27;ve used CHI flat irons in the past and I am really impressed with the quality of the HSI. It heats up quickly, and I love that it comes with heat resistant pouch. My hair is very fine and extremely curly so I&#x27;ve ended up with a lot of heat damage at the ends. Between the Argan oil and the flat iron my hair looks and feels amazing and is so soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy hair and this could not handle it. I was previously using Remington Wet 2 Straight 2&amp;#34; Wide Plate Wet/Dry Ceramic Hair Straightening Iron with Tourmaline. And i wanted something new and what i thought would be fancier but it wasn&#x27;t. My old flat iron would straighten my hair a little bit almost immediately and this new one i&#x27;m reviewing on did barely anything the first 4 strokes on high setting. I returned it no problem and now my motto is if it aint broke don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my daughter-in-law and she loves it!  Less expensive than a Chi and works just as well!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair.  I have used cheaper flat irons and they would not give me picture perfect straight hair.  The HSI flat iron gives me picture perfect straight hair.  I thought it was very reasonably priced since I did not want to pay close to $100 for one.  I can&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best flat irons that I have used..I love them!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I have had the t3 and chi and there is no comparison and the price is much better.  I had not heard of this brand but took a chance and I am so glad I did.  I am buyinbg another for my other home.  Try this flat iron and you will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Needed a last minute gift.  Quick shipping and good value for the product.</li>
    <li> I finally can calm my frizzy hair down. Im 58 and my hair has become very coarse. This definitely does the trick.</li>
    <li> I think this was great for its price. I was a little nervous about purchasing this due to the reviews saying it would break one month later. So far no issues and I use it to straighten and curl my hair. I have pretty thick curly hair and there are some spots I go over twice. I also live in a dry climate so I don&#x27;t know how well it works for humid locations. But for the most part it does well and lasts two days.</li>
    <li> I came across this product from Amazon&#x27;s Best Sellers list and I was blown away by the price markdown and reviews which is why I decided to purchase the item.    When the item came, I was very excited for a professional quality straightener. After seeing the packaging, I was certain I got myself the biggest steal ever! However, it turned out to be very different. The first run through the straightener got caught in my hair about 2 times. Also, it did not make my hair straight. I have Asian hair, so it should be a relatively easy job. I decided to give it a chance and go through the rest of my hair with it. It just kept snagging non-stop and did not straighten.     When I looked at the plate some more, I realized the plates did not completely clamp together unless I pressed the plates together really hard. Also, the plates moved, which was not in the description, so I finally decided to send it back. Worse straightener experience ever!    I give it 2 stars for the packaging and the accessories that came with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve used in years.  I had a Chi before this, but it seemed like Chi went down in quality.  The first Chi I owned I LOVED, but the second one felt cheap to me.  This little guy straightens my hair like a charm in one pass.  Even if it is totally frizzy, it can handle anything.</li>
    <li> I, too, have had CHI&#x27;s previously. I had 2, and both stopped working within a year.Both cost well over $200. I had never heard of HSI, and was not sure, initially. The price really convinced me to give it a try. I was happily surprised! I have thick, curly hair and the HSI works very well. I burned myself on numerous occasons with my CHI. This is not an issue with the HSI, as the outer cover stays cool. It heats up quickly and goes through my hair smoothly. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the temperature control, didn&#x27;t have that on my last straightener. Heats up very quickly. Handle doesn&#x27;t get too hot, so it&#x27;s difficult to get burned. Overall, very happy! Only thing is that sometimes, if I take too small of a section of hair, some of the hair will get caught and pull slightly. But not a huge deal.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It is easy to use, has a wide range of heat settings, a swivel cord, and is light weight which helps in doing flips and curls. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received this straightener about two weeks ago, and so far, I have no complaints! I finally decided to upgrade my $20 conair straightener to a professional straightener, and before I settled on this one, I considered a Chi or a babyliss. After reading all the reviews I could find, this one seemed like the best value with the best reviews. I have thick, naturally fairly straight hair, so I&#x27;m not using this to tame unmanageable curls, but this straightener leaves my hair very silky, soft, and smooth. My only warning is that it really gets your hair HOT, a lot hotter than my cheap straightener, so be careful. I may have burned myself a few times already.... Overall, I think this was a great purchase and will continue to use on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It heats super fast and allows you to adjust the temperature. It leaves hair silky and smooth. I use it everyday and it has not damaged my hair at all. It leaves your hair very straight, even of it gets rained on or it is very humid. My old hair straightener left my hair frizzy and if it was the least bit humid my hair would flip in all weird ways but not with the HSI.</li>
    <li> Works great and feels like it is built really well. Hair glides through smoothly and I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I totally love this flat iron. I&#x27;ve used quite a few...FHI, Chi, and a bunch of other silly ones. This is by far the best of them all in my experience. I only needed one pass on the length of my hair to get my sections straight. I didnt need to go back over it 2 or 3 times. My hair is very smooth and silky straight with a lot of movement. I  didnt have any heat spots or get the sense my hair was burning like it normally does with others. I also loved the cute red bag I got and the HSI argan oil. I used the argan oil as my heat protectant...I&#x27;m not sure how pure it is or if its just a serum (does anyone know?). Either way it was a nice cherry on top. I looked all over google to see if I can get the bigger bottle. I&#x27;d be happy to get my hands on it! The swivel cord was just right, the length of the cord was just right. I love Tourmaline/Cermaic Technology and my hair does too as evidenced by the many compliments I got after getting this flat iron. My single problem is that the heat dial does not have more numbers. I&#x27;m not looking to fry my hair and I don&#x27;t like guessing. It only has the highest and lowest temp settings. I&#x27;m not a fan of that. Other than that, good product.</li>
    <li> I just got this straightener for Christmas and I LOVE it. In the past I&#x27;ve had a CHI, but after that one broke I had been using a Wet2Straight. This HSI straightener blows both of those out of the water! I love that it came with argon oil which leaves my hair shiny and soft after straightening it. I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is being fried as it did with the CHI and Wet2Straight. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the heat setting so it takes a little bit longer to straighten, but overall I am highly satisfied with this product and I love that it leaves my hair soft and frizz free! Another perk is that is is skinny enough to double as a curling iron!</li>
    <li> really bad rip off!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! I ordered me one a few months ago and had to order another one for my daughter because she kept taking mine saying it works better than her chi. Fast shipping also!!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter as she had a cheap one and it seemed to burn her hair. she fell in love with this one as soon as she used it. She said it made it easier to straighten and last longer now.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly. Smooth heating panels. Used it for the first time this morning. I&#x27;m going to LOVE this flat iron!</li>
    <li> This straightener is OK for the blow out price I paid for it. I have used straighteners for years so am not a newbie. I have wavy hair and I had to go over each hair strand multiple times, on the highest heat setting. It also pulls hair out a little. For sure not a professional grade, and NOT for curly hair (more than wavy). Worth the small price I paid for it, so I will keep it as a back up, but not the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I sometimes forget to turn off my straightener. I would come home from being gone all day and my straightener would be flaming hot! Talk about BAD for your straightener. Does this item shut-off after no activity?</li>
    <li> i bought this flat iron just to have an extra one to keep at my office or for travel.  It works beautifully and you can easily adjust the temperature.  I have fine hair so I use at the lower temp.  Love the free sample of HSI Argan oil bottle included in my purchase.  Very pleased overall!</li>
    <li> Grandaughter&#x27;s Christmas present. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I went online b/c I wanted a 1\\&quot; flat iron and was going to get a Chi, but I saw this deal.  I read the reviews and was like, why not give it a shot?  I love it!  I gets hot w/o burning your hand.  Unlike some of the negative reviews, I did not have a problem closing the plates over my hair at all.  The ceramic plates actually closed quite tightly over my hair and, as I&#x27;ve switched to titanium on my larger flat iron, it was an adjustment for curling.  I found that this was less of a problem for smaller strands.  However, the curl was really nice and held well.  I do not use a flat iron w/ an automatic shut off and, as somebody with long, thick curly hair (I use the flat iron to get a sleeker curl) I need a few minutes to straighten and I do not want a flat iron that I have to keep restarting, so the lack of that feature did not bother me at all.  My friend with waist length, curly hair (she owns about 5 flat irons) also used my flat iron when we were recently in Vegas and she also loved it.  She made some comment about it making your hair shiny.  She said she would expect it to be much more expensive and she plans on going online and looking for it.  The plan was for this to be my curling/ traveling/ back up flat iron (I have a bigger, more expensive one), but I could see it replacing my other flat iron.</li>
    <li> Very nice we love it.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a present. I&#x27;ll post review after she uses it. It did show up on time, and looked good upon arrival.</li>
    <li> This straightener really didn&#x27;t work well for me as I have baby fine, thin hair.  I&#x27;m sure it would be much better on thicker hair.  I tried every heat setting but just couldn&#x27;t get it to something that would deal with my hair.  I also have shorter hair and it&#x27;s a bit bulky to me.</li>
    <li> I have straight fine hair and bought this to combat the frizzies/fly aways that I get with the summer humidity.  I&#x27;d only ever used a friends straightener which I used on High.  Stupidly, I tried the HSI on High the first time too and nearly fried my hair.  It gets HOT really quickly.  For me, a more medium heat works perfectly.  I am already able to curl my hair with it, flip it out, etc.  It is a great tool and was a great price.  I wish I could give 4.5 stars only because there is no auto off on this iron and I nearly melted my counter by leaving it on all day the first time I used it.  Otherwise it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this straightner... plain as that. I&#x27;ve used crappy drug store straightners and finally got something real. I love it so much. I love the grip and the heat and how smooth it makes my hair. Awesome straightner. :) Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener I have ever owned. I would highly suggest getting his one over any of he others. I have tried four on Amazon and hey all quit working a few months later. Ths one is built better and so far performs just as good as the day I bought it.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this straightener!</li>
    <li> The HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron allows the user to select the heat intensity from a dial on the inside of the iron.  It also has a protective coating on the outside of the iron so the user does not burn their hands.  This is one of the best flat irons I have used.  The Chi, which is extremely expensive, can not compete with this HSI flat iron.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you are on a budget.</li>
    <li> My sister wanted one for Christmas. I already owned this one for a few years. It works great, easy to use and came quickly both times I ordered it. My sister was very pleased with the quality and how it worked.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FLAT IRON EVER</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron! I went natural a few months back and my hair is really, REALLY curly and dense. I wanted a flat iron that would get the job done without destroying my hair (i want to grow it out). After a lot of research, I decided to try it and the price helped me make my decision too (awesome price!) The first thing I noticed is that this flat iron gets hot SUPER fast, so if i was on limited time, that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Another thing is that it glides sooooooo easily along my hair which really surprised me. I thought it would take me a few runs to get a part straight because let&#x27;s face it, natural African American hair tends to be very stubborn. But no! I was able to finish my hair in about twenty-five to thirty minutes. My favorite thing is that it was able to straighten my hair with out crushing the volume. My hair looks so healthy! It&#x27;s sturdy too, i doubt it will kick the bucket anytime soon. So.... try it!</li>
    <li> Just upgraded from a Wet/Dry flat iron to this HSI and I LOVE IT!  My hair is very thick and naturally curly and it took no time at all.  I love the shine and the silky texture this iron produces, my hair never looked better.  It was shipped super fast and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel like silk</li>
    <li> I too had been using a cheaper flat iron and was ready to buy a professional flat iron that wouldn&#x27;t fry my hair. After reading negative reviews of the CHI, and finding some of the other brands beyond my budget, I went with this one and was anxious to try it out. Like another reviewer, I also received the Argan oil sample instead of the BioSilk, but no big deal, I like Argan oil.....but I don&#x27;t like the fact that 3/4 of the oil had leaked and ruined the nice storage bag. But what really got me was when I used the flat iron for the first time only to find that it was catching, pulling, and breaking my fine hair!! Otherwise, the tool seemed quality and maybe if I had thicker hair I wouldn&#x27;t have the breakage issue (?) I bought this nicer iron so that it wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair and now I have to return it....I guess I&#x27;ll try Babyliss next. Bummer! Anyone have any suggestions for a quality iron for people with fine hair??</li>
    <li> I bought a $25 straightener in town and couldn&#x27;t keep using it because it got too hot and didn&#x27;t have a temperature control feature. It was actually burning the ends of my hair. So I turned to amazon to find a better alternative. The HSI straightener has temperature control (although it only shows the highest number on the dial, so you have to experiment with getting the right setting). The temperature control and on/off switch are inside the handle, which may seem inconvenient, but in reality, it keeps me from accidentally changing the setting during straightening. The unit heats up quickly and has an indicator light showing it has reached the right temperature. The HSI seems really well built so far and I&#x27;d highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> My friends have been trying to talk me into a fancy (non WALMART) flat iron for years.  I finally did it thanks to amazon and the reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I don&#x27;t like fixing my hair for more than 10 minutes and now that is not an issue.  This is one great iron and it comes with a kool little red silk-quilted bag.  And my hair stays straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Purchased it to travel and it worked wonderfully in Europe. Now I leave it at my beau&#x27;s home for use when I stay over.</li>
    <li> My daughter Received this for christmas and we both love it. It is way better then the chi and alot more reasonable.  Get buy</li>
    <li> This is the best straightening iron I have ever owned.  I have extremely thick, curly, and coarse hair that does not straighten easily.  Other irons I&#x27;ve owned in the past failed miserably.  With a little of the included Argan oil, my hair straightens quickly with this iron.  I also love the fact that a heat-protecting glove is included in the package.  To sum it up, I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  Mine was purchased through Blue Novelties.  They are a fantastic vendor with super fast processing and shipment.  Their customer service department is extremely helpful and fast to reply to any questions regarding their products.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The glove may be necessary for some as end does get hot. Got the serum spray and love the way it works to keep hair looking shiny, frizz free, and it feels great. The only complaint involved shipping. The bottle of spray serum had leaked and about half the product was missing.  Really happy with both and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works better than my expensive Chi!</li>
    <li> Love it, i do have to run it through my hair a couple times because i have such thick hair but I have never found one that I didn&#x27;t have to, so it was great</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Amazon when my 4-year-old Chi began to lose its effectiveness on my thin, semi-wavy hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I couldn&#x27;t find that many reviews on the HSI straigtener (besides on Amazon) but I decided to try it out for the affordable price. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it -- good packaging, a sample of argan oil (which I love!), but most importantly, the straightener definitely lived up to my high expectations! I like that it has a temperature dial unlike the Chi so I can use the lower heat for everyday use (to minimize hair damage) and a higher temperature for days when I need perfect hair. It is definitely easy to use and I have no complaints whatsoever! It takes me only about 7-8 minutes so straighten my hair now so it saves me time in the morning too. It is a good buy and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with my new HSI Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron!  It heats up quickly, only requires one \\&quot;swipe\\&quot; over my hair, and after using for about two weeks, it hasn&#x27;t caused any drying or damage to my hair.  The HSI Argan oil sample is awesome, too!  I&#x27;ve been using it every day...not just on days when I plan to use the flat iron. My hair is soft and smooth, but not oily at all.  I had been looking at flat irons for several months (price checking, comparing, etc.), and I&#x27;m thrilled with the one I ultimately decided to purchase!</li>
    <li> My ceramic flatiron is better than I had hoped. I really like that the temperature is adjustable. My first flatiron did not have this feature and I felt that it was damaging to my hair. It seems to be very good quality and is beautifully packaged.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my HSI straightner in the mail yesterday (which only took two days)...I LOVE IT!! It leaves my hair smooth and healthy looking!! I have tried many different straightners but this is by far the best!! And it came in a cute little red velvet bag!! It is a great price too!!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd hair straightener in the last 2 years and by far this was the best product in terms of quality, value and effectiveness. I really like my hair super straight without feeling like I&#x27;m totally frying it. Other products I&#x27;ve used were either not straightening my hair or causing it to get too burnt and dry. I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past couple of weeks and it&#x27;s far exceeded expecations especially when you take into account the price versus a Chi. My boyfriend, who sometimes doesn&#x27;t even notice when I&#x27;ve cut my hair, actually made a comment about how nice my hair was after I used the HSI. That&#x27;s good enough proof for me!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! It was incredibly cheap and does salon-quality job. I have had 2 CHI irons before this and they worked well but died after a year or so, and cost $100+. This hair straightener was cheaper than the CHI and does 10x the job the CHI did. My hair is smooth and shiny and straight after using, and it does not fry it like many do. I would recommend this iron to any and everyone!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for our 19 year old daughter. Chose it due to reviews and various suggestions to buy a unit with temperature control. She loves it and it was way less expensive than other models.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter says, &amp;#34; it works fast&amp;#34;! She loves it!</li>
    <li> This HSI professional hair straightener was as advertised and was a great value!  I also recieved it in a very timely manner.  My granddaughter is very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> Not as good as my Chi. Pulls and catches hair. Doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly.</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome hair straightener</li>
    <li> So my wife really wanted a chi iron for Christmas, but after reading other people&#x27;s reviews of this product, I decided to &#x27;gamble&#x27; on the HSI flat iron (and use the $ I saved to get her another little gift)...and hit the jackpot!!! Now that she has used it for a few days, she actually likes it MORE than her sister&#x27;s chi iron!</li>
    <li> LOVE this flat iron.  I loved it so much I have recommended it to several friends and they have all ordered them.  (This order was for a friend actually) And the price is GREAT!  I never owned a Chi, but with this iron, I don&#x27;t need to.  It is just hot enough that I don&#x27;t have to spend hours flatting my natural curl and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair either.  THANK YOU for a great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up quickly and straightens fast and perfectly.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this.  Really feels like professional quality.</li>
    <li> I was worried that all the positive reviews were only because the price was so discounted (Originally priced at $200). I am glad to say the reviews are because the HSI ceramic flat iron works pretty darn well. It does a good job straightening and flipping my hair (haven&#x27;t tried curling with it) and maintains heat well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It heats quickly and reheats very frequently. It has a good weight and construction. Wide heat range to select from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The biggest issue I have with this flat iron is its diamond pattern on the grip. It can be pretty uncomfortable to press into it when you hold the iron close. I also wish it had an auto off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair straightener from amazon and must say I am very pleased  with its performance.Received order in about three days after I placed order.This straightner gets nice and hot .I have curly hair and this does a terrific job. Would definately purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of growing my almost-all-my-adult-life short hair out into a bob.  I have coarse hair, so when I style it with a blow dryer, I&#x27;m not happy with how it looks. It looks kinky and damaged, almost.  So I would take a curling iron and try to straighten it with that.  Nope, not happy with that, either.  So then I&#x27;d end up curling it, and it looked too futzy, too styled, if that makes any sense.  This flat iron makes my hair into a sleek and shiny, simple style that doesn&#x27;t look like I spent hours on it -- which is the look I want but have never before been able to achieve.  I like the adjustable temperature.  I like how fast it gets very hot.  The only minor thing I don&#x27;t like is how sometimes my hair gets caught and pulled out, but that happens with brushes, curling irons, every appliance you use on your hair.  I feel like this flat iron is a quality implement worth much more than what I paid for it.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> great iron for the price. Just switched from chi. The glove is useless though.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of this product, decided to give it a try.  I was amazed.  It is wonderful.  So much better than my Revlon.  Liked it so much I bought a second for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I already have straight hair, so I didn&#x27;t buy this to do heavy-duty straightening, just to keep things in check.  It does a perfect job for what I need, but I have certainly used better in the past. It heats up fast, you can adjust the temp, and the light turns green when it&#x27;s ready. It&#x27;s got a good clamp and does the job quickly, but you still need a product in your hair to make sure it stays straight. The cord is plenty long and the storage case is nice, the plug just doesn&#x27;t fit inside.  Packaged nicely with a glove and sample though!</li>
    <li> If you are even considering purchasing this straightener, stop thinking about it and just do it! I thought I had a great straightener and was really upset when it broke, but this product is a million times better. It leaves my hair soft and naturally straight looking, not artificially pin straight or stiff. Best of all, it takes much less time than my old straightener. I feel like the price is really a bargain. Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I was so amazed by this flat iron when I got it,after two months one side did not heat up anymore.It was a good flat iron but did not last long at all. SO DISAPPOINTED, GOOD THING AMAZON WAS ABLE TO REFUND MY MONEY EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY I BOUGHT THIS FROM THERE WARRANTY ONLY LASTED A MONTH. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Secret Santa gift of just recently last year 2014. And it&#x27;s awesome!  Thinking of getting one myself now.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is as good as the reviews claim. Heats up very quickly and does an excellent job on my hair. I have thick course hair and it just combs thru and straightens fast. Leaves your hair shiny and feeling healthy. The Free ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave in Treatment is incredible. Smells fantastic. The bag that comes with the iron is thick and seems made well. Very happy I researched before buying one at my local superstore.</li>
    <li> NOT REALLY A FAN. I LIKE TO CURL AND STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR WITH STRAIGHTENERS BUT THIS BLADE IS TOO SHORT, TAKES A LITTLE LONGER AND IM NOT REALLY IN LOVE. WISH I WAS BECAUSE I READ ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS PRIOR TO PURCHASE BUT IM NOT IN LOVE WITH IT :(</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, my daughters have very curly hair and love to straighten it once in a while, this is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> I used a friend&#x27;s other brand flat iron and really liked how my hair looked so I decided to purchase one for myself.  Since I don&#x27;t style my hair everyday I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.  The reviews on this flat iron were pretty high so I decided to purchase the HSI and it works great!  It&#x27;s a really good value, shipping was quick, I like the variable temp but do wish it had an auto shut off.  Good purchase and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love the ability to control the amount of heat for my hair texture. The argan oil is of a high quality in comparison to many I&#x27;ve tried and the glove is a wonderful safety mechanism. Thanks for this product! It left my hair soft and silky straight and also I used it to put gentle waves when desired. Great job!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My other - very expensive -  flat iron died. After reading the reviews for this, I decided to purchase it.  Not to mention it was being offered at a steep discount and had better overall product reviews.  This flat Iron  heats up fast  and is easy to use. The cord does not get tangled and the heat bars do a wonderful job of straighten my hair and/or  adding curls. I woud recommed the HSI 1&#x27; tourmaline to anyone who wants great looking and shiny hair. The seller is top notch, fast ship and the product arrived early. What more can I say - It was a win win!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only flat iron that will straighten my difficult hair!  It does not leave my hair frizzy like most other brands do.  I like the different heat settings and the lightweight iron.  Definately a great purchase at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to replace another ceramic plated one that I had. I was hesitant about buying a new brand, especially at this price but the reviews were good so I thought I would try it. As soon as the iron arrived I had to test it out. I have really tight ringlet curls and thin hair. When I blow my hair out I give Chaka Khan competition, but never the less it is not corse and straightens fairly easily with a good iron. This iron heats up very quickly and works very well. I have only had it one week so I cannot say how long the ceramic plates are going to last. The only thing that I am really upset about is that the textured surface of the iron hurts my thumb and palm of my hand after continuously running the iron through my hair. Thank-goodness they give you a heat glove so you don&#x27;t have to hold it that far down.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She uses it pretty much every day. It has a very sturdy construction.</li>
    <li> Works great. My daughters hair is very curly and it makes it perfectly straight</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the looks and price of product, I am still undecided about the preformance. It doesn&#x27;t seen to work as well as some of my flat irons in the past. My hair seems a little frayed after each use. But if you consider the price...you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great Product at a Great price.</li>
    <li> excellent product...easy to use, light weight, kind to my hair...highly recommended</li>
    <li> Surprisingly great!  The reviews for this item were pretty consistently great but I was still somehow expecting an iron that was LESS good than a Chi. It exceeded all of my expectations and is my all-time favorite hair straightener.   I have no complaints about the iron whatsoever (and I have very thick wavy hair that takes at least 45 mins to straighten all the way through).   It arrived in a box identical to the picture, and has been keeping my hair looking great for well over 6 months.   I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing.Oil leaves hair shiny without the greasy look.GREAT PRICE. I will never buy another CHI.The case is an added plus, so adorable.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I like the way this flat iron curls the ends of the hair.  My previous hot iron did not do this.  I definitely give this product 5 stars!</li>
    <li> My daughter in law has long and extremely curly hair.  She said it normally takes 45min to straighten.  The first time using this, she was done in 20!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price,.  Was shipped with a  cracked plate but customer service was nice enough to exchange.&lt;br /&gt;EIGHT MONTHS LATER-&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, within 8 months, one side is already broken.  It makes electrical crackling noises and no longer gets hot.  If I wiggle the plate, I can get it to work in a pinch, but it quickly goes cold again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth wasting your money on.</li>
    <li> My niece loves it, it was a Christmas present!!</li>
    <li> Omg the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had,and the price it&#x27;s amazingggggg first time I used it I fell in love,And u can even curly ur hair,I will DEFINTELY RECOMMEND this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AFTER TRYING SEVERAL STORE BOUGHT. I HAVE TO SAY THIS ONE HAS WORKED BETTER FOR ME.</li>
    <li> Good design, heats up fast, quality product. Love the Argan oil sample. Classy touch to add the storage bag and heat protection glove. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my best friend for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Great value and a great straightener that heats up fast and keeps hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been using different brands of hair straighteners for a long while. My hair is naturally very thick and curly, and not to mention I have been coloring it for about 7 years. My hair is basically fried and when I try to leave it curly it looks like a giant, unamanagable frizz ball. When I used this straightener it took merley 15 minutes for me to straighten my hair, which is a little bit past my shoulders. With all my prior straighteners it used to take me 30-45 minutes to straighten, and it was never perfectly straight. After using this hair straightener with the Argain Oil afterwards, my hair looked and felt so silky and smooth with no frizz whatsover. I honestly could not believe the transformation that my hair had. I highly recommend this product, especially if your natural hair is nowhere near being straight.It is worth every penny and your hair will look amazing afterwards!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with item. Work as expected.</li>
    <li> Best hair straighter you&#x27;ll ever own in your life. If you have curly or difficult hair, or just want your hair to be extra straight, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife. She was spending WAY too much time straightening her hair with her old flat iron, so I thought this one would be a good replacement. I was not disappointed, neither was she!! She has greatly reduced the time needed to press her hair as well as the overall health of her hair has improved quite a bit. I highly recommend this product to any husband out there who wants to win a bit of favor with his girl.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift i even want one myself</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S AWESOME ! I THOUGHT IT WOULDN&#x27;T STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR AS MUCH AS IT DID BECAUSE I&#x27;M AFRICAN AMERICAN BUT IT DEFINITELY PROVED ME WRONG IT MADE MY HAIR SOO SUPER STRAIGHT . I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE OF ALL RACES !!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is wonderful! I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day for four months and it&#x27;s performance is outstanding. I&#x27;d rate it right up there with the Chi iron my hairdresser uses. It heats up to HOT pretty quickly and keeps the heat coming. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and this iron takes care of it in no time.  I finally feel that I have control of my style.  The temperature settings are easy to adjust and my hair is left feeling smooth and looking shiney.  I liked the little bottle of oil treatment too.  This is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a flat iron for awhile.  I asked countless friends who use flat irons what they use and I heard Chi over and over again.  Well I couldn&#x27;t spend that kind of money on a flat iron, even generic irons a my local beauty supply were near $80 if I got one that had temp dial and were ceramic tourmaline, still to much for me to spend.  So I decided to try this iron with all of the good reviews I saw on here and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have shoulder length, very thick, coars, very wavy hair and this got it straight, soft, shiney and did it fast.  I didn&#x27;t time how long I spent on the flat iron part but I took a shower, blow dried, answered a few email, chased my 1 and 3 year old out of the refridgerator and then flat ironed my hair in 40 minutes, so it couldn&#x27;t have taken too long.  My hair is as straight and sleek as if I had just left the salon.  This flat iron did&#x27;t snag, felt sturdy, handled well, heated fast, kept it heat and just worked like I would expect a flat iron that cost a lot more would work!  I am so happy I picked this flat iron and saved my money!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome! Best one I have had in a long time!</li>
    <li> We have been very satisfied with this product thus far. It lives up to the excellent rating it has received so far. We hope to use this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> Amazing Straightener. Just what my daughter wanted.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my mom and she loves it. She says it works very well and didn&#x27;t damage her hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product best flat iron I ever had</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It replaced a Chi Ceramic Ionic Flat iron that was several years old.  It wasn&#x27;t a tourmaline ionic flat iron &amp; this HSI is absolutely the best.  This flat iron made my hair much more shiny &amp; silky feeling compared the Chi flat iron.  And, this was a great price.  Highly Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is of excellent quality!  It heats up fast, straightens hair, and comes with a cute red satin case.  The price is just right.</li>
    <li> I heard about this iron and saw it on sale I had to try it out. when I first got it I was shocked with the speedy delv. I turn it on and WOW! I LOVE IT...my hair had this great shine and body. I have found my hair new best friend lol. Oh and my hair is thick and no relaxer but I like to wear my hair straight. Get this iron you will not be dissapointed it works wonders...</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, she says it does a great job but it takes a long time to straighten her hair.  You have to do very small sections at a time.</li>
    <li> love this thing! it heats up quickly and that is a plus..you know when you walk back in and notice there is a spot that needs retouched real quick?  i do seem to think my hair does look really superhealthy..shine is always my goal! i also have noticed with this flat iron...my hair seems to \\&quot;last\\&quot; longer without going limp?? i do love straight hair but mine is thin..so as i straighten i pull up....so its not flat. i now have supershiny bouncy healthy looking hair..and i am down to washing every third day!!! man, i have so much more \\&quot;me\\&quot; time in the morning...not fussin with my hair!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a hard time dealing with straightening machines this one is absolutely to fall for. Wish I can give ore starts to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just that the leave-on Argan oil was quite small than I expected</li>
    <li> Works okay but not any better than one you can get at Walmart.  I have actually used cheaper ones from Walmart that I feel work better. Would not bother getting this brand again.</li>
    <li> I looked up reviews for the best straightener and this one was rated number 1. How could I not at least try it out with this price? So far so good!</li>
    <li> My beloved Chi broke so I decided to try this straightener because of the price. The product worked fine for the first few months until one arm of the flat iron would intermittently stop being hot, making it difficult to straighten my hair. Finally, one arm of the device just plain stopped working. It was disappointing, and a bit difficult trying to figure out who I should contact about the product. In the end, Amazon made an exception to let me return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my Chi iron broke. I&#x27;ve used the Chi for years and loved it, so I was a little worried about changing brands. I chose this one for the price, but after using it I would buy it over the Chi even at the same price. While they both work well at straightening hair, I think this one does a better where I want a little wave. Mine came with a case, a glove, and a little bottle of Argain oil - I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightner after looking at several different models and their reviews and I am so happy that I chose this straightner. It is very easy to use and I like the fact that it has a little bit of weight to it so I dont feel like Im smashing my hair trying to straighten it. Heats up very quickly! This straightner came with a small sample of the argon oil (which I love), a protective pouch, and heat glove. I have very thick, short hair and have had no issues using the straightner to achieve several different styles! I would recommend this straightner to anyone looking for a new one, you will not be disappointed. It is salon worhty without the high salon price! I Love it!</li>
    <li> This works great. Better than most that cost twice as much. The temp control is a great feature. It does the job with no problems with my hair while only set at half temp.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 2 grandayghterss! They really love them!!</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron is amazing...straight hair without the fuzzy burn. My previous flat iron - professional chi - was just too hot for treated hair. The HSI is hot enough to straighten, yet leaves my long hair undamaged and looking quite smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment]]</li>
    <li> Such a great product! It did everything I wanted it to do! My hair is very thick, frizzy, and curly! I always have issues finding an iorn that will get hot enough to flatten and smooth my hair. This iron solved my problem! For this iron the price was right! Im so thrilled with this product and all it has done with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you HSI!</li>
    <li> Broken after 3 times using it</li>
    <li> Have not had it very long. It&#x27;s done a really good job straightening so far.</li>
    <li> The hot iron works as well as the Chi I had prior which finally broke and this iron was priced much cheaper!  Has a hook on the end for hanging the iron up but also came with a case to store the iron in.  VERY pleased with this product!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product. Alot easier and safer to use than the cheap metal straightener I was using. I would recommend product and seller to anyone wanting a good quality straightener!</li>
    <li> Works great so far! A great width for straightening my pretty fine hair and also gently curling it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener after the switch on the CHI straightener I&#x27;ve had for years broke unexpectedly. I wasn&#x27;t eager to shell out almost $100 again for a replacement, and this seemed like a good option with all the positive reviews. It&#x27;s a pretty good straightener. My hair feels good, and I like that the heat settings are adjustable. However, the arms seem to be set just a bit too wide, so that when it&#x27;s clamped down the ends are touching, but there is a little space between the plates at the inside edge. Because of this, it causes it to pull on my hair instead of running smoothly over it. I&#x27;ve become accustomed to a better quality product, so I&#x27;m annoyed that this one doesn&#x27;t provide nearly the same quality of user experience. I love that this product is offered at a reasonable price (under $50), but it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for, and I would have been happier replacing my CHI straightener if I had known how this would tug at my hair.</li>
    <li> I needed an new flat iron, but did not realize until I received this just how badly I needed one!!  There is such a difference in my hair since using this.  My hair style stays all day.  I have extremely straight, fine hair. This iron actually controls it!!  I wish I had found it years ago!!</li>
    <li> Best straightener ever.  Hands down.</li>
    <li> I just received the HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment and it is so much better then the Conair I was using. My hair is shiny and it glides smoothly through my hair without pulling. The nice long cord gives you plenty of mobility. I had researched before buying and for the price this was perfect for me. I was amazed at how fast I received it only three days after ordering. Really Happy with this purchase. Thank you, Deb3677</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and the HSI does a wonderful job of straighting the curls. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had a chi for 13 years until it finally broke the first day of vacation.  I have naturally thick and curly hair and swear by a flat iron.  I was skeptical about purchasing any other brand but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the cost...a chi cost $150.  I have used it on several occasions and each time people have commented on my hair. The product is great and works fast, no need to go over each section more than once.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light for when it&#x27;s on and ready.</li>
    <li> I have never owned an expensive hair straightener, I have always purchased cheap ones from WalMart.  This one was not expensive but it is fabulous.  My hair is super curly and after I blow it out with a hair dryer it takes just minutes to straighten it out and it leaves my hair feeling soft.  The other ones I have used left my hair feeling dry and frizzy.  This was a wonderful purchase for the money.  I hope it lasts a long time.  I don&#x27;t know anything about those Chi things, but this one is definitely fabulous.</li>
    <li> Great! But a little over a year or so into using it and the digital display goes haywire occasionally... but it still works (for now).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great straightener with high quantity and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has really long, super thick hair.  She says it&#x27;s the best and it works fast too!</li>
    <li> delivered ontime, and excellent product for the money</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Gives great results, the price is right, even like the little extras thrown in. The iron itself works great for straightening and curling, but I do notice that it pulls just a bit. So that&#x27;s the only negative. So far mine has worked great, no problems with it conking out like other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Over all I found this iron easy to use even on my super thick, coarse, curly hair. It only took me about two tries to get the hang of it, and my hair looks great! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it does pull my hair, every pass my hair gets caught in the plates. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I do not think it works properly.  I do not believe it heats up to what it should.  I would never buy anything like it on line again from Amazon</li>
    <li> My daughter has been asking for one of these hair irons for some time.  Although she has natural, silky straight hair, she hoped to learn how to use a flat-iron to make it wavy.  This iron is all we hoped it would be and more.  Plus, it is value-priced and an amazing deal as compared to other irons of the same calibre.  The seller was especially fast in shipping the iron.  It seemed to arrive the next day!</li>
    <li> I just received the HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron hair straightener. It heats up pretty fast,and it also straighten my hair the way that I like it. I enjoy the temp control and I will have more info later on how it perform with time. But I love it, love it, love it...</li>
    <li> Heats up fast &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It look to good to be true but it is a excellent hair iron. That I told friends of mine and two of then got one will worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter. she LOVES this. told me the straightener was best she&#x27;s ever used, and the ARGAN OIL is fantastic! wants me to get her more - but i told her where to buy it.  :)&lt;br /&gt;Great seller. Arrived very quickly and pkg was very good.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will use seller again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t give your money on expensive brands only for their names. This hair straightener gives you more quality than you could expect. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product but the one I received never worked.  I had hoped for a replacement but.... Oh well.</li>
    <li> my hair looks straight and pretty! HSI works because it leaves it sleek and the hair treatment is absolutely helpful, and not to mention free! buy from blue novelties they are a great seller!</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI flat iron after my Chi had suddenly stopped working after just 4 months of use. I read product reviews and decided to take a chance on HSI (I have not heard of the brand before). Since using the HSI flat iron for the past month, I have no complaints, it works great! My hair is wavy and the HSI is able to keep the curl in my hair if I choose to do so (or make is super straight on other days), due to the design of the flat iron, it is versatile. I am happy with the HSI and would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a little over a month ago but one of the plates have already broken. The plates are connected by a kind of spring that has come unhinged. It hangs off the device and has to be snapped back every time I run it through my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of straiteners and this one lasted the least amount of time.  Unfortunately I am 3 days past the return window so I&#x27;m pretty much stuck with it as I won&#x27;t be fully reimbursed for it if I send it back. I&#x27;m not sure why it has so many positive reviews.  Before it broke it didn&#x27;t work any better than any others I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a pretty legitimate straightener. It gets pretty hot and I love the auto shut off feature. Definitely not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is NOT as good as the high end brands like GHD, which is what I was hoping for.  It does the job, but I don&#x27;t get the sleek results as I did with my high end straightener.  I still have a little frizz.  I do like that the temperature is adjustable, but I wish it had an automatic shutoff after being on so long.</li>
    <li> Great product, and nice eccessories with this flat iron</li>
    <li> The minute I saw it out of its packaging it looked amazing! When I used it on my hair it seemed to convert my frizz ball of curls into smooth silk! My hair lasted like this for days, until it got wet from the rain!lol Other than that I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Living on the coast my wife has all sorts of frizz with her hair and she loves this flatiron. She purchased a cheap one and decided to upgrade. This works great and heats up quick.</li>
    <li> I have thick long hair, i love the HSI fkat iron because is:Easy to use &amp; carry and the best of all: \\&quot;it give you a professional finish\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;travel overseas many times a year and the HSI flat iron is the first thing I pack because I can use it anywhere around the world.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would make this better is an auto shut-off feature. I tend to forget about turning it off. Otherwise, it works amazingly!</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying a flat iron hair straightener, and I am so amazed with the quality of this product and how well it works, for such a low price! This is definitely a must-have product; some features are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) it has an on-off button&lt;br /&gt;2) a degree setting that goes to 410 degrees&lt;br /&gt;3) long power cord&lt;br /&gt;4) It comes with a beautiful case&lt;br /&gt;5) It comes with a bottle of Morocann Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) high quality product&lt;br /&gt;2) affordable!&lt;br /&gt;3) it heats really fast&lt;br /&gt;4) it makes my hair really straight and shiny in a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money in an expensive flat iron, but you want a professional, high quality product to style your hair for a low price, buy this one, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and does a great job without ruining my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair looks great and my hair is a little difficult to straighten. The trial oil left my hair very shiny. I would recommend these products, very high quality.</li>
    <li> This flat iron amazed me more than any other iron has. I purchased the HSI flat iron, half-expecting it to work on my 4a/b/c natural African American hair, but the price was right and the reviews impressed me so much that I wanted to give it a shot. I ordered it on a Sunday and received it Tuesday, which, although I was a Prime member, suprised me because I&#x27;d expected at least 2, regular business days (a \\&quot;plus\\&quot; for the service). I used it immediately and was awed, and completely satisfied with the results. When used in combination with the potent, sample Argan oil, the HSI flat iron left my normalLy thick, tightly coiled hair sleek, soft and silky. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better iron (no exaggerations here!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Synopsis: GO ON AND ORDER ONE TODAY BEFORE PEOPLE CATCH ON &amp; THEY UP THE PRICE!! :)</li>
    <li> Heats very quickly and is heavy unlike some cheap plastic flat irons. My daughter loves how well it straightens.  The carrying case and glove were very nice. Highly recommend!  The price was awesome as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago for a trip to Europe (Germany/Switzerland). I checked it out first on US current and it worked great. Comes in an awesome red silk puffy packing sleeve, which was great for my suitcase. Used it in both Germany and Switzerland; worked fantastic in both places. All you need is a plug adapter for those countries so that the plug will fit into the socket. I totally recommend this for anyone who needs dual voltage.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this item since it had such good reviews. I was disappointed with how well it straightened my hair. I have medium-length curly hair, not too unmanageable, but I had to run the straightener through a strand of my hair 20 times before it stayed straight. Even then, my hair would become wavy by the end of the day (I am not sweating or doing anything too physical, and it is cold outside). I am still in search for a better straightening iron.</li>
    <li> Very good! works perfectly</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron.I have medium length frizzy hair and I get wonderful results.Would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> I bought the straightener for my daughter.  She often wakes up with hairs going every which way. The HSI takes only minutes to heat up and I can run it through her hair making it silky soft.  We love it!</li>
    <li> Daughters seem to like it.</li>
    <li> Hate this straightener. Worked great first couple of times then it just stopped.</li>
    <li> Nice product works as well as my Paul Mitchell straigner. Better price!!</li>
    <li> Good product, great value for the money and the fastest shipping ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the entire transaction and good to know that I have Amazon backing everything...</li>
    <li> Works good she really enjoys it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron. Heats up fast and straightens very nicely. Great price too. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> very good for the price</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is for the quality.  Works great on my hair.  Really love it!</li>
    <li> Never used a flat iron before, finding this one works great. Having a temp control puts me at ease for fear of frying of my hair. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works great.  very pleased with purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife for xmas the delivery was timely, it arrived with the free sample of aargan oil and a heat glove. My wife has used the product for about a month she says that it does the job better than other straighteners she had including a chi straightener. She states that it does not get as hot to the touch as her previous straighteners so she has not used the heat glove that came with the unit. She used the aargan oil however she was not sure what the results were supposed to be, there was nothing she did not like about it.</li>
    <li> I will buy one for my friend. Everybody is noticing my hair its so shiny and always beautiful.. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great product for great price!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my GF and she says it is simply the best she has ever used.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, performs beautifully.</li>
    <li> Adjustable temperature that heats up quickly; light turns green when ready. The controls are out of the way of your hand so you can never accidentally turn it off on yourself. Keeps my hair smooth and frizz-free all day-long.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product. Description was met to expectation.</li>
    <li> The products I purchased is excellent. I am stll getting use to the flat because I never used one before. But I an coming along nicely.  The flat iron came with a beutiful red satin like carry bag And a sample of oil.  That stuff  is incredible. Heat up quickly.  Curling iron heat up fast. With the flat iron the temperature gage is located inside of iron instead of outside this is ackward when trying to set temperature. Otherwise I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister in law. Package came on time and as expected. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints from my sister in law. So I assume she&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> The price is AMAZING for what the product delivers. My only complaint, the side of the iron pulls my hair, other than that, I am ordering three more for my girls as Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my girlfriend. She seems to really like it and I have heard nothing bad about this product yet. We&#x27;ve only had it for about a month though so no idea about longevity.</li>
    <li> The plates don&#x27;t meet up when closed, so my hair just slides through.  It also pulls my hair out. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one or if this is just the way this iron is designed.  But it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair because the plates don&#x27;t touch when closed all the way.  So I guess i&#x27;ll have to send it back. I&#x27;m disappointed after all the good reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
    <li> Very good hair straightener. Bought a hair straightener from Ulta, paid three times as much, had to return it. This straightener is excellent. I would buy it again. Temperature controller, ceramic plates and (very good feature) it&#x27;s good here in USA and abroad (where voltage is up to 220V). Price great! Love the pouch and a little bottle of argan oil. Please note, it is very important to get a right heat protecting hair product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is away at college and she is such a fan that I&#x27;ve now purchased a second as a gift for her younger sister.  Here is her review of this flat iron:  This flat iron heats up in about 30 seconds, which is significantly faster than any flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  And since I&#x27;m always in a hurry, I depend on it to be ready fast.  Other flat irons always seemed to have an odd smell when they were operating, as if something was burning and this does not.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair at all, and my hair isn&#x27;t even that hot when I touch it right after it&#x27;s been through the iron, so it doesn&#x27;t burn me, yet my hair looks WAY smoother when I&#x27;m finished with this flat iron compared to others. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like every other one has. My split ends are considerably better now than they were before and as a bonus, my hair stays in the same style all day long after using this flat iron.  The exterior looks cool and sleek and it doesn&#x27;t get extremely hot.  My old flat iron was so hot on the outside that I really couldn&#x27;t touch it and if I did, I definitely would burn myself.  It&#x27;s great to be able to handle the flat iron without fear of injury and that gives me more control when in use.  This also came with a free sample of some hair oil that I will definitely be purchasing going forward.  Thanks Mom!</li>
    <li> I truly love this flat iron. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot like it should.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service!  They took care of the problem faster and easier than my expectations.  So far, I love the flat iron.  My hair felt so much softer than it did with other straighteners.</li>
    <li> #Awesome this leaves your hair great i love it</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product for a variety of reasons; these reasons include: the main features, the affordable price and the quality of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Features&lt;br /&gt;• The iron’s cord is 7 feet long, making it easy access to use when not near an outlet&lt;br /&gt;• It has adjustable heat ranging from 140° to 410°F, which makes the straightener suitable for nearly every hair type and structure.&lt;br /&gt;• It has ceramic heat plates, eliminating the straightener tugging at your hair and gives your hair a smooth texture.&lt;br /&gt;• The flat iron has one inch plates, making it easy to straighten your short bangs&lt;br /&gt;• It straightens or curls your hair in a fast, efficient manner.&lt;br /&gt;• Once turned on, the straightener is ready to go in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;• The iron also comes with a travel bag and safety gloves for your convenience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable Price and Quality of Performance&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this straightener for under $40! With a retail value of $199.99, you will struggle to find a superior straightener for less money. It also arrived to my apartment in just two days! Prior to this purchase, I had a Professional Chi straightener that I purchased for $140 and this straightener produces nearly identical results for one-third the price! It is definitely worth your investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only One Minor Issue&lt;br /&gt;While this product is an extraordinary value, like all products, it is not perfect. The only thing lacking in the flat iron is an automatic shut-off. If left on, it can pose a safety risk. While this is a negative feature, it teaches you to get in the habit of double checking to make sure your straightener is off, which is always a good idea.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the oil that came with my iron but so far I really like the flat iron even more than my chi.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would make this product better is an auto shut-off.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use. I have thick hair and my daughter fine-works great for both.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the flat iron.  It arrived when it said it would.  My previous one stopped working and this one got to me before disaster hit.  So far, it seems very good.  It heats up fairly fast and the temperature controls seem to work just fine.  I would recommend buying this to anyone in the marker for a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Works very well and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Love the straightener.</li>
    <li> This product definitely meets my expectations. After reading all the reviews I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. I get compliments of my hair all the time..curls, waves, straight, flipped in/out you name it! With the HSI straightener a great hair day is at your fingertips!!😃</li>
    <li> This ended up not being the right flat iron for me. I purchased for the purpose of travel (It has dual voltage! It heats up quickly &amp; gets very hot--great for straightening hair. But it may have been too wide for me--I have short thin hair. My scalp and skin is very sensitive &amp; burns easily---I was unable to handle/maneuver this iron in my hair without burning myself (the sides of the iron also get hot). It wasn&#x27;t that much wider than the iron I used at home, so I&#x27;m not sure why I had trouble handling this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller &amp; they immediately arranged a return. They were extremely pleasant and helpful. I&#x27;m sure many people will love this iron, it&#x27;s a great price &amp; the dual voltage is perfect for travel. It comes with a &amp;#34;travel pouch&amp;#34; but I would also purchase a heat resistant mat--especially for use when traveling as the iron gets very hot.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast like and does a great job.  It is light and is comparable to higher cost irons.</li>
    <li> I have owned quite a few flat irons.  This is the worst.  It makes my hair look and feel like straw.  I do not recommend and would definitely not ever buy another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a couple of weeks and so far it&#x27;s just ok. It has nice settings and plates for a straightener. I&#x27;ve also enjoyed the extras (Argan oil, gloves and travel pouch). So far I&#x27;ve been disappointed in the heat- it takes a little longer to straighten my hair than I&#x27;m used to and, so far, hasn&#x27;t done as good of a job in straightening. I&#x27;m sure it causes less damage than my old one, so I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try out this hair straightener, however when I did, it just left my hair extremely static as though I just worn a woolen hat all day and taken it off :( I look like a science experiment gone wrong once I apply these straighteners to my hair.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!! It has totally out worked my past few, it has a great dial to adjust temperature and an out of the way on and off switch you cant hit accidentally while using. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great for creating tight curls, waves, or straightening, thanks to the beveled edge, which also means my hair never gets caught between the plates and the plastic. It also heats up super fast. I use one of the highest heat settings, and I can turn it on and start using it in 20 seconds. Can&#x27;t believe what a great deal it was. I know many people who have paid a lot more for less.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter is using this and she says it&#x27;s working great. She uses it a couple times of week and the straightening holds up to a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Straightens wonderfully and heats very quickly! I have thin hair and this does a great job styling it. I also like that the narrow heating plates are thin enough for my bangs and the rounded edge allows me to curl or straighten without making ramrod straight hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 7 1/2 years old daughter as she has a curly hair. After using this product, her hairs are straight and looks good. My family is enjoying the use of this product. Its light weight, so we don&#x27;t get tired by holding for longer duration.</li>
    <li> I love it! Easy to use. Works great on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this iron! My hair is so frizzy and curly I hate straightening my hair because nothing ever actually made is straight or took too long. Now in 20 minutes I have straight hair!!! So in love with this!!!</li>
    <li> This is heavier and bulkier than my beloved Babyliss Pro Nano, and does not get as hot, but it does the job fine at a good price for a second iron to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I use the iron for the first time today and my hair is so soft, straight, and bouncy. I am truly please with the ease of using the iron and how quick it did the job. I am so pleased that I can&#x27;t say enough about the iron. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good iron for African American hair or thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  So happy I got it. I like the adjustable temp. My hair needs the super hot options to straighten properly and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t what I expected they work ok</li>
    <li> Really great quality product and packaging for the price!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I could feel this way about a hair straightener. Worth every penny. My super-fine super-straight hair even looks good the next day, which had never happened before in my life.</li>
    <li> Works soo well! So happy I bought it</li>
    <li> I like this iron, but I prefer the flat irons that are slimmer, this one is bulky. It gets really hot though, and works well on my thick hair. It also comes with a trial size bottle of argan oil which I really like.</li>
    <li> I love how soft this is on my hair, it doesn&#x27;t stick or snag on it.  It heats up quickly and the dial for the heat is great.  I especially love the light on the outside telling you when it&#x27;s hot enough.  All in all it&#x27;s a great straightener, especially for the price!  I definitely recommend it :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve ever owned! I previously had a CHI but when that broke, I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on a replacement so I scoured the internet looking for an alternate option. Enter: the HSI professional flat iron! For only 40 bucks it is certainly a great deal. The iron works perfectly! In my opinion, it is just as good if not better than the CHI when you take into account the price. It has multiple different heat settings, the plates are smooth that do not catch hair, and it leaves my hair feeling silky and perfectly straight! I i have extremely thick, curly, frizzy hair but most people do not know this because of how well this straightener works. In fact, people are shocked when I tell them my hair is not naturally straight! I also use this to make curls in my hair as well. The straightener comes with a protective heat pouch which I use all the time, both to rest my straightener on and to use when I travel. It also comes with a heat glove and a sample of argon oil. This is a great flat iron that you will not regret buying! Highly suggested!</li>
    <li> As a person that usually has to repeatedly go over their hair with a straightener, this has solved all of my hair problems! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great service.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works well and love the traveling case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, it takes me a while to get my hair done. My experience hasn&#x27;t been so great so far.</li>
    <li> I literally just received it yesterday and used it for the first time today but already I love it so much more than my previous flat iron. Which is saying a lot because I loved the last one. Or rather, I loved that it did straightening, smoothing things to my uncontrollably frizzy hair. That one could not handle all my international travel however and I am optimistic that this one may last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have baby fine &amp;#34;dandelion fluff&amp;#34; hair, wavey naturally. It straightens well, with flat irons in the past my hair fizzes and just looks like a poor straightening attempt. I use it with John Frieda frizz ease heat defeat, awesome results.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron even more than my $100+ chi! Very affordable, and it leaves my hair shiny and smooth. I also love how it shuts off after a while because I always forget to turn it off!</li>
    <li> love this flat iron. This is the 2nd one I have purchased, my daughter broke my 1st one. If you want to get your thick curly hair straight, buy this flat iron it is soooo worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased so far!  I plan on buying some Argan oil. I really liked the sample that came w/the iron.</li>
    <li> What can you say about this product other than it works awesome.    I brought this for my wife and comparing to her 13 dollar flat iron well it just doesn&#x27;t come close.    You can tell quality right from the box. It&#x27;s heavier than the cheap one that&#x27;s for sure.  Also comes with a     Nice silk pouch for storage.     Anyways the hair comes out like silk. I never seen her hair so straight, and it only took 15min to do vs. usually 45min to an hour and it wouldn&#x27;t come out as good. Guys if you&#x27;re looking to get your wife ready to go out faster. This will defiantly give you that.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron ever.  It makes your hair soft and bouncy.  I Love It!</li>
    <li> Good dual voltage appliance. Heavier than what I am used to using.</li>
    <li> Works well with my hair. This is the first flat iron I have bought so I don&#x27;t java much to compare it too but I am happy with it.  My hair is thick and very wavy to curly and this flat iron usually straightens with only one or two passes. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great Awesome.  Fast Delivery.</li>
    <li> The product was better than exoected, excellent quality love the fabric case for the iron and everything in the box, my only complaint is that my heair gets caught in the iron :( I wish that didn&#x27;t happen. Other than that very impressed with the price and quality!</li>
    <li> Works great and the price is awesome</li>
    <li> The iron works great! i have really frizzy and curly/ wavy uncontrollable hair and it was able to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it did not take long to arrive at all and I love the little aragan oil sample that they give you it helps my hair stay healthier. Overall, the product is good I would def, recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times but works well and I am very happy so far. Loved the lined satin bag it came in and the additional items.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing. Works Great. I Am In Love With This Straightener!</li>
    <li> Worked really well for the first 2 months and then one day one side of the plates stopped working.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straighter. This is the best straighter I have used. I have thin hair but a lot of it and it get very frizzy and this item worked wonders on my hair. And one can not bet the price! This straighter does beautiful work and I am very pleased with this item. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I used the Amazon suggestion of how highly rated this was and took a chance. This is pretty darn good for the price. I have curly, fine hair. It flips and curls my hair very nicely as well as straighten and it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair. It is very sturdy and expensive looking and feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. Customer service was great</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Awesome price; awesome product! Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Love the iron. It&#x27;s awesome. I get my perfect curls in really short time and they stay.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. Better than any I have used in the past. Heats up quick and leaves my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and I have to say I am in love with it...it left my hair silky soft for 5 days..i don&#x27;t get that when I get my hair done at the salon. The way I used it was I washed my hair and then wrapped it around my hair doobie style..let it dry and then used the flat iron I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice my hair came out. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent straightener! I love that I can choose the heat setting. It straightens perfectly in one pass and can create beautiful, lasting curls.</li>
    <li> I love it, just what my wavey hair needed</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron.  Highly recommended.  Straightens my curly frizzy hair and makes it very shiny also.</li>
    <li> It worked ok. I ended up getting a Paul Mitchell straightener as it works much better. It does ok for the price you pay. I just wanted better.</li>
    <li> leaves your hair looking great. I had a chi for a few years and decided to switch. Better price same results</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. I lobe the leave in conditioner.  My hair is shiny and feels very healthy.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this flat iron. I have been using a chi now for 2 years and noticed my hair looking frizzy. I have never gotten so many compliments on my straight hair which is normally a huge poof ball. Very happy I purchased one of these!!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron that I have ever used. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Thee best!!! HSI is simply amazing. Only have to go over hair once and its bone straight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit picky when it comes to hair straighteners and usually go for the $100+ brands, so I was pretty skeptical about buying the HSI. Glad I did! Definitely a good buy. Extremely reasonable price, works well, heats up quick, and has a nice carrying pouch for when you&#x27;re traveling. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> great styling tool, heats up quickly and is easy to use with rounded tips and slim design. Leaves hair straight and silky. I always use Tourmaline Ionic curlers, the others don&#x27;t  really get your hair as straight or last as long, I use it to curl my hair as well and it last all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hair iron I avoid using. It was tedious, took forever, and the curls would come right back on the same day. Decided to try a different iron and bought this a few weeks ago. I LOVE the HSI Professional Hair Iron! It&#x27;s quick to use and my hair holds it&#x27;s style much longer. I have 3C curl type hair, so it&#x27;s pretty stubborn about going straight. With this iron I can use a lower heat setting and still have beautiful hair. WARNING: The sample hair oil is totally addictive. After I finished mine I ordered a bottle and love this stuff better the CHI oil.</li>
    <li> beautiful...well made  I love using it</li>
    <li> Love this love it!!! I owned a ConAir cheap flat iron and it has made my hair full of body and it looks like I came from the salon. I am natural with 4b/4c hair and it looks like I have a relaxer. My plan was to measure this against the ConAir and see if the reviews for HSI were true. If my hair came out the same way when I use the ConAir , my plan was to return it. Keeping this without a doubt. If your doubtful and think this flat is too good to be true for the price, take my word for get it! Best $50 spent.</li>
    <li> This product is great just need more practice.</li>
    <li> Works well but snags hair a bit.  If you have a bit of arthritis it is also a bit hard to hold hair clamped for the entire course of hair...there is no way to lock plates down for long hair.  I have to stop frequently or use both hands.  But it does the job.</li>
    <li> Great product and even greater price!  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Whatever it was made of (low grade of ceramic??), it pulls my hair, not smooths out like the other straightener I have, and makes scraping noise.  I can even imagine my hair screaming with protest! Usually I set medium temperature but this product is not hot enough.  In order to straight through my long hair with the least pressure, I have to turn up the temperature. It still doesn&#x27;t straight my hair as much as I would like (or I would expect from my other one). Especially end of my hair is left frizzy as I am afraid of damaging them with the hot temperature and rough ceramic surface.  Only reason I bought this is it&#x27;s dual voltage so that I could use in Europe.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing service! I was desperate for a quality flat iron ASAP. This was in my hands within less than 24 hours of ordering it!</li>
    <li> Thank you :) very good</li>
    <li> I have never owned the all famous Chi but this straightner is the best one I have ever bought in my life!! What a deal it is also! I would say buy this without doubt!</li>
    <li> love this flat iron gets super hot fast &amp; easy to use :) great product</li>
    <li> I received this machine and it worked HORRIBLY! However, I immediately contacted the company and they were very nice and helpful and said that I probably received a defective one. They sent me out a replacement, which I received within a day or two, and it does an AMAZING job!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Thank you for an awesome product and the professional and great customer service!</li>
    <li> So much better than paying at least double for a CHI!!! I&#x27;m getting one for my mom for Christmas!</li>
    <li> very good product. portable and easy to use. would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Breaks and pulls the hair right out of your scalp.</li>
    <li> Very high quality have naturl curly hair straightens in 15 min</li>
    <li> Excellent iron, I highly recommend. Has cut my time down significantly while straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> Have fine hair and works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.  It heats up quickly and straightens much more effectively than her old iron, leaving her hair silky smooth.  When it stopped working she was heartbroken.  The customer service rep. was fantastic.  She took my complaint seriously and even included complimentary beauty products with the replacement iron.</li>
    <li> In love the best mask</li>
    <li> Got the straightener for my sister and she loved it</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with this product! It is the most wonderful flat iron I have ever owned!!!!!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. It smoothly glides down to the bottom of your without any pulling or breaking of your hair. Also, my hair remains straight until I wash it. I like the lil bottle of moisturizer too which came along with it!!</li>
    <li> I love it. It leaves a nice shine on my hair. it doesn&#x27;t burn it and it heats up quickly</li>
    <li> Works great! Love how it helps it curl under. The oils doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have any on my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the straightener a couple times now but I do have to say that it seems to be making a difference.  I&#x27;ve owned my CHI for several years now and decided to try this since it was on sale.  I do notice that my hair seems to be straighter than with my CHI and it seems smoother overall.</li>
    <li> I love this iron, I can take this with me any where,, in my bedroom,&lt;br /&gt;if I am on my computer. I can take it in my computer room,&lt;br /&gt;it beats the hot comb on the stove.  i love it, i would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product to all Women Of Color.</li>
    <li> perfection! I have LOTS of hair and THICK , OH AND LONG and it took  me a little over an hour to do my hair. that is  pretty good for my thick curly long hair. i loved my hair. i went to a thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it, a little girl thought i was a hair stylist . made my night lol</li>
    <li> I have only used the product once, so far.  It seemed easy to use and did a good job straightening my hair for my new cut.  Perhaps it is really 5 stars, but with only one time using it, I cannot make that judgement call for excellence.</li>
    <li> I thought that purchasing a more expensive flat iron than my walmart revlon flat iron that i&#x27;ve been using&lt;br /&gt;would give me better results with my hair. Unfortunately, this flat iron isn&#x27;t any better for the extra money&lt;br /&gt;that  I Ispent. The plug is so much bigger and bulkier and the cord is too long. Sorry I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> Works really well at straightening,  just hate how it tugs at my hair. Will be going back to Chi even though they are expensive.</li>
    <li> Works well! Great for the price</li>
    <li> Wife loved it. Said it was hotter and worked faster than any other straight iron shes ever used. Shipping was quick and on time. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other straighteners and this one is awesome! Left my hair shiny and smooth and it was quick!</li>
    <li> Really great product!  I can smooth my hair with out having it come out flat.</li>
    <li> Nice quality oroduct at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I love everything about this flatiron. It heats up super fast and is smooth on my hair. The cork swivels and does not get tangled up as I use it.  Great purchase! I would recommend this flatiron!</li>
    <li> The rounded edges allow me to create waves and the adjustable heat setting keeps my thin hair from frying. Service was prompt and product arrived safely.</li>
    <li> Worked great in London! Heats up immediately and does the job, although my hair&lt;br /&gt;was not very out of control. Great value.</li>
    <li> Great product! Couldn&#x27;t be happier especially for the price.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Great purchase no problem with Theron product The ítem arrived on time and Wells package</li>
    <li> I was motivated to get this considering it is one of the highest rated and reviewed hair straightener but I should have read the reviews that hated this product as well before buying. It pulls my hair so much each time I try to straighten that I feel like I might be left with no hair on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used CHI before from my aunt and I should have just bought that one since it was so easy and smooth. Never buying this again!!</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good product. It works about like the other one I have. Not as good as salon quality, but adequate.</li>
    <li> Durable, excellent product. We owned one for many years before it broke. This one we have been using for 2 years now (daily) and it&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
    <li> bought for my wife and she said, it is the best straightener she has used.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, I don&#x27;t think this product gets as hot as it says.  However, if your hair is fine and not very curly, then this product will work fine for you.  My hair is pretty fine and only gets a little wavy, and this product works great for it.  It leaves my hair shiny and it works great to smooth or curl my hair.  I got it on a huge sale and am happy with the purchase.  But, if you have very curly or thick hair, it may not be the best product for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron based on the reviews and the awesome sale price, and it certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint.  I used a CHI before buying this HSI, and the HSI far outperforms the CHI.  It heats up super fast, and it&#x27;s heavy enough that I don&#x27;t have to squeeze super hard to get my hair straight.  I also love that the outer cover stays a lot cooler to the touch than the CHI -- I burned myself several times on the CHI, but that won&#x27;t happen w/ the HSI.</li>
    <li> this is a great iron for the price! it irons the hair really wqell. i find i can do it in a short period of time. i can also curl my hair easily. it has a great temperature setting as well.</li>
    <li> Bought for my gf as a Xmas present. Its at a fantastic price and extremely well rated. If I had long beautiful flowing lush shiny hair I would definitely buy one for myself.. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t as I am bald.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as hot as I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> Good product for the value. The argon oil inclusion is great!  The packaging is pretty fancy.  I have not yet used the glove but it is great to have.</li>
    <li> Reviews on the iron were top rated. We were skeptical of the price and my daughter even wondered if it was used (yuck). But it was a brand new, high quality flat iron at a price we couldn&#x27;t believe. Definitely would do business with them again. Delivery was much faster than we expected too.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product!</li>
    <li> Great product...great price!  I had used a Chi flat iron for the past 5 years and absolutely loved it, until it broke.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a replacement iron so I gave this one a try and it works great!  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 months.  The only thing that the Chi has over this iron is that the hot plates are a bit smoother to run your hair through, so it feels a little different when ironing your hair, but otherwise this one beats out the Chi in all other areas and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The HSI flatiron straightens my hair just as well as the CHI that I used previously.  Thought I would try the HSI since it was priced much lower than the CHI. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it and recommend it to my friends. And delivery was much sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Great for the price! I&#x27;m on my second one. The first on lasted for 4 years until the 2 yr old child pulled it off the counter and a plate fell off. So glad I could replace it quick and easy through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this straightener! As other reviewers have commented, it does not have an automatic turn-off feature, but this is forgivable considering how it outperforms any others I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and have received many compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> Not Sure why is it compared to CHI. I have thin wavy hair and I had to use it few times to make that straight. It did not made my hair smooth and silky as CHI does. Also I did not like the feel of the straightener on my hair... It had a rough feel. Definitely returning.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of its high ratings on amazon (after wasting money on several irons which were worthless). I am not a beauty expert, but I am a chick that likes to look good......and this flat iron does just that!!! Perfect size, perfect job, understand why it&#x27;s a best-seller.</li>
    <li> meh...i&#x27;ve had better.  it does get nice and hot quickly, it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair as much as my last one.  i would like longer plates. i can&#x27;t curl my hair with this one and i could with my last...all these reviews i read before i bought it made it sound fantastic.</li>
    <li> Did not meet up to expectations.Made claims in the adveretisement thats just did not stand up.Did not heat properly at all.Ended up sending back for a full refund.</li>
    <li> My 3rd ordered I would recommend to everyone for gifts</li>
    <li> Lies! buyer beware. This is not professional at all. The plates are pulled my hair, there is no way to tell the temperature- as it&#x27;s a dial, not digital.&lt;br /&gt;My hand hurts after using it because it&#x27;s not easy to use or smooth and it took too long to do my hair. the end results are less than thrilling.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t understand the high reviews for this product. you are getting what you paid for. no deal. I feel ripped off that I paid 40.00.</li>
    <li> Really excellant iron, fast shipping, very happy, thanks! A++++</li>
    <li> A really good hot iron straightener actually better than I expected, I can straighten my hair in a shorter amount of time and twice as good. I highly recommend this straighter for people with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron! Does not give me static which is what most do since I have fine hair. It is also curved around the edges so I can curl my hair in or flip it out for an added stylish look.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid it&#x27;s sort of like a you get what you paid for kind of deal.  I just don&#x27;t think this straightener is as good of quality as what I was expecting for the MSRP price.  I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as it should and I keep it at the highest temp possible.  I have had for over a year so I got a good amount of use out of it, just trading up for a CHI.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and it does not straighten my hair that easily</li>
    <li> Works great! Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, everything was packed nicely and product is great! Especially LOVE the mini sample oil that comes along with it, will def. invest in a full size one when the little guy runs out.</li>
    <li> ~~Perfect!!!!!!  LOVED IT!!!!!!!~~~~Need I say more????????😉😉😉😉😉😉</li>
    <li> I had the Sally Hansen Generic Value Product flat iron previously because it was recommended as a knock-off CHI.  It did a decent job for the price (around $60).  Then it gave out after about two and a half years of straightening goodness.&lt;br /&gt;So I shopped Amazon and based on the reviews, bought this.  This is so nice.  From the luxurious red silky bag to the HSI oil sample, you could tell it was all quality.  The iron is much more substantial feeling and heats up very fast.  It does the job well and I believe it could be an over $200 iron.  What a deal!</li>
    <li> Cant wait to straighten my hair again. Love the way it straightens my think curly hair. So happy i bought it.</li>
    <li> I guess I am just spoiled by the chi. This straightener feels as though it is pulling your hair. It takes a while for it to straighten hair, and I am use to my chi doing the job faster. My chi has recently broke and I was just trying to find a cheap way to straighten my hair. I would not recommend buying this straightener if you are use to the chi.</li>
    <li> Works great! I was going to get a Chi but this one was priced better and had great reviews so I decided to give it a try and I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> The awesome reviews are all true! I love this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It basically does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I was hoping for something a little lighter and smaller for travel purposes.  It&#x27;s difficult to put it in the accompanying travel bag due to the large plug and overly long cord, which would be fine if you&#x27;re plugging it in on the other side of a room but otherwise it&#x27;s too much cord.  I bought this to replace an older one that I had where the plates were cracked in a couple places.  I was expecting something a little lighter and more modern but this one was exactly the same as my older version of a different brand but this one has a heavier plug part.  Overall, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It&#x27;s a decent flat iron.</li>
    <li> Its a very good flat iron for the price. I just hate the plug nd its hard to curl without getting so twisted</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!! These sell at my local mall for over $200!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been impressed with this item. I like my CHI better.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better!  For a reasonably priced flat iron, it does a fantastic job.  It&#x27;s also nice that it has dual voltage.  I was very happy I was able to use it on a trip to a Ireland.  The only drawback is that it does not have an automatic shut off.  That could be a huge safety hazard if you forget to turn it off.  I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone would use the glove that comes with this product, but that doesn&#x27;t detract from the quality of the flat iron.  The oil works well and is a great travel size hair product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Heats up quickly.  It works really well!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for daughter. Will have to wait and see</li>
    <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and have very fine, thinning hair. I have extensions but suffer from &#x27;old looking, fly away&#x27; hair.  This is my first flat iron and it has made a world of difference!  After use, my hair is smooth and shiny, and is no longer &#x27;witch like&#x27;!  Greatest purchase I have made in a long time!</li>
    <li> Great on my natural African American hair. Glove is a great asset. Applied argon oil after straightening and the results were phenomenal. I Highly recommend this for coarse, kinky, difficult hair.</li>
    <li> Luv this flat iron I would say to anyone buying be careful not to drop cuz the plates break easily</li>
    <li> I like that it heats up fast but it rips at my hair and you have to do small strands at a time if you want to get it straight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this same exact hair straightener at my local mall for $120 and I found it on amazon for half that price! I love this straighter! Bought one for my mom and she is in love with it too. Shipped fast! And came with a free bottle of argon oil:) would definitely recommend this hair straightener. Have been using this exact straightener for 5 years now!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter--and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I normally use the Croc but my broke once again and thought I&#x27;d try something more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for the price I paid</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s CHI broke a couple of months ago. The on/off button itself came apart. I opened it up and found out the switch was built into the greenboard, so I wasn&#x27;t able to fix it myself. Insetad, I read the other reviews and opted to get her this flat iron as a replacement. She&#x27;s been using it for about 5 weeks now. It took some getting used to and adjusting to find the right temperature for her hair, but after repeated questioning to assure myself that I made the right choice, she has affirmed that It works just as well as the CHI. The style is very nice, the item has some heft to it and I don&#x27;t think it is poorly built. Overall, I think it is a solid investment and I know she&#x27;s enjoying it. I have heard zero complaints and she uses it daily.</li>
    <li> My order came very quickly. It looks like a quality product, however this is a Christmas present for someone else</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! My hair is naturally curly and very hard to straighten. The HSI takes 1-2 swoops that it. Very smooth and shiny. It&#x27;s very flat when I&#x27;m done and looks fantastic!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful flat iron! Works perfectly for myself and my daughters who agree with me this is better than the CHI straighteners we had previously. My daughters have thick hair and I have curly hair and all of us get a soft, straight, silky result after using the HSI. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My dad bought me this flat iron after a long time of deciding on which new one to get. We didn&#x27;t want to spend this much but its so worth it! It replaced my 1 1/2 inch conair infiniti. That one stopped heating up randomly. Anyway, this one heats up fast, like under 30 seconds, the heat is consistent, HOT, and its easy to squeeze. I like the little red bag it came with, although I don&#x27;t think the bag is heat-proof. Over all, great flat iron! The only thing is, you can&#x27;t see exactly what tempreature it is because it has a dial instead of a digital display. That doesn&#x27;t bother me or affect how well the iron works so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin and natural curly hair and wanted a straightening iron  that would be gentle on my hair, yet get the job done without a lot of frizz or  snapped/broken ends from over drying with the additional heat.    The ceramic plates on this iron help protect against all the damage that a lot  of other irons have easily caused.  After the 1st use I could notice a difference  without added frizz and strongly feel the broken/frayed ends will also decrease  with future use.    I&#x27;m impressed with the results and glad I changed irons before my hair was  completely ruined by all the irons that don&#x27;t care for your hair with such  precision and design.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. The price was very reasonable and it works well. She has been using it for about a month and has zero complaints.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Could not be more happy w/ my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my hair look and feel!</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener and is the best straightner I&#x27;ve ever owned! With this great price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
    <li> This iron is better than the Chi I used to have. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months, use it every day, and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!!! I wish I could attached a picture so you can see the amazing job it does on my hair I have curly hair and it takes out all of the kinks once it gets really hot. One of my best purchases on Amazon!!! I got the package ontime and also a lil gift of oil..Little small lol but I will really try it this weekend when I wash my hair! I did a lot of research on buying a flat iron, for the price and product this was a steal!</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day since I bought it years ago!</li>
    <li> This flat iron does the job and does it well!&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thick and curly hair and I had no trouble straightening my hair!!! I love it</li>
    <li> I love love this flat Iron, works best with HSI Argan oil. I have thick coarse black hair and this makes my hair look smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> Love love love these flat irons! The best I&#x27;ve ever had and inexpensive too!  I bought my sister some too!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Works 1000 times better than my old Remington one. Sometimes my hair gets snagged between the plates but it&#x27;s WORTH IT! This iron is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few straighteners in the ten years I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair and without a doubt this is the best one I&#x27;ve used. When I received my package I was so excited to try it out that I used it on my curly hair (I usually blow-dry my hair out so it&#x27;s straighter and easier to straighten, but I had air dried it this day). I have always had issues getting a straightener through my curly hair and it actually straightening it... with this straightener it wasn&#x27;t even an issue, I was amazed! I highly recommend this product... works wonders and shipping was very speedy. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> The product itself, is really great. I am pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth 5 stars. My only complaint is the time it took to actually ship out.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned. I am not a pro by any means but I have had lots of compliments on my hair and nothing is different but the tool.</li>
    <li> Good flat iron.  Not quite as good as a Chi, but a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Met my expectation , ordered it to be used during my visit to India</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron. I have long, naturally curly hair and this flat iron gets it perfectly straight when wanted. However, I tend to use the technique of flipping the wrist and using the flat iron to give a nice, pretty curl to the bottom half of my hair and this iron does amazing. I love the look it gives and the curls stay forever. I use this iron to style my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair this way too. The iron heats up super quickly and has adjustable heat setting knob. Mine arrived in perfect 2 day shipping time thanks to much loved Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> It was the perfect gift for my daughter and a GREAT bargain. It was delivered in a timely manner with no hassles. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This straightening iron is great! It heats up very quickly &amp; smoothes my naturally wavy/frizzy hair with just one pass of the iron. It also comes with a protective heat-safe pouch &amp; a glove to protect fingers.  This easily compares in quality to my chi, however, it is waaay more affordable. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is DABOMB.COM!! I am seriously impressed with this flat iron! I love it very much and EVENTHOUGH its only been a week of me using it, I have nothing NEGATIVE to say. This is truly a great Flat iron. Thank You HSI  (lol) ...</li>
    <li> Bought it the first time, and it was broke so I sent it back and got refund. Decided to buy another one and had the same problem, even after I hit the reset button and left it on for 10 minutes it still did not heat up/work. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am so surprised by this flat iron it&#x27;s better than the expensive chi that I used I definitely recommend it to everyone give it a try</li>
    <li> Happy with our purchase.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this straightener, I received a compliment on my hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this straightener! I have super thick, long hair and it gets the job done efficiently. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron! Heats up incredibly quickly, love the swivel cord, and the fact that it is 8&amp;#34; ft long! I really like that the temp controls start at 140 degrees. I have fine hair (although I have a lot of it), and this is the perfect setting for me! I also love the included glove as I am not the most coordinated flat iron user.</li>
    <li> Received this product quickly and as described. It is an amazing flat iron for the price. Couldn&#x27;t be happier! As a novice user, I&#x27;m not quite sure how to utilize the glove and oil, but will inquire next time I see my stylist.</li>
    <li> I have tried many type of flat iron hair straightener and I used to spend 1 hour to have good results but not with HSI. Within 10 minutes, my hair already looks great!!! It heats up very fast, easy to hold and the outside part doesn&#x27;t get too hot so you won&#x27;t burn yourself if accidentally touch it. The pouch is a definite plus so it doesn&#x27;t get messy when you take it for travel. The Argan Oil Leave In Treatment is tiny though. Really wish it&#x27;s bigger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my HSI Pro for two weeks now and love it.  I did have to turn the heat up hotter than the manufacturer suggested for my fine hair and it works just fine.  I like that the iron heats up very quickly and that it holds its heat stable very well.</li>
    <li> This item was just as described! I have been researching a number of flat irons, and I am extremely happy with my choice of the HSI. I also own a GHD and a Chi...this is extremely comparable to the GHD and works just as well if not better. And it&#x27;s just a fraction of the price! I have extremely thick, frizzy, curly hair and this works wonders!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a gift. She loves it and uses it everyday. Great product with a great price. It gets hot very quickly which is good.</li>
    <li> Buen producto pero la verdad es que la publicidad exagera un poco en cuanto a que no es un producto magico como lo presentan ya que al pasar por una vez la plancha no queda tan liso rapidamente como muestra el video, Yo me tarde 1 hora alisando el cabello de mi esposa y eso es un martirio, ya que la plancha esta muy caliente y el cabello caliente te quema la mano que no esta protegida con guante. Sin embargo mi esposa esta encantada con los resultados, y es logico ya que ella no hiso el trabajo. Asi que la recomiendo aunque como dije anteriormente NO HACE MAGIA!</li>
    <li> We love this flat iron. You can adjust the temp &amp; it works quickly on our wavy hair.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  The first one works so well I bought one for someone else. You can&#x27;t beat the price.  We love it!</li>
    <li> This is my second one, cant live with out it.</li>
    <li> Piece of $#!+. It didn&#x27;t work. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Best straightener out there. Time spent straightening my hair was cut in half!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good product as expected!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is just what I needed to help my hair in the Florida humidity. It is easy to use and works so well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality professional straightener for some time now. With all the great reviews I thought this straightener would be a great buy. It was rather cheap from the original price and free shipping. The shipping was fast, and the packaging it comes with was awesome. It even came with a sample of HSI aragan oil and a storage pouch. The thing I was most disappointed with was the way it straightened and the lack of a few simple features. I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair. The \\&quot;floating plates\\&quot; that don&#x27;t line up so well pulled at my hair while straightening sections. By the end of straightening, I had a lot of breakage damage to my hair from the catching of the plates. It doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off feature. Which is a huge plus for me since I have forgotten to turn mine off while in a hurry. I promptly returned it, and got my money back. I&#x27;ll stick with my 2 year old $40 Remington Teflon Straightener that makes my hair smooth, has auto shut off, and digital display.</li>
    <li> I really like using this hair straightener. It feels very smooth as it glides over my hair, and the results, even by a rather novice hair styler, are great. The design of the straightener is very nice, it is easy to hold and move about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the adjustable temperature control. I use it at a middle of the range temperature for my hair and it holds the heat very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would totally recommend it, I have fine, fly-away hair and it makes it look so much better.</li>
    <li> Works just as great as my $120 chi. I just wish the iron plate was longer across the lengthy of the straighter</li>
    <li> Works amazing on my thick hair, love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I love the oil that came with it.  It&#x27;s fantastic and I got a killer deal.  100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have had many flat iron&#x27;s in the past ten years. All of them have been about the same price as this one. Some were even more. This one blows all of them out of the water. You cant beat the price. It is so professional feeling and so well made. It glides so nice through your hair so you have less breakage and it only takes a couple strokes to straighten my long think very curly hair. Also my hair feels super soft after use. On a really humid day my hair stays straight almost through a ten hour shift. That&#x27;s really good for me. If you want your bang for your buck I would buy this one. Why spend a hundred or more when you could get this one for $38.99 and its as good as the hundred dollar ones.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Purchased for granddaughter.  She said, &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! At the highest temperature, running just one time leaves you with silky straight hair. No unwanted smell (burning). Runs smoothly through your hair. Heats up in 30 seconds (I counted). Finish up with one or two drops of argon oil. It makes you hair super soft.</li>
    <li> Great hair styling tool.  So worth the money.  Better than expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this flat iron.  The item shipped very fast and was packaged very nicely.  I am very impressed that it came with a storage bag and a glove to guard against the heat.  I also love the sample of Argan Oil.  The flat iron works very well.  It is nicer than my Paul Brown and Chi hair straighteners.  The price was unbeatable and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this straightener to my 21 year old daughter and she love it. He hair is shiny and it still straight the next day. We will purchase items from you again.</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener for the price! Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> My friend ordered this. I&#x27;m sure it was fibe</li>
    <li> I like this product, it&#x27;s just taking me a little time to figure out the best temperature setting to use.</li>
    <li> I always wanted a ceramic hot flat iron  to do the job for my hair.  This is the answer to my hair and styling problem.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality straightener for the price.  You cannot beat the value.  All the little extras were nice as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my daughter-in-law who wanted it for her birthday.  She is very happy with it and has pretty long hair.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works great. It is eay to use and seams to be very durable. I have had no issues with it. I really like the fact a glove and a nice case came with it. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I was looking to buy a new straightener because my old one suddenly quit working. I had a Conair Infiniti which I really liked. I had already been thinking about buying a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; model, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the cost of a chi or a mall kiosk one. So I decided to give this one a try, you really can&#x27;t beat the price. The good things about this straightener, besides the price, is that it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair. It does very little damage, and makes my hair look smooth, shiny, and healthy. The drawback, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like. The control knob says it is supposed to get to 410 degrees at the highest setting, I don&#x27;t think it is getting that hot. My hair is thick and wavy, and it does take twice as long to straighten my hair with this iron than it did with my old iron. I would say that I&#x27;m happy with it overall, though it may be better suited for someone with thinner hair. One more thing, if you order this item and need it in a hurry, don&#x27;t choose the free shipping option because it will take at least a week to get it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for 2 months, then just stopped heating up.  Very dissapointing.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!! I have very thick hair and with other irons had to go over my hair numerous times and took forever, this one works first time and im done in 10 min!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price for a quality item. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works as well as described</li>
    <li> Great hair iron! My hair is thick and I&#x27;ve had troubles either ironing my hair evenly or my hair not staying straightened. With this hair iron my results are 20x better! The argan oil that came with it adds shine and protects my hair from splitting.</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron for the price.  Glides smoothly over my hair, heats up quickly and I love the argon oil that comes in the box.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old chi with this flat iron and I love it.</li>
    <li> Didnt work for my hair - I have wavy hair and didnt seem to do much at all----- Really disappointed!</li>
    <li> The Iron is pretty good, I feel like it snags my hair more than my last flat iron did. Also the iron is very heavy. You can adjust the heat which might be nice for some but I tend to need it turned all the way up all the time so I could have done without the dial. All in all not a bad flat iron. Good for the price</li>
    <li> I have VERY curly frizzy hair, I bought this for my daughter, but I&#x27;ve ended up using it because I was curious to see if it would work for me since nothing else I&#x27;ve tried ever had. My hair came out like never before! It was so silky and smooth... We are very pleased with this product!! :)</li>
    <li> Works just as it&#x27;s advertised. Glad I didn&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a decent hair iron.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Better than any iron I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Loving it! Works really well and is very quick on my thick hair :)</li>
    <li> Works very well hair was very soft and smooth! Delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great! It heats up very fast</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Works great and saves me so much time because, ya know, it actually gets hot enough to get the job done. Love the ceramic although be careful, the plates can break off if say, your 1 1/5 year old throws the straightener on the ground :P I ordered the exact same model afterwards, however, so obviously I am still sold on this product.</li>
    <li> Very good value for the price</li>
    <li> Works perfect. I used to use a Chi and I honestly prefer this better.</li>
    <li> I had my Chi Flat iron for 5+ years and it started to slowly go out on me. I was a bit skeptic about purchasing a brand I&#x27;d never heard of, so I reviewed (several times on different site) HSI compared to other brands before my initial purchase. The price was good and the reviews, even better. I received my item really quick, two days after I placed my order. It came in box with a nice red pouch! It didn&#x27;t come with the free Bio Silk sample as stated, but I wasn&#x27;t too bummed about that. Instead, came a small sample bottle of some HSI straightener solution. I&#x27;d immediately put it to the test and it worked really well! It heats really quickly and it does its job! I have only straightened my hair though, not curl it yet. I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t create nice curls. There is a light that changes from red to green and back again; I believe it&#x27;s an indicator of some sort, but doesn&#x27;t affect the hot iron. Overall, great quality, great product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and handle, heats up quickly and works very well especially for the fantastic price.  Includes sample size Bio Silk treatment that really helps create an even smoother, straighter and silkier style.  A well made silken red cloth bag is included to encase the flat iron and everything comes in a glossy, study and gift ready box.</li>
    <li> only used it once and im pretty happy with it... never used a flat iron so can&#x27;t really compare it, but it met my expectations the first time time.</li>
    <li> I got this product before I even expected. The shipping was fast and the straightener was perfect. Coming from cheap $15 straighteners there is a huge difference. Just one swipe down your hair and it&#x27;s straight thus less damage since you are not rerunning it through your hair numerous times. I don&#x27;t use the glove but I know it will come in handy when I choose to curl my hair. The oil is amazing, too. All you need is a drop and it&#x27;s like a silicone base where a little goes a long way. My hair looks healthier than before after I straighten my hair and use HSI products.</li>
    <li> This is Mark&#x27;s Daughter: I really like this hair straightener because it makes my hair really soft and it is very easy to use. I had a CHI and it broke randomly after I had only had it for 2 months. I also couldn&#x27;t return it. I have had this straightener for 5 weeks and so far it has been simply amazing. I definitely reccomend it!</li>
    <li> should of ordered one slightly bigger but that was my error. works perfectly, and slides thru so smoothly. the organ oil is also great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for a couple of days and really like the results.  Only Complaint is the temp adjustment knob is located very inconveniently (hard to get to...especially if you&#x27;ve turned the iron on then try to adjust the temp) and can&#x27;t tell what temp you&#x27;re setting.  Kind of a trial and error til you get the temp you want.  At least that has been my experience.</li>
    <li> After my chi nano flat iron broke I decided to try another brand out. I have thick &amp; wavy hair and after reading all of the excellent reviews for this flat iron I thought how can I go wrong with this one? WRONG! This flat iron is cheap, can not keep a steady heat setting, and constantly snags my hair. Every section I tried flat ironing it would snag my hair at the end. Maybe if you have thin hair this flat iron may work for you but otherwise save your money and time and keep researching....because this flat iron is horrible.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! It works better than any I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;ve never owned a Chi, so I can&#x27;t compare to that, but I don&#x27;t see how a flat iron could be any better than this! It straightens my hair the first time and has adjustable heat settings. My friend, who has very curly and thick hair, has also used this. It usually takes her over an hour to straighten her hair, but with this thing, it only took about 15 minutes!! And it did a better job than her previous flat iron. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great Delivery, nice product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. It is by far the best I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve had several, and all very nice ones. Thank you for making this great product.</li>
    <li> First time to use a flat iron.  I am a pianist and organist and have been terrified of burning my fingers.  However, the iron was totally easy to use.  My fingers never got in the way of the heated ceramic.  Extremely well made product.  Has an &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; light and a cord that will not tangle.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> Works ok but doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up very well. Did not meet my expectations according to description.</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick and curly hair and after reading many reviews I decided to purchase this flat iron. I was looking into the more expensive ones since my hair is difficult to straighten, but this one is great. I like that it comes with the glove, holding pouch and argan oil. The argan oil is a life saver and really does make a difference when straightening hair. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and I&#x27;m glad that it came with bonuses and I did not have to spend hundreds of dollars for something that works on my hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful straightener, love the included oil!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a smaller straightener while I was traveling to Europe. I don&#x27;t know if the retail price is inflated to make the savings seem more impressive, but I found it to be a high quality straightener with a wide range of temperatures available. At one inch, it&#x27;s not large and so if you have long hair, it will take longer, but the heat is good and, more importantly for my purposes, the voltage range meant that I could use it while in Europe without any issue.</li>
    <li> One year I got one of the straighteners from the mall. They were supposed to be the next big thing and healthy for you hair. After a few years, it began to spark and the company would not replace it, even though I had a lifetime warranty. I spent forever looking for another straightener that would still make my hair soft and really straight. I found this one and researched it. There were nothing but good reviews. I am so pleased with it! It makes me hair so much softer and shiner than my old one. It also act as a curling iron. And if you&#x27;re worried about your hair texture, don&#x27;t be. I have the thickest, waviest, frizziest natural hair you&#x27;ve ever seen. It is amazing and takes less time. I would recommend this to EVERYONE. Plus, it was only half the price of my old one.</li>
    <li> Just got this.... I&#x27;m pretty sure that it will serve me well. Used 1 time &amp; so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Good product. Straightens well. Heats quickly and l love the swivel cord. Catches on the ends of my hair a bit but no too bad. Overall good purchase. Delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> During a recent visit, my sister convinced me that I needed a flat iron.  I&#x27;ve heard a lot about the Chi, but I still had visions in my head of the horrible flat irons of the 90s that somehow managed to pull, burn, and tangle your hair simultaneously.  My sister had a Chi and let me borrow it and I was amazed at how well it straightened my curly hair.  However.  The price?  It&#x27;s a little beyond my budget.  So, I turned to Amazon to try and figure out if there was something comparable that wouldn&#x27;t flatten my wallet as well as my bangs.  Based on the reviews, I chose the Hsi.  And I am very happy that I did.  It performs just as well as my sister&#x27;s Chi, but at half the cost (maybe less!).  I use it almost at the highest temperature setting and it only takes a minute to heat up completely.  It&#x27;s nice that it has an indicator light to let you know when it&#x27;s ready to go.  The plates are great.  They don&#x27;t pull at all and glide smoothly over my hair, even when it&#x27;s a frizzy mess.  It takes no time at all to get everything smooth and looking nice.  The straightener comes with a small bottle of Argan oil, which smells nice and smooths on nicer.  There&#x27;s also a glove that you can use on the hand holding the hair to keep your fingers from getting burned.  That&#x27;s a nice touch.  A red satin bag is also included for the straightener.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with the Hsi and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  My hair is too.  And my husband.</li>
    <li> this is a terrific product at a great price. I am going to buy one for my daughter as well. didn&#x27;t care for the red silk package and couldn&#x27;t figure out what to do with the glove and flattening syrup, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> Great product, it was a Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after research for too many stores...I saw the same product at $200...great price and great results</li>
    <li> Nice hair straightener. But be aware that this product doesn&#x27;t work internationally. Just brought it on my trip to Europe and none of the outlets or adapters work with the plug style. The fat end is too large.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with my purchase. The price was fantastic and the delivery was on time. The flat iron is all I had hoped for. It heats up quickly. It straightens and flips with one stroke through my untamed mix of curls and wave. The handle stays cool. The cord is long enough to share the bathroom mirror while my 10-year-old brushes her teeth in front of me, yet it never tangles. I would highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The unit heating element burnt out after a year. My wife prefers the CHI brand for quality and says it gets hotter than this brand</li>
    <li> Tried different temperature levels - and even at the highest setting - the iron does not slide through hair easily.  Disappointed after reading all the great reviews... perhaps mine is defective. Not happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like to have a spare professional grade flat iron on hand because the old one normally goes kuput at the worst time. I ordered this unit and received it in less than 5 days. Since I have never owned a HSI, I wanted to try it out before putting it on the shelf. All I can say is that I like this unit better than my CHI and it was 40 bucks cheaper. Great piece of equipment and the seller was lightning fast with shipping.</li>
    <li> I prefer the chi better.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI flat iron &amp; I&#x27;m impressed. The quality is good ,&amp; my hair was straighten in seconds! I would recommend it to family &amp; friends!</li>
    <li> Not as good as a Chi but I have had no problems at all with it.</li>
    <li> It takes a lot longer than my other hair straightner and it doesn&#x27;t stay as straight. Shipping was fast and great response from seller, but the product isn&#x27;t the strongest straightner.</li>
    <li> I have thick blonde hair and it does a fine job. The cord is extra long and that is a really nice plus.</li>
    <li> I love it! I wish the temperature dial was digital but the product was delivered in time and looks great.</li>
    <li> I love this straightening iron. My first one lasted about three years but I accidentally dropped it on a tile floor so when it was time to purchase a new one, I bought the same one. It heats up fast and does not catch my hair in it. I would definitely recommend this straightening iron to anyone!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is after I use this straightener. I am going to purchase more of the oil that came with it.</li>
    <li> It is heavy and unwieldy.  The temp dial is impossible to adjust with medium length nails.  I cannot use this flatiron.</li>
    <li> i love love love my flat iron! the are the best ones i tried so far and plan on them being the last one.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron..... straightens my curly hair fast..... wont replace it for nothing.....the bottle of argan oil was empty so yall better send me my free sample...... and im being serious i want my free sample</li>
    <li> love it. though bought in june 2014, sometimes feel like not as hot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a flat iron expert and I also have coarse hair but the HSI is doing a good job of straightening my hair. My mom started using it too. The price is good and the glove and argan oil is a nice bonus. Before my purchase I read a lot of the reviews. I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy it.</li>
    <li> It leave my hair straight in seconds</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this device because the price was so reasonable.  The general conception is that the only hair care equipment is the expensive hair care equipment.  Knowing my use would only be occasional, I went ahead and took the risk.  I love it!  It heats quickly and it does a nice job refining my hair&#x27;s direction.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and would not accept returns.</li>
    <li> This was meant to be a birthday gift for my sister and we both have super thick curly hair. It leaves her hair shiny, soft and a significant difference in volume.She has also worked out with her hair straight and was pleased to find it still very straight and not frizzy with curls returning. So I decided to try it out for myself, my hair is very long, thick and curly, so straightening my hair normally takes 2+ hours and doesn&#x27;t stay straight (so I normally don&#x27;t bother). It only took about an hour, was noticeably thin, pin straight, and super smooth and soft. Even after being outside with light snow fall my hair was still very straight. The price is fantastic compared to a straightener like Chi.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightner! I have coarse hair that is very broken, this tool helps my annoying little hairs flatten completly. Receved it two days after ordering. Would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item based on all the great reviews it had gotten- and was NOT impressed. I have think, wavy hair that has never been incredibly difficult to straighten.  I was just looking for a flat iron that would improve the overall look and feel of my hair...This was NOT IT! After using it, my hair looked dry and by the end of the day much of my hair&#x27;s natural wave had returned. I tried this product a few more times after this and chose to return it. I have had much better luck with straighteners purchased (for less money!) at Target!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this after her  Chi broke. So far she has been extremely happy. The straightening is comparable to the Chi and her ability to straight  iron curl her hair is DRAMATICALLY better. Overall a great purchase for less money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair straightener from this vendor as the one that I bought from a mall kiosk for $120 broke. This straightener is outstanding. It arrived quicker than anticipated and has worked beautifully with my baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have had multiple flat irons before and found this one nice. It heats quickly, you can set the temperature and it comes with a hand case and oil for the hair.  My hair looks great when I used the oil.  Glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron. Light and easy to use. Would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable flat iron</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  Better than the Chi!</li>
    <li> Perfect flat iron.  Sleek and hot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never has a flat iron for hair before, but it seems to work just fine.  Someone else I know tried it and said it was better than the one she&#x27;d been using for 10 years, so I bought another one to give her as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron. Heats up quick has great settings.. The only thing that leaves a lot to be desired is trying to register it for the warranty. I have gone onto HSI website and have tried numerous times but either the webpage is not found or when I email customer service I get it back stating there was a fatal error, even when I have copied and pasted the email address.</li>
    <li> The product works as described. Very pleased. A great hair straightener, just glides through the thin or thick hair. Love the Argan Oil and too the pouch, glove that all came with the product.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Works quickly to straighten my daughters thick hair.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Far exceeded my expectations!!!  Straightens my hair beautifully</li>
    <li> I broke the day I got it so I give it 1 star for how nice it looked</li>
    <li> My expensive CHI flat iron gave out. Was looking to replace it for a minimal amount of money. I know normally you get what you pay for. I was one that would normally spend $200 on a flat iron. I saw the reviews and thought I would give this a try. I was nervous, and I am picky. I am telling you, this exceeded any expectation I have. Heats quickly and leaves my hair smooth with no heat damage. I would buy again, no doubt. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This an awesome flat iron, especially for the price.  Truthfully, my only wish is that there was an automatic shut off.  This does as well as any of the more expensive irons I have tried from friends.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  I have naturally straight hair and was told by a friend that a 1\\&quot; flat iron makes the best curls. I did my research on amazon, found this product, ordered it, and crossed my fingers. I am happy to say the HSI flat iron can curl my hair or keep it stick straight, and the style lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Product  does a wonderful job. Delivered on time, no problems.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works well. Arrived quickly. Pleased all around!</li>
    <li> This straightens my hair making it smooth and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t smoke or burns the hair. My hair feels silky and doesn&#x27;t get caught in the edges as my previous flat iron did. I would recommend this to everyone. You won&#x27;t need a curling iron as this curls even better. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is AWESOME... I could not have asked for anything better. I love the heat setting and the storage bag. It heats quickly which is great for a busy mom.    [...]</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are totally thrilled with this strsightener! It heats up fast and leaves our hair sleek and shiny.plus it has areally long chord that doesn&#x27;t tangle. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality product for a great price!</li>
    <li> My wife has been wanting one of these for awhile. Gave it to her for Christmas and she LOVES it. Thanks for providing a great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Very speedy delivery and also a great price for the straightener. It is a Christmas gift so not quite sure how well it works.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Heats quickly. A little heavier than my chi. I do like the different temperature settings. Would give it 5stars but due to the heaviness gave a 4. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron because the price was good. I have to say I was a little skeptical because I have paid three times this price and got poor quality. But this iron actually works much better than any I have had. It doesn&#x27;t fry your hair to get it straight. It leaves it shiney and healthy. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, wavy hair and usually straightening process would take me about 40 minutes, and then it would all go to hell anyway with a touch of humidity. Not with HSI! Not only does it straightens my hair in half the time it actually STAYS straight and silky. Stays straight through a workout, and a full day outside. Couldn&#x27;t believe it - the hair even looks healthier than before you straightened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for curling and it works great too. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Love it. And shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> I bought this because i saw all the great comments and ratings it had, but idk about it being soooo good like people say. Its okay in my opnion, its not good or bad. I wouldnt pay 50 dollars for this, I would pay 30 the most honestly! It leaves the hair parted when your trying to straighten it sometimes. But yeah i guess im keeping it...</li>
    <li> It arrived sooner than I expected.  I used it before I went to my cousin&#x27;s wedding. Everyone thought that I did my hair in the hair salon because the result was terrific.  I loved it because it was easy to use.  I totally recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron I bought for my granddaughter, she loves it. She has very curly hair and she gets her very smooth and straight.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  Just started using it but am very satisfied thus far.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and condition were as promised.</li>
    <li> Love this, however it broke 1.5 years into it. Bummer</li>
    <li> A very effective and well made flat iron.  Works on both my fine flyaway hair my mother&#x27;s coarse wavy hair with beautiful results.  Heats up very quickly, has a lovely heft and balance when held in the hand.  Does not feel or look flimsy.  I can&#x27;t believe I paid so little for an iron of this quality!</li>
    <li> I wanted the CHI but wasn&#x27;t willing to shell out the $$$. This straightener works really well and the price is very reasonable. I have super curly hair and it cuts my straighting time in almost half.</li>
    <li> This iron does what it says and I like the sleekness of it.</li>
    <li> I never owned flat iron before and before I purchased this one I did my homework. It is perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, so I can only go by what she tells me. This straightener cuts the time she needs for doing her hair by at least 25% maybe more. She loves it and for her hands it&#x27;s very comfortable to use. She&#x27;s only had it for a couple of months so we don&#x27;t know how long it will last. If it works well for a couple of years or so, well rate it as being perfect. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have had the same straightner for a long time and it was horrible, took so much of my time and was damaging my hair.  I just recently purchased the HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat iron and I love it! I am kicking myself for not buying it sooner  Was a good price. Was a little nervous that it wasn&#x27;t working that good but apparently I just needed to change the setting to higher temperture. It  did take a little bit longer to heat up to ready but saved so much more time b/c Im not having to repeat the same sections of hair as with my other flat iron.  I didn&#x27;t get the flat iron holder, wish it came together. I have not yet gotten to try the argain oil</li>
    <li> love it and just in time.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this iron.</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener, I have really thick hair and it gets the job fast, the only complaint is that it pulls hair sometimes, but other than that I love it! I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It heats up very quickly and does a wonderful job both straightening and curling my thick, fine hair. I&#x27;m still getting used to the iron, but I will post an updated review once I&#x27;ve had some more time with it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have very curly hair and this flat iron works better than any other flat iron I have purchased--even better than the professional iron used by my hair stylist.  Would definitely recommend and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> After several years (and drops on my part lol) my old HSI finally went to straightener heaven, so I bought this new HSI and will keep it until it eventually dies too.</li>
    <li> Oh my God. I don&#x27;t believe reviews anymore because the previous ones have to be fake for it to have so many stars. There is absolutely nothing special about this straightener... it doesn&#x27;t get very hot so your hair does not get straight and is not shiny after using it. My hair is just wavy and it&#x27;s thin so there&#x27;s no way this would be a great straightener for curly hair. I bought this one because of the reviews and it doesn&#x27;t add up. I had it on the highest heat setting and it feels like my straightener that I am replacing because it&#x27;s 2 years old and is starting not to work as well. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Does an awesome job! Fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> Great product, I highly recommend. It was a little different than the one I had before, but after getting used to the way it should be handled, it worked just as good, if not better.</li>
    <li> I received the flatiron promptly and in great condition.  It is a great flatiron and I use it everyday. I love that you can adjust the temperature.</li>
    <li> The first week or so I realized what I had been missing. However.... three weeks later it started taking soooooo long to heat up. I never see the green light anymore.  It is well having a straightener that works. But this one was a tease.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel to Europe and it has been doing its job! I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me that this flat iron has Anything more than one star? It deserves zero!!! I may have gotten a defective one but by the reviews it seems like I&#x27;m not the only one. The straightener sucks. It doesn&#x27;t straighten. It gets super hot but you go over one section of hair multiple times and it still isn&#x27;t straight. It also breaks and damages the hair. Not to mention the seller blue novelties has the worst customer service. It costs me $15 just to send it back to them. Waste of money! Don&#x27;t get this product or do any business with this company. Not worth it. They&#x27;re not even a real or big company. They&#x27;re address is someone&#x27;s house. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson to only buy stuff on amazon that they fulfill themselves because at least amazon guarantees their products and returns!</li>
    <li> The HSI 1\\&quot; ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron works fine. It did not live up to what I was expecting and I think my friend&#x27;s CHI is a little bit better. I like that the temperature can be adjusted, however I find that I use the hottest setting anyway. Just so you know, I have fine hair but a lot of it and it is curly. This product does snag my hair sometimes, but that seems to happen with every flat iron I&#x27;ve used. Overall I do like this flat iron as it gets the job done and my hair is quite shiny and soft after I use it. One thing I don&#x27;t understand is the light. When the iron is turned on the light is red and at some point it turns green, but even after it has turned green it will change back and forth from red to green. I don&#x27;t know what that means, but it still works fine.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with delivery of the flat iron.  Promt service and although the oil was not included in the package it arrived the next day. Also happy with the product.  This is my first purchase of a flat iron and so far it is good.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly! Fast delivery, product was in perfect condition. At first I thought it was broken because it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, but all you have to do is press the reset button on the electrical plug. It leaves my hair soft and I love the temperature adjustment.</li>
    <li> I have hair somewhere in between wavy and straight. This flat iron creates a smooth appearance. I little ceramic smell the first few times I used it but that got better.</li>
    <li> Great service and a wonderful Flat iron...I LOVE IT.  I&#x27;m really happy with the price I paid for it as well as the wonderful service received.  :)  I have natural African American hair and this flat iron is fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through no fault of the seller I was not able to ues the Argon Oil as I accidentally spilled it. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the flat iron has a digital temp control and is dual voltage. I would never leave home without it. (and haven&#x27;t...ha ha ha)</li>
    <li> This straightener rips out my hair!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Second flat iron I have purchased from this manufacturer.  Definitely compares to more expensive models.  Is 220v, or dual voltage, which is great for overseas travel!</li>
    <li> Great product - exactly as described.  First time I&#x27;ve purchased a flat iron hair straightener and this works great.  My hair is thick and it handles it nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Less expensive than a Chi and does just as well!</li>
    <li> So far so good:) girlfriend loves it and said alot better than her last one. Would recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the case.  It&#x27;s the only one we could find with some hard part on it.  Everyone else only has rubber cases.</li>
    <li> This product does everything that I want it to do and more. It straightens my hair in so little time, maybe fifteen or twenty minutes, and I have thick, long, wavy hair. It also does flips if I want my hair to have a little something extra, and it curls. It also gets very hot, so that it can straighten any type of hair. Great Product!</li>
    <li> Ok... So I TRIED to wait until Christmas (it was a gift to myself, since my 2 teens kept borrowing my old one)... I FIRST used this for my famliy&#x27;s Christmas party...smh....CRAZY!!!! MY HAIR FELT LIKE A BARBIE DOLL&#x27;S HAIR!! I DO NOT have bad hair (I am  AM) I take great care of my hait and just wanted my teens to leave me alone and didnt wanna share flt irons with them (im picky!!!)... So I got this on sale and OMG!!!!!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT and want other products by them!!!! IDK what to tell you... BUY IT!!!!! I was in the mirror smiling and COULD NOT believe the results...Last product I uses was the revlon ceramic and tourmaline and it was GREAT!!! This is like AMAZING!!!! and the OIL.... puleaaaaazzzzzz OMG.... JUST BUY THIS AND INVEST IN THE OIL!!!! PROMISE YOU!!!!! My sister, daughters and my youngest daugter friend felt my hair and all they did ws SHAKE THEIR HEAD (and I SMILED EACH &amp; EVERY TIME!!!).... As I said i DO NOT have bad hair at all... This product is FIERCE!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I&#x27;m not much into spending hours on end doing my hair each morning.  But so far this flatiron is doing exactly what I want it to do in a short time span!</li>
    <li> This was for my 27 year old daughter for Christmas......SHE LOVES IT!!!!!Easy to use, works GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a great one.  The HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron is a great tool for smooth, sleek hair.  Since having my second child, my hair has decided to curl, and this flat iron has become a daily necessity.  It heats up to temperature quickly, is lightweight, and is a great price.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting that healthy, shiny, straight look.</li>
    <li> I have used a CHI for the past 4 years and was very happy with it.  However, it quit working so I was on the hunt for another.  I found the HSI on Amazon.  I did some research on it and it had consistantly good reviews.  I purchased it via the reviews as well as the price point.  I am VERY pleased with this flat iron.  Even more so than the CHI I used.  The shipping was fast and everything was in the original packaging.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> Love my ceramic hair straightener!</li>
    <li> Great iron, fabulous price! Adjustable temp. to meet the needs of your hair.</li>
    <li> This product does not break or pull your hair like some of the others that I have used. I Like the controls that can be turned up and down. It gets hot really fast. This is probably one of the best ceramic straightener that I have used.</li>
    <li> The wife loved it. Compared to other $150.00 models she has purchased before and have had problems with. She couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality and time it takes to warm up. Great product at a great price. Hopefully it will last a long time and not die out within a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after my chi broke. I was really worried because it was less expensive and  I really liked my chi. But after reading the reviews I decided to try it out. I really like this flat iron. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend all that money on a chi! I have mostly straight hair with a little wave that is fine but there is a lot of it and this flat iron works great!</li>
    <li> Perfect! I loved it so much I  bought another one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good quality product. It definitely meet my expectations. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> I had normally spent 100-200 dollars on straighteners. But after reading the reviews thought I would give this one a try at the much lower price. Oh wow, so happy I did! Even my boyfriend has commented on how great it works on my hair, and he normally never notices such things. I have super thick and rather long hair. My old straightener I would go through my hair about 5 separate times before going to events and it still would not get my hair as straight and nice as this does after going through it once! Def recommend purchasing this to everyone on the planet.</li>
    <li> My sister in law had this one when they were visiting. I liked it so much I ordered one for me. Excellent straightener. No complaints</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this flat iron. It&#x27;s the best product in the market.  I have fine straight hair, but it gets fuzzy when it&#x27;s hummid. When I use the flat iron in the morning my hair doesn&#x27;t get fuzzy.  I simply think it works and it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair.  :)</li>
    <li> Very nice curling iron and does a great job straightening my very curly hair</li>
    <li> The HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron was all it was advertised to be. It heats quickly and stays at a constant temperature, no having to fiddle with the thermostat or wait for minutes for it to be ready to use. Hair styling is a snap and can be done in less than 3 minutes without damaging hair. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair is shiny &amp; silky. Other flat irons don &#x27;t leave my hsir feeling so good.well worth the money!</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves it. She says that it is the best one she has ever used. She loves the temperature adjustment on it. Very fast shipping! Great seller!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I have very wavy hair, borderline curly, and this flat iron makes makes me look like I have naturally stick straight hair.  My hair is very thick, but I am able to do each side with just 3 layers.  I get so many compliments on my new hair!</li>
    <li> Works great. Lots of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it. The case is very useful because I&#x27;m always on the go. The best part is that the cord is long enough and is on a swivel so it doesn&#x27;t kink. Just ordered a second one as a gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> I got the HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener for a christmas gift and could not have picked a better one myself! And I am very picky with my styling products, this one works just great! As soon as I plug it in, it is hot and ready and does not \\&quot;fry\\&quot; my hair. Great service and if I ever need to order again, I will order through this company! Great product, great service!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.Just what my wife had been looking for. Her hair is frizz free looks shinner and healthier.Would recommend this product to every lady out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener as a gift for my wife.  She loves it!  It&#x27;s fast-heating, very easy to use, and it works great.  This seems to be pretty high quality.  A great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Sorry...but I had to go back to using my old flat iron.  This new one did nothing but burn my hair.  And the temp. Isn&#x27;t even as hot as my old one.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST 1\\&quot; ceramic straightener I have ever used, and the price is phenomenal. I&#x27;m not sure why that other reviewer thought that this iron was a Chi product, but I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s not. I had never heard of HSI before ordering, but I will defiantly buy any other hair tools that they make. The iron heats up quickly and has floating plates. My hair was very shiny after use, and I didn&#x27;t need to use any sprays or sheens. With this flat iron, I can curl my hair, flip my hair, and of course straighten my hair. After use, my hair was bouncy and it looked almost as good as when I go to the hair salon. I could go on for hours about how much I love this new flat iron, but don&#x27;t take my word for it, buy one for yourself before they raise the price. I forgot to mention that there is a teeny tiny bottle of hair serum that comes in the box with the flat iron. It works very well, but it is just a sample size, so don&#x27;t expect it to last for more than 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I needed a new straightener because my CHI straightener broke. I had only had my CHI for a year and one side stopped getting hot - my fiancee tried to replace the thermal fuse but that didn&#x27;t work. I got this one because of all the amazing reviews, and just wanted to say this one is great! It gets really hot just like my CHI did, and makes my hair really smooth and shiny. You can tell its cheaper than the CHI, because of the feel of the metal on the outside, but since those keep breaking I think this one is perfect for me. I use mine on tile countertops but if you&#x27;re setting it down on something else I recommend getting the holder because it does get really hot.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product. It came with a lot of extras! For the price it is a great product!. I&#x27;m really happy that I choose this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a horrible year with my hair.  So much humidity.  I would see women with beautiful silky hair and be green with envy.  I asked my sister-in-law what she used and she suggested a professional flat iron, but to be very carerul not to damage my hair.  I am thus far pleased with this flat iron.  Still practicing with it, but the results have been exactly what I expected.  Nice not to be a ball of frizz head any more.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> Purchased on a whim, so glad I did. It has made  a huge difference in the texture of my hair, it   straightens faster than my previous flat iron   and straightens better then my old one as well.  I am very happy with it and would recomend.</li>
    <li> This iron was amazing.  It heats up quick and strengthens your hair in one swipe.  I very happy with it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up fast and works well and seems to be of high quality.  The only downside is there is no automatic shutoff.</li>
    <li> Love this! It straightens my wavy hair perfect!</li>
    <li> i bought this back in early 2012 and it still works! not as well as it used to (been through alot from constant traveling) but still works!</li>
    <li> I have not written a review in some time but my wife just loves this product. She has very curly hair and began chemically treating it (every 3 months) to straighten it. This did not make me very happy since I had heard the chemicals might be carcinogenic. She has been using this product now for almost 4 months and her hair is remaining perfectly straight, from roots to tips. She insists she will never have to straighten it chemically again.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product. 6 stars ******. Amazon 6 stars as well for simply being the best place to buy things.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for an upcoming trip to Europe where the current is 220 volts.  She likes it so well she scrapped her old one and uses this one exclusively since it works in the USA on 110 volts too (without any adjustment).  Very satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Received it in time and when I used it I LOVED it.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the iron, the oil, or the combination of both but I really like the way my hair turns out. I am trying to not flat iron my hair too often &#x3D; I have lots of curls and freeze&#x3D;, but sometimes I can&#x27;t resist and want to look more polished. this gives me the results I want. I am actually thinking on buying one for my daughter too. :0)</li>
    <li> This item was my best by yet on amazon, I got this for my daughter as a christmas gift and it work wonders i&#x27;m so happy with this investment.</li>
    <li> These flat irons work wonders. I&#x27;m so glad I bought them. I love them. My cousin uses them as well and she was just as happy as I was..</li>
    <li> I only used it twice and my son used it once and it does work good.  Made my hair soft and even the next day, was still soft.  The only drawback is a couple of strands of my hair got stuck in it a couple of times, so I will keep an eye on that.  I only had this product for 2 days, things can change.</li>
    <li> Purchased in April 2013 and stopped working September 7, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;It worked intermediately this last month.  The flatiron would work if the electrical cord was turned a certain way.  Then September 7,  the flatiron starting to put off an electrical smell.</li>
    <li> works nice for smoothing and flipping hair- Was only disappointed that it does not have an auto shut-off feature-I have already left it in once for a day-plus the turn off switch is inside in an awkward place-just ended up unplugging it without turning it off-didn&#x27;t want to risk burning my fingers.</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY WITH THE FLAT IRON.  A VERY NICE GIFT BOUGHT WITH A GIFT CARD! I AM A NOVICE WITH THIS FLAT IRON, BUT AM STILL GETTING GREAR RESULTS.</li>
    <li> My daught was very happy with this for Christmas.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic. Quick in heating up and does a great job straightening my frizzy wavy hair!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It has a wide range of heat depending upon the texture of the hair.  I used the low range of heat and used one pass through my hair. Since I have not yet been able to find a hair dryer that is to my liking when it is wet I cover my hair with a hair net, a cotton scarf then finally a bath towel.  It dries adequately enough, however, the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic... makes my hair almost as smooth as If I had curled my hair in rollers with pins and sat under a dryer.  Yes, this is the old fashioned way, but it still works great for me. However, this product does a nice job. A small bottle of argan oil is included which is recommended to use before the flat iron is applied to the hair.  The  only improvement needed is the arrow that points to the area of heat should be more clear~~~either delineated in white or made a bit larger.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fastastic!!</li>
    <li> My daughter finds it doesn&#x27;t slide down her hair smoothly, it pulls her hair. t does heat up quick though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 14th birthday. She LOVES it! (and she is very picky!) Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Didnt do it for me. I have this hair and this barely straightens it. I read all the good reviews and thought it would be good but.</li>
    <li> In love!!!! Works so much better than my CHI straightener ever did. A must have!</li>
    <li> Amazing, works great and perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> This has a smooth plate, it is perfect for thick African American hair, it got my hair nice and silky the first time threw.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter as Xmas gift and she loves it - could not believe how great it is.Better than previous one she had, Thank you for good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> My wfe has used this everyday so far and I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time! Seemed to be able to go faster with this iron than my previous one (BTB), without fear of it not getting out every lump of my crazy hair.  My hair also seems shinier and smoother after using this iron.  My package came with a bottle of the argon oil, however I have not used that yet.  The plates are 3 1/2&amp;#34; long which is pretty standard.  The plug is the box kind that has a reset button in it, it all seems very well made.  Excited to continue using it! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Was a little dissapointed, doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I thought it would, and it pulls my hair. Not terrible, just not what I was expecting. Got it at a good price though.</li>
    <li> Top quality, straightens hair on the first run through. Could not be happier and would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price. Heats up super fast and gives alot of shine. Truly a professional styler. Also comes with a nice carrying bag. Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> My daughter has waist-length thick, curly hair, and had given up on finding a decent straightener. A Mall of America kiosk worker selling this straightener used her for a demo, and it worked so well and so fast on her hair that we bought this on Amazon - rather than spending the $140 the kiosk was asking for it. It&#x27;s amazing - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Ever since I have started using this iron people have been complementing on how well my hair looks. The iron really does a great job of straighting my hair. It looks smooth and shinny after ever use. My hair is not breaking anymore! Love it! A must have! As you get older your becomes more dry and dull. This iron makes my hair look fabulous!</li>
    <li> This is the best product and a fabulous price.  It is truly the best flat iron I have ever used.  And it came with a fabric case as well as free bio silk sample.  I am beyond satisfied.  Shipping and delivery were speedy.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> To illuminate as to my hair and its needs, I am South Asian and have very thick hair. And there is a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair texture tends towards dry and coarse, and on flatirons with temperature control, I keep the dial turned up to high.&lt;br /&gt;I had a CHI flat iron prior to this iron, and after reading the reviews, I think my expectations for the HSI were too high.  I think this iron would be great for someone with normal to fine hair. The HSI does the job, but for smoothness and ease of use, I still prefer CHI.  Price-wise, this iron is a great deal, and it definately does straighten- or curl- my hair well enough, but to compare with CHI, I have more flyaways and a \\&quot;drier\\&quot; texture to my hair. (This after using the iron with the CHI silk infusion, which by the way, is a great product!)</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these straighteners hoping they were better than the Chi irons we previously owned and I was completely satisfied.  They are great and are much better!!</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I really, really like it. It does it&#x27;s job very well, and I have yet to burn myself with it. Give it a go!</li>
    <li> This is the second pair of HSI flat irons I bought. The firat ones wirked so well my sister borrowef them and kept forgetting to return them. I had to buy as replacement. These cermanic flat irons have made it a lot easier to learn to do my own hair. Theres no burning or snagging they glide through hair. One problem the on/off switch and temp controls are on inside of flat iron making them difficult to reach.</li>
    <li> Good product, nice price..haven&#x27;t had any problems. If this one breaks or stops working I would probably buy another one</li>
    <li> This is the first \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; flat iron l&#x27;ve purchased. I find that it actually doesn&#x27;t make my hair look/feel any differently than the $20 straighteners did. I use a quality heat protector product and l believe that&#x27;s where the difference is made. Also, the cheap irons have an auto shut off feature that this one doesn&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s also very heavy. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it dies, but l won&#x27;t waste my money again on a \\&quot;professionally-priced\\&quot; iron.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised...awesome straightener.  I recently needed a new straightener as my old one had a crack which caused it to pull my hair.  This one is smooth and easy to use.  I actually enjoy using it as opposed to my old one.  Once straightened, it lasts for days and looks great.  I was looking at a more spendy iron, but I am glad I didn&#x27;t go for the extra cash when this one is exactly what I was looking for to work my long hair.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great straighter, it flows very smoothly over your hair with shiny results. I bought this with the [[ASIN:B004V9600U HSI PROFESSIONAL HIGH TEMPERATURE HEAT RESISTANT FLAT HAIR IRON STAND / HOLDER fits most 1 inch models]].  This product does everything it says it will, and comes with a heat glove, a satin case, and a little bottle of HS1 Argan oil. I am very pleased.  The only con is that it does not have an auto shut off, but I unplug the unit after use, so not a big issue for me. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> only used twice seems okay</li>
    <li> I use the straightener everyday, does a great job straightning my hair but leaves my hair very dry. Not bad for your money.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I had one that I loved that cost almost twice as much as this one, and it stopped working. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a replacement, but I wanted a really good product. Due to the great price of this one, I decided to give it a try, and I love it! My hair is not extremely thick or curly, so it&#x27;s not too terribly difficult to straighten it, but it does get frizzy and damaged easily. This straightener is wonderful. My hair is soft and shiny after using it. I don&#x27;t use it at full heat- I have the dial turned about halfway, and it works perfectly. I have also tried using this to curl my hair, and with some practice, I was able to get natural-looking waves and curls - better than my curling wand.</li>
    <li> Great product.Love the pouch))</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I brought it with me to Israel and it worked perfectly. No glitches. It also works perfectly in the US. For the price it was such a great purchase. I am very happy so far with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn the hair like some straighteners.  Just perfect!</li>
    <li> Works great. Heats up very quickly and the temperature is adjustable. Easy to use, but I can&#x27;t curl my hair easily, it starts to snag when I turn the straightener. Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with the product. Also, please note that it is not a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size, but it comes with a nice travel pouch.</li>
    <li> I had this for less than 6 months and all of the suddent one side of the iron went out on me. I&#x27;ve cleaned it right and taken good care but out of nowhere this happend</li>
    <li> Great price and it works great!</li>
    <li> Works but wish that it straighten the hair better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like commenting before I really know quality and durability, so others know exactly what they&#x27;re buying. With that said I&#x27;ve been using this a minimum of 4 times a week for almost two years. It still works exactly as it did the first time I used it. Consistent heat that makes it so you only have to go over hair once. Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, it glides very smoothly and hasn&#x27;t caused much, if any damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> I am definitely satisfied with the product. It heats up super quick, and straightens/curls my hair easily. I have thick, course hair and it works great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it does get hot in the area above the plates. But... They included a glove! It didn&#x27;t even have that in the product description and it was in the box. The free sample was an HSI brand of argain (they spelled it that way) oil, not Biosilk, but I really don&#x27;t mind that. The packaging was nice. It came with everything described and more. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 16 yr old grand daughter for Xmas and she was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair so it can be difficult to straighten completely, this iron does a great job though. It heats up in less than 2 minutes which is very nice.</li>
    <li> My daughter is thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> Just as described! Arrived quickly and in good shape. Works great! Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> The wife loved her gift.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome. Heats up fast, and works awesome. I have very Curly hair and this iron takes all the curl out. It takes me about 15 minutes to straighten my shoulder length thick hair after I blow dry it. I love the travel bag and the heating glove. It has an adjustable heating dial for the prefect temperature. Love it, glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100 plus dollars on a Chi iron.</li>
    <li> After a review of almost all the available flat irons, my wife decided to go with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good decision. After using the product for few weeks now here is our review of the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Heats up really fast.&lt;br /&gt;2. The temperature control available in the iron, suits all different hair types.&lt;br /&gt;3. Didn&#x27;t notice any hair fall, breakages or hair burn or burnt smell.&lt;br /&gt;4. Another important feature is the dual voltage, which would allow us to use almost anywhere we travel (India).&lt;br /&gt;5. The Argan Oil that comes with this package, is really good and helps in maintaining the hair really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had no problems with it at all! Works as good as it was on the first day. I would recommend this product to every one.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this for Christmas. She is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This product works great!!!</li>
    <li> Efficient service. Excellent product. Can&#x27;t believe the price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Brought them for my daughter. Her hair is naturally curly and these flat iron gets her hair super straight.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product. It has been perfect for my needs and the compliments I get are amazing. This does NOT burn my hair. Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron was exactly what I was looking for.  It leaves a smooth, shiny finish on my hair.  I was very pleased with the price, as they were much more expensive elsewhere.  The argan oil is a nice plus, I had not used it before.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Really impressed with the shiny, smooth finish it leaves my hair. Highly recommended to all.</li>
    <li> I am not disappointed with this product.  I expected to be because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job on my hair.  I do have fine hair, but I found the perfect temp.  Leaves a nice shine when using the oil.</li>
    <li> There&#x27; a general misconception that the UV light generated by nail lamps is harmful over time. This has kept several of my customers from enjoying the benefits of UV gels on their weak and broken nails. I am so happy to find these  Anti-UV gloves. They have helped me bring two customers over to gel nails. With only their fingertips exposed, these women feel safer during UV cures and are delighted with their new nail enhancements.</li>
    <li> I have used my HSI flat iron for 1 week now and it&#x27;s amazing.  This works so much better than any store flat iron.  It now takes me 15-20 minutes less time to straigten my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it works just as great as my old $180 one I bought at the mall. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very Pleased!&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift for my daughter and she is &amp;#34;tickled pink&amp;#34;!  Advisedly. it heats up very quickly and is of very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron for the price.  I like it better than my Chi!</li>
    <li> Arrived with a HUGE crack in the plate! Returning!</li>
    <li> I was expecting salon results with this hair straightener, but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. It did not straighten my wavy hair, even after gliding it across an area several times. The iron wasn&#x27;t hot enough for my thick hair, even at the highest setting. Highly disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> Not hot at all. The hair remained wavy after several times.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, excellent product. This is a wonderful hair care product. I have thick, long, natural curly hair, with this iron I can go from curly to silky straight in no time!!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Great price! Excellent delivery time!</li>
    <li> It has been a very long time since I have bought a hair straightener, but I am happy so far.  The straightener arrived a day early, was packed carefully, and came with a few features I didnt realize (including a cute red pouch).  I have only used the straightener once, but the day I used it, I went outside and it immediately started raining.  I only had an umbrella and figured my hair would be ruined, but it actually stayed straight for three more days (I was traveling).  The only thing I didnt expect was that the straightener was a little heavier than my old one (some Conair model from probably 5-10 years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done plenty of reviews of hair products and was ready to try something new. I did my research and found this flat iron and thought it was a must have. After seeing the fabulous reviews on this company I knew I would be getting a good product and in the time it was promised. They did exactly what I thought they would do and am extremely pleased with their services. Definitely recommend this company for anything they have to offer.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and she really enjoys it! It&#x27;s small and compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my flat iron.  My expectations were that and more.</li>
    <li> It works! Love the package.</li>
    <li> I was concerned with having thick wavy hair that I would need a larger iron...  this one works great and having never done it before was able to straighten my hair without any burning of my skin or hair... great deal and great iron... I love it!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy, long hair, and straightening just my bangs has previously been a challenge.  This iron works really well, very similar quality as my Chi flat iron, but bonus...it&#x27;s dual voltage and can go overseas!!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it takes a while to cool down.  This wasn&#x27;t a major issue for me, but for someone who has to do her hair and quickly pack and leave, it might be an issue.  The heat resistant bag was nice and may help if that situation applies to you.  I actually kept the box for the iron as well, as it is quite sturdy and made the trip back and forth to China without crumbling in my packed luggage.  Overall, if I didn&#x27;t already own a Chi, I would have no reason to buy a Chi...the HSI is great and less expensive!</li>
    <li> I think that this is a great Hair Straightener.  I am glad I picked this particular one.  It does a wonderful job and leaves my hair nice and shiny.  I would highly recommend the HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener.</li>
    <li> Works great, I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of them for my daughters, They are a great gift and a great straightener. I plan on buying my self one soon. The best part was I ordered them on short notice and they showed up to my house within 2 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m black so I have super thick kinky hair and it&#x27;s really hard to find flatirons that will completely straiten my hair but these... OMG..! Perfect. I just wish they had an auto shut off. I keep leaving them on.</li>
    <li> Wife bought this to use in Italy since our old flat iron broke.  It works great and she loves it.</li>
    <li> My package came immediately! It was great, the product worked perfectly when I tested it and not a single piece was missing. Overall 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron. I like that I can set the temp. My daughter has thin fine hair and doesn&#x27;t need as high a temp as I do, with much thicker hair. Also very quick heat up. Love the travel sleeve, comes in handy when I need to throw iron in travel bag right after finishing hair.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is great...I&#x27;ve had quite a few over the years and paid way more money, this is one of the best i&#x27;ve ever purchased, at a much more reasonable price.  Shipping was super quick, I highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! So happy, my hair got straightened so quickly, which is rare because I have really thick curly hair. There was almost no waiting time for the ceramics to heat up and it straightened my hair so much better than my old straightener.</li>
    <li> Goes beyond expectations! Keeps hair straight longer than my Chi. I loved this product so much I bought two, one for me and the other for my mother. Thanks HSI for the amazing product!</li>
    <li> Great value for a straightener that works just as well as a more expensive one. Shipped out fast and came with all the accessories (oil, glove, and case).</li>
    <li> I am a flat iron enthusiast and this flat iron I guess for the price is ok. It pulls your hair and that is the worst. I have thick curly hair and this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The straightener gets hot fast, but it doesn&#x27;t work well with de-frizzing hair. Overall, a good product but there are definitely better out there! But good bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> As long as I have it on the highest setting it works good on my hair.  I have wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to others (hence 4 stars due to my ignorance) but it heats up fast and straightens my hair in around 5-10 min, and I have very thick wavy hair. Never snags. Plus the discount is major. I like the safety settings and the bag it comes with so it&#x27;s portable.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because of the high ratings, but I was very disappointed the first time I used it and discovered a huge design flaw. The ceramic plates have hard plastic corner pieces that rip out your hair as you pull it through. Not a fan!  I had to have my husband take a utility knife to cut the edge pieces off. That seems to be a fix and he still has all his fingers. Hopefully this will permanently fix the issue.</li>
    <li> It worked like a dream for about 9 months, but then it just stopped working one day. I probably had it up too high for too long and overworked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly/frizzy hair, and it did wonders. I recommend this product, just be careful with the settings.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter uses this and loves it, works well and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my chi iron but still gets the job done, and for much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Finally, a straightening iron that doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair.  The heat is adequate but the knob to adjust the temperature is rather hard to get to and is small and difficult to turn.  It&#x27;s scary-close to the hot part of the iron.  If you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price. The green light when ready is a nice feature. Works as well as the Chi, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It&#x27;s so easy to use. Heats up quickly. I also bought a bottle of the argan oil. It leaves hair so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> didnt work on my coarse frizzy hair.  did not work as depicted online.  ordered the CHI  after returning this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried other straightners bu this one works and keeps your hair shiny and straight all day!! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have coarse curly hair so it is hard to find straighteners that actually work on it. The straightener worked awesome. I put it on the high setting for my hair and it was great. It comes with a great little storage bag. Very pleased with the straightner.</li>
    <li> Great hair tool! Smoothes and straightens my hair very quickly, would definitely recommend this product. Very high quality and the lower price makes it a very good deal for a quality hair tool!</li>
    <li> Fantastic results; I am very happy with this product!  Arrived early!</li>
    <li> After doing a lot of research, I decided to purchase the HSI 1\\&quot; ceramic flat iron. What a great decision! I absolutely love it!!! First off, although it gets super hot, it doesn&#x27;t feel (or smell) like it&#x27;s frying my hair. It glides very, very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t catch my hair anywhere, even if I have a big section of hair clamped in it. I have wavy to curly hair, and this flat iron really does the trick with one pass. I&#x27;ve used the Chi in the past, but the HSI is a far better product all around. Another feature I like is the rounded edges as this allows you to use the flat iron for curling hair as well! This specific seller (not sure if all sellers do this) included a free bottle of the Argain Oil hair treatment which conditions and shines the hair. You only need a little bit of the product, so 5 ml should last a while. I put this on my hair when it was dry - really smoothed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, I highly recommend this product! Definitely the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing!! The best I&#x27;ve owned in fact, better then my CHi, my Kpak reconstructor, my Paul Mitchell and my FHI. It leaves my hair with a silky, smooth finish that my other irons have not even come close to. Truly impressive, feels and looks like a healthy, soft new head of hair, my stylist doesn&#x27;t even come close to the finished look that this gives. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever purchased! I was concerned but it was less expensive then the last one I purchased, but it is much better than the last one! The first time I used it, I curled my hair. The curls were bouncy and lasted all day! The next time, I straightened it. I have long and thick hair and it took half the amount of time it usually takes me! It glides over my hair and leaves my hair looking gorgeous! I highly recommend this product! You will not regret purchasing this straightener. This is a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Good product and yes I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is alright. I cannot rave about it and can&#x27;t particularly hate it. Personally, I think it is very heavy and so it fatigues your arm especially if you have very thick, wavy/curly hair like mine. Even though its ceramic, and that is supposed to leave your hair nice and shiny and frizz free, I found that with my hair, it dries it out and have tons of frizz. I think this flat iron is great for those with thinner hair and more straight hair, but not very thick.</li>
    <li> I got my new straightener and we love it.  My daughter uses it as well, and it works great.  It makes my hair shiny!!!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several different straighteners for my daughters over the years. Some that were cheap and didn&#x27;t work very well, and others that were very expensive and worked great. This one, the HSI Professional, is a great straightener at a great price. My daughters and I are very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down BEST flat iron on the market. My hair can get all sorts of crazy but this iron left it completely soft, frizz free and best of all straight. Went out last night and my hair is STILL beautiful!  Buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. She said it straightens her hair 5xs faster then her old one .</li>
    <li> Iron quit working after 6 months! I rarely used it and it won&#x27;t heat up anymore. I tried everything, reset, different electric outlets, etc, but it is dead!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great - it&#x27;s high quality, heats up quickly, and works as well, if not better, than CHI.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s still going strong!  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a salon quality straightener without the high cost.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter.  Awesome little iron for this price.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it when we got it.  Great deal .</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Nothing extraordinary.  Works fine.  Have not had for very long but quality seems good.  Makes curly hair srtaight</li>
    <li> This is a nice iron for the price. I have very very thick hair that is naturally wavy/curly so straightening my hair is not an easy feat. This item does a nice job of it. Having the glove included is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I have only owned a non-professional straightener for many years. I can&#x27;t believe the difference this one makes. Like the rounded off sides too...makes short work and does a beautiful job...hope it lasts me a long long time.</li>
    <li> I wanted a user friendly straightener due to never using one before and because I&#x27;m pretty clumsy. :) My hair is already pretty straight, just some waves. I really wanted it to manage my bangs which tend to have a mind of their own.  This does the job beautifully.  I can straighten them flat or put a little bounce in them. It heats up quickly and I only turn up the heat to about halfway and it works great. I haven&#x27;t burnt myself and haven&#x27;t even used the glove yet.  People that know me would be impressed by that... I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be glad I have it when I start getting creative with some new styling. The price was right too!  Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Ok so I have been searching for a good iron for a while! I have a 40$ beauty supply iron that just does not do the job! Well I googled best iron brands and hsi is in the top 10 so seeing them online here I was shocked! I placed the order thinking how can I lose! HAPPY is all I can say! This iron does the job. My hair is not permed and heavy heat is required! Hands down it will get any hair straight! My results were so good my aunt and cousin bought the irons within a week of seeing the results! I highly recommend! My only let down was thinking I would get a sample of the Argan oil but what was in the box was a sugar pkt size sample not enough for your bangs! That sucks because it wasn&#x27;t enough to know if I&#x27;d like the product to buy more!</li>
    <li> bought this once before..loved it, tried others without the same quality even though they clamed it was a great product..after buying 2 other brands ..bought this one for a 2nd time. price is great..</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up quickly, is easy to use, feels sturdy in one&#x27;s hands and doesn&#x27;t tangle due to a rotating electrical connection. Thus far, about two weeks in, I am fully satisfied with this purchase. I&#x27;d recommend this product to friends and family, as well as the Amazon community.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is amazing!  I cannot believe I got it at such a great price.  It gets super hot, super quick. Will use this brand in the future!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok...The flat irons straighten my hair but not my daughter hair, she has thicker hair then mines and it didn&#x27;t do a good job on her hair.  And the side of the flat irons are scrapping off already and I only used them a few times.</li>
    <li> nice product.  easy to use and not too heavy.  I like the indicator lite on the handle - changes from red to green.  heats up quickly - nice storage bag also</li>
    <li> My package came on the date it was due, all in one piece, and it works great! I&#x27;m a very happy woman! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this HSI hair straightener because of the low price and the great reviews. I was needing a replacement for my old hair straightener, an FHI, that had begun to short out after about 6 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this new straightener, the first thing I noticed is that the wall plug was the safer, larger kind you find on a hair dryer, versus a regular plug that was on my old straightener. I was also pleased to see that this straightener came with a free bottle of Argain oil and a travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first use, I noticed a big difference between this HSI straightener and my old FHI. After straightening, my hair was smoother. The updated tourmaline-ionic technology is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this straightener to anyone, regardless of their hair type. I have wavy-to-straight hair that requires smoothing of the lumps, bumps and frizz, especially in the back of my hair. I also live in humid Florida, where a straightener is a Godsend.</li>
    <li> This straightener isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s hyped up to be, it isn&#x27;t better than my chi straightener.  and it CERTAINLY isn&#x27;t a $200 straightener. I bought it when it was on sale for $60 luckily. But, is it better than a drug store straightener? probably.   I returned this straightener for 2 main reasons: the first one is that I did notice some pulling when I ran the flat iron down my hair while straightening. With my chi it is perfectly smooth, there is no pulling AT ALL  The 2nd reason is that the plates don&#x27;t evenly distribute heat because when the iron is clamped down the plates do not touch eachother uniformly. When I would clamp this straightener the bottom of the plates would be touching, but there would be a small gap between the top half of the plates.  This makes for uneven heat on your hair.  Again, with my chi this issue is non existent.   This straightener is ok, but there is better quality available out there.</li>
    <li> Not a professional feel or heat up. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend as a must use product. I&#x27;ve used cheaper flat irons that were much more smooth. Advertised regular price is way over for the quality received.</li>
    <li> My rating for this flat iron is four stars because it met all of my expectations accept for the smell when you first heat it up.</li>
    <li> Got this for a Christmas gift for a friend &amp; she loved it. We tried it out for the first time together before going out one night &amp; it works great for a great price.</li>
    <li> Awesome iron . Awesome price. Very happy with my purchase !</li>
    <li> It works well. Leaves my curley hair straight and manageable</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait to submit a review until I had used the product a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to buy a Chi iron but this product is a good substitute.&lt;br /&gt;It gets very hot so you have to watch the settings as to not destroy your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It tends to leave my hair dry but I think it&#x27;s because I use to high of a setting.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend if you are looking.</li>
    <li> Very nicely package but the buttons on the iron leave a lot to be desire.  Doesn&#x27;t look like it will last, the dials look like they are ready to fall off, flimsy for such a product</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;d written a review before stating the iron died after just a few days. The seller was kind enough to contact me to send me a new one and it works spectacularly. Love it!</li>
    <li> Thought the flat iron would work a little better, but maybe it&#x27;s the humididty these days.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron and reasonably priced. I use flat iron sparingly but the cheap ones I was buying were really drying my strands. I bought this after extensive research and I definitely do not regret it. Works great at straightening by coarse textlaxed hair. As a heat protector I use coconut oil or Chi infusion and my hair looked shiny and slinky without heat damage. Love it and I know it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> magical- gives me supermodel hair!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  It leaves the hair super straight and shiny.  I also love the fact that the company is selling this old model for way less its original price, plus the amazing argan oil that comes in the box.</li>
    <li> Mty hair will get curley again at mid-day, but I like the idea with glove so I won&#x27;t burn my hand</li>
    <li> This is the second HSI flat iron I have purchased. I had owned the last one for over four years, and still worked just great. I had to replace it because my cat pulled it off the countertop and broke one of the plates. I used it this way for a month or so, before I finally broke down and purchased this one as a replacement.</li>
    <li> Works awesome!  Just a little on the heavy side</li>
    <li> Loved this gift. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I got this as a early Christmas present from my Boyfriend and let me tell you its AMAZING! He purchased it a week early because he thought it would take a wial to get here but it came so fast! :} I use this straightener every other day and its always leaves my hair shiny and silky ALL DAY LONG. I use the Brazilian Keratin therapy flat iron spray before I straighten and it helps a great deal also.   I have the Fluffy, Body envy, wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t like to stay straight all day and ends up waving up as soon as I exit my house, but this straightener keeps it pin straight. It also heats up sooo fast. Usually with my old straighteners, after parting my hair in sections I would still have to wait until the plate heated FULLY! but as soon as I plug this beauty in, its done BEFORE I&#x27;m done parting my hair. It usually took me a hour 2 get All of my hair straight but now it only takes me 20 mins.   The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that because the plates get so hot I have to ALWAYS use the glove. It also has a habit of taking its time cooling down after u use it and it takes some time waiting for the stubborn Lady to settle before storing.But I rather have a straightener hot and kicking rather then one that&#x27;s warm and stinking! lol Corney I know.  What I also like about this straightener too is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the smell of burnt hair behind. Even using good-smelling heat spray, my other professional straighteners always left that horrible smell behind, and this doesn&#x27;t. Whatever good-smelling spray I put in my hair before straightening its stays that smell, I even tend to lightly spray my hair with some amazing perfume after straightening as well, to give it that long-lasting sweetness all day long!   My hair also tends to get greasy quicker right after straightening, but with this straightener I feel like I just came back from the salon all clean and fresh and it stays that way all day.  My hair is sooo much healthier after I got this straightener, I haven&#x27;t seen onesplit end or dry frizzy strand since I switched.I would DEFINITELY recommend buying this straightener if you have had the same problems I had for YEARS but all is solved because the HSI has saved my hair, and will save it for more years to come :} &lt;333</li>
    <li> Best straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot! Once I&#x27;m done straightening my hair, it stays that way until I wash it again. Usually I have to restraighten periodically. Not with this one!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  I bought this for the primary purpose of international travel because I&#x27;ve ruined my last flat iron using it in Europe (it did not have alternative voltage options). I&#x27;ve taken this iron both within the U.S. and internationally and it has worked very well.  It heats up quickly and to the temperature needed. It heats nicely to a high temp. I have thick, long hair and it straightens and curls when needed.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a international option and even for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great, and heats up fast</li>
    <li> Great product for the price (under $40).&lt;br /&gt;Pros: heats quickly, runs smoothly through hair, long cord that swivels, nice grip, sleek design, heats as high at 400 degrees&lt;br /&gt;Cons: does not automatically shut off; no temperature read-out so you&#x27;re unsure what number you&#x27;re set at</li>
    <li> Well to be clear, &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; is a word I reserve for circumstances beyond anything a flat iron could ever deliver.&lt;br /&gt;But that being said, I&#x27;ve found nothing lacking in my experience either with the seller, or with the product.&lt;br /&gt;The transaction was smooth, shipping was quick, price was excellent, and the flat iron is exactly what I was looking for.  I love the adjustable temp knob.  I&#x27;m unsure if it will automatically shut off or not, so I just try to remember to switch it off when I&#x27;m finished using it.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Feels a little cheap but does the job.</li>
    <li> A gift from my hubby. I love it!!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the edge seemed a little rough and my hair seemed to snag on it every now and then. But,other than that an awesome straightener for a fabulous price!!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron definately straightened my hair quickly so that is a plus. But, it did leave my hair with split ends after a few days of using it. It did make my hair a little frizy but over all it is a good straightner for the money. I will try turning the heat down to see if that helps with the frizziness. OVER ALL, IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Wife LOVES this flat iron. Gets hair nice and straight and shiny. Hairs stays straight and shiny for days.</li>
    <li> Was pretty disappointed, thought it would be great was wrong I have really think hair and a lot of it and I felt like it left my hair dry frizzy and thick, maybe it&#x27;s meant for people with thin hair or not so much hair, but I like my hair straight straight not wavy straight, if you have thick hair DONT buy</li>
    <li> Better than my Chi.  The enclosed glove was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to use it during a trip to Europe and it turned out to be such a great product that I got rid of my old 110v flat iron.  It worked perfectly in Europe (220v), heated well and fast.  No need to switch voltages, it automatically adjusts (actually, it has no switch button).  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; my hair. Leaves it soft and shinny.  The travel bag is a great addition.  Has a long power cord which is very convenient when travelling as many hotels don&#x27;t have an outlet near a mirror or in the bathroom.  Can&#x27;t comment on the Argan Oil as I have not used it.  Great product for a fantastic price!  Highly reccommend it if you travel to countries with 220v. No need to have a 220v and a 110v, this one can do both!  Of course, you do need an adaptor to connect it since international electrical outlets are different to the US&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I like the straightener. not thrilled that the temp isn&#x27;t digital like all the new straighteners but it does the job and heats well.</li>
    <li> It worked like a charm, great product at a great price.  Heats up quickly, does a good job of not pulling hair out.</li>
    <li> this is the best hot iron i have ever used it  heats up fast and makes my hair very smooth and straight</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the HSI Professional flat iron.  It works as well as higher price flat irons.  I have been very pleased and would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I only used this twice.  The third time I tried to use it I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on.  The two times I did use it I didn&#x27;t think it go hot enough to straighten my hair.  Only bright side is I&#x27;m using the pouch that came with it to store the other straightener I had to buy to replace this one.  The pouch works well so far.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron.  It is the perfect size and is a great straightener or curler.  Heats up fast and the glove that came with it is the perfect extra accessory.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the Chi iron.  This one doesn&#x27;t get as hot and feels a little rough on my hair.</li>
    <li> I had no idea how much I would love this. I was using a curling iron, magnetic curlers and even hot curlers before I purchased the flat iron,now I only use the flat iron, it smoothes my hair so nicely that I am getting compliments &amp;#34; look great 10 years younger&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Had such high ratings I had high hopes but so disappointed.  The edges snag my hair and pull it out, not good.  After I read more reviews I saw a number of others with the same issue.  I am returning.</li>
    <li> Got my item fast and it was exactly as described. I would hightly remmend this seller; ships fast, has great products, and great prices!</li>
    <li> I wrote a review on this once  already.... but it does not show up when I look through the reviews?? Maybe the reason for mostly 4 and  5 star reviews on this product.&lt;br /&gt;This item came ..... was a cmas gift . one very disappointed daughter when she tried to use it and it did not turn on at all . switch to turn it on very flimsy as well . I believe this is a scam ..... not a quality product ... BEWARE</li>
    <li> Well I was wondering in purchasing a straighter for my wife and I reviewed many because I didn&#x27;t want to make a mistake, I came upon the HSI ceramic hair straighter in amazon. I read the reviews and only saw good ones, there were a couple a bad ones, but decided to get it.  When I got the product it feels expensive heavy and has a tough durable look to it. My wife loved it. If you guys wanna score high points with the GF or wifey this is a good one at least to get home at 3am excuse no questions asked. Well maybe after the usual let me smell if you have girl perfume. BUT great product.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a while now and I totally love it. It heats up pretty quickly to the desired temperature and settings are pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a burning smell.</li>
    <li> After researching for for a new flat iron straightner. I saw the HSI professional the one I was searching for! I immediately ordered one for a gift for my niece. she loved every aspect . She could curl her hair. It just glides thru your hair. I have since ordered 3 more for myself, family and friends. It arrived earlier than expected always a plus😍😊😀👍👍</li>
    <li> Bought this flat iron to take on my trip to Italy.  I  used it when I received it in the mail and it worked good.  Hope it works during my trip.</li>
    <li> I am going to start out by saying I am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews posted on here. I received the HSI straightener before the date estimated and instantly used it. I straightened my hair first because my hair was wavy and my hair came out nice and straight with a great shine to it. I curled it later that day for class and the curls were BEAUTIFUL! I prefer the curls that look messy and tussled which is the kind of curls this straightener gives. I loved this product very much and it makes me regret buying the &#x27;HerStyler&#x27; ones you get in the mall for 150+ It also came with a nice burgundy sleeve to keep it in when you travel. I also like that there is a heat setting because my last one didn&#x27;t have one and was always so hot and fried my hair. With this straightener I can control the heat to my hair type. I would definitely recommend this straightener to anybody looking for a durable straightener that can straighten and curl!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister- her Chi had burned out and she needed a new straightener. I wanted to try a new brand since- in my opinion- Chi is overrated and overpriced. The HSI had fantastic reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. She LOVES it!! She started getting compliments on her hair after the first use. Thanks to HSI I look like a hero, and I didn&#x27;t have to break the bank!</li>
    <li> There were no surprises. I wanted a high end flat iron for a great price, and that&#x27;s what I got. I love the high heat setting and the even way it grips my hair. The product arrived promptly without any issues, unlike many other Amazon third party seller purchases of late. Five stars all around.</li>
    <li> I used to have a chi, but like a lot of other people who have one, the cord started shorting out and it would turn on and off while plugged in, eventually just quit working ;(. Then, I got taken by those guys at the kiosk, and bought an Amika flat iron - what a mistake! It didn&#x27;t get very hot and took forever to straighten my hair. Though i loved my chi, I was reluctant to go back to buying another because it burned out on me just after one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking around Amazon searching for other irons, I came across the HSI and saw that it got rave reviews...and for the price, it made it seem like a steal. I decided to get one and so glad I did. It heats up fast, works very similar to my chi, if not better, and i especially like the soft grip feel it has on the outside. I did notice the first few times using it, my hair had a faint burnt smell to it, but after many more uses, that smell doesn&#x27;t appear anymore. Must have been because it was brand new or something, not sure. I would definitely recommend this flat iron because it works great and is worth every penny. Leaves my hair straight all day and makes it feel sleek and look shiny.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!! Would suggest to anyone!</li>
    <li> Hated it from day 1...... Pulled my hair out and made it frizzy.</li>
    <li> This iron is well worth it&#x27;s price! I have been using a CHI iron for over 10 years and this iron exceeds my old CHI! My hair is softer and shinier after using it compared to my CHI. And I loooove their argan oil!!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift and decided to try it as an alternative to the Chi... my sister loves it!</li>
    <li> This is a great straightner, it seems to reduce frizz and makes my hair more shiny.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is trying to take mine away.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product. After i got back from the post office I opened the package immidiately. It seemed okay to me, the oil was just a little puch, the flat iron felt very heavy. I plugged it in, it did heat up very fast. I tested it out on a strand of hair at the bottom of my hair and as soon as i passed it over my hair, it pulled it and it hurts. I have pretty much straight hair but it&#x27;s frizzy so i sometimes straighten it. I&#x27;ve had the same flat iron for nearly four years and it works better than this product. It&#x27;s cheap, so there is no quality to it. I&#x27;m gonna be asking my hair dresser to get me a Chi. I rather pay the full amount for something that does the job right.</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose. Quick and Easy to use. No issue. I wish it could handle both 110 and 220 V</li>
    <li> This is a really nice ceramic straightener (flat iron). It was the best price I found and the quality seems to be very good. It heats up super fast and is ready to go when I am. The plates are \\&quot;floating\\&quot; and easy to wipe clean. I haven&#x27;t used a flat iron on my hair before, but I now prefer it over anything. After watching a 4 minute instructional Youtube presentation, I was good to go. It&#x27;s easy to handle and it does a beautiful job, leaving my hair shiny and healthy looking. I found the little bottle of serum that comes with the iron actually goes a long way. I also use a little bit of natural emu oil on my hair (run a dime size amount in the palms and smooth into wet hair). This also helps to protect my hair from damage. I don&#x27;t always wash my hair every day, so on the second day I just quickly do the tops and my hair is shiny, smooth and beautiful. It is quick and easy. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love my HSI Flat Iron. I have curly thick hair and always spend a longtime to get it nice and straight without the dried out look. I had a Chi before the HSI, and the HSI works 100 times better than the Chi!! My Hair is always smooth and Silky when I&#x27;m finished using! Not only does the HSI make my hair look and feel great it came with a travel case and a heat glove so I wont burn my hand! I love this and anyone looking to spend less money for a good product this is the one!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well. I am African American and I have very course hair, but this really straightens and softens it. It can get very hot, up to 400 degrees. Most of the time I keep it on 200 to 300 degrees.   After washing and blow drying my hair, I use this and it gives me a nice look. I also use it to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Before this, I had a $20 straightener from Target.  So, this has definitely been a step up.   It heats up quickly and leaves my hair smooth.  (I have thick hair that is naturally just wavy enough to look terrible if not styled.)  Before purchasing it, I borrowed my sister&#x27;s Chi - for which she paid $75 at Costco - for a week.  I think that this HSI works almost as well, if not as well as her Chi.  I still have to straighten my hair in layers and sometimes run it over a piece more than once.      I did like that the Chi had an automatic shut off (even my cheap one from Target had that feature) and a felt heat protection on the outside of the unit where it heats up.  With this HSI, you definitely don&#x27;t want to touch the outside on the heating unit when it is on.  I do love the velvet bag it comes with as it allows me to put it away or pack it even when it&#x27;s still hot.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase but not wowed with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with my experience in buying this straightener.  My purchase arrived promptly, was as the buyer said it would be (brand new with a free sample), and most importantly it is a great product. I have used the straightener numerous times already in the week or so that I have had it and am impressed by the quality each and every time.  I have pretty curly hair and this particular straightener has absolutely no problem straightening it and making it feel extremely soft.  The Argain Oil is amazing as well, and really helps to lock in moisture and keep your ends from looking dry and brittle.  I would recommend the straightener,oil, and buyer to anybody!</li>
    <li> I love yhis flat iron, it works perfect for my thick hair.[[ASIN:B004VWCEDE HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE HEAT CASE &amp; GLOVE. DUAL VOLTAGE 110/220 IDEAL FOR TRAVEL]]</li>
    <li> I bought this iron holder for my wife to hold her $200 flat iron and boy she couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great service and a very fast shipping, no brainer&#x27;s choice!</li>
    <li> Works as described. The oil sample is wonderful! Thank you</li>
    <li> order two of them , why, because after being a great item, the brand is another.  love the price.  wonderful thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> This straightener is wonderful! It really does straighten fast and it gets my curly hair smooth. It doesn&#x27;t tug and pull my hair like others and was super affordable!!!</li>
    <li> I like the iron. I needed one right away because my other one broke. But this one leaves my hair a little dry.</li>
    <li> My old iron died, so quickly got on Amazon.  Read the reviews on many irons.  HSI had great ratings.  I have very frizzy hair.  The flat iron came with bag, glove, and argan oil.  My hair is now smooth and shinny.  Definitely recommend this iron/oil combo.</li>
    <li> My stylist wanted me to spend $150 on an iron, but this was excactly what I needed at a third of the price.  Works perfect! Fast delivery and great packaging.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this straightner. I have used a Chi turbo for the last 8 years and never thought I would use any brand but Chi. I took a gamble on this one because mine finally broke and I needed a new one. All of the reviews have been positive, and for the price, figured why not. I would recommend for anyone. It heats up very fast, the swivel cord makes for easy curling of the hair, plus the longer cord gives more flexibility. Shipping was extra fast as well. My hair is blonde (dyed blonde) very fine and thin if this helps as well. It does not leave any creases, very smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and amazing product, esp for the price!</li>
    <li> Hi guys! I purchased this product for my wife recently. She absolutely loves it!!! Guy&#x27;s. You cannot go wrong with this. My wife is very picky about her hair products. This is an awesome product! I am very happy &amp; not affiliated with anyone working for this company that&#x27;s for sure.. :]</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron</li>
    <li> I do not think this item works properly - it must be defective.  My old flat iron (Remington) would straighten my hair on 390 degrees and this flat iron doesn&#x27;t even take the bend out of my hair on it&#x27;s highest setting. Luckily I kept the box and am returning it today.</li>
    <li> This is a very average straightener. I have thick hair and I have to run it through a strand 3-4 times to make it straight, causing more damage. With a chi I only need to run it through once or twice. It&#x27;s not bad for the price but I would rather pay more for a Chi and not damage my hair.</li>
    <li> I think that this iron is better than the 3 chi flat irons I have owned.  I have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have bought many flat irons over the past years.  I have wavy hair that is very stuborn and does not stay straight in humidity.  I bought this when my other expensive flat iron gave out on me. It came packaged great, with the bio silk-which I love.  I also like the sily travel pouch it comes with, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being damaged when I travel.  It&#x27;s easy to use-the perfect width and keeps my hair straight all day.   I had never heard of this brand so I was a little nervous, but the straightener exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend to anyone.  Great product.</li>
    <li> So far, so good with this ceramic.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair straightener - just what I needed to tame my thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> This iron does a pretty good job... have to make a few passes but evenutally it does the job and it does last.</li>
    <li> First time buyer I have used a curling iron as long as I can remember. But this straightener is wonderful- I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very poorly made.  Stands of my hair are constantly getting caught in between the plate edges and pulled out, no matter how I hold it or how small the size of the hair sections I&#x27;m trying to flat iron. Extremely disappointed. Huge waste of $60.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had Chi&#x27;s in the past. They were very expensive, but years ago, when they first came out, Chi was the Gold Standard. Fast forward several years and I&#x27;m thinking that the competition has had time to catch up. With the economy so bad, I decided to give this a try because it was considerably less expensive than the Chi. The reviews on Amazon were also so overwhelmingly positive, specifically in comparison to the Chi.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this about 2 weeks. So far, I love it. This works even better than my old Chi. Another thing I like about it is I don&#x27;t have to keep it on the highest setting and it works just fine. The lower heat has to be mean less damage to my hair. Some other reviewers say their product stopped working after about 3 months, so I&#x27;m still crossing my fingers. This also comes with an attractive case and a glove to avoid burns. Chi had no case or glove, so this was a pleasant surprise. It does require some maneuvering to slip it back into the case.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my (dead) CHI...so I tried the far less expensive HSI...I am pleasantly surprised by how well it straightens my hair.  Granted, my hair is not curly nor thick.  I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d fair the same satisfaction if your hair isn&#x27;t thin and straight...</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron. i was looking around for a CHI, but i saw too many imitations and bad reviews, so when i stumbled on this one and saw all the fantastic reviews i thought i would give it a shot. It showed up at my door 5 mins. ago and i tried it out right away. I have never been SO excited about a flat iron in my life. My hair is big, thick, half-wavy, half-curly, and a pain in the butt to straighten. I normally have to go over each 1 inch piece of hair at least 3 times to get it to be flat, and when i used the HSI today, it went over once and made my hair so flat and so incredibly shiny and healthy looking. I did not use any product, the flat iron did it on its on. Don&#x27;t buy anything else, for 50 bucks, its the best purchase i ever made on amazon.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It gets my hair bone straight!!!</li>
    <li> The plates pull my hair. It&#x27;s just okay! A good price on the flat iron, just not professional grade.</li>
    <li> works great! Heats up quickly and is smooth enough to let me curl my hair with the flat iron!</li>
    <li> This iron gets hot and stays hot.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice iron for the price.  It takes some adjusting to get the correct temp, but once you find it, no problems.  It does sometimes snag a hair or 2, but otherwise very good.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron is the best.  I have tried 3 or 4 of them and none come close to this one.  The heat and action is perfect.  It gets the job done without any issues.  Perfect score!</li>
    <li> Based on the amount of good reviews, I&#x27;m surprised this product didn&#x27;t work.  Other customers mentioned the light goes from red to green when ready. Mine went to orange and never to green.  Didn&#x27;t get hot at all.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair irons on the market -- and at a reasonable price!  My hair dresser told me about it.  I have purchased two so that I am never without it as it is an essential for me!</li>
    <li> Works great! I have long, super curly hair. I blow dry my hair with a round brush, then use this to smoothe/straighten. Haven&#x27;t tried it with my hair when its dry and already curly. But for what I needed, it works like a dream. I go from wet curly hair right out of the shower to sleek straight hair in less than 30 minutes. Great professional straightener for a really good price.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t snag. Think it could straighten a bit better. Love the swivel chord&lt;br /&gt;Wish it turned off automatically.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my girlfriend! Good price and quality. The product arrived in the stipulated time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron out there for an amazing price. It makes my hair silky and straight and you can softly curl the ends with it too if you want. Doesn&#x27;t over stress the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull! Highly recommended and seller was prompt and attentive.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener without ever hearing of this brand and just by reading others reviews. Luckily for me this turned out to be an awesome product. I have naturally curly hair and it&#x27;s very fragile from coloring and straightening it. This straightener worked on my hair in just 1 or 2 passes and it makes it so shiny. It heats up quickly and makes my busy mornings much easier because I don&#x27;t have to take as long doing my hair. Fabulous straightener!</li>
    <li> This is honestly a fantastic straightener! Shipping was very quick, and I was excited to use it the moment it was delivered to my front door.    The box was lovely; inside was the straightener in a red satin adorable case, a heat protectant glove, and a tiny bottle of argan oil. No bio silk sample, as said in many other reviews.     I had upgraded from the $19 one I purchased at walmart... and looking on Amazon, it was between this and a Chi. I&#x27;ve used a friend&#x27;s chi, worked well, but very hot. Other reviews said their&#x27;s did not last very long. I thought about it, and finally decided on the HSI. Very happy I chose this! Excellent heat, not completely frying my hair, and my naturally wavy hair is perfectly straightened, and smooth and shiny afterwards.     The drawback is that it does not glide through the hair as smoothly as the Chi, but that could be just me.     I would recommend this to a friend. Great price, works amazingly. Love it!</li>
    <li> Needed a new hair straightener after my Chi died. I am extremely happy I am with this purchase! Especially with the great value I got it at $40! Works better than my Chi did!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron as a backup for guests, but I like it so much it has replaced my regular one.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron.</li>
    <li> Quality product, I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant getting this product because I hadn&#x27;t heard of the brand before. I bought it in confidence that the other reviews I read were true...and they were! I love that this flat iron has adjustable heat settings. I have thick, Asian hair and it works wonderfully on it. You get that salon finish after each use. The red fabric case that it comes in is also very useful for travel. All in all, I am really happy with the product and the seller shipped it to me in record time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Got this for a great price and it works well. I wish the temperature setting had more numbers on it but I like everything else. It came with a heat protectant glove and argan oil. Happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> as a hairstylist, I know the good brands of irons. This one is a steal at the price, cheaper then we can even get it at the supply store. Great Flat iron! easy company to work with.</li>
    <li> Works great. Exactly as described. I got it for my daughter who has very thick, curly hair and it has cut the time in half to straighten her hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter was skeptical that this reasonably priced straightener would work well on her long, medium thickness hair. She uses it to straighten and make waves in her hair and is always pleased with the results.   We like it so much we are considering ordering another so we don&#x27;t have to share.</li>
    <li> so far I must say I am well pleased, great product and easy to use:-). Might get one for my sis for Christmas</li>
    <li> My wife loves her new straightener.  It is very good quality and the delivery process was quick and easy.</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic. I was a little nervous when I ordered this because I had never heard of this brand before. All of the great ratings is what made my decision. I am so glad I went with this choice. I have had my Chi for 5 years. It still is working but I could tell it wasn&#x27;t having that \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; it used to have. While searching for my next one I came across this one and was shocked by the low low price! With 500 5 star ratings I had to give it a shot! I have had it now for 2 weeks and love it! It literally takes 30 seconds to get ready for use! It is so quick! It leaves my hair so soft and silky! The only thing that they could add to make this the best out there is add a setting to where the hot iron would cut off after so long...just in case some one was to forget to turn it off! :)</li>
    <li> Quit working after 9 months. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron. Heats quickly, heat settings are very adjustable. Works well on my coarse, curly hair. Bought mainly to use overseas since it has a built-in converter. Will report again after trip.</li>
    <li> A lot of the reviews that I&#x27;ve read are from people that had Chi&#x27;s and then tried this product.  I on the other hand, I have never had an expensive flat iron.  I&#x27;ve been using a cheap revlon flat iron that I had to run thru my wavy, frizzy hair four or five times just to get relatively straight hair...that rarely stayed straight...so I went on amazon and found this little gem.  I wanted a great iron but didn&#x27;t want to pay big bucks for it.  This thing is amazing.  When it first arrived, I tried it out without any of the products I normally have to use...and my hair was silky, shiny, and very straight!!! This iron will not disappoint!! Would recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> Super happy with this flat iron, I bought it to replace a Paul Brown flat iron and I&#x27;m super happy I switched! It leaves my hair extremely smooth and shiny without damaging it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this straightener, especially to anyone with very thick, wavy hair. I decided to start growing my hair out again (currently it&#x27;s about collarbone length), and I&#x27;d been using a crappy $20 straightener after my Sedu broke. My old straightener snagged my hair a TON, took a looong time, and wasn&#x27;t going to cut it for longer hair. The HSI works great! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s as great as my sedu was, so I gave it 4/5 stars purely for not being the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used, but I like it a lot, and I think the price it right!</li>
    <li> Compared to other flat irons that I have used, this is best in quality and value. I ordered this product because the flat iron i had dries and fizzles my hair. This product delivers professional results. I use it once a week and my hair is soft and shiny throughout the week. I save a lot of money because i am able to get professional results using the psi flat iron. My old flat iron ended up in the trash after one use of the psi. I definitely recommend this to all looking for a great product. I have no complaints. A completely satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> very happy with it so far - have used it once but no pulling on hair and my hair is beautiful</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for a month now and I love it! Great product! I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I just have to say that if you are looking for a straightener for your hair, this is the one to get. No joke! My hair was horrible, frizzy, and totally out of control. (I feel like I&#x27;m doing a commercial). After I used the straightener my hair was soft, sleek, and I actually looked like I had hair on my head and not a head full of disgrace. Seriously, I am so glad I read up on this product and bought it. Thanks a million... b/c my hair means EVERTHING to me.</li>
    <li> I have uses many high end flat irons, this one is the best yet!!  Does not feel cheap very good quality!  Makes my hair very smooth and straight . Will never buy another Chi again. Thanks HSI and Blue Novelties for great service.</li>
    <li> This was for my wife... She loves it. Good price, good quality.</li>
    <li> I Love Love this Iron!! I am Natural and have been all my life!! I get so many compliments on my hair!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and have used a lot of brands. It catches and pulls a few hairs if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I like it for the price.</li>
    <li> I love it... No complaints!</li>
    <li> I have fine to damaged hair and on the highest setting it will only slightly straighten my hair. I was very excited for this product based on reviews, but&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning and getting something else.</li>
    <li> I am PISSED. I&#x27;ve had this straightener for LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS, and it just stopped working out of the blue this morning. If I was gonna spend my money on something that would just break in a couple of months, I would have spent my money on a straightener at Walmart that costs half as much. Will never buy from this brand again. DO NOT BOTHER. You&#x27;ll just be buying another one soon anyway.</li>
    <li> Read reviews so I expected an amazing product that both curled and straightened my hair with little to no damage. Used it once and my hair is ruined! Little hairs standing up .... It&#x27;s like it fried my hair. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item. Comes with everything listed so because of that it gets ** but that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Love it, love the price.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> I need a good flat iron and so far I really like this one. I have every dry hair so being able to adjust the setting is very much a plus. I would order this again.</li>
    <li> The product is as described. Good value for the quality of the product.  Wide range of heat settings and heats to temperature faster than any other flat iron I have owned.</li>
    <li> Great product. get heated fast. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I bought this HSI professional ceramic straightener because I was in need of a straightener for my unruly curly hair. I had been looking and searching up reviews for straighteners and I came across this one which had so many great reviews and was actually listed as one of the best hair products on Amazon. So I gave it a go, I ordered the product and I then specifically made it a two day shipping as I was hoping to use it for a special occasion. The product didn&#x27;t arrive in two days but in 6. Although I had to wait and wait extra time the straightener was worth it. It is a really good product and the sample of argan oil they include does not disappoint! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This sure came in handy on a recent trip to the Azores.  Humidity very high on the islands and it helped to control my frizzies!  Comes in a nice carrying pouch and was simple to use.  A little larger than I thought it would be as the one I had at home is very old and much smaller.</li>
    <li> Love this iron! It is hot in a matter of seconds and does the job perfectly. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and am so glad I chose this one. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it and I travel often. The last one, a $100 iron, broke in my suitcase. This one has held up through 7 flights so far.</li>
    <li> This slick looking iron arrived on time and packaged neatly in its own box with a beautiful bag to hold the iron, a glove to protect hands and a sample of argan oil hair treatment. I purchased this iron for my daughter who likes to straighten her bangs. I have to say that it did the best job I&#x27;ve ever seen. The oil made her bangs shiny, and the straightener made them look naturally smooth.</li>
    <li> When the professional Paul Mitchell straightener I had for years finally gave out I decided to try this cheaper option. It is almost just as good ad the $200 straightener. Great product for $150 cheaper!</li>
    <li> Straightens great...but pulls my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and the HSI flat iron has been wonderful. I can use it on multiple hair types thanks to the adjustable temperature. I just love this flat iron and so do my clients, they especially love the HSI argon oil for their hair and how smooth it comes out.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product but love it and the customer service was excellent, I got my straighener exactly as promised didn&#x27;t have to wait and now my daughter and neice want one. Leave in hair treatment is awesome too, not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy. I use to use Paul Mitchell hair serum, not anymore. Thanks Blue Novelities too, your quick response was very helpful and professional,Love shopping on Amazon :)[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment]]</li>
    <li> Got this flat iron last week after my one year old FHI broke on me...I was a bit skeptical given the price because it&#x27;s such a good price and has such good reviews (too good to be true?). I will say that the vendor has been very good about following up with me to leave feedback on their company, as well as the item, so it is possible that they are better than other companies on Amazon about encouraging feedback, which explains the TONS of comments about this item. But in this case, I was going to leave product feedback regardless because I really think this is a good straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the temp, it comes with a little pouch for traveling, and it seems to make my hair shinier and holds the \\&quot;straight\\&quot; longer. I have thick course hair that is very susceptible to heat and humidity ruining all my hard work straightening it, but this straightener has done a much better job of fighting the humidity. I even had a coworker point out to me that my hair looked straighter and better with my new iron...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and especially the price. Time will tell as to whether or not it holds up though, but I&#x27;ve very satisfied with my choice at this point. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; can&#x27;t beat the price. Haven&#x27;t used the product included in the package but mostly because the straightener does what I need it to.</li>
    <li> It gets very hot and works as well as the one that I paid twice as much for that I had to replace after 5 years. I also liked the free gifts that came with this one. great price and good seller too!</li>
    <li> I would give it 2.5 stars. After reading the reviews,  I guess my expectations were a little high. I have thicker coarse hair and thought this was going to actually work on my hair without costing me a small fortune. I&#x27;m sorry to say that for me it does not work any better than any other straightener I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect anything amazing for the price, but the temperature settings don&#x27;t even appear to work, which is annoying.  Pretty sure the green light is almost never accurate, and sometimes the light will randomly switch back to red while you&#x27;re straightening.  I have super-long hair and I get paranoid about frying it, so I like to find the perfect temperature and stick with it....tough to do with this straightener.  The plates also catch a little : (</li>
    <li> this flat iron is not hot enough,I need a digital iron, and it wasn&#x27;t, it was hard to read what temperature the iron was on.</li>
    <li> I decided last summer to get a body wave and it severely damaged my hair.  I wanted a straighter that would not cause more damage than I already had.  After searching and reading reviews I decided to give the HSI a try. I am very satisfied with this straightener. It straightens great and leaves my hair looking silky smoothe.  This is a great product at a very great price. I would highly recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> I received my straightener last night.  I was very eager to use it after reading all of the comments.  I must share that I am also a true believer in the HSI Flat Iron.  I had purchased an expensive Royal Straightener a few years ago.  I had continued it because I thought it was doing an ok job of straightening my hair. Although my hair wasn&#x27;t shiny and had somewhat frizzy ends, I thought that was about as good as it was going to get. Bottom line, I settled for the not so perfect hair days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in December, I decided that I was going to make it my mission to find the right straightener that would provide me the sleek, straight shiny hair that I wanted to achieve at home.  The HSI Straighter is a true God Send!  My hair was super straight, shiny, tangle free, and it took only one run through to get these results. I am 98% sure this is the same straightener that my hair stylist uses.  Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;ll be saving a whole lot of cash since I can now do it on my own. Plus, the price for this straightener is hands down unbelievable.  I would have easily paid over $100 for how nice my hair turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is even remotely on the fence about whether or not to make this purchase, let me assure you, you can&#x27;t be disappointed. It&#x27;s that good!!!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying BlueNovelties was a PLEASURE to buy from, they are very helpful! I got my HSI yesterday in the mail, but the red light kept flickering on and off, it wouldn&#x27;t stay green (as it is supposed to do when at desired temperature). It didn&#x27;t stay real hot for very long. Left my hair kinda dry and blah. So I emailed them early this morning and they got right back to me, right away. They said it must be a defective one, and they could send me a replacement. But I think I want to return it and buy a new one. Maybe a chi or GHD...I have never tried a GHD but only hear good things. It looked like this one was supposed to be AMAAAZING, but I didn&#x27;t experience it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a latecomer to flat irons, because I&#x27;ve always liked my wavy/semi-curly hair, but a stylist thought it would be fun to style it straight at a recent appointment. I had never seen my hair straight before (really!), and it was pretty cute. Boyfriend liked it, too, so I hopped onto Amazon and found this flat iron and its great reviews. I don&#x27;t plan to use it all the time, but when I do, I want the best quality I can find if it&#x27;s going to be in direct contact with my hair. I&#x27;m still learning how to use it, but so far I&#x27;ve had good results, and my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be suffering at all. Very straight and silky. My stylist advised me to get a flat iron with variable temperature and to never use it on the highest setting, and I find that I do like that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety with these is obviously very important, so it would be better with auto shut-off, as another reviewer noted. But overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It allows me to get my hair down in less than 10 minutes, and as a mother of two toddlers, it&#x27;s a great time-saver.</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up so quickly.  It is smooth and leaves hair perfectly straightened and curled at the end if desired.  I highly rcommend this product.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I chose this HSI flat iron.  My 1&amp;#34; Chi was not working properly after years of use, so I was in the market for something just as good if not better.  This HSI flat iron is not consistent with heat, one day it&#x27;s hot enough to straighten my thin hair and other days its not. It doesn&#x27;t straighten with one pass. I have to pass it thru small sections of my hair. I have bent (wavy) hair and I like it to be straight. Maybe I got a dud? I would not recommend this to anyone. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I am only a little disappointed; had a spent a fortune, I would be very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing for my daughter and she absolutely loves this product. My fiance has a Chi and she says it works much better. Great little gift idea. It comes with a red velvet bag for traveling and protection. We highly recommend this product. Works great!</li>
    <li> It works well, and looks good! I have notice less breakage and frizziness than with my previous straightening irons. I would definitely recommend this product, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I had read several of the reviews and looked at pictures people had posted and the flat iron was fine, but not as the reviews suggested. My hair is very thick and curly so it still took several passes to get it suitable then I still took another smaller flat iron to get it a little better and straighter. It&#x27;s a good flat iron though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this for my wife as she is not happy with the current one she owns, she has thick and curly hair. I picked this one based on the reviews, ceramic plate and high temperature settings. Well it turned out to be a great decision. The package came before the expected date and my wife tried the next day, couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. She loves the Argan oil that came in the package, we even ordered with bigger bottle with the 50% coupon that came along in the package. Well done HSI, great product and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and my niece loved it!</li>
    <li> I have a super thick and course hair.  My salon gave me rave reviews about the HSI which sells for about $300.  I bought it on amazon for an awesome price.  I am satisified for the low price.  Would not have been happy to have paid $300.  Really, it works just as good as my 5 year old Chi.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Doesn&#x27;t pull hair and straightens beautifully</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! Best straightener I have used yet !</li>
    <li> I had my last hair straightener for 4 years and used it daily so I was a bit skeptical to try a new brand but after reading the reviews, I had to give it a try. I am definitely glad I did! I have been using it almost daily for a little over a month now and could not be more satisfied with my purchase. Quick shipping and love the free glove and bag that came with it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER.  I am a stylist and must say I was skeptical at first because I was not familiar with the brand.  After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance on this product.  I ordered the flat iron along with the stand.  Both arrived as promised nicely packaged.  I opened it up and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if the iron would live up to the hype.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised immediately, the flat iron get hot right away and gets the job done.  I was so pleased that I ordered an additional CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER for my 16 year old daughter this morning.  I have used many professional flat irons including CHI, Paul Mitchel and Hot Tools just to name a few, this flat iron, hands down, is the best.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this flat iron after reading all the reviews.... but I have been let down.&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron pulls your hair and does not get hot enough. I was spoiled because I have a chi. I was looking for a cheaper one to leave packed for traveling, but I think this one is going into the trash</li>
    <li> Thank you for making my Daughter&#x27;s Christmas!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to purchase this product as I have only used expensive flat irons like Chi and Paul Mitchell. My flat iron died right before Christmas and I didn&#x27;t really need the expense of replacing a $200 flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and thought why not.... Day 1, I was pleasantly surprised, but thought for sure after a few days it would probably dry my hair out. It&#x27;s been over 2 weeks (of using this every day) and my hair texture has actually improved. My bangs used to get fried with my Paul Mitchell, no signs of dry ends with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly thick hair, my hair not only stays straight for days (3 is the longest I&#x27;ve attempted to go) it is soft and silky looking. Also, I am no longer experiencing static once done flat ironing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that I purchased this product. I have and will continue to recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I bought one if these 8years ago for myself and have bought 2 others as gifts since. This is a great product. I highly recommend the HSI company.</li>
    <li> I love my hot iron.  Straightens perfectly, heats up fast, leaves my hair shiny even the next day when I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
    <li> At this incredible price I was not expecting much. I ordered for my 11 year old who is just starting to flat iron her hair. I used it to show her and had to order another for myself. Not only does this work better than my Paul Mitchell flat iron but it comes with the hot glove and a nice silky case. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!</li>
    <li> Product came as described. Easy to use and works great! I definitely reccomend the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It has a heat dial that allows temperature control.  It heats up quick and does a very noce job.  It was the perfect replacement for my old hair straightener (Which I had,had for 5 years!  I think I&#x27;ll be keeping this one around for a while.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The  flat iron was very nice in how it looks.  My thought was that I was buying better than I could get at Walmart.  But, my daughter says it&#x27;s not as good as the $20 she has from walmart.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this iron. Works very well, has   a longer cord than others ive used</li>
    <li> At first I was really excited to get this and it works awesome with smoothing out my hair, I can really tell the difference. Then the next time I used it, Im having issues with the light that shows when the temperature is set. It turns on red when it&#x27;s heating up and green when ready, my problem is it only stays red and never green. I&#x27;ve been trying to email the company but no replies? Help!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the better ceramic straighteners I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve gone through about half a dozen lower priced ones trying to find a good one and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used.  As good as the ones in the salons for $100+</li>
    <li> Purchased the item here at Amazon. Great product. Came with a storage bag for travel as well as a free sample of oil battle. Too early to tell how long it will last. Initially the quality looks very good and works like it should.</li>
    <li> My hair always \\&quot;grows\\&quot; and gets fly-away as the day goes on. When I use this hair straightener, I don&#x27;t have that problem any more. I really like that the controls are not where you hold it causing me to unintentionally change settings.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. I didn&#x27;t know much about irons but this one has very good reviews on its page. This iron heats very quick and lets you hair very shinny. I just love it. Also, the seller was very fast and I received my item in few days. Recommend it  ;)</li>
    <li> I have really thick long hair that just started becoming curly. I have tried other flat irons but all they did was frizz my hair and make me want to cut it all off. I bought this flat iron after reading the reviews and I am really happy with it! I even brought it to my hairdresser at my last appointment for her to try it out and she fell in love with it too! The only she had, she paid $150 for it. I only paid $50 for mine and it works better than hers does. I am really impressed with the quality of this flat iron and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this particular product and I read every review. But I still decided to try it anyways after the comments. I am in love with the flat iron. My daughter has very course hair and I was like let me see if this will straighten her hair first and see how good it is before I perm her hair. I tried it and was very surprised and the curls last for at least a few days. It heats up very quickly and it does get very hot. I love the fact that the temperature and the on/off buttons are in the middle as I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hands accidentally hitting the buttons and turning it off. Some people complained about it pulling your hair, well I have not had that problem. Also my flat iron does clasp all the way down and the design does not affect my ability to flat iron my hair at all as I saw that someone stated that as well. I just pray that it last for a while and I did get everything as advertised. Also, please be aware that when I first plugged the flat iron in, it did not come on. But the reviews stated to hit the reset button and it would power up. I did that and it was on right away. I am very satisfied with my purchase...</li>
    <li> This product got shipped to me really fast and it works very well.  I love the argon oil that came with it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great Flatiron and for $39?!?!  Leaves hair silky and smooth.  Also curls really well too :)</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener to replace my broken Chi. It gets very hot, which is great, but I have some concerns about how well it holds its heat. Originally I got one that was defective and kept reheating while I straightened. The seller was great and sent a replacement, and it&#x27;s definitely much better. But, I am still confused by the ready indicator light continually switching to red in the middle of straightening my hair. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a very good straightener and I am happy with it, especially after my Chi broke. However, I don&#x27;t love it the way some of the raving reviewers did. Good purchase and definitely worth the price, but not the best I have ever seen. Having said that, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Thought with thick, wavy, longish hair it would be nearly impossible to straighten it so quickly.  This item heats up fast, flattened my hair and probably saved me a small fortune going forward for trips to the salon.  I am very pleased with it and have already recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I purchased this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Great for the price, this was a great replacement for my old ceramic flatiron.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the mini flat/spiral iron. It gets hot very fast and works great. Will be perfect for traveling. Works very well for curls. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron. It was delivered on time. I ordered my flat iron may 2,2015. I used it yesterday and it stopped working.  The only reason I am updating my  rating to 2 stars is because it only lasted 6 months. I didn&#x27;t  even use it for 3 of those months before yesterday.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron that serves more than one purpose.  I can add a cute flip, curl, or simply just straighten my naturally curly hair.  Great price!  Very professional company who proves that customer service is alive and well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything I wanted in a flatiron for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife &amp; she loves it!</li>
    <li> Great prouduct and easy to do business with, would purchase from seller again. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Not bad at all. Got to give it several more tries</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically a good tool with all the little touches included (heat resistant glove, storage pouch) but like another reviewer had said, there is no free bio silk sample included as described.  There is another sample product instead.  The iron heats up very quickly but it feels very heavy compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It&#x27;s fine if you are using it to just straighten or pulling the iron downwards.  However, if you are using it to flip or curl, your wrist will get tired very fast.  It&#x27;s better to use a traditional curling iron for that.  Overall, it&#x27;s still a good product for the price.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick! I anxiously awaited the straightener as mine was getting quickly outdated. I am more excited to dry and straighten my hair then I ever have been. Straightener is just as good, if not better, than the CHI my hair dresser uses. Absolutely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Was looking to replace a worn out straightener - ran across this and read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  INCREDIBLE!!!  Makes my hair shiny and does NOT fry it! Love the ready light!  and the temp indicator/selector seems to be much more reliable than the old CHI flat iron I had.  HIGHLY recommend this item and whatta deal!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.  I had an inexpensive model ($15) from a major retail store.  I did not know that compared to this one, it was junk.  About 2 years ago, I up-graded to a $30 model from a beauty supply store.  It was a little better, I thought, but,didn&#x27;t have rounded, floating plates and left creases in my hair unless I turned it a certain way.  I bought this HSI model (a month ago) instead of the other popular model that starts with a \\&quot;C\\&quot;, based on other reviews and price.  I must say for approx $50, this model is superb.  It does not crease my hair or leave lines. I have naturally wavy super fine hair.  It didn&#x27;t come with a Biosilk sample but rather an HSI argan oil sample - which most of the time I forget to use.  It heats up in a flash and the travel pouch is super handy to put it in after each use.  My kids are in my bathroom a lot so the pouch is a major plus for me, I put it away each time, while it is still hot - so they don&#x27;t burn themselves.  I would definitely recommend this product for someone not wanting to spend $100 on other models.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This item replaced my Chi Wet to Dry.  The temperature adjustment is not in a very convenient place but I think that is by design so you don&#x27;t accidently turn it up while styling.  You can&#x27;t see the temperature that the unit is set to, it is more of an approximation.  I don&#x27;t think the end gets as hot as the Chi which is a blessing since I would continually almost burn my fingers while pinching the end.  It seems like it is similar quality but just not as many bells and whistles which is great since it was 30% the cost of replacing the Chi Wet to dry.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS FLAT IRON BECAUSE IT HAD ALL OF THE FEATURES I NEEDED IN A GREAT IRON. THE FIRST TIME I USED THE IRON IT MADE MY HAIR LOOK LIKE BUTTER. MY HAIR WAS SO STRAIGHT, MY ENDS WERE SILKY AND EXTREMELY SOFT, JUST WHAT I NEEDED IN A GREAT FLAT IRON. ALSO I LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN DETERMINE HOW HOT I WANT MY IRON TO BE, SO THAT WAS AN EXTREME PLUS FOR ME. THE SMALL BOTTLE OF ARGAN OIL THAT WAS INCLUDED WAS I A NICE BONUS TO AN ALREADY GREAT PURCHASE. THE IRON IS EVERYTHING IT DESCRIBED AND MORE.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT flat iron!!! Salon quality and it&#x27;s great for transforming frizzy, dull hair into gorgeous hair. This iron heats up quick comes with a small bottle of oil which works great. I give this flat iron 5 STARS! My hair is bouncy, is healthy, and looks like I just left the salon. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I have thin, but curly volumized hair and it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair at all. The only problem is where the temperature and off/on switch is. It is actually located in the inner part of the straightener. Not safe at all.</li>
    <li> It straightens very well but I had it for about 2 weeks and it got knocked off my counter. The part you plug into the wall fell come rely apart.</li>
    <li> The shipping was faster than I expected. The product is amazing..I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my hair is frizzy n unruly, I&#x27;m not a professional hair straightner nor do I take my time this product straightens my hair in no time. Makes it smooth n hine and last till my next wash. for the prize its a steal. ordr came even before expected. thanks</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and keeping in mind that some reviews can be promoted by the manufacturer, I can honestly say that this flat iron holds up to the positive feedback. Amazon Prime ROCKS. I received the HSI Flat Iron on time and even earlier than promised. After having my hair cut to just above my shoulders in the beginning of January, I was intent on learning and playing with the new &amp;#34;beachy wave&amp;#34; look.I have fine hair so my concern was that the use of the Flat Iron may be to aggressive. The heat range is good even for those who have fine, thin hair but those with coarse thick hair would find this to work for them too. The packaging was impressive including a beautiful red bag, glove (if you choose to use it) some Aargon Oil and the little touch of attaching a velcro strip to the wire to keep it neat when not in use. I am completely pleased with this flat iron. Now all I have to do is perfect the wave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many straighteners and this one is pretty good. I have thick course hair and it does straighten it pretty well. It&#x27;s a little heavy on the arm, that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it. The Argan oil however is GREAT.</li>
    <li> I was a little doubtful of this straightener at first, yet now that I have been using it I could not imagine ever living without it! This hair straightener is simply one of the BEST I&#x27;ve seen around. No more bad hair days for me!! This item deserves more than 5 stars! :)</li>
    <li> Prior to buying I read all of the reviews and pricing was good.  I finally decided to buy this product was for my daughter for her birthday.  Every time she straightened her hair it looked amazing and she was able to use it as a curling iron as well.  Well my flat iron finally gave out so I bought this one as a replacement. I am very happy with my purchase. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works good...nice packaging...Good price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know too much about flat irons, but my wife loves it. We planned on getting her one that cost about $400, but as we were search for it on here we ran into this flat iron. We read all the positive reviews and decided to take a risk this one. We&#x27;re glad we took the risk because it had everything she wanted and it was much inexpensive than the other one we where going to get. Much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Worked great. I had a $100 iron that broke and this HSI Iron got my hair straighter faster and it was soft . Love it! I especially like the glove it came with.</li>
    <li> Was not happy with this product. You can adjust temperature to either not straighten or fry your hair. I have curly hair and tried a low temp, this did absolutely nothing (even after running over hair several times). Then tried at a higher temperature, this fried my hair and now I have areas of hair which no longer have curls at the ends.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! I love the weight of the flat iron and how sturdy the product is when I hold it.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and it works. But you could find better for less $$</li>
    <li> I wish the actual ironing plate was a bit longer. Also, I don&#x27;t see how the lower temperatures recommended for fine hair would ever get the job done. I had to crank it up!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It takes me 10 minutes to do my hair. I&#x27;ve owned two so far and the reason I had to get a new one was because mine broke during traveling a lot after 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ordering and shipping process was quick and easy. I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Really nice flat iron! It does exactly what you&#x27;d hope it would, it straightens hair and it seems to hold the style for longer than my old straightener (I have wavy hair, nothing too special). I think my favorite think about this purchase was the argan oil. Dude, this stuff is amazing! The combo of using the argan oil and the flat iron just makes it glide over my hair, no snags, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just something to be aware of when you first plug it in, the light turns red as it&#x27;s heating. I assumed it would turn green when it was fully heated but it just turns orange which was a little frustrating when looking at a glace. But other than that, it&#x27;s awesome. I usually plug it in then go make coffee or something, when I come back (less than 5 minutes) it&#x27;s fully heated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone else mentioned, it does NOT auto shut off if you forget to unplug it. You have to unplug it for it to turn off. Just FYI.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing, it&#x27;s doing exactly what it supposed to do. i will recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> This does a nice job of not pulling at your hair.  I feel it is a little heavier then my other straighteners.  Someone had mentioned it gets super hot, but I feel it does not get as hot as other ceramic irons I&#x27;ve had/used in the past.  The thing I like the best is that I don&#x27;t fee like it damages my hair like other irons have.</li>
    <li> Super excited about my new straightener! Came quickly, works great and came with a free case and argon oil. So much better than my old conair although anything is probably better than that. I researched for about 6 months before purchasing and am happy about my decision.</li>
    <li> Very good and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Is not that good for me</li>
    <li> I love flat irons and hair products. Of all the irons I have(4) these are the best. Will definitely by again.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible iron for the price.  I bought this based on the reviews and price and was not disappointed.  The most expensive iron I owned was a CHI and it continually pulled and broke my fine hair.  This flat iron is so easy to use with great results.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron i ever have..</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Shipped quickly, heats quickly!</li>
    <li> Have just used it once, but it was very effective.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for Christmas.  Used it twice and on the third time it short circuited and made a spark...died.  Also, it didn&#x27;t grasp my hair smoothly when I went to straighten.  It would tug at strands and it hurt!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, but not as good as other flat irons I have used in the past. It sometimes catches my hair near the end and pinches my palm - just something about the build, I guess. It does leave my hair straight, but slightly fizzy. I am going to return this product as I does not meet my expectations. Sorry!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and works great for my bangs!! Not much help with long hair like mine... But maybe I just needed to take more time with it as I tried using it while rushing to get ready for work.</li>
    <li> My CHI died after about five years of loyal service to my hair.  I was nervous about this iron but I was in desparate need of a new one.  It gets pretty hot and seems to straighten my hair really well.  Don&#x27;t try to straighten too much hair at one time or you&#x27;ll get the pulling sensation that a few reviewers have complained about.</li>
    <li> I would like to have settings and automatic shut down. Otherwise it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It works great on my think unruly hair. I love the temperature adjust dial.</li>
    <li> the product is performing as expected.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair iron I ever had. Good investment for the price. Works good both straigthening and curling my hair. I love this product.highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Needed a new straightener. Most of the CHI&#x27;s out in the marketplace today are cheaply made fake clones, there is no guarantee you are going to get a good one. I decided to try out the HSI. Great unit, good quality, every bit as good as a real CHI that I have used in the past. Buy this one and be happy.</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter and she loves it. She had a much more expensive flat iron that&#x27;s ayes a year. She said this one works a lot better!</li>
    <li> Tried at least a dozen straighteners and was never happy until I bought his one! Hair is healthy and glossy all day. I am ordering more as gifts!</li>
    <li> I am still getting to know this product but I have to say I am very glad I ordered it.  It works very well and I believe that it is the best hair straightener I have used by far.  More to follow!  Great value!</li>
    <li> This a great straightener, my old conair infinitely broke and i was in search a replacement. After reading a lot of the reviews, good and bad, i decided to give this one a shot. Having thick and heavy hair, it becomes a challenge for me to straighten my hair. This straightener did the trick. I even curled my hair, the curls were full of body, and bouncy, the best part they lasted. This is a great buy and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this. doesn&#x27;t burn her hair like many others</li>
    <li> love this flat iron!  the flat iron doesn&#x27;t pull at my hairs and makes it feel soft and healthy not brittle and fried!  love it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic flat iron! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works great! Leaves my hair nice and silky, not dull and frizzy! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Good Flat Iron for the price.</li>
    <li> A good back up straightener</li>
    <li> This is a really nice straightener.  Quality made.  I ended up returning it, I decided I liked having an electronic safety off option.(when it turns off after an hr or so)  JUST IN CASE I ever forget to turn it off.  I&#x27;ve never forgotten too, but I like to have the backup piece of mind.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for 10 years and wanted a change; the search for the perfect flat iron began.  I am sooooo glad I found this flat iron because I absolutely love it and the argon oil that came with it. You will not be  disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it so far! Better than my Chi was at standing up to humidity!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! Works just as good as very expensive straighteners I have purchased in the past and fast shipping!! Very happy!!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener when my $40 Revlon straightener&#x27;s plate coating started to chip off after two years of daily use. There are things I do and don&#x27;t like about this straightener, and I will talk about them in that order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;For a slightly more expensive straightener, I guess I expected a little more, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair quite as well as my cheaper Revlon  straightener. Also, the  plug this straightener uses is the big bulky block plug you would normally see on a hair dryer or something similar. As such, I can no longer plug my hair dryer and straightener into the same electrical outlet because they won&#x27;t both fit. I only have one electrical outlet in my bathroom and I can&#x27;t use a power strip in this location for various reasons. If this straightener didn&#x27;t have a long cord that reaches to the outlet outside the door, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it inside my bathroom. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem with the straightener, but if anyone else has only one outlet, they might like to be aware of this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I do like:&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, It doesn&#x27;t really seem to damage my hair much, and it never snags or pulls my hair which is one thing I hated about some of my previous straighteners. Also, I haven&#x27;t ever pinched my fingers with this straightener, which is a bonus. The argon oil it comes with smells nice and feels great on my hair. This is something I wasn&#x27;t expecting because I have very fine blonde hair, and usually ANY products (even some conditioners) will make my hair heavy and look dirty and oily. Not so with this. I ended up buying more of the oil. The straightener seems solidly built, and has a comfortable, but not too heavy, weight to it. I&#x27;ve even dropped it on a hard tile floor multiple times and it wasn&#x27;t damaged in the slightest. I also like how the swivel cord is super long! This straightener does a pretty decent job of straightening my hair, but not quite to the degree I was expecting. Anyway I think the pros outweigh the cons, and I like it enough to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I did really like this flat iron, but I wasn&#x27;t quite as impressed as I was expecting to be from all the other reviews. I do think it does a good job, but my hair is very thick and curly so it doesn&#x27;t keep it as straight all day as many of the other reviews say that it does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good flat iron! it really worth the price! My girlfriend and I are really happy with it, it&#x27;s a great addition to our beauty parlor.</li>
    <li> This flat iron came quickly and was very nicely packaged. I think the flat iron is good. I had an Ion before and I liked how hot it got, 450. My HSI gets up to 430 and I can tell a bit if a difference but that&#x27;s probably because that&#x27;s what I have been used to. Other than that it works well and is easy to use. I like the longer swivel cord and it came with a few freebies. Overall the price was good and I feel it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me I&#x27;m inlove with this hair iron my hair look so lively and stunning even I ironed it everyday</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with my flat iron. My hair no longer looks frizzy. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. It is priced right and is well made. The only drawback is the iron is quite hot and you must be careful where you place it to cool down after using. I believe there is a stand you can purchase separately for that purpose.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried herstyler, chi, iso beauty, and this by far is way quicker at straightening coarse frizzy hair! I highly recommend this hair straightener and the aragan oil is definitely a bonus!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling burnt after I straighten it and just after one pass it keeps my hair completely straight</li>
    <li> Great straightener. Really straightens my hair fully.</li>
    <li> These babies worked liked a dream. They heat up fast and stay hot. Normally it takes me about 30 minutes to straighten my hair, but with these babies I can get it done in 15. You also don&#x27;t get that ugly crinkly burn mark that other cheap flat irons will give you. Only bad thing is they don&#x27;t have an automatic cut off function so if you are the type of person who is absent minded be careful. All in a damn good pair of flat iron for a damn good price.</li>
    <li> I have gone back to using my old flat iron and shoved this one in the back of the closet. The green light turns to red after about 5 seconds - requiring you wait for the iron to heat up again and again and again. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this flat iron but I can&#x27;t say I like it better than my CHI iron.</li>
    <li> The reviews led me to believe that I would be blown away with this straightener.  It&#x27;s a good straightener, but I think I expected better.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair and it usually takes an hour to straighten it, with our new Tourmaline flat iron, straightening her hair was done in less than half the time. I like how quickly it heats up too.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Heat settings are a must to just smooth hair without frying.  My T3 iron did not last long, and I used about 3 times per month.  Hopefully this does better. Seller mailed the product quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> I love this item!!  It make my hair straight and smooth!!  It heats up quickly, and the red storage bag it perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> Does not get nearly as hot as it should. My teenage daughter wanted this type iron and they cost so much in the store. When I saw this deal, I thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately, we have had to buy another one in the store for much more because this one does not get hot enough to straighten her hair. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> First off it was a great price. The product came in quick and met all expectations.  My favorite feature is that it heats up really quick! Great for people on the go and in a hurry!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife, she doesn&#x27;t have curly hair but it&#x27;s difficult enough to iron it with a straightener from my sister in law. This one worked perfectly, she set it at the maximum temperature and it straightened her hair almost perfectly and didn&#x27;t burn the hair at all. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron i have ever used. I have thick, coarse, curly hair and most of the flat irons I have used have required the highest setting of heat to get my hair straight. The problem is that not only did it not get my hair totally straight but i had tons of damage and couldnt really afford to do it more than once a week. I set this on medium heat and it leaves my hair super smooth, this particular flat iron also comes with the argan oil which I put on before and makes my hair much easier to straighten. LOVE it and if mine ever breaks I will order the same one again.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! And the best was it came at time!!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife. She loves it. She loves the fact that it&#x27;s digital and she knows when the temperature is just right.</li>
    <li> The product worked great until one of the irons popped out- now my hair gets stuck in it. I only had it three months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this straightener a couple of times but it works awesome on my curly hair and quicker than other straight irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few cheaper flat irons.  Just spend the money and get a good one.  This iron heats up in a flash, that means real fast, like a minute or two.  It curls well &amp; fast &amp; it is not damaging my hair in any way.  My daughter used it and commented, without me telling her, that it was a really good flat iron.  She liked it but was surprised I spent the money.  I&#x27;ve bought more expensive blowers &amp; curling irons in the past, and they have held up much better than the cheaper ones, so I&#x27;m counting on a lasting relationship with this one. (Both of us have fairly straight, medium textured hair.  Hers is very thick, mine is average in thickness.)</li>
    <li> I have always used a CHI iron, but dropped it one too many times and it broke, so I thought I&#x27;d replace it with something cheaper. I decided to purchase the HSI based on the thousands of good reviews........I used it for the first time this morning and was *very* disappointed. How can this terrible product have SO MANY good reviews?? My hair got caught on the plates every time and it pulled my hair out/broke it. The plates felt like they were being raked over the hair. This iron is NOT better than the Chi, which never pulled my hair, and glided over it smoothly. Looks like I&#x27;ll be splurging to replace my CHI!</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever seen. I loved my hair after.</li>
    <li> Great product....works well! The dual voltage feature is great. I used the straightener without any problems on my trip to Spain.</li>
    <li> My pre-teen daughter is not a fan of her &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; frizzy hair which was the source of frequent morning melt downs as she tried to get ready for school. I was prepared to get the CHI flat-iron, but when I searched on amazon, the HSI came up, and with so many good reviews and less than half the price of the CHI, I decided it was worth a shot. It has not disappointed! We have used it frequently and it works great! I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money on the CHI iron, and my daughter&#x27;s mornings go much more smoothly! :)</li>
    <li> Love this iron! Works as well as some better known brands that are much higher priced. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I really love the sample of the straightening oil that was included with my order. It was a nice little surprise and it seems to do wonders in my hair. The straightener itself I like, but I feel it could do a better job. It doesn&#x27;t give me that smooth straight that I was hoping to achieve. I do use it almost everyday and will continue to use it! It was shipped very quick and I do appreciate that!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, especially for the price. Works well. Heats up fast.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this HSI straightener! I recently bought a CHI on Amazon, and had it for less then a month when it went out on me. I considered the HSI before the CHI, but hadn&#x27;t heard of the brand, so I just got the CHI. Well, when it went out on me, I asked for a refund (which I got), and purchased the HSI. IT IS AMAZING. It&#x27;s got a dial for the temperature and a silky bag to keep it in. It gets hot really quickly and cools down just as quick. THANKS!</li>
    <li> This was my first hair straightener. I tried to copy what my hair dresser does, but I didn&#x27;t succeed at first, but with a little practice it looks pretty good.  It is reasonably priced and I like the slip case and oil that came with it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this work and the fact that the on off switch is inside so you don&#x27;t turn it off accidentally!  Very effective!</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy this product because of the huge discount.  I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived!  It works better than I had hoped!  I would recommend this to everybody looking for a flat iron!</li>
    <li> Pretty good to use...&lt;br /&gt;at first time, I hesitated to purchase it or not....Finally I purchased it after reading many reviews.The product shows exactly what it looks like in the image....even though I don&#x27;t like the case...&lt;br /&gt;When using with a hair oil, my hair turns to be shiny and smoothy....</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome! I was replacing my Chi flat iron and had previously purchased the HSI one last year for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she loved it. The price is amazing, much cheaper than a Chi, and performs as well or better.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST flat iron I have ever purchased.  I was so surprised when I received the flat iron as it came in a red carrying bag.  It was so much more than I expected for $44.00.  It has the quality of a professional in the features, look and feel.  I have never heard of HSI before but will purchase other items made by them due to the quality of the craftsmanship.  The adjustable heat controls, flexible cord and smooth plates.  My hair is shiny and this iron is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but it doesn&#x27;t straighten too well even when it&#x27;s at its hottest temp.</li>
    <li> I had to turn the heat all the way up to get close to the same effectiveness as my chi that broke after 11+ years of use.  It is sturdy and works well for the price.  I wish it had an auto shut-off feature, especially since the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light is not in a great place to see to remind you that it is turned on.</li>
    <li> The strength of the spring makes your hands tire quickly, and makes the muscle in my thumb cramp up.  It also made my hair EXTREMELY static-y and pulled at it. Disappointed for the price, especially considering it has no automatic shut off. UPDATE-customer service contacted me regarding the review, and offered to do whatever they could to remedy the situation. This company stands by their product, which is something I very appreciate. Going to try a different one in case maybe the one I got was a fluke. Update: received the new iron in the mail very quickly.  Must say that I love it!  Still came with the trademark Argan oil.  Upgrading to 5 stars for not only product quality but company quality. They are are 5 star company in their own right!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like the product until I realized I needed to turn up up the heat. Works great!</li>
    <li> Worst amazon purchase ever! So disappointed. I took very good care of this product and only used it a handful of times before it stopped heating up. Tried returning it but amazon said it was too late.</li>
    <li> X-mas gift was a success!!!</li>
    <li> very pleased with  this product  i had read previous reviews and was actually thinking about a chi product, but all of the previous chi users, spoke highly of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this iron! It heats very quickly and is comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy to open it and find out it was missing the sample of argon oil which is why I picked this product to try in the first place.</li>
    <li> This little thing works wonders! Heats up fast and keeps my hair smooth and not damaged looking like my old Walgreen&#x27;s straightener did. I&#x27;m a guy and have a long fringe, but even on the parts of my hair where it is short I can still get in there and straighten it with this. Very pleased with the fast shipping too, would recommend to anyone looking for a great and affordable (when it&#x27;s on sale, got mine for $44) straightener!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!! Exactly what is described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received my flat iron just in time for me to use it this morning. Works great. First time using the oil with it and my hair smell good and feels good. I also like how they have the tie on the cord to help keep everything together. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I previously had a Chi, which I absolutely loved but it stopped working after many years. I was looking to buy the same brand but it was a bit too expensive so I went with this product. I LOVE IT! I&#x27;d highly recommend it. I love that you can control the temperature. That&#x27;s a big plus! It shipped in two days and I liked the glove, oil, case and even the packaging that it came in. Very classy. I&#x27;d highly recommend the HSI Professional!</li>
    <li> Pretty good flatiron for the price point. It heats up nicely and leaves my hair smooth and shiny. I wish the iron cooled off a bit faster, but usually I leave it out for a bit to cool or stash it in the sleeve</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron.  Works as good if not better than my  Chi.</li>
    <li> I love it, way better than the old one I had and it is very effective. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and look forward to using it for many more years</li>
    <li> used it 4 times....it died on me .......dont know why ! suddently stopped working :(</li>
    <li> While on vacation I plugged my original Chi flat iron into a converter resulting in a huge section of my hair getting burnt.  I had to replace my flat iron and quickly.  I order the HSI professional flat iron.  It arrived before expected.  Item was new, with adjustable heat (something my original did not have), a long cord, a pouch, and a small package of hair oil.  After using this product for the past several weeks I am pleased with the results.  Price was great!  Compared to drug store flat irons this is a superior product.</li>
    <li> I love it, not only does it have my hair looking great but it actuallys lays your hair down perfectly while other flat irons turn your hair out poofy this one is great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my new flat iron it works Great on my hair, takes very little time to do my hair which I love the best.</li>
    <li> This is my first hair straightener. It is a little hard to set the temperature because the mark is not very clear. Other than that, the product is overall good.</li>
    <li> I had never used a flat iron before and was very skeptical that I would could use one.  My hair is very curly, so I do have to dry it and use a brush to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; out some of the curl before I use the flat iron.  The iron heats quickly and gets very hot, so takes only a few minutes to give me a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; look.  Before I had to wash my hair every day, now every other day or every third day will suffice.  And I have had so many compliments on my new look!  The only negative is there is not an automatic shutoff.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a flat iron that actually works on my naturally curly hair...and I finally found it! I really cannot believe how well it works! It takes only about 15 minutes to straighten my hair when it used to take about 50 minutes using my old one. Thank you for this amazing product!</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of the mixed reviews. I decided to go ahead and purchase this item.  I had another ceramic flat iron that fried my hair.  It still looked broken and damaged no matter how I styled it.  I have used this several times now and my hair actually looks healthier after being straightned with this flat iron.  I am happy I listened to all the positive reviews.  The only negative about this is that there is not an automatic shutoff if left on.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!!!</li>
    <li> The price was great and shipping was very fast.  The feature I was most excited about was the temperature control since I felt like my Chi straightener was too hot and there was no temperature adjustment on that model.  This HSI model that I received seemed to not be hot enough unless I had it at pretty much the highest setting.  Also it did snag/catch on my hair which I was very surprised by.  My Chi straightener does not do that.  This straightener is a great price but I am not 100% satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Works great, looks good, just as advertised.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;m happy that it performs as well as those $100+ ones.</li>
    <li> The HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair is absolutely amazing.  I have extremely thick hair and this iron completely makes in manageable.  I could get somewhat straight hair from other irons but this one gives you the straight flat silky look you see in all the magazines.  You cannot beat the price or the customer service from the seller.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy, frizzy and fly away. I use this iron on the highest setting, and it  straightens my hair quickly. It is not difficult- does not pull or tangle hair- and is lightweight and very easy to use. I love it! I have not as yet had a chance to use the free bottle of oil included with the straightener.</li>
    <li> Works really well! I am totally satisfied. Be careful with that high heat setting though; 410 degrees feels hotter on this iron than it did on my previous hair straighteners (I had CHI).</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough.  Returned.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron works extremely well, and I got it for an amazing price - apparently about 75% off. It heats up almost immediately, which is essential for me because I have thick hair that is difficult to straighten. I bought it because of the previous user reviews, and I am not at all disappointed!</li>
    <li> This flat iron will straighten your hair, though not with the smoothness of the Chi I&#x27;ve had for the past 5-6 years. It boasts a quick heat-up time which I have found to be an exaggeration. The indicator light is red while heating then turns green when your desired temperature us reached. Sometimes the light never turns green; although I use it and it does a fair enough job on my hair. However, I would not purchase this iron again.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and purchased this flat iron after reading the great reviews. I have to admit, I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve used CHI, Hot Tools, and Remington brand flat irons in the past. This is my favorite! I love it! I have very thick and wavy hair, making straightening a challenge at times. This flat iron gets the job done. I can go for days with straight hair. It also leaves my hair shiny and smooth. I&#x27;d highly recommend, and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I purchased HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for my mother as a Christmas present. She is prone to stealing the flat iron that I own and I was getting annoyed. Ironically shortly after Christmas my flat iron broke and I am now borrowing hers. The HSI is a great flat iron, it heats up really quickly. I have really curly hair and it was able to give me a soft smooth straight that is not flat. It also created a nice shine to my hair. As for my mother she has very coarse dry hair. With the HSI she is also able to achieve a very smooth look. The best part about this flat iron is the price; I can not believe how well the quality is. I used to work in a salon as an assistant and I can say that this is definitely salon quality. After using this product I am looking into purchasing another one for myself.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my daughter with very long thick hair. She is very pleased with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  I usually always get CHI hair straighteners.  But since I saw this got so many high reviews and it was reasonably priced I bought it.  I do like the CHI better, but it did cost 3 times the price of the HSI one.  So it should be expected.  The only complaint I have is that the switch is inside and I risk getting burned to turn it off. And it also tends to snag and pull at my hair a bit and the CHI would never do that.  Its good for the price. But since I use my hair straightener so oftern, I would&#x27;ve probably gotten the more expensive CHI.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this iron! My curls are hard to straighten and this does it with ease. So much better than my Chi. Great purchase. 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> Gets good and hot. What I like best is even though it gets very straight, my hair still has body after using it. Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on reviews and I am glad i trusted the other customers. This iron is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I got this Flat Iron as a Christmas gift for my niece. She has it for a couple weeks with no complaints.</li>
    <li> I was about to buy a chi but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste the money bc this one is just as good plus they give you freebies :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Better than others that I used before.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price. Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I was blessed (or cursed, if you choose) with very thick, curly hair.  For years, I have wanted to wear those cute bobs and sleek looks.  I never thought it would happen.    Several months ago, I ventured out of my comfort zone and let my new (yes, I said new) hairdresser cut my hair into one of the stylish asymmetrical bobs.  I definitely looked like a million bucks when I left the salon and thought I&#x27;d have this one day of perfect hair and the next two months of a frizzy balled up mess.      A co-worker let me borrow one of her cheap irons and I used it until I found this one.  I had researched online for what seemed like an eternity and decided to buy this one - by the time I made up my mind, it had sold out.  I certainly had hoped that the HSI would give me that &#x27;just walked out of the salon&#x27; look that the cheaper store brand hadn&#x27;t (tons of fly-aways and daily frizzies...)    During the holidays, I checked back in on Amazon for it&#x27;s availability.  I had seen it advertised for about $89 then it jumped to $149 when I finally decided on it.  Needless to say, I was disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t available and really forgot about ordering it until after the holidays.  When my co-worker needed hers back, I knew that I needed to order one and found it back in stock with Amazon.    It arrived in a few short days and I was eager to try it out.      I plugged it in the next morning and had absolutely NO trouble using it.  It gets very hot very quickly and I didn&#x27;t need the hottest setting like I thought.  The iron glides over my hair and leaves it shiny and smooth.  Even the shorter pieces of the back of my hair are easy to straighten.    I have gotten more compliments since using this iron than I ever have before.  It is definitely a must have for &#x27;hair novices&#x27; like me and definitely worth the price.

    <li> I agree with most. I have never heard of this brand before so I was nervous about ordering one. I currently have a Chi and I thought it was going out so I just ordered one to try it. I am impressed. I have super curly natural hair and my mom asked me today if I got it chemically straightened. I love this product. I should have ordered a spare. I still have never heard of them but they now have a regular customer. I did not get the chi smoothing serium as promised but instead it was biosilk. That was fine with me it works just as well.</li>
    <li> Got this hair straightener very quickly after my last one of five years bit the dust.  So far so good.  Love the sleeve for it and the quality of the product is very good.  I have very THICK long blonde hair and it is extra wavy near my scalp.  The 1&amp;#34; allows me to get close so I can pull the waves straight and it looks great and holds up for a few days.  I&#x27;m very impressed for the price and quality.</li>
    <li> I have thin and fragile hair, I use the lowest setting and it leaves my hair smooth and straight.</li>
    <li> Very good product! I have thick straight Asian hair, and this product helps me curl my hair into the exact style that I want: natural and cute.</li>
    <li> I used this straightener on my 3 year old niece, within 20 minutes the job was done and looked amazing! Mind you this lil&#x27; girls hair is super course and Afro!</li>
    <li> It is my second hair straightener and I love it! I have very thick, coarse and unruly Asian hair. I use the highest heat setting for my hair and it does wonders. My first straightener did nothing to my hair and this one is amazing! I am so glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Straightener works great. It was a gift for a family member and they loved it. The hair straightener was also a great price.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, I have wavy hair that is on the thick side and it&#x27;s always hard for me to find a good straightener that will do the job on the first time.  I&#x27;ve had other brands in the past and with my long hair they never seemed to get hot enough or do the job right the first time. This HSI flat iron does a remarkable job on my hair, it leaves it shiny and straight and can even curl the ends and flip it when I want. The 1\\&quot; plate is prefect  I just recently got my hair cut short and in many layers and this works like a charm. Straightening my hair has never been easier and look so shiny and good.</li>
    <li> While this iron isn&#x27;t as powerful as some pricier models, it does the job well at a great price. I got this because my girls are always fighting over the \\&quot;good\\&quot; straightener and this has stopped the arguments. :)</li>
    <li> The iron and the arrival timing is and was great.</li>
    <li> I have owned my Chi straightener for the past seven years. However, it recently wasn&#x27;t getting as hot as it used to and the power only came on intermittently. I reviewed 1\\&quot; flat iron reviews for DAYS and deliberated over spending over $100 on another Chi or going with the Amazon reviews and buying the HSI flat iron. I had never heard of this brand before nor had my friend who is a hair stylist. I signed up for a free trial of Amazon prime and received the flat iron 3 days after placing my order. I use my flat iron primarily for straightening my blunt bangs and for curling the rest of my hair. I have to say that this iron works just as well as my Chi did when I first got it. I think that it gets hotter than my Chi ever did and I haven&#x27;t even turned it up all the way yet. I love the green light that indicates when the iron is fully heated. In contrast to what some others have said about the grips on the outside of the iron, I enjoy having them as sometimes my hands will become slick with product with use. It is slightly heavier than my old Chi, but seems to be a sturdy product that will not easily break. All in all, it is half as much as the Chi and I am fully satisfied with the product thus far.</li>
    <li> Worked for exactly 32 days and the return policy is 30 days. So now I&#x27;m stuck with it!</li>
    <li> I rarely leave a product review but I thought it may help others save some $$ on their flat iron purchase. I have the type of hair (thick and curly) that really puts one of these tools to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the 1.5&amp;#34; Sedu ionic ceramic pro for years and last week it just pooped out on me. I had always gotten great results with this straightener and had debated on purchasing the same model but I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 so I started doing some research on other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I searched Amazon, this HSI pro popped up as a best seller and since it was highly rated by thousands of customers I figured I should give it a look. I always research reviews through other sources as well and I didn&#x27;t come across any negative feedback elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HSI Pro met all of the criteria I was looking for (ceramic tourmaline, ionic) but could it be comparable to the Sedu at $40. I ordered it so I could see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I counted down the days until my purchase was to arrive because my hair was a frizzy mess. I tore open the box immediately and oohed and aahed over the adorable storage pouch it came with and was thrilled with the quality of that and the full sized heat resistant glove that was included. AND-to my surprise, the straightener gave me the same results as my Sedu at almost 1/3rd the price! I was worried that the more narrow plate size (1&amp;#34; vs the Sedu&#x27;s 1.5&amp;#34;) would add time to the straightening process but it really didn&#x27;t. Also, I found that I was able to get closer to the root of my hair with the the smaller plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am very happy with my purchase and I guess the last aspect to compare to the Sedu is how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I love this iron! Not only can I iron my hair straight, but the design of the iron allows me to put soft curls in at the bottom so that my bangs frame my face, or flip out. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Great pair of flat irons!</li>
    <li> Im very satisfied with this straightener. It shipped very fast, straightens my hair very well and so glad i bought this instead the chi! Its so much cheaper than other good quality straighteners too!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve used.  I don&#x27;t have to put the heat on high to get it to work on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron to replace a cheap one I had bought years ago. Works really well - it only takes me a couple of minutes to straighten all my hair. It can get pretty hot though if you have it on the highest heat setting so it&#x27;s advisable to wear the glove that&#x27;s included if you&#x27;re going to set it to max. I also like that my hair doesn&#x27;t catch in the flat iron and rip it out like my old one did!</li>
    <li> Definitely glad this was on sale, because the original price was out of my budget.  It does the job wonderfully and puts my other $30 flat irons to shame.  Straightens hair in half the time my other irons did.  Heats up fast, too!  Comes in a great satin bag for storage and easy to pack for travel!  The switch inside the iron is in a perfect spot, other irons I used had the on/off switch near the handle and I&#x27;d accidentally turn it off sometimes.  Great product!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Styling my hair takes much less time.</li>
    <li> This is my first straightener and after reading through reviews of various straighteners, decided on this one. Works great! My daughter has very fine, thin hair and I have thick, coarse hair. It&#x27;s worked great for both of us. And for the price, I was impressed.</li>
    <li> Heats up good, but snags my hair bad, it feels like it is ripping my hair out.. Would not recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is terrific!  It heats up to full temperature in under 60 seconds, and holds its heat long enough for me to straighten my 34&amp;#34; long hair.</li>
    <li> Just learning how to use it.  So far it has been good</li>
    <li> Works just like a CHI straightener, maybe even better!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner for our trip to europe since the us straightners dont work there. I started using this straightner in us as soon as it was delivered and it is working very well in both us and europe. Specially love the argan oil that came with it as trial. Will surely buy that when i run out of my trial bottle.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace a similar straightener that I&#x27;ve had for 4 years. Looks identical, but did not straighten quite as well, but still positioned as needed. I&#x27;m not sure if it just didn&#x27;t get quite as hot. I love the pouch that was included, that will be great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after my Chi broke and I was hesitant on buying a new Chi due to the price.  I tried buying a Chi from TJ Maxx but when I plugged it in the lights in my house starting dimming on and off!  No flat iron is worth a blown fuse.  Sadly I returned the &amp;#34;too powerful&amp;#34; Chi and started looking for a different brand.  I stumbled onto the HSI and was intrigued by the very high reviews.  After having mine for almost two weeks now, I&#x27;m not sure what the fuss is about.  It&#x27;s ok...but nothing compared the Chi I had.  I guess you get what you pay for and I feel like I now own a $40 drugstore flat iron.  I have fine wavy hair so I thought maybe that was the problem but I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s thick wavy hair and it was no better.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what temperature setting I have it on, the results are just ok.  Even the feel of it is &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; than the Chi.  I&#x27;ll stick with this for now since I had the electrical issues with the new Chi I bought but I&#x27;m not thrilled.  Luckily I do not use a flat iron too often.  I miss my Chi.  :(</li>
    <li> This is a great high quality hair straightener at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Its pretty good flat iron, and for the price its unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to get a great quality but I did not. I got is as a gift fro my mom and she was not happy at all... Just few days after I gave it to her the flat iron quit working... :(&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this flat iron highly enough.  I read through all of the reviews before purchasing, and I agree with all of the positive ones.  If you need a flat iron that works quickly, look no further!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s  straightener broke and she needed a new one . Of course she wanted more expensive brand, but we couldn&#x27;t afford it. This one had good reviews and we purchased it. It s hard for me to give it a review, she used it only a couple of time. Her hair looked the same as it looked when she was using CHI. She liked that it came with a pouch and sample of argan oil.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! I used to have a Chi before and it finally broke, and I wasn&#x27;t sure I would find something that worked as well, but this one is great! It also has a little light on the side that is red when it is warming up and then green when it is hot enough, so you never have to guess. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Was hopping it would get hotter then it does ! Good for thinner hair but not my thick and semi curly hair it takes me over 30min to strait somewhat ! Always have lots of friz even with using argan oil !</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! I have fried a few of these in previous trips.  My wife can use the iron very effectively as a curling iron ( a lot of practice with&lt;br /&gt;the help of her hair dresser ).  It has the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;of a well made iron.  Packs well for travel in the included case.  Anyone who has shopped these&lt;br /&gt;Irons in a travel or hair products store will know what a great value it is.</li>
    <li> I have been straightening my hair for years now and I have always just bought one of the basic flat irons like Conair or Remington because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on something like a Chi iron. I&#x27;ve heard plenty of bad reviews on those as well so I wasn&#x27;t willing to take the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this iron when I was looking for argon oil (which I also love from HSI!) I decided to give it a try because the reviews were good and the price was reasonable (I got it for $39.99). It was definitely a great purchase! The temperature settings are great and it is so much more stable and sturdy than others I&#x27;ve tried. Nice and easy to use and great lasting results eapecially when using the argon oil as well. I&#x27;m very glad I gave this a try, so far I am very pleased with the HSI line of products!</li>
    <li> I have been straightening my hair for 4 years with my beloved Chi. It finally started to lose the scolding heat I had grown to appreciate. I didn&#x27;t want to purchase another because in the past few years, they changed the manufacturing company, and now they&#x27;re hit or miss. I was super excited for this straightener, especially for the price. I had debated for weeks over purchasing (I&#x27;m that skeptical), but with all the positive reviews how could it be bad? I got the package super quickly. I waited for perfect hair status to try it for the first time. I could not believe I received the same straightener in all these reviews. I&#x27;ll make a bullet list so I&#x27;m not rambling..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-This does not give you the \\&quot;board straight\\&quot; style that one might come to expect from a high quality straightener. It doesn&#x27;t define the layers. It&#x27;s a very rounded look, almost unfinished. I see that some like being able to use it to curl, but I have a curling iron for that. I want this to make my hair straight, dangit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-To me, it did not heat up that quickly. More importantly, it couldn&#x27;t keep the heat worth a darn. The green light would turn to red after every section of hair. I also wasn&#x27;t impressed with the maximum temperature. It just didn&#x27;t seem that hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The swivel cord is useless. It gets stuck constantly, which makes the product unstable and slides all over the place. I&#x27;m always worried it&#x27;s going to fall right off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t seem to clamp down tightly, which may be the reason it sucks at straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t stay straight! When I have used other straighteners, my hair will stay straight until it gets wet. In using this, I have a few waves back by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth through hair (I haven&#x27;t experienced any snagging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Good sample of the oil, cute satchel, useless glove. A nice touch , though. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As for other people&#x27;s concerns, Ican say, in my experience, I did receive the sample, glove and satchel. It did come quickly. The item seems decent quality, as far as construction. It did not snag my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I do find it VERY suspicious that every review that isn&#x27;t positive is immediately marked as unhelpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone whose hair is even slightly curly. This may be fine for mildly wavy hair, or for someone who wants to curl and straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, personally, have medium thick, wavy, dirty blonde hair, and it just doesn&#x27;t even come close to cutting it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I grow to regret the purchase more with every use. I tried the Remington Frizz Therapy straightener that my friend bought for less, and I prefer it to this. If I can return this, I will. If not, I&#x27;ll probably end up selling it at a garage sale and buying another brand.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, curly hair and this HSI Flat Iron works wonders on it!!  Fantastic product with an awesome price!  Hello straight hair; goodbye curly hair!  (and lets not forget an overdue farewell to the overpriced Chi Flat Iron)</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to take on a trip to China. Of course I needed a plug adapter, but the iron worked perfectly and I am thrilled. I have also used it in the USA with perfect results. This is a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick, she likes the adjustable heat settings and has zero complaints about the flat iron, good price point.</li>
    <li> This HSI flat iron is exceptional. I have wavy, frizzy hair and it works perfectly. I had to try it out a few times to get the hang of it, but once I did, it was easy to use.  Thank you so much, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap flat iron for years. My hair never looked shiny and never got completely &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;. This one seemed like a great deal. So far so good! It heats up super fast (and gets VERY hot..so be careful) and is easy to use. Perfect size for doing bangs too! It says that you can curl with it as well...I haven&#x27;t tried that out yet though.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron I have had many in my life and this is one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I have begged my mom to change her hair style... she has super curly hair and slightly frizzy. I bought this straightener for her birthday.This straightener has done wonders for her hair.... i raved about it so much to a coworker that i bought one for her as well. She loves it!. After my straightener stops working i will definitely be buying one of these. Gets the job done quick and looks great!</li>
    <li> I think I have had this straightener for at least 3 years if not longer and it still works fantastically.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this with her own money and swears by it.  Easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> having fairly straight hair naturally, i recently got a haircut that requires a bit more styling than just letting it air-dry (as i have most of my life). i&#x27;ve always been a bit afraid of too much heat-styling, and after a lot of reviews decided to go with this iron.  i love it! the packaging was amazingly cute and high-quality. i love the little travel bag that came with it. the glove is a nice touch too, though i don&#x27;t really use it. the plastic outside the iron does not get very hot, so i don&#x27;t have much fear of burning myself while styling. it also heats up pretty quickly, and i like the adjustable heat settings as well. overall, a great first product!</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical because of the price, although I went ahead and bought it. I tried it and it left my hair very nice and straight and shiny! My sister who has very course even liked it because she has a difficult time straightening her hair. I would definitely recommend it to my friends when they are shopping for a new straightener.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener gets hot really fast and the outside remains very cool so you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning yourself. I also am very happy that the cord attachment can rotate so the cord never gets tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Very good iron but I bought one a couple years back from Sally&#x27;s that was comparable for about $50. Tech tools, I believe is the brand. Honestly, can&#x27;t decide if my HSI is better or not. Definitely is a little bulkier than my other one is. I&#x27;m not dissatisfied just not totally wowed.</li>
    <li> I love my new HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron, it does an excellent job in straightening hair and the price and packaging was phenomenal (I paid $38.95). It does not curl hair as well as I was hoping but it really is a nice addition to my hair tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a quick turnaround,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend after listening to her complain about her other one breaking. I know nothing about hair straighteners but I came on amazon anyway and looked at ratings on this item and apparently they were all dead on. She is in love with this thing. I am not basically a hero over a $50.00 hair straightener. Perfect transaction.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing flat iron for many reasons. First, does a great job in a short period of time with minimal effort. Secondly, reaches the high temperarure it promises. Finally, after flat ironing no smokes odor is produced. And most importantly, very affordable! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it that much yet.. But I like it, it gets the job done &amp; it works really well &amp; gets very hot! But it straightens the kinkiest hair &amp; turns it bone straight.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my coarse, wavy hair. It leaves it smooth and shiny and lasts well into the second day as long as I touch up a little around my face. Great price.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and it seemed to last about a year and a half before it would intermittently start not working.</li>
    <li> Great item and very fast shipping</li>
    <li> I got this for my Granddaughter.  She was going on a trip to Europe.  I didn&#x27;t want to provide a review until I had a chance to talk to her about it.  She said she loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hair person but this is much easier to use than the flat iron I previously bought 10 years ago and really makes a difference when I actually do my hair. Seems to be the same as the popular chis and for this great price it&#x27;s totally worth a try. No clue about all the accessories that came with it but I can see the protective insulated sleeve could be quite helpful. Pretty sure I would be incapable of working with the glove or oil but it&#x27;s a nice touch. Certainly worth the try and my purchase price.</li>
    <li> Used it during international trip to Dubai and India.  It worked great !!  I would prefer this rather going to small travel iron.</li>
    <li> So, I just got this and let me tell you this is a fantastic flat iron.   It made my hair smooth, flat, &amp; shiny! :)  I have med-thick somewhat wavy hair and I only have to go over my hair 2x and viola great hair. This is one of the best purchases I have ever bought.  You will not be disappointed. I love my hair now:)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really put heat to my hair(only once or twice a year) but when I do I like to use a good product. My hair is naturally curly/wavy so I decided to add some heat to it but before I did I read some reviews on the best flat iron to use , I ALWAYS read a LOT reviews before deciding to buy a product so when I read the reviews for this flat iron I saw it had great reviews, so I purchased it, got it in a timely manner (which I really love), tried it out and LOVED IT!!!!! It straightened my hair beautifully, it remained straight until washed it again which was 2 weeks later, normally I wash my hair once a week but I wanted to see how long it would last and it lasted the full 2 weeks. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT. I probably won&#x27;t straighten my hair again for another year but when I do I  have the perfect tool to use. Not to mention the argan oil that came with it. Smells so good, and the shine it gave my hair left me smiling from ear to ear. :-) I recommend this tool to anyone who wants their hair bone straight. And the price was GREAT compared to it&#x27;s regular price. You couldn&#x27;t beat THAT price anywhere else!!!</li>
    <li> Shipment was received promptly.  Nice presentation, iron was in a satin bag.  Works like a charm and thanks for the free Tresomme!!</li>
    <li> This product blows the Chi straightener out of the water. My hair is straight, soft, and healthy within minutes. Also, my hair stays straight for longer, so I don&#x27;t have to restyle it the next day.</li>
    <li> I really liked the way it left my hair. The glove that comes with the flat iron is really helpful not to get burnt. Overall it&#x27;s a great product, and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Caribbean girl, I&#x27;m mixed thick curly hait and I relax, but the hsi flat iron showed a huge difference even my hair dresser bought and some after and she has the expensive salon brands...it gives ur hair a nice extra healthy shine. Dead straight or with a bounce depends on ur technique...</li>
    <li> I brought this straightener for my daughter to take to college.  Was not sure of the quality as we have had several name brand flat irons that weren&#x27;t that great.  My daughter loved these. We are of African American descent and have extremely coarse curly hair.  My daughter only had to go through her hair once and even did my hair. Absolutely love these. I plan to purchase a pair for myself as we&#x27;ll as the argon oil. Wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the straightener and the speedy delivery.  I would definitely order this product again.  It was exactly as stated.  Great price and outstanding results!  The added Argan Oil is amazing.  Even in the humid summer heat of Washington DC I have been able to keep the sleek look that I get with the use of the HSI straightener.</li>
    <li> This flat hair iron a great product.  It was great to get the traveling sleeve with it. The shipping was immediate and everything arrived just as described.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just used this flat iron yesterday for the first time and cannot believe how well it works. I have curly hair and not all flat irons work well for me, but this one is amazing! I let my curly hair air dry and then later in the day brushed through it, so it was very frizzy. Mind you, this was hours after I intended to use the flat iron. So the frizz was even worse. but this made my hair smooth and silky. The difference from one side to the other was incredible. Even my daughter who was helping me do my hair couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. So much so that she even wants one for herself! I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for 2 of my daughters for Christmas this past year.  One of my daughters accidentally dropped it and the plate cracked and she only had it for a couple of weeks.  I sent an email to HSI and explained that the plate on the flat iron had cracked.  After one or two emails they sent me a message telling me that they would take care of it and a new one would be shipped within the week.  They came through on their promise and I truly appreciate their wonderful customer service!  My daughters are very happy with their new flat irons!</li>
    <li> I had been trying to use a 2\\&quot; Conair flat iron I purchased many years ago, but it kept snagging and pulling my hair out. I decided to take a chance on this unit even though I thought I needed a 2\\&quot; iron. I have long hair. I was immediately in love! It heats up almost instantly and glide smoothly through my hair with not snagging. It now takes me less than 5 minutes to make my hair smooth and straight with no damage. I also really appreciated the sample bottle of the Argain Oil. It was just what I needed for my dry fine hair. I will be using that again.</li>
    <li> I really like the HSI flat iron. It leaves my hair so silky and straight. The argan oil is also great. I use the flat iron and finish it off with the argan oil and my hair looks and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I was used to paying well over $100.00 at least once a year for my previous curling irons.  The reviews I read about the HSI Ionic Flat Iron convinced me to try it soooo I bought one along WITH my usual $120.00 Flat iron.  The HSI iron arrived first and after I tried it once I was sold.  When the expensive iron arrived I sent it back the same day!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my Hot Tools ceramic tourmaline flat iron that bit the dust after a year or so of use.  I loved the Hot Tools iron but thought it should have lasted longer.  I limped along using an old flat iron for a few weeks until my hair look terrible.  I did my research, found the HSI and its great reviews and decided to give it a try.  WOW!  I shared with my co-workers that I&#x27;d ordered it and brought it to work for everyone to check out when it was delivered.  We used a coffee break to \\&quot;do hair\\&quot; and everyone agreed that hair was silkier and more shiny after just one use.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and I love how my hair looks and feels. I straighten after washing and drying and my hair needs only minor touchups for days until the next shampoo.  The unit is easy to handle and use, love the swivel cord and adjustable heat control.  The only drawback I&#x27;ve seen, albeit a minor and manageable one, is the controls seem awkwardly placed.  I don&#x27;t really have a better suggestion for where to place them but in my opinion their placement is odd.  May just be me.  I&#x27;d give this 5-stars on performance and price.  Great investment for anyone wanting to purchase a professional quality flat iron at a reasonable price. The Hot Tools iron didn&#x27;t hold a candle to the HSI!</li>
    <li> Best Flat Iron I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> HSI hair straightener works great, meets our expectations and was priced right.</li>
    <li> The first flat iron I received was defective but i contacted their customer service and received a brand new one right away. The product itself can match a chi. Other straighteners for this price cannot match!</li>
    <li> Used this flat iron on my recent trip to Peru. Worked fine. I have thick wavy hair. The flat iron got hot enough.</li>
    <li> Wow - my hair has never been better!  This flat iron is great - it curls and straightens.  My hair seems to be more manageable since using it.  I really like the oil they sent as a sample; it leaves my hair silky and shiny.  Glad I ordered.  It was delivered to my home very quickly.  The price was great, shipping free, what more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> great flat iron and great deal could not beat the price very happy with this one</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron so much and it is like I read in the positive reviews that people postedand i also loved that argan oil it came with. About the shipping order, wow it was amazing got it that same day I order it, it said I was going to receive it at 8pm and got it way before that at 4pm. Thank you ☺</li>
    <li> gets thick and unruly hair super sleek and soft</li>
    <li> Product works as it should so far. Received quickly.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair; you don&#x27;t get that burn smell and my hair is silky straight when I&#x27;m done. My last flat iron had burn marks all over and I&#x27;d have to cool it down, but this one is great its on a high setting and no burn!  It&#x27;s nice and sleek looking, easy to handle and really does the job!</li>
    <li> Good product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is defective, I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month and it has already died on me and does not work. I am very disappointed, I have tried different  outlets and to no avail it doesn&#x27;t turn on. Is there anything that can be done to help me? Is their a warranty that I rely on? Please help...</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I ever used! Delivery was fast!</li>
    <li> My daughter has super curly hair, and I was told that ceramic is better than the metal plated irons, so I purchased her a new flat iron.  She absolutely loves it.  Her hair actually feels soft afterwards, not dry and straw like.  It does a far better job of straightening her hair than the metal one did.  I highly recommend this iron to anyone who has coarse, curly hair that would like it to be straight.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> After the cord of my old flat iron almost blew up in my face, I decided to search amazon for a comparable replacement. I am pleased with my purchase. The iron heats quick and my hair feels like satin after it&#x27;s straightened. I love it!  I recommend HSI Professional to anyone looking for a great flat iron!</li>
    <li> Thank you for shipping my flat iron super quickly! I bought this product because it was recommended, and I am extremely happy with the results. I have Puerto Rican/African hair (3b/c) and the flat irons power really gives a nice kick! It doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle, and the results are nice and smooth. I usually purchase $80-$100 irons at Sallys, but this is a much better item for my budget. Luckily, you don&#x27;t have to sacrifice results for luxury, the ceramic plates make sure my fix is well maintained, and talk about baby ass smooth! I usually use olive oil hair sheen, and the argan oil was a delight to add in my hair (3-4 drops on my fingertips with a decent scalp massage after my hair was done did the trick) Honestly, if you&#x27;re looking for a decent tool with a pretty punch of power, GET THIS FLAT IRON!!! I already love mine :)</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron over the Chic which I never owned but heard about it. It&#x27;s lightweight, the velvet pouch and glove come in handy and love the end results. I would highly recommend this product. Kudos!!!</li>
    <li> HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment. WORLDWIDE DUAL VOLTAGE 110v-220v (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;It is 100% worth the money and the seller is one I will do more business with in the future. The product is working every bit as good as a Chi at a fraction of the cost</li>
    <li> The reason I ordered this straightener was the temperature control. I bought a straightener on the clearance shelf on an end aisle for $20 about two years ago. It is still going strong but it tends to burn mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair. I have had this for about 2 days and I am really impressed by this flat iron although I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for a $40 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up really fast&lt;br /&gt;Long swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;$40!&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable temperature control&lt;br /&gt;I have curly/wavy hair and works really fast&lt;br /&gt;Carrying pouch&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;No auto shut off&lt;br /&gt;Large plug in (I cannot plug in my straightener and blow dryer at the same time in the same outlet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking into a babyliss flat iron for some time now but I am glad I went with this instead (works just as well in my opinion).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.  After reading the reviews about this flat iron and understanding that the CHI that is sold on Amazon is not the salon quality we purchased this item.  So far she is loving it.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron primarily for international trips which require 220 volts. It works as perfect as it does on 110 volts. Amazing how fast it heats up and the level of heat settings it has. A great item to keep your hair in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> This is the second HSI I have purchased from Blue Novelties.  I LOVE it!  I have VERY curly and coarse hair.... with the Argain Oil (included WITH the flat iron) and a touch of protective spray my very coarse curly hair is sleek and soft!  This flat iron never burns my hair...and it gets hot enough to straighten on the first pass!  Love the iron and thanks to Blue Novelties again for such a quick delivery time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few CHIs in the past few years. While CHIs straighten like a charm, they are not very durable and break easy. My CHI broke and I thought this would be a decent replacement at a great price. From the minute I took this out of the box I could see it was a cheap piece of you-know-what. It is very light and hollow, not solid and sturdy like the CHI. The quality is very poor. The knob is cheap plastic and can barely turn. The iron doesn&#x27;t even heat up right at the highest setting and the &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; plates pull and snap your hair, instead of gliding through the hair like the CHI does. My hair didn&#x27;t even feel hot to the touch at the highest setting. Did not grip my fine hair at all and certainly didn&#x27;t straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product differed so greatly from my expectations that I felt compelled to warn others. From the volume of disappointed users and the even larger volume of &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; reviews I smell fake, hyped up reviews. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s worth paying more money to get a quality iron.</li>
    <li> This iron is great! I have semi wavy hair that was hard to straighten until I bought this iron. Great product and a great price. Unbeatable!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. My hair is fragile but this straightener never hurts my hair. Great product at reasonable price. Would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> i have very curly and frizzy hair. this straightener works really well. overall, i&#x27;m happy with it and am glad i purchased it.</li>
    <li> This worked well with my frizz - prone hair . My hair stayed silky after using this flat iron even here in the humid South . So glad I purchased it !</li>
    <li> I have always considered myself curling/flat iron challenged having only bad experiences with these types of products in the past. My daughter has owned some popular brand flat irons that quickly lost their appeal. I chose HSI Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron mainly for price and features when compared to similar flat irons. I am more than pleased with this product. I get great results without crimping or burning my hair in the process, and compliments on my new hair style! I recommend this product for both experienced and the inexperienced user.</li>
    <li> I have VERY Thick VERY Coarse long hair. Since my previous iron quit on me I needed to find a decent flat iron without spending a fortune. As soon as I opened the package I plugged it in to try. I set it to the highest setting and it heated up exceptionally quick and I was able to flat iron my hair just the way I love it very easily. LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Also the glove they include was nice to use so you don&#x27;t burn your hand.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser told me that my old flat iron was ruining my hair.  I asked what type she used.  She said HSI.  So I got the exact one she uses daily as a gold level Aveda stylist.  What a difference the right tool makes!  This is a terrific product that will not scorch color treated hair.  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> My sister has one and I had used it and loved it! So much better than the cheap ones that you buy in a discount store!</li>
    <li> After reading many positive reviews, I was so excited to try out this flat iron. Sadly, it fell far short of my expectations. I thought the price ($40 at the time of my purchase) was too good to be true but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. After all, it has 13,000+ reviews and a 4.4 star rating. Anyway, I don&#x27;t usually keep flat irons at the top heat level, but I kept having to turn the heat higher, and higher and higher... even at the top setting (400+ degrees) it doesn&#x27;t feel hot enough to really straighten my hair. I have to run the iron down my hair 5-6 times before it begins to straighten. My basically straight hair is sort of &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; in the humid summer, but not curly in the least and my cheap, 6-year-old straightener from Target works better than this one. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if my iron is defective since most reviewers seem to love theirs, but I just can&#x27;t bring my self to rate more than 3 stars at this time.</li>
    <li> The service was very good. The product seems great - only problem, is me.&lt;br /&gt;I need practice handling it and getting hair just right. It will come in time. :)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like it. She was impressed with the quality of it.</li>
    <li> The product works great and I got it sooner than expected! Good Job!</li>
    <li> Great product shipped on time</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you can adjust the heat of the iron and that it comes with a really nice pouch. The downside is that it is heavy. I have thick course wavy hair and I am able to get it straight and even with a bit of shine to it, but you need to iron your hair out in small sections. So far I like it but I am not wowed by it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product i&#x27;ve had 3 over the years and bought one for my daughter and she loves it also.</li>
    <li> Just received my new flat iron and gave it a quick try. Amazing! This is just what I need for my short, curly, thick hair.  I had it on the highest setting, but did need to turn it down. This iron works so quickly!  With short hair it is hard to use a wider flat iron or a curling iron (ouch!). This one allows me to get close to my scalp without burning myself. In the past I still had waviness to my hair that I could not straighten (wavy bangs) One pass with this iron and I have smooth, straight hair. I am not a high maintenance person, (liking to spend exorbitant amounts of time on hair and makeup), however, I have high maintenance hair.  I was able to do my hair in 5 minutes and am extremely happy with the results!  Did not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a flat iron.  This was approximately $40 and I can&#x27;t imagine that a more expensive iron could have any better results.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener/flat iron works great.  I owned a Chi for many years and wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the HSI, but this model is smooth and easy to use.  The item glides and straightens.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Ugh I despise this straightener. I bought it based on the great reviews on amazon, but after using it I decided that it was just a waste. When I straighten my hair, it ends up frizzy and kinky. It curls great, but at the top, the frizz and kink is still very visible.  I usually use the CHI but after my last one died after many years, I wanted to switch  it up. What a shame, I should have just paid extra for the CHI.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this flat iron and love how quickly it shipped.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> It works magic I love it and it heats up super fast .</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for years and know how it is supposed to work and this flat iron doesn&#x27;t.  The plates seem to drag rather than glide across my hair, and when I get to the ends it is almost like they get snagged on the plates.  I just can&#x27;t figure this one out, so it&#x27;s back in the box and in the cabinet and I&#x27;ll keep on using the old one</li>
    <li> works amazing, quick delivery</li>
    <li> My flat iron came earlier then expected and I love it</li>
    <li> I have long naturally curly hair and straightening it is usually a 2 hour process. This straightener took only 25 minutes for ALL of my hair. Best straightener I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!  Works great!  Only negative I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off!</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and my daughter, we both love it!  Have had expensive flat irons &amp; this one beats the others hands down!</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a great flat iron!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SIZE AND ALSO THE GLOVE THAT CAME WITH IT - GETS HOT ENOUGH TO STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR</li>
    <li> love this no complaints</li>
    <li> The flat iron is awesome.  However the shipping was very bad.  It came with a bottle of Argan oil and the lid on it was loose.  So all the oil soaked into the beautiful red carrying case making a big stain.</li>
    <li> As good as a Chi, but way less expensive!  It has a super long power cord.  It heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I had many problems with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s extraordinarily heavy. Not good if you have a head of very thick hair and need to use it for more than a few minutes, as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t get particularly hot. Again, not good for thick, very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The cross hatching along the handles is extremely uncomfortable. I got a blister on my thumb after using it for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Within a month, both ceramic plates had cracked. One even cracked so severely as to lose an entire triangle-shaped chunk. I broke a few strands before I realized it had broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. For the same price, you can get far better equipment. Shop around a bit more before settling for this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> The best straightener I have ever used, and I have had many! I highly recommend this product! You will not be disappointed, I promise.</li>
    <li> Very pleased it heats up fast and I have thick hair so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would straighten but it works wonderful</li>
    <li> This product far exceeds expectations.  The price is well worth the money. The floating plates don&#x27;t snag my hair at all!  Plates also heat up super fast and evenly. I love this product. I would buy this product again if I had to and I would buy it as a gift. I also believe it would be good for all hair types my hair is a medium course texture and it straightens my hair quickly. Nice smooth and sleek finish.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Comes with a heat resistant glove and a nice carrying sleeve. I got this on the recommendation of my hairdresser. I love it! This iron heats up fast and gets hot! I have perfectly smooth hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It gets the job done well and I love the fact that you can use it for curling too!</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener! You can adjust the heat however you like, it heats up very quickly! You can also use this to curl you&#x27;re hair it works very nicely for that as well. The only thing it&#x27;s missing is the auto shut off feature. I have caught myself leaving it on and forgetting about it, other than that great product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m asian. I have verrrry thick hair.  I&#x27;ve had all kinds of flat irons - cheap ones that don&#x27;t work, an expensive one that really worked (sadly, it broke after 4 years) and this mid-range one that is so so.  If I could go back in time, I would have spent the extra money to get the same kind of flat iron I had before. This one takes longer to straighten my hair and sometimes it feels like it&#x27;s pulling my hair out.</li>
    <li> My wife was not sure if she wanted this straightener or one called a chee. She liked the price of this one, and said it sounded like it was similar. After she bought it, she said it was great. She did say it did not get quite as hot as a chee, but that it worked great for her type of hair. (it&#x27;s thick and really curly)</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter loves it...great price for what you receive and good quality.  This flat iron has all the features as the one I use that I paid four times the amount.</li>
    <li> if works great. I bought one for my sister and then decided to buy one for myself. just a bit dissapointed that the plates are pretty short.&lt;br /&gt;but over all works great!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this flat iron.  Although it did glide through my hair nicely, I could not tell how hot it was and the dial was in the inside of the flat iron which made it very difficult to adjust.  There was no display to tell the heat setting or what the temperature was.  I did send the iron back as I didn&#x27;t think it was working properly.</li>
    <li> its beautiful and really helpful . i wanna make sure my hair in the correct way. so i need it</li>
    <li> It is very well made, easy to use and does a great job!  I would highly recommend this straightener to everyone!</li>
    <li> works much better than my $200 flat iron I purchased a few years ago.. very happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> As a professional hair stylist, I found this product to be excellent~!!! Regulated heat makes this tool perfect for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this iron.  I am just getting ready to use these types of irons.  So, I can only speak on what my daughter and granddaughters have told me and that is the love the iron.</li>
    <li> Quality while it lasted...bought this for my wife a while back who needed a good flat iron for home use.  While it worked great in the beginning it quickly proved why it&#x27;s so affordable.  One of the ceramic plates has since cracked and now pulls and breaks at her hair while attempting to use the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good flat iron for short term use, proceed.  If you are searching for something that&#x27;s going to last a few years....continue looking.</li>
    <li> Does a great job! It heats ups quickly and it worked great for curling and straightening my hair. It does pull on your hair every now and then but not so much that it deserves to bumped downed to four stars.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Great price! Heats up fast and does it&#x27;s job! Worth more than I paid. Shipped faster than estimated date. I give this iron 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Flat iron works very well, and the price is great too.  My friend bought three of them, for herself and her daughters. The flat irons are great quality.</li>
    <li> My flat iron mysteriously died so I needed to make a decision and buy a new one fast. I knew I wanted and ionic and I also knew it would be expensive. I was surprised to find one that looked exactly like what I wanted for such a good price; I figured even if I wasn&#x27;t happy , no big deal. Well I actually am very happy! This flat iron came in a beautiful satin bag with a heat protective glove and a sample of argan oil. The bag is pretty and keeps everything in order when it isn&#x27;t in use. The oil is silky and makes your hair shiny but doesn&#x27;t weight it down at all. And the glove is useful especially of you need to lead the hair section around the closed shell of the iron with your other hand for waves and curls. As for how the iron works, I love it. It doesn&#x27;t fry my long, fine, wavy, processed hair, so I know it will be great on others! I really lucked out. I would definitely recommend this iron; it was an excellent purchase and the seller was also kind and professional.</li>
    <li> The thermostat is inside a very difficult to get to...really bad design</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good flat iron, especially for the price.  I give it four stars because I feel that it does pull at the ends of the hair rather than gliding through the entire length and so you have to be carefully with how much pressure you are applying. Also my hair isn&#x27;t able to resist humidity and remain straight as it has with other flat irons.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have thick unruly hair and this does wonders!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my little sister. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  It works as well as some other high-end straightners I have have used.</li>
    <li> Honestly this straightener wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping with all the five star reviews. But, I guess you get what you pay for at $40(I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending more than that on this one). It gets the job done, but it sometimes takes several runs over to get it straight, and if I step outside and there&#x27;s any moisture in the air at all, it curls right back up. With some straighteners they can keep even with conditions! Kinda wish I&#x27;d just invested in a straightener a little bit more pricey like a sutra.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these for my 15 year old daughter and she just loves it!  She has had other ones in the past, but this thing rocks and her hair looked so beautiful after just one use.  Great price and got it in only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an expensive product sold to my daughter at her hair salon which only lasted a few months. Very glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this product and how well it works for the cheap price that I bought it</li>
    <li> It really is a great fast working piece. I don&#x27;t gave a lot of time in the am, like most ppl and this for the job done and fast. It has a carrying kit for travel and the glove seems funny but saved me from many hand burns.</li>
    <li> Love!!! Best iron I ever had!!!</li>
    <li> it gets way too hot even on the lowest setting. Be very careful with it if you buy it!  If you have thin fine hair I would suggest not getting this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I think this product is not hot enough for my hair type.I do not get the silky feeling and my hair is not as straight as I would like it, but I will keep using this tool for a while, until I find the right one for me.</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist and I love this flat iron. I have personally ordered several of them for my customers and have given the information to others that were interested in them based upon my recommendation.  I will continue to use these flat irons as long as they continue to offer a quality product.</li>
    <li> My 13 year got this for her birthday, she loves the glove that comes with it and liked the sample of argan oil also (we&#x27;ll be getting more of that). She is mixed and has ringlet curls and this really straightens her hair well however it does not curl her hair that is her only complaint.</li>
    <li> Great item!! Smooth ordering process. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great straighter.  I like that I can control the temperature.  Works really well and at a great price point.  Would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, comes with a great case and serum.</li>
    <li> Quick and Fast! Thanks</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  The price is excellent compared to similar models and the choice of heating temps./on and off switch, and movable cord is nice.  No more tangled cord.</li>
    <li> Awesome price. Awesome product. I love it.....better than my old chi. I can straighten my wavy/curly hair in half the time and curl it when I want to without it being an all afternoon ordeal.</li>
    <li> I love it! I like the fact that you can set the heat level - don&#x27;t want it getting too hot as I have coloured hair and don&#x27;t want to damage it!  It heats up quickly, and I like the grip effect on the handles. To sum up, great product and real value for the money!</li>
    <li> I could not believe the reasonable price for such a great flat iron.  It works great and completely exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing this product because of the reviews it had, but after i gave it a shot i Loved it. It really works especially since I have Thick curly hair I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work on my hair.. But it did!!!</li>
    <li> After several years, my CHI died on me, so I bought this flat iron because of the many great reviews.  However, the HSI did not seem to get hot enough/maintain heat and it kept snagging my hair which is normally very easy to straighten.      It was very simple to return and HSI refunded all of my money and that is why my rating is as high as it is.  I ended up going with the Cricket Friction Free Iron from Sally Beauty Supply which was actually $20 less and works even better than my $90 CHI did.  My sister is a stylist and recommended the Cricket to me.    Also, the sample serum that it comes with is not Bio Silk as noted in the description, but HSI.  It also came with a glove and a satiny storage bag.</li>
    <li> As good as it gets for the money. Had to put it at the highest temp setting for it to actually straighten my hair, but gets the job done</li>
    <li> I have used a chi and Conair flat irons and wanted to try HSI and this sounded like a good offer but I was very disappointed in the product.  my Conair that I got @ cvs for @$25.00 does so much better than this item... seems like it is poorly made or the product is made of cheap material.</li>
    <li> I hate this flat iron. I&#x27;m use to a titanium iron. Will never by ceramic again. Never again. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on so many good reviews, but it does not live up to all the hype. I had used another flat iron for a year with no problems until it died suddenly one day. I thought this would be a good replacement without breaking the bank. It did flatten my hair, but it also gave me a lot of breakage and made my hair very dry. I do not reccomend at all.</li>
    <li> My other straightener quit on me, so I was in a hurry to get a new one.  I looked around in stores and online, and read lots of customer reviews for various products.  This straightener seemed to be well-liked by all, and although I hadn&#x27;t heard of the brand before I decided to give it a try.  This turned out to be a very rewarding purchase!  I hadn&#x27;t realized how quick straightening my hair could be - which is saying something, b/c mine is pretty thick and crazy.  This tool gets hot and stays hot.  It&#x27;s well designed and versatile.  I would happily recommend it!  And the cherry on top?  It&#x27;s cheaper than a CHI!</li>
    <li> If I could, I would!  Have bought lots of other cheap brand flat irons - figured they were all the same.  Got tired of my hair dragging in the iron and then getting caught in the ends and being pulled out.  Finally decided to go on Amazon and do a little research.  I came across this little guy and within a day or so, decided to buy it.  I have had it for several months, if not a year now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I actually use it to curl my hair.  No more dragging or pulling my hair out.  I would highly recommend it.  I may even get another one for travel and get rid of my other cheap one.</li>
    <li> It may be a 5 star but just started using it. Like it much better than one used previously. But still on learning curve using it. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!! Heats up super fast, minimal time to straighten, and makes super cute curls!! :) I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I brought the HSI straightener without the LCD screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING:&lt;br /&gt;When I first received it, I noticed that the box the straightener is contained in is easy to access/ remove. The straightener is in a pull-out box with no tapes or tabs. In other words, if a customer returns the flat iron the company can simply insert the straightener back in the box and there would be no tape marks/ signs of opening. However, being a suspicious person I am,I had a feeling they sent me a tampered/ returned flat iron. The straightener just didn&#x27;t look as if it came brand new. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESIGN:&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the design. It was sleek and had diamond details on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE:&lt;br /&gt;I brought a cheaper flat iron ($20) at Walmart and it heats up faster than this HSI straightener. I have short, coarse hair and this straightener snags my hair.It snagged more when I put my TreSemme heat protectant on. I do not recommend this if you have short coarse, brittle hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, thank goodness this didn&#x27;t cost me a fortune. This product didn&#x27;t work for me and I won&#x27;t be recommending it to anyone I know. I won&#x27;t be returning this, but I sure won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing I dislike about this product.  It works very well!  It is exactly as the description said it would be.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item now, twice, and both times have received a defective product.  One of the plates did not heat on the first one and the second one barely heats up.  I have a cheapy straightener that only heats to 210 and I don&#x27;t even have it turned all the way up and it works wonders.  This one supposedly heats to 410, I have it cranked all the way up, and it does not do anything.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a bad batch from this seller or a knock off or something, but I don&#x27;t want it.  Now the seller is asking me to pay for return shipping...let&#x27;s see how this goes!</li>
    <li> My Chi straightener broke and I was looking for a replacement. After searching Amazon, I purchased this one because of the positive reviews. I have only used it a few times so far, but so far it&#x27;s awesome! Straightens my hair perfectly. I would highly recommend it, especially for such a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> Since I had my hair straightened 2 months ago, I used this product only once to test it and liked it. I didn&#x27;t like the hair treatment oil because of the strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t comment but felt I must this time. I carefully reviewed all written reviews for the various Chi and HSI irons. Almost  everything I needed to know  was  in the reviews.  The only thing not mentioned was that there is a \\&quot;ready\\&quot; light that indicates when the temperature set has been reached.  NICE surprise!  Also, there seems to be a piece of rubber attached to the iron that you could use to hang the iron when not in use??  I also am pleased with the ease of operation and how ergonomically correct it is to hold and manipulate to style my hair.  I would highly recommend this product over the chi, which is much more expensive and the HSI to me is much better all around.  I have long hair that is thick, wavy and fine.  I set the temperature lower than I  had to with the CHI and to my surprise I didn&#x27;t have \\&quot;burning hair or hot lines \\&quot;  AND my hair was beautiful, shiny, smooth, silky:))  VERY PLEASED!!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!!  my first one broke... Dropped it on the tile floor.  Had to have another one!!!  Love love love!</li>
    <li> Worst purchase EVER!  I bought it because it had one of the best reviews for dual voltage. I could use it in Europe and here in the U.S. I stayed in 7 hotels and a cruise ship and it did not work in any of them!!!!!  A waste of money and luggage space.</li>
    <li> It works great and it&#x27;s offered at a more than fair price.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> It takes a good (usually very expensive) flat iron to get my curly, thick hair straight. The HSI worked perfectly. However I have gone through 2 of them in a short amount of time because of the cord breaking apart exposing the wires which could result in something horrible.</li>
    <li> Most amazing straightener I have ever used! My hair actually feels softer and more easy to run my fingers though after using and that has NEVER happened with another straightener. Got my hair very straight, fast and easy. I tried to use it to curl and only did a small portion but it looked amazing! It heats up super fast and seems like it would be very hard to accidentally burn yourself with this. I love the swivel at the top of the cord and the nice long cord. I can&#x27;t see this ever getting all twisted up. I also adore that the power is a switch and not a button. All in all best 44$ i have ever spent!</li>
    <li> Love this product for the low price it gets the e job done.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves how nice this flat iron works.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly and works to straighten&lt;br /&gt;hair easily.  Would recommend this sight&lt;br /&gt;and product to others.</li>
    <li> This is my second straightener and I love it so much. This HSI makes my hair straight all day and also so satisfied to bought this from AMAZON. I place order Friday night and I got the package on Monday. So recommended. Moreover, this is also dual voltage so it&#x27;s easy for someone who travel a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this straightener. I use to have a chi and I like HSI much more. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a straightner.</li>
    <li> I have bought everything from CHI to GHD straighteners; that have cost double if not triple what i paid for the HSI iron and I have to say, this item matches, if not beats the others products I&#x27;ve tried! Gets hot fast, has temperature control, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair, and LEAVES it straight and shinny! LOVE LOVE LOVE this iron!</li>
    <li> the temperature adjustment is very nice. Great product at a great price and arrived promptly. The one inch is so much better than my old two inch non-ceramic straight iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this one because it&#x27;s highly rated, I think it deserves it rating. It&#x27;s a quality product... high quality materials and a good weight to it. It comes with a nice pouch (carrying case) in a shiny/slick box. In my case, it came with a trial straightening hair product (Aragon oil item). I like it and would recommend this brand. I also love their Aragon oil product. Nice items.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. The shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Great! Great! Great! 100% recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Before buying this product I read a few reviews about this product. Most of them were saying that the straightener worked well. Now I agree. It makes my hair shiny and straightness it pretty quickly. The handy pouch for this flat iron is great too. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look more attractive, shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> Nice product..nice price</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like my CHI iron did and it has a temperature setting. The price is nice, too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightner after my cheap one from Target broke. After reading the reviews on Amazon and price shopping I decided to get this straightner. For $44 this was one heck of a deal!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using it for only a few days now. It did come with Argan Oil instead of the \\&quot;biosilk\\&quot; as it advertised but I was fine with that since Aragn Oil has become my go to hair product. I&#x27;m a bit disppointed with the product though. Yeah it gets the job done, but I was expecting something from a product that is worth $299. My cheapie from Target does just a well of a job as this straightner. It heats up slower than my target one, and doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as I was hoping and I practically have the dial almost all the way up! I have medium thick hair and I have to run this straightner through it a few times more than what I should be. So while the price is great for the product and it&#x27;s pretty much what I would spend at Walmart or Target for a straightner anyways, I&#x27;m just saying that if you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; hair straightner I would go ahead and buy a Chi or ISO...</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, IT WORKS WELL. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This straightener gets hot enough to really straighten my hair! If you use the argon oil, it keeps it shiny and doesn&#x27;t burn the hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair and it works perfectly. Great value!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works amazing!  It has great reviews, worth buying. Especially for this great price. My hair looks great, has great shine to it and loves how it curls. If you&#x27;re looking for a great deal, this is it!.</li>
    <li> I had my Chi for about 8 years until it finally died. I read such great reviews of this HSI straightener and was excited to have such a great product at an amazing price. When I first started using it, I noticed my hair would catch on the plate mounts every time I swiped it. Not really a major problem, just an annoying inconvenience. I have had this straightener for about 6 months and one of the heating plates is falling off. I am quite disappointed with the product overall.</li>
    <li> My hair was shiny and very straight. Love the fact it came with a glove to protect your fingers from the heat.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  It works great!  The day I received it in the mail it had been raining all day.  I had straightened my hair twice that day already with my old flat iron and so when this one came in I immediately tried it out.  It worked great!  I love how I can adjust the temperature...I couldn&#x27;t do that on my old one.  I didn&#x27;t have to straighten my hair the rest of the day!!</li>
    <li> Horrible sound. It honestly sounds like the headphones are popped. The color was nice but the sound was just horrible.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have purchased...</li>
    <li> I was really wanting to love this...  But it stank up my house so badly, I couldn&#x27;t keep it.  It also made my hair stink.  I know it&#x27;s getting rave reviews, but it felt cheap to me.  It&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting another brand for about $50, and love it.  This HSI did straighten my hair, but the flat iron that I ended up keeping instead makes my hair feel much much much softer and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, beach-wavy, dirty blonde hair.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and does a WONDERFUL job!!!! Happy to see that it also comes with a 1 year warranty. No more stealing my daughter&#x27;s straightener any more!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  It seems to be very good quality and came with a storage pouch, heat resistant glove and small bottle of oil for your hair.  It leaves her hair shiny and smooth and does not damage it as her last inexpensive flat iron did.  Would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So I gave this product 3 stars because it does work great (especially on my tight ringlet curls) When I broke my first one, after 3 months, I bought another one since it works so well without much damage to the hair. But...after my second one broke after falling from the sink five times, I realized this product is not durable to withstand my life style. If you can keep the straighter from ever falling from a few feet than I highly recommend it but seeking something that will last you longer than a year, than try something else.</li>
    <li> i was in search of hair straightener related product which can operate on dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;i am giving surprise gift it to my wife, also i don&#x27;t want a headache of using voltage converter all the when she will be using it.&lt;br /&gt;i just check for its heating functionality, it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;expecting same results when my wife will be using it in India.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after my Jibere Tourmaline died after a faithful, yet monogamous 7 years (my current longest relationship, RIP). I still don&#x27;t want to talk about it... I was enthralled when the box came to my door after not being able to straighten my hair for nearly a week (that&#x27;s like a decade in hair years). I may have even danced &amp; squealed like a high school girl being asked to the dance as I plugged it in... It&#x27;s all quite vague to me now. As I opened the box, I remember the silkiness of the red travel bag it comes with being like that of the finest silk, fit for only a queen. With expectations high, I gently clamped down on my long black hair, and pulled the HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron through it... The clouds didn&#x27;t part, heavens pearly gates didn&#x27;t open, and the choir of angels didn&#x27;t start their rendition of &amp;#34;Hallelujah&amp;#34;. I then debated the thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t give the HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron enough time to warm up. After all, the excitement of receiving it on my front door step may have deterred me from the sound logic that Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day, and just like Rome, the HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron must have needed more time to heat up. Just like the beginning of any relationship, I gave the hair straightener more time to get it together. After several minutes passed, with one swift but steady move (like that of a ninja), I once again pulled the heated plates through my hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The purest form of disappointment then began to flood my pearly gates and drowned me and my hair in its sorrows. Not only did it not work, but it also ripped my flowing hair from my scalp. The HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron has now become something of the passed. It remains a dark chapter in my life that I would like to continue to keep closed and I think you should debate this fate as well. If you want sloppy seconds (and I mean SLOPPY), be my guest. But if you&#x27;re looking for a hair straightener fit for Gods, I recommend looking somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Moral of the story: There&#x27;s nothing like your first...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Devo</li>
    <li> This is a great product- I had no idea it existed! Wish I&#x27;d known about it, very happy with the way it helps my hair maintain its shine and literally no frizz!</li>
    <li> In love with this straightener!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good flat iron. Not great. Leaves my hair very soft after straightening, but not very straight. I have very fine, kinky hair. Previously used a ConAir I purchased from Target that surprisingly worked wonders. Have to turn the dial all the way up on the HSI to get the ConAir results. Pros? Doesn&#x27;t snag, great packaging, no scorching. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have course, thick hair. This works really fast and easily. It&#x27;s not too heavy and the temperature goes up to 410. My hair works better with the higher settings. The price is excellent for the product!</li>
    <li> great product!  Love the ability to dial the amount of heat I want.  Very happy ;)  Loved the ease of order and the great shipping time as I do not have Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> My hair is very long and thick. It&#x27;s very hard to straighten. But this does just fine. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Before I bought the HSI flat iron I had spent soooo much money on different ones trying to find the PERFECT one.. All the other ones would fry the ends of my hair and leave them crunchy!!! Plus I have super thick naturally curly hair. I actually used the flat iron for the first time after going to bed with wet hair and literally only had to go over my hair once &amp; not multiple times with the flat iron!  I finally convinced my husband to let me buy this one.. Simply because I was tired of spending more money trying to find the right one (I had 5 that just weren&#x27;t what I wanted) I just KNEW this one would be perfect and it is!!! After I flat iron my hair it is smooth and NO fried ends!! I&#x27;m absolutely in LOVE with this flat iron &amp; I recommend it to EVERY woman that has the same problem as I do! Plus the oil that I had recieved with it smells AMAZING leaves my hair so shiny &amp; soft! Thank you HSI for the BEST FLAT IRON EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome - especially for the price! Heats up quickly and works super fast. I love it!</li>
    <li> I loooove this product!! The argan oil is wonderful also. I have had my share of flat irons and these are the best yet. My hair felt healthier and shinier after the first use.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have biracial curly semi-coarse hair and for the past year have been growing out years worth of relaxers. I like to straighten my hair in the cooler, less humid months of the year so I need an iron that would straighten my hair and make it look like I have a relaxer without having to repress everyday. This does the trick. When I&#x27;m finished my hair is silky and shiny and holds the press perfectly. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good hot iron that doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. I liked the sample of oil received with the iron, it smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> great flat iron... love it...  if you use on high your hair will be stick straight... use on 3/4 power for regular use</li>
    <li> I just got my flat iron yesterday and oppened right away, my hair was a mess and let it heat to the max and to my surprise it worked like a charm, i have very thick, freezy hair after using irons from walmart and just wasting my money with them i decided to go for this one and coundt be hhappier ....  if you are lookign for a professional iron and dont wanna expend a lot of money go for this one , is GREAT !!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love how it heat quickly!</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and does a decent job straightening hair. It takes a long time to fully straighten hair though.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a good product, heats up quickly, and stays hot. Easy to hold and I like the swivel cord, no more tangles.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron, by far. I had another professional flat iron and it doesn&#x27;t even compare with this one. This heats up extremely fast and stays hot. It takes very little time to striaghten my hair. LOVE it...huge time saver in the early morning. I would highly recommend this product. The price was amazing and it was here before the promised date. Great service from this company!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron after my solia tourmaline ceramic ion flat iron died on me after 4 years. So far it is comparable in function. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the bit of friction it has when straightening chunks of hair right at the ends. It doesn&#x27;t let the hair flow through with ease like my previous flat iron. But, it&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the listed price.</li>
    <li> Everything with the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline  has been great.  The first time I used the hair straightener I received many compliments about my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because of the reviews and that its best selling. However I am very disappointed. I&#x27;ve had many straighteners that makes your hair straight and silky which this straightener doesn&#x27;t seem to do. The other straighteners are more or less cheaper than this. This makes your hair straight but doesnt give you that shine that I always get with other straighteners. Just thought I&#x27;d share my experience.</li>
    <li> Great iron... Easily straightens  with just one pass through your hair  Love the Argon oil</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron.  It works wonderfully and heats up very quickly!</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best! I love it. It makes my coarse wavy hair smooth and soft. The glove is gigantic and the \\&quot;free biosilk sample\\&quot; is not biosilk at all. In fact it says \\&quot;argain oil\\&quot; but I am assuming they mean argan oil?   Regardless, buy it! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> When I first received this flat iron, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it, especially considering how reasonably priced it was.  I love that it came with several accessories - a heat glove, a storage bag, and a sample of argan oil - and that I&#x27;m able to use a LOWER temperature to get my hair straight.  It also has a \\&quot;ready\\&quot; light that goes from red to green when it&#x27;s heated to the temperature selected.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and, as I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever, I expect it to last a while.  I recommend!</li>
    <li> i love it much,, &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a chi and a ghd and the hsi is my favorite flat iron yet.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this as a replacement. It hipped quickly and she&#x27;s been happy with it since she tried it out.</li>
    <li> I have a short, angled bob, and this contraption seems to work fairly well.  I think it would probably work best if your hair is longer, but it still makes my hair look pretty cute.  I do recommend this, but I have to say my arm gets a work out and gets sore, by the time I switch sides!  But all in all, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> The Iron is great. I have thin hair so I don&#x27;t have to use the hottest setting, but it works really well and leaves my hair straight and shiny. My husband is bald and does not use this product. The glove is really big, I don&#x27;t use it, but if you wanted to it might fit a little wonky.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase of the HSI Professional ceramic Ionic Flat Iron.  The product was delivered in a prompt manner and has worked very well</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and still opted to buy it. Wish I would have listened. It&#x27;s a decent price, but I could have used the money to put towards a better one. I have frizzy hair thick hair, not horrible but I&#x27;ve never had such issues. I will literarily straighten the same piece 2-3 times. It heats up then cools down after 2 minutes of my using it. Stay away!!!</li>
    <li> My previous iron was burning my hair so I asked my hair stylist about a good brand and she recommended this one to me.  It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Item came just as described and I am loving my flat iron. It works great!  And the little argan oil that comes with it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife she likes it the only thing she complains about is too many strokes to straighten her. Other than that she likes it.</li>
    <li> I got this a gift she never been happier :) thank you.</li>
    <li> This straightener does not get as hot as my last one. It takes alot longer to do my hair than before. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The item I received is probably used or refurbished. There was greasy dirty inside all the edges and some minor scratches. Gross! There was no glove nor argan oil sample. Returned.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my sister. I was worried because her hair is extremely curly! But it was perfect It makes your hair look so silky and not oily! She loves it so much she couldn&#x27;t be happier with her gift.</li>
    <li> So I got this flat iron based solely on the reviews its been getting (and maybe the price didn&#x27;t hurt either lol) . And let me start by saying that I have owned well over 10 flat irons and I must say this is definitely one of the top ones. I love the fact that you can control the heat, the packaging was awesome and you can tell it was brand new, the fact that it came with a glove and oil was a bonus.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron and was so happy when I received it so quickly.  I have had a chi in the past and it did not last a year.  I used this iron for the first time and love it.  It is easy to handle, heats up quickly and works better than the chi I had.  I would recommend it and an happy i ordered it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new straight iron after my chi broke.  I read several reviews about this brand and have been very pleased!!This is a great iron and I love that you can control the heat setting!</li>
    <li> I shared my curly unruly hair with my daughter. Both of us have tried various flat irons in an attempt to bring our ringlets under control with mixed results but the HSI professional flat iron has worked wonders. My daughter can now accomplish in 10 minutes what took her 40 minutes to do with other products. Her hair is straight and shiny with frizz. She is so happy that I bought this. I haven&#x27;t tried it myself, she has been reluctant to let it out of her sight since it arrived.</li>
    <li> This is the only straightener I buy since I discovered it about four years ago. Granted, i have only had to replace it once, which was about a month ago. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent enough money on straight irons to fund the national debt, looking for the perfect iron.  All fell short in some respect, but this is fantastic!  First, it&#x27;s nice and smooth and if you have arthritis, it&#x27;s not like those hard plastic ones with the cross-hatch stuff on them that is hard to grip.  It heats up in a few seconds and holds it&#x27;s temperature level.  It&#x27;s super smooth, but holds the hair well too, which some don&#x27;t. It&#x27; never pulls or tears the hair.  It comes with a glove and argon oil and I love everything about it.  The only way they could improve it, is make a shorter cord for home use and have decent instructions on how to turn on!!!  But it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever used and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works Great!!!! I have 3 girls in my house with VERY curly hair and it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I had a really nice expensive straitener that was 10 years old. I replaced it with this one and it is very comparable in heat, size, and quality. Don&#x27;t pay more.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and so its important to me that the straightner I buy doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. I originally bought a $200 straightner and was so totally unimpressed with it! It didn&#x27;t straighten without kinks and didn&#x27;t curl with out kinks! I came along the HSI and researched them and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I am SO HAPPY with this product! It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and it straightnes beautifully. Plus the arrangements oil trial sample they throw in is Phenom. The carry case they supply is a little small for it but if you wrap the cord correctly it can fit. All in all I would hut this straightner again! Its worth the money but it still doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> I read everyone&#x27;s comment on how good this straighter is! I was so excited when I got it but I don&#x27;t like it one bit! If it would just stay on, heat wise stay on the temperature I want &amp; light stay green I think it would be ok but as soon as I start to straightening my hair the light goes back to red &amp; does not stay hot! It takes so much time to straighten out my hair with flat iron &amp; I didn&#x27;t have this problem with a chi!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for people who have problems with frizzy hair like me. It works great and I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I bought it hoping to save some money and avoid buying a GHD, but it&#x27;s just not comparable. I ended up returning the product b/c it also felt cheaply made and for what it&#x27;s able to do, I&#x27;d rather just stick with the Solia I&#x27;ve had for 8 years. That being said, for the price, it&#x27;s probably one of the better straighteners out there. It&#x27;s definitely better than the bottom of the line drugstore conairs and maybe only slightly underperforms my Solia; however, the Solia (which as mentioned, I&#x27;ve had for 8 years), just semes to be a far more quality product (at about 2x the cost of this guy--tradeoffs worth considering!)</li>
    <li> Works great! I have naturally curly hair and it does a great job smoothing out the curl without making it frizzy. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Breaks hair more than I would like but it stays straight for a long time.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener quite a bit. I have medium coarse wavy/curly hair. It takes a few times going over each small section to eliminate the waves. I was expecting it to do a little better based on the reviews I read before purchasing it, but it gets the job done faster than cheaper straighteners. It doesn&#x27;t really increase the shine to my hair, and the floating plates allow gaps that my hair can get caught in. In all I would say this straightener was probably worth the $50.00, but I would definitely not pay anymore than that.</li>
    <li> Fantastic straighteners, highly rated reviews, can not fault at all, what you see is what you get, perfect professional straighteners!</li>
    <li> This flat iron has given me hair that I can run my fingers through! I was cursed with fine frizzy hair...and it is down to my waist. After using the HSI my hair is sleek and shiny and I actually received my first ever compliment on my hair! I suggest this product to anyone battling frizz and out of control hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron slid over my hair and many times I only needed one pass to fully straighten my hair. Other people have commented on the hair catching in the iron...just ease up on the pressure a bit! The iron gets so hot you do not need to clamp down all the way to achieve smooth and straight hair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. It works quick and leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny. Love It! Would recommend this product highly to anyone!</li>
    <li> I actually received this days before anticipated. It was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Worked great until i dropped the cord a foot onto the counter and it shorted. Not the most durable thing. I&#x27;ve had a lot of straighteners in my life and most seem to hold up well to every day use, but this was the first i&#x27;ve had die on me like that from such a minor drop. Maybe I just got a bad one.</li>
    <li> Well, my hair is on the thick side with frizz in the humid weather.  Sometimes I just want a straight polished look.  I had a pink ceramic that I lifted from my daughter years ago that did the trick.  When it broke, I thought this looked like a good one.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it twice.  It has heat setting which I am not that familiar with.  That could be my problem, I&#x27;m not sure yet.  It straightened my hair but the silky smooth was not there, and the frizz was still there even though the iron felt really hot.  My hair did not stay in the style (straight and silky smooth) I wanted for very long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again, but I wish I had my old pink back.</li>
    <li> So far I am loving my Flat Iron.  It heats up fast. This is my first time using a flat iron and was a little afraid on being able to handle it but have not had one bit of problem.  Also love the pouch and glove that came with it and also the sample of argan oil.  Great bargain.</li>
    <li> Left my hair shiny and sleek</li>
    <li> ***Update July 2017*** This product has changed since my last two reviews. This is not the same product. I have changed my review to one star but ideally want no stars because, A. They change products on my review to make it seem I was giving a good review for this product and B. I have tried this flat iron and it is nothing like the one I had previously reviewed. The quality is a downgrade and not worth it.   **** UPDATE**** Almost 5 YEARS later... Still going strong! Love love LOVE this Hairstyling tool. GREAT price for an amazing product that last so far for 5 years. I will be buying more from this brand.  I bought this straightener on sale for $56. Lucky me, my old cheap one broke in time to catch this great deal. It&#x27;s amazing! I love this straightener, buy it! :)</li>
    <li> This is the second (and 3rd, bought one for my daughter as well) flat iron I have bought from this company.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter dropped my first one and it broke much to my devastation. It still worked, even though one of the elements was almost dangling out (good construction obviously!) but a new one was needed.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, very curly, long hair to the middle of my back. My daughter&#x27;s is the same just even longer. This iron works amazingly well. Has a good high temperature that I need for my hair type. It doesn&#x27;t pull or feel like I&#x27;m dragging my hair through it.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair very silky and soft. The effects last for a couple of days so I do not need to use the iron every day. And even better, I use almost zero product in my hair now because I can keep it straight for so many days in a row. Less money spent and less goopy stuff in the hair! Very good for curly hair people as we tend to have really dry hair and scalps.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that they include a glove so I do not burn my fingers. The included little bottle of argan oil is also very nice. Smells good and is useful for keeping things smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The iron works very well for curling hair also.&lt;br /&gt;I even used it on one of my husband&#x27;s ties that got wrinkled, not the intended use but in a pinch it worked wonders haha.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this flat iron and hope I can keep this one for many years.</li>
    <li> Great hair iron for the price. It does snag my hair a little.</li>
    <li> I have been using this flat iron for about 1 month and so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  I&#x27;ve had two Chi&#x27;s, one which stopped working after 10 months and the second around the year mark.  I&#x27;m not hard on them but I&#x27;ve heard this same complaint from friends that own Chi&#x27;s.  Hopefully this is better.....fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Probably should have spent a little more to replace the one that I previously had.  This one is not great quality and you get what you pay for.  It really has to be set to the the highest temperature to work.  The overall feel of it is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work as well as the CHI but it is one of their products and I can tell you I&#x27;m not disappointed!  It works great and I get a lot of compliments.  Money well spent!</li>
    <li> So I have mixed girl hair. It&#x27;s thick, long, and wild. I was tired of spending money on the expensive Chi. I felt like it was not as good as people said it was. I seen this cheap flat iron and I read the reviews so I decided to make the purchase. I love this flat iron. It usually takes me more than 2 hours to do my hair. With this it took me half of that. I was so happy and my hair looks good too. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 9 yr old daughter who has been asking for a straightener for about a year.  I tell her that she is too young to ruin her hair.  I got this as a Santa gift and now she completely believes (she was kind of on the fence) in Santa because &amp;#34;Mommy would NEVER have gotten this for me!&amp;#34;  LOL - it worked!  Just waiting for our heat protector to arrive before I straighten her beautiful, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered the HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener and received it within a few days.  The product was exactly as described and exceeded; my expectations.  The straightener  heats up really fast and leaves my hair looking and feeling shiny and great.  They also sent a free 5 ml bottle of oil for hair treatment free of charge.</li>
    <li> Far shipping, good product</li>
    <li> Great straightener, heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product in an affordable price. Perfectly straightens and curls my hair and it&#x27;s pretty thick and wavy.</li>
    <li> Bought this on December 5th.. 3 months later, it&#x27;s not working.</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  It works even better than expected. At the beginning was skeptical about flat irons but after using it, being my first realized it has to be the perfect thing for hairstyles.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and it works so well. It heats up super fast and the temp control is great.</li>
    <li> It works great! And the Argan Oil bonus makes my hair feel so soft and healthy! Love this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped super fast! Light weight, gets hot fast, comes with cute cover protector and free argon oil. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> Great for my naturally Curley hair. Very easy to control the item wheter I want my hair straight or controlled curls</li>
    <li> Love this iron! Definitely a great purchase. It&#x27;s amazing how fast i get my hair done!</li>
    <li> I just received it today and have only used it once, but so far it&#x27;s been great! It arrived about 3 days before the scheduled delivery date, so shipping was super fast. I have very curly, thick, coarse, hair that has always been difficult to straighten. The straightener heated up very quickly and made my hair nice, soft, and smooth with only one or two runs over it. Definitely works well, better than my roommate&#x27;s Chi that I&#x27;ve been borrowing lately and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Like I said, I&#x27;ve only used it once, if something changes with it I&#x27;ll update, but for now I&#x27;m very impressed with this straightener and would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I got this straightener for my daughter, who was coveting my very expensive straighter, thinking that she&#x27;d probably use it once and then go back to using mine. Wrong, she loves it! It&#x27;s a great straightener at a great price...so glad she&#x27;s finally leaving mine alone!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical after I ordered this product and read some of the reviews...but I LOVE this flat iron. It works great and I have never gotten as many compliments on my hair as when I use this. I&#x27;m so glad I saved money by ordering this versus the Chi.</li>
    <li> The combination of the iron and the oil really helps smooth my hair out and leave a shine. Overall, it is a good product.  I have thick hair. I wish I would have ordered the 1-1/4&amp;#34; iron instead of the 1&amp;#34; but oh well. Just takes a little bit longer to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> Does a very good job!</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I ever had and great price.</li>
    <li> I have never left a review before on anything.....but this flat iron is so wonderful I had to give it 5 stars and leave a review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chi had gone out again it (like it has about every 2 years). I went to amazon to order a new one when this straightener popped up. I read the reviews and then saved it for later. I finally cut my hair shorter and was in desperate need for a flat iron that I purchased this one because of the price. Let me tell you this has been hands down the BEST flat iron Ive ever used. You will not be disappointed with this one!</li>
    <li> The hair straightener works as well as pricier versions and left my normally untamable thick hair smooth and perfectly straight!</li>
    <li> It was just average for me, nothing great. But still a good tool. It did straighten my hair good, but it took me a long time and I had to go over it a few times. My hair is natural curly (3B).</li>
    <li> My HAI straightener recently died and I needed a replacement and bought this because of the good reviews. Compared to my old one, this takes longer to straighten and is not as smooth when I&#x27;m dragging it down my hair. Also, my hair is not as silky as when I used the HAI. This product is just average.</li>
    <li> this is my first hair STRAIGHTENER , so far so good, easy to use, satisfied with this choice, i give 4 star since not compare with others</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have used of similar kind. Make sure the hair is not too wet while the temp is high as it might hurt the hair and make the scalp dry. But the hair remains straight for a very long time with this. Totally amazed.</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter.  easy to use. good quality. Basic hair straightener everyday.  I can use for oversea travel .</li>
    <li> It works fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem or works like a professional hair iron, when I placed the order it said 2 business days, but It took a week, and I did not get any argan oil.</li>
    <li> Pass on this \\&quot;too good to be true deal.\\&quot;  I have a Chi and I used this a few times and went back to my Chi.  My hair glides through my Chi.  With this flat iron, it pulls and there&#x27;s no glide.  I don&#x27;t know how there&#x27;s so many positive reviews.  Maybe those people have never owned a really good flat iron before- and sadly, they still don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> As I am a busy, last-minute kind of gal, I love that this flat iron heats up so fast. And the safety storage pouch is really useful. (Don&#x27;t know why the glove was included. It&#x27;s not needed). This is a good buy!</li>
    <li> It seemed like a good product after its initial use, but it wouldn&#x27;t turn on again after that.  Even when my wife followed the instructions to reset the device, and after switching power outlets, it still would not turn on.</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron in warp speed. Nice long cord and heats up quickly. I have lots of fine curly hair and it does tend to &#x27;snag&#x27; if I try to take thick parts so it takes a few times over to get it all straight and smooth. Overall happy. Nice travel bag, heat glove and Argan oil sample included.</li>
    <li> Todavía ella no lo puede creer. Rápido envió, excelente calidad y un precio sin competencia.La caja y todo lo que viene dentro de ella posee un acabado de lujo.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast and straightenes my naturally curly hair very well. Other straighteners that i have used will make my hair straight but still super frizzy. This one makes it feel silky smooth. After i read all the reviews i decided to go with this iron and i am very happy i did.</li>
    <li> Really love this straightener...finally one that keeps my hair from getting frizzy!!</li>
    <li> This truly is a professional flat iron, including everything from the green light when it&#x27;s ready to the many different heat settings for different types of hair.  It glides soothly and easily though my hair and only takes minutes to heat up.  It even comes with a convenient carry bag when you&#x27;re in a hurry and have to take it with you before it&#x27;s completely cooled down.  I could have bought a pretty purple one a little cheaper, but you get what you pay for and I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth with this product.  I would highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Was told about this product from a friend. Never knew how to curl or do anything with my hair until I used this Ceramic Tourmaline curling iron set. I would highly recommend this product . It works great and is safe to use on all hair types. The different barrel sizes are great for a wide range of different style curls. In love with this iron and cannot stop doing my hair. complements left and right . great product!</li>
    <li> Received this straightener yesterday with my 2 day shipping and used it this morning to curl my entire head of hair in less than 15 minutes. No snags, pulls or anything. Feels good in my hand and is easy to maneuver. I&#x27;ve had far better results with this iron than any other I&#x27;ve had! Definitely 100% worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Best hair iron ever used. Better than Chi.</li>
    <li> I bought this when my chi broke which happened every few years. Works just as well as a chi but at a better price!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my hair feel soft and straight</li>
    <li> Overall an OK straightner. I feel like it&#x27;s bulky and doesn&#x27;t close that tight when I&#x27;m straightening  my hair. Also doesn&#x27;t  curl my hair as well as my GVP. I feel like it should work great on my hair because my hair is pretty thin and straightish. It&#x27;s usually very easy to style. Just don&#x27;t like the style of this straightner either. I also didn&#x27;t receive the free sample argon oil which is a bummer because I wanted to try it out. Overall it&#x27;s okay. Probably will not buy again or recommend to someone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so amazed I just have to write a review! I&#x27;ve owned a couple of flat irons in the past, the recent one is a Remington Wet-to-Straight flat iron, this one is so much better defifnitely. Straightens the hair beautifully, and it doesn&#x27;t burn your fingers if you touch it as soon as you pass the iron on that section, not like my other one. My other one also gives out smoke even if your hair is not wet, this one doesn&#x27;t. And the over-all look of your hair after using this is just wonderul. Highly recommended! It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome iron at a phenomenal price</li>
    <li> This flat iron is incredible! It heats up fast, and my hair stays straight now for days. I am very picky when it comes to picking out a flat iron but this was a great investment and leaves my hair feeling soft, looking shiny, and healthy!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have very thick, curly hair but like to straighten it sometimes.  We have had a cheap straightener for a few years that would eventually get our hair pretty straight.  I decided it was time for something better, so got this one, and it works wonders.  It heats up fast, and straightens much better than the old one.  I would recommend this to anyone with curly or thick hair!</li>
    <li> I have always used a Chi fla tiron, but when I was shopping for a new one, I saw the HSI and read the reviews.  All reviews were positive and the price was lower, so I ordered it.  After receiving the iron and trying it out, I was sold!!  It straightens my hair perfectly and I like that it has a temperature control setting.  My hair was silky and smoothe after straightening.  The iron comes with a beautiful carrying bag and trial bottle of conditioning hair treatment. I would definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I have been using this flat iron for about a week now and like it so much better than the Chi I had been using. This one glides over my hair much more smoothly and gives a nice shine. Excellent heat up time. My only complaint is about the temperature selector. It&#x27;s a small knob located near the hinge inside the iron. It&#x27;s a little awkward to make adjustments when the iron is already hot.</li>
    <li> I needed a dual voltage flat iron for traveling and I&#x27;m happy to have chosen this one. It switches voltage automatically do I don&#x27;t have to remember to do anything and not be afraid that it will fry.  Just the right size for traveling. Perfect size to use as a curler too so I don&#x27;t have to bring a separate curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product and very easy to use.  The adjustable temperature control is strategically placed to avoid accidental changing.  The iron feels great in your hand makes it easy to reach the back of your head.  I especially like the slight curve which allows for both over and under flips as well as straightening.  I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick hair and I&#x27;d been looking at straighteners for a while and my mom actually found this one for me. I love the oil it comes with. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking oily and with a residue. Haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot, but I love using it to curl my hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get super straight when I do straighten it but I think there&#x27;s some trial and error to figure out. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I saw all of the great reviews this product received, but I didn&#x27;t like it. Compared to my Ultra Chi, it is heavier and bulkier. While the HSI had temperature settings, it didn&#x27;t seem to matter much - it straightened OKAY (I have medium/long hair), but my CHI was much more of a smooth pass thru my hair. My hair never got caught in the CHI, as it did in this one. Going to stick with the products I know I like. Would NOT recommend this particular flat iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the flat iron the first time I used it. I was looking for a ceramic flat iron for months but it was going to cost me $100+. When I came across this one, I had to get it because of other reviews and price. I&#x27;m very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> These flat irons are fabulous to use! They do such a wonderful job on your hair! I have never had one that could even compare with this brand!! I LOVE LOVE LOVVVEEE THESE IRONS!!! HSI PROFESSIONALS is a wonderful brand and company that stands behind their products! I will never own nothing else but these products! If you can definitely try them because I know you will love the brand also!</li>
    <li> First of all, I am pretty sure this was used when I received it, although I ordered New.  I wasn&#x27;t sure though.  Sometimes it will turn itself off (not the power, just the heat).  I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often, but I think this flat iron is terrible.  My hair may be somewhat straighter after I use this, but more often than not it is considerably more frizzed out than before I started.  It also makes my hair feel and look very dry and brittle.  I recently used my friend&#x27;s flat iron and noticed a huge difference.  With her flat iron my hair was smooth, shiny and soft.  This product is terrible and should not be bought.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this flat iron! Heats up quickly, and has an indicator light to tell her when her flat iron is ready. She only needs to do one pass through her hair to get it straight.</li>
    <li> Love the sleek and lightweight look and feel! Love how you can staighten or curl your hair or anything in between with the same tool. It&#x27;s great that it has such a range of temperatures to choose from but yet when I have it at a pretty high heat, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is being fried to a crisp. Heats up super fast and cools down pretty fast, too. A GREAT value for the fantastic product you receive! (And the small bottle of argon oil that comes with it smells great and does not leave my hair feeling oily or stringy.)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why ppl give it a high rate, u have to repeat the same area four times to get a result that is fine. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all</li>
    <li> This straightener doesn&#x27;t get as hot or have as large of a straightening plate as my stylist&#x27;s straightener, so I don&#x27;t get quite the same results as her, but I&#x27;m sure hers was a lot more expensive.  I&#x27;m satisfied with this product for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  She has really wavy hair and this took the curve right out of it.  Heats up quick and gets the job done.  She&#x27;s happy....so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Great iron. Heats quickly and comes with a very nice pouch. I also like the temperature control.</li>
    <li> No automatic shut off. Mine stayed on for 12 hours one day when I forgot to flip the tiny inside switch. The next day it would turn on, but would not heat up what-so-ever.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many years ago I bought this but never got a chance to do a review.  This is one of the best flatiron I have bought over the years.  I wish I bought a 2in though.  But it works very well for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I have use chi&#x27;s as well as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s straighteners and this one by far works the best! Also with the sale, it cost 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> I am African American with really thick hair the HSI ceramic tourmaline flat iron did a wonderful job. I will be purchasing two more flat irons in the near future for my two daughters.</li>
    <li> This straightener was impressive right out of the box. I bought it to fight my unruly curly and kinked hair, and this makes it super easy to control all of that. I&#x27;ve had other straighteners that have fried my hair or that just didn&#x27;t last for very long, but not this one. I&#x27;ve had this one for just about a year and a half now, and it isn&#x27;t showing any signs of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great in your hand and is easy to control and the ceramic plates are amazing in that they don&#x27;t fry my hair and always leave it looking straight and feeling soft. It also came with a little bottle of HSI argan oil that I absolutely love. Its been over a year and a half now since I bought this, and I&#x27;m still buying and using HSI&#x27;s argan oil because of the way it works so well with this straightener to make my hair shine (plus I love the smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this straightener! 5/5 stars</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It works great for my hair.Will definitely recommend it to family and friends😊The Argan oil works great with my hair. It makes my hair feels soft,shiner and more manageable.Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> The plates were chipped and cause lots of pulling on my hair. After letting the iron heat for 15 mins I found it worked best.</li>
    <li> Works as good as the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Got int in time. Leaves my hair really smooth and not static so far so good.</li>
    <li> t is my first flat iron, I am very pleased. Works very well on  long grey hair. I would highly recommend it. Priced very well is a bonus. I am pleased with the quality and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Well constructed and thus far has worked fantastic. Have used a curling iron for years and it has been an adjustment but pleasantly surprised at at the ease of use!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, she really likes it. The iron does what it says, the only complaint I heard is that it does pull her hair sometimes but it doesn&#x27;t stop her from using it. She also liked the argan oil bottle that came with it. Very fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. It leaves my hair very straight and so silky feeling! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love my HSI flat iron!</li>
    <li> Spent over $200 on a different straightener and bought this one after reading reviews! Very impressed with this one, and disappointed I didn&#x27;t do research before I wasted a lot of money on my own!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Does exactly what I need!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this she uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron at an awesome price!! It came so quick!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! All of the reviews I read about it were accurate!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! It comes in an awesome package and even has a cute bag to keep it in. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Works great and received quickly after ordering! Price was excellent</li>
    <li> If you have thick, curly/wavy and often frizzy hair, this is your answer! Not only is it a STEAL, but it is a really great product. My hair takes up to an hour to straighten, but it only took me 20 minutes! leaves hair very shiny and smooth! unreal</li>
    <li> I am not very good with straighteners in the past but have had good luck with this one. it leaves my hair shiny and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron and the Argan oil that it comes with is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but it is fantastic so far, with great control for very curly hair.</li>
    <li> Not the best. The chi is much better</li>
    <li> Not horrible, but WalMart sells better flat irons. Doesn&#x27;t heart up nearly what it says. The leave in oil deserves five stars. Glove is cheap and worthless, but free so whatever..</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly. Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend absolutely loves it. Her hair is much straighter and softer now, it&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
    <li> My wife love this product, I don&#x27;t know about this, but she said that is a great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron hair straightener on Saturday 11/29/2014,at about 2:00PM and about the same time the following day (Sunday), YES SUNDAY, the product was at my doorstep.  Great delivery and great product so far.  I have also read that HSI has very good customer service too.</li>
    <li> Great product! I bought this straightner to replace my CHI. The price and good reviews caught my attention. I have had it for about a month and it works great - very similar to CHI but much better price! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up quickly and allows you to flat iron your hair in just minutes. Easy to use and a great width to making styling a breeze. If you want to try out different styles, you could do it fairly fast with this product but if you just want to tame thick unruly hair, it literally can be done in just minutes! I would recommend this product to a friend and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works very well on thick, long, African American hair. My hairdresser loves it as well.</li>
    <li> It stopped heating after using it for a few times,very disappointed!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has very thick hair and she is quite pleased with this flat iron! Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work as well as it do because of the price but I love it!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, got it a month before Christmas...it&#x27;s valued at nearly a 100 dollars, but I scooped it out for a wonderful deal. I must admit that I wasn&#x27;t going to buy an high-priced product like this...but, I&#x27;m glad I took the risk. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this! It is different then most others because I have delicate hair and it makes is soooo soft and not wiry. (:</li>
    <li> Still trying it out so far not as good as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> its wonderful i got it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> I will never buy another non-ceramic flat iron again! This flat iron runs through my thick, coarse hair like a hot knife through butter! My hair stays straight until I get it wet. After my first, very expensive ceramic, flat iron died, I needed something quickly and cheaply and bought a metal plate flat iron. I didn&#x27;t know what difference it would make until I used it a couple of times. It took twice as long to straighten my hair and it was still &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;. I ordered the HSI and am so pleased with the results. My youngest daughter has thicker hair than I do and refused to use the metal iron after the first time. She said she&#x27;d rather go with the &amp;#34;spazzy look&amp;#34; than the mess the metal iron made. Now we are both happy!</li>
    <li> I love this hair iron! It heats up so quickly and can be used to curl the hair.</li>
    <li> I wish it had an automatic shut off.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for myself about a year ago. I read some reviews where people said they liked it better than their Chi. I couldn&#x27;t imagine it being better than my Chi, but I didn&#x27;t want to fork out another $100 on a straightener so I thought I&#x27;d just try this one. Now, I wouldn&#x27;t go back to a Chi even if it was the same price! This straightener is so much sturdier, and just feels like it&#x27;s better made and higher quality than the Chi. It also works wonderfully. It doesn&#x27;t pinch my hair like my Chi used to if I didn&#x27;t get a large enough section of hair! It gets super hot and takes no time to heat up. I have thoroughly enjoyed mine for over a year now, and now, I ordered one for my mom for Christmas because she liked it too! Just trust the reviews and buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron...it works AMAZING and the price is unbeatable!!!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and as described.  It is a gift so I won&#x27;t know how well it works until it is gifted.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this straightner. This is the first HSI that i have ever owned. Normally i only will buy Chi&#x27;s, because they are the only one that i have found to work with my hair, which is naturally thick and curly. But i decided to give the HSI a try as i have heard of them before, but didnt know anyone with one. Well i happen to need one ASAP, and seen this one for a WONDERFUL price so i went ahead and bought it. I now LOVE it more then my CHI....&#x3D;) The Shipping was fast and was shipped out the next day after my order was placed, and i placed my order at 830 at night! This does not put your hair, or make it frizzy like most other ones! I will definatly be buying another one soon for a backup!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It was excellent  n quick delivery.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It works quickly, I don&#x27;t have to go through more than once.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged product.  Works just like I want it to work!</li>
    <li> Great product. Will order again</li>
    <li> The only reasons I bought this flat iron was because the price was right - only $44.23 and the reviews were great. For $44 I thought it would be worth the risk of not knowing the manufacturer to go ahead and get this since it is a professional flat iron. I had been using a Chi iron. After reading several reviews on Amazon about how others had a CHI that broke, I thought it might be a good idea for me to get this as a backup in case my own CHI breaks soon. Now my old CHI is the backup and the HSI is my main one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This HSI flat iron is great. The features I love:&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable temperature control&lt;br /&gt;-Swiveling cord so no tangles/twists&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic behind the heated plates does not get too hot so I can grab that part when I need to&lt;br /&gt;-Both straightens and curls my hair&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth plates, nicely constructed so my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught up in it and pulled out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, curly hair and this flat iron does a quick job straightening my hair. i would recommend this product and would buy an HSI again if I had the need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AFTER 1 1/2 YEARS&lt;br /&gt;My HSI flat iron is still going strong! I use it about 3 times each week as my only flat iron. It works as well as it did on day 1 and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this HSI ceramic flat iron after reading excellent reviews about it.  Luckily the reviews were right on target!  The iron is easy to use, glides smoothly through my hair and has an adjustable heat setting.  It is, hands down, the best straightening iron I have ever used.  I like the fact that it has rounded plates so I can use it to curl the ends of my hair if desired.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving the flat iron. It&#x27;s big enough that i can use with quite a bit of hair and it heats up quickly but doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. I also really liked that it came with a glove in case you want to use it and not get burned and some oil.</li>
    <li> I love this iron!  I have fine, curly hair that doesn&#x27;t straighten easily but was breaking off from the high heat of my CHI Nano.  I like the temperature control on this iron.  It straightens and flips beautifully and I&#x27;m frizz and kink free on a rainy day!!</li>
    <li> Love it! this flat iron far exceeds my expectations! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Very nice straightener!</li>
    <li> Awesome product at an awesome price☺️</li>
    <li> Received the product as described. This is a gift so not sure it&#x27;s functionality or quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many straight irons but  I absolutely love this one the most. The iron warms up in no time and has sensitive heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;I use my iron all the time an love that it has more uses than just straightening. I can also use it to curl. :)</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron is the best!  I used to hate  straightening my hair everyday because it took 30 minutes to straighten all of my hair, but now that my HSI was mailed to me I enjoy styling my hair!  My hair is left VERY soft and silky and the flat iron glides across my hair and never pulls it.  Now that I have my HSI, it takes way less time, AND my hair is soft and straight.  I  HIGHLY recommend  the HSI and I hope that you will be able to experience how great it is.  (at a very low price also)</li>
    <li> I have no idea about hair products at all. I read all the review good and bad for almost 2 hrs. Too buy my girlfriend a hair iron those review help a lot my girl love it when she tried it. Her hair came out so gorgeous. I was extremely happy when she said she loves it. This is a really good product.</li>
    <li> love it, so easy to use and my hair feels and looks great</li>
    <li> This iron took me about 5-10 tries before I really liked it.  I think it does not run through the hair as smooth until it&#x27;s been used a few times.  I am still undecided if I like this HSI more than the CHI original flat iron.  It was a good buy and does work really well.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, so far no problems.</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron. I have long, thick, naturally curly hair so I can&#x27;t use cheap flat irons. This one works great. My hair doesn&#x27;t end up frizzy or only partially straight. Price is good too.</li>
    <li> I am a Black girl with regular puffy black girl hair...its very hard to get bone straight. THIS FLAT IRON DOES WONDERS!!!! its SOOO SILKY! it changed the entire texture of my hair...youd think i was mixed. i LOVE it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND iT!</li>
    <li> I just used my straightener and I LOVE it!!!&lt;br /&gt;It straightened my hair perfect, heated up quickly and stayed hot. So simple to use, and actually straightened my hair a lot faster then my old hair straightener.</li>
    <li> Great product for such a good price. Used to use a very base model of straightener, wow, didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing. I live in a humid state and it still stays straight. I also have a meannatural wave and it keeps it all in line. I would highly suggest. :)</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and was worried this iron would damage my hair.  It has adjustable heat settings which was perfect to make sure my hair didn&#x27;t get too hot.  It&#x27;s easy to manipulate through the hair and smooths it quickly. Love the bio silk sample that came with it too!</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MA0QY2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title    My Daughter loved this flat Iron.....  It came right in time and packaged perfectly....Thank You so much... She was so excited as her old Chi had all kinds of problems...  I am really happy I researched and found this one...  She used it right away and said that it worked really good and she was thrilled.....</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it.  I was weary of how good it would be considering the deeply discounted price (and compared to the prices of other professional-level options), but figured it was worth a try - and this product did not disappoint.  My wife has very difficult hair and she said this iron tames it in under 15 min. (which used to take her over an hour with her old iron).  It also arrived in the mail faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has used many flat irons. This by far is the best. Great price. I came back to order one for myself but this seller was all sold out. I will be watching daily to purchase one. Dont wait run to buy it! Well worth the money!!..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED: That was in Jan, I bought it for her for Xmas. Well Is April and it will not heat up well. I would NOT recommend this flat iron. I enver thought anything when it took alittle while to heat up. it did work better then the conair one I was using BUT I bought the Babyliss and OMG I will never changed. And the reason why the reviews are so good is the seller offers a free bottle of the oil if you write a good review. READ BETWEEN THE LINES on this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I really loved this straightener. Functionally, it worked perfectly. My hair is thick and wavy, yet this straightener always made it smooth and straight. But now it&#x27;s broken.   I&#x27;ve had it since the end of September and today it stopped working out of nowhere. It was working fine just a couple days ago. I didn&#x27;t do anything to it. And yes, the outlets are working and I&#x27;ve hit the reset button about a dozen times. Ugh!   Really wish it would lasted at least a year! C&#x27;mon!</li>
    <li> Best one I have purchased top date.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and pretty good</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because the price was right and the reviews I read were good. It was well worth the purchase. It heats up in like 15 seconds its that fast. It takes not one at all to straighten my medium length hair. I HIGHLY recommend this product it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron. Packaging was nice, product well protected for shipping. Great iron at a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m joining the ranks of people rating this as 5 star for a couple of reasons: 1) It does a salon quality job. Finally I can make my own self look like I do after I leave the hair place! 2) The ceramic plates slide soooo smoothly over hair. It&#x27;s pretty quick work even for a thick bushy mass of hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice quality flat iron. In my opinion you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Working great a year later</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! had many in past and never consistently used them because  I have thick hair that takes far too long to do This iron made it so quick an easy! woop woop!</li>
    <li> Loved it.i use this aas both curler and straighner.works.u need to use the maximum heat and go really slowly for curling with it.for straightening i had to go through the same chunk of hair multiple times.but still it gives the result and lasts till the next wash.better than my philips curler.but i really dont know how amazon is able to provide  this product for this price.it is really expensive in the hsi site.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife for Christmas. After a few uses she immediately started seeing top layers of her hair were broken and shorter. She quit using since it was damaging her hair. We plan on returning it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a spare when she&#x27;s visiting us from the UK. She loves and says it&#x27;s much better than her one at home. She has straightened and curled her hair with it and it always looks beautiful. She has lots of very thick hair too and it seems to be very efficient through it!! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I lost my CHI iron that I had for 8 years and was so sad because I didn&#x27;t want to pay retail for another one.  I read reviews on amazon about the HSI and I was not disappointed.  I feel that maybe my CHI put out more heat than this HSI, but this flat iron really brings out the shine in my hair.  I love the fact that there is a dial to change heat settings and it gets the job done.  The best part is the price!  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and saved so much money by going with this model.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best flat iron that I have ever used. I get better result than when I go to the hair salon, so I go even less and save money.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For years I have bought most of the items that I wanted or needed off of Amazon and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review.  I feel strongly compelled to warn people about this product though.  I had intended to purchase a CHI as I had been borrowing my daughter&#x27;s for some time but after I read the rave reviews for the HSI, stating that it was comparable if not superior to the CHI at a lower price, I bought it instead.  After months of using the HSI, my once thick &amp; healthy hair is absolutely ruined and I am seriously considering cutting my long hair short and starting all over again.  Yes, my hair is that damaged.  I have started borrowing my daughters CHI again and the difference in how my hair looks is dramatic.  Even my co-workers who see me every day are commenting on how nice and shiny my hair suddenly looks.  I wish I had never bought the HSI.  Please do yourself a favor and spend the extra $10 or so and invest in a CHI.</li>
    <li> The fact that this iron does not have an auto shut-off feature is a huge disappointment. I bought this to replace an old Revlon flat iron that I used for years, and it would shut off after 35 minutes of use to prevent fires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does not. Very unusual for hot irons these days, it is almost standard for safety now.</li>
    <li> I thought that after reading all those reviews I would LOVE this straightener but I didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just an okay for me.</li>
    <li> It is the best iron I ever had! Instructions how to use it are clear and understandable. Hair looks great and stays that way for all day long even in high humidity! Recommend to everyone! It worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
    <li> It does the job fairly well. I straighten and curl my hair and I am satisfied. It is worth the price so far (actually it is a good deal for the price).</li>
    <li> This flat iron does not straighten hair very well at all. It takes a long time to heat up and as you straighten your hair the flat iron loses it heat. I have to go over my hair atleast 3 times for it to be completely straight... Highly dissappointed</li>
    <li> Great value for the low price. Can be compared to $100 hair irons. Would definitely recommend to a friend on a budget</li>
    <li> I recently got my hair cut short in layers and needed a flat iron to help curl, straighten and flip sections of my hair. This product is great for all of it. Since I have fine hair, using the medium setting works best to protect the ends from damage. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use and a great price. It comes with a thick lined storage pouch too as well as a glove but I haven&#x27;t  used the glove yet because the handle doesn&#x27;t get hot only the area around the plates. I highly recommend this flat iron. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has wavy thick hair and we have tried many straighteners. While this one is on the lower price range, it gets a lot hotter than other ones we have tried and keeps her hair straight most of the day. We are still working to perfect our skills with this straightener but so far so good</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed and has more or her dad&#x27;s hair style.  I have never found a strightner that worked till now.  It makes it look silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife when traveling to India because it can work on both voltages. Now she even uses it at home.</li>
    <li> I wanted an iron that makes my hair straight even after sleeping on it. I didnt want to iron my hair every day. I saw crazy nice reviews on this one so I tossed my old phi iron out and got this one. Now this one is definitely better than my old one but not the best out there. It also did a pretty good job holding my hair straight next day. I recommend this iron. Good price as well. My hair has been extremely static nowadays after ironing my hair. Im not sure its irons fault though. Please let me know if it happens to other people as well.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does exactly what is needed.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Product arrived on time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this flatiron were really glowing and definitely impacted my decision to buy. I&#x27;ve used it to straighten my previously (nearly) waist length hair and it worked ok. It wasn&#x27;t quite the holy grail that others made it seem to be though. I bought it to replace my nearly 10 year old CHI that didn&#x27;t stay consistently hot anymore. This flatiron does get hot and I DO like that I can control the heat (the old one was just on and off). The extras like the glove and the storage bag were nice to get. I&#x27;m just not wowed by it like I had hoped to be. It&#x27;s slightly heavy and felt clunky to me. It&#x27;s bulky compared to a lot of the competition out there and the photos honestly didn&#x27;t convey that to me- but that could just be me. Bottom line: if you don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t spend a lot and need a decent flat iron, this is for you. If you can spend more or are expecting something of supreme quality like a lot of others out there then you might be disappointed by this. However, it is a quality product, it&#x27;s just an ok quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for two weeks and have only used it maybe four times.  With the heat setting only to half it does a pretty good job.  It&#x27;s heavier than other models my mom and sister own but I like that it feels sturdy.  Has a lot of texture on both sides of the handle.  Heats up in no time and has a red light on top (not inside like other irons) to indicate the iron is on.  The light turns green when it&#x27;s completely heated up.  So far I really like this straightener.</li>
    <li> CHEAP PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;DIDN&#x27;T HEAT UP ENOUGH, SO SENT IT BACK</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  Heats up quickly, and my hair is sleek and shiny in less than ten minutes.  My hair is not wavy or curly, but I just like a sleek look.  It was recently cut to just at my shoulder.  I can do sections and it is finished super fast.  HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Controls are hidden under the iron, hard to get to, easy to burn your hand.  Does not heat up fast, no read out, and heavy.  I have used a Croc for years and is sooooo much better.  The design of this iron is not designed for easy use.  I have used a Croc for 10 years, worth every penny compared to the HSI flat iron.  DON&#x27;T spend your money on this one, buy a good one, the Croc.  I am over 60 and have purchased my share of flat irons for myself and also gifts, this is one I would definitely never purchase again.  I would not even give this as a gift!</li>
    <li> Straighten my hair fast and did not pull my hair</li>
    <li> It works just as well as the chi but so much cheaper</li>
    <li> My hair has a VERY hard time staying smooth and straight, it&#x27;s very fine, frizzy, and never really looks polished...this ceramic straightener fixes all that. I use product before I blow dry my hair and straighten it but I think this straightener does wonders and works way better than my previous ones.</li>
    <li> It seems to work great so far. Good price too!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this iron. I have one already, but needed another for a trip and decided this would be the one I would order. This iron works as well as others, if not better, for a lot less.</li>
    <li> This is my far the best flat iron I have ever owned!!! Heard up super fast!! I have this hair and I don&#x27;t have to do little piece by little piece you can flattened a good bit of hair at a time!!! I can sleep on it and it still flat flat the next morning - that NEVER. Happened with all the other flat irons I have used !! The extra long cord is a PLUS!!!! And where the cord meets the iron is a turn with connection so no matter how you lay it down it won&#x27;t tip over!! Would recommend for everyone to use it!!!</li>
    <li> First and foremost great deal! This flat iron is worth 4 times as much as I paid. I&#x27;m Jamaican (black) and my hair can be quite difficult to handle. Got my untouched roots almost bone straight! Got the relaxed parts of my hair perfect. The little sample pouch of argon oil was awesome too! Made hair real shiny and gave it a soft feel. Do be careful though the backside of were the heating pads are does get to burning point so try not to press it without the glove they gave you. Worth 11 out of 10 stars very glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smoothly straighten my ethnic hair. It does the job, but not in a smooth way. I feel it pulls some hair out versus my sisters GHD straightener that is perfect. Not my favorite at all.</li>
    <li> Had a CHI that had died and was going to get another CHI.  However I saw the price and reviews of this one.  It lives up to its high reviews!  Stays hot to straighten my hair without taking a break!</li>
    <li> Sleek and professional. Totally impressed!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a flat iron but this is a great product! I love the different temp settings.  AND the price was right! I received it much earlier than expected and the price was RIGHT!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great! My hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in any cracks and my hair runs through it very smoothly.. Heats up very fast which is very convenient..</li>
    <li> I was very happy with it for the first few months, then it started to lose power and the red light doesn&#x27;t go on when I plug it in.  I can see it&#x27;s an issue with the cord, because when I move it to a certain position, the light turns on but as soon as I let go it dies and therefore it doesn&#x27;t heat up any more.  I just contacted the seller to see what my options are but disappointed, I wasn&#x27;t even using it every week and it hasn&#x27;t even been a year yet since I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this straightener. It makes my hair very staticky and even on the highest setting doesn&#x27;t work very well. The light also only works intermittently if at all.</li>
    <li> good straightener heats fast</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as I expected. I have one I paid $15 for that works just as good, If not better. Disappointed. ..</li>
    <li> A great product for the price!  The company shipped the iron quickly and it arrived on time.  It is a very well made fly iron- it heats up in no time and I love the indicator light letting you know it&#x27;s ready!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today, I bought it after the wide-paddled Remington straightener I had finally died after 7 years ($30 at Target). I noticed no difference between this one and my old one, I honestly would&#x27;ve been mad if I had paid full price for this.  I actually liked the wider paddles better.  This works just as well. Though the on/off switch and temperature wheel are on the inside of the handle and slightly awkward to get to, I don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off or change the heat setting like I did on my old one when the controls were on the outer part of the handle.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron heats up very quickly and allows you to set the temperature that you want to heat it to.  Unlike some other straightening irons I&#x27;ve used, it does not require you to go over the same hair numerous times, reducing the amount of heat damage to my hair.  I especially like the insulated pouch that came with it, as it allows you to pack the straightening iron before it is all the way cool.  Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this straightener a low rating is because of its durability. I&#x27;ve had it for less than a year and the side corner of one ceramic is chipped. I think we all know that we drop our heating tools once in a while but I&#x27;ve never had a straightener plate chip. That being said It&#x27;s really hard for me to use it without yanking my hair out.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when it came in the mail. It was extremely disappointing to discover it did not work... not at all.</li>
    <li> Great product. It came with a very nice travel bag and a sample to use on my hair with the product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Our daughter asked for this as a Christmas gift and was very excited to get it. Fast shipping, on time and just as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast and leaves my hair super smooth. I actually don&#x27;t use the pouch it cane with because I dont need to but I guess it&#x27;s good for when u travel. The it let takes up 2/both but I dint mind. Sounds of you may. It&#x27;s sleek and works perfect on my big ol mop of a head. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Chi, this is a comparable product for a lower price.  The Argan oil is fantastic, but the 60% off a 4 oz bottle coupon which came with the product does not work when I tried to purchase - very disappointing...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product - it&#x27;s great for creating super silky straight hair, and also has the rounded edges so I can curl my hair if desired. It&#x27;s a great multi-use tool.</li>
    <li> I just got this straightener last week... I already have a Revlon straightener so my main focus for this one was the curling part.  This straightener works amazing for curling your hair! I have long thick hair that used to take me 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours to curl it with a curling iron... now with this straightener it takes about a 1/2 an hour! I like the carrying pouch it came with as well.  It seems to heat up pretty quick too.  All in All I would suggest buying this straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this straightener for probably almost a year now and it has stopped working. I absolutely love the straightener while it lasted and seemed to not be as bad on my hair as cheap ones.</li>
    <li> Really like this flat iron so far. Haven&#x27;t had any issues. It heats up quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it pulling my hair like some people have had. This is my first flat iron and I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Works great so far! Doesn&#x27;t curl my hair as good as my last straightener, I&#x27;ll have to practice at it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is crap. Company deceives customers so only good reviews end up in this listing of the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I use solia but wanted something that I could use overseas and this doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to it.&lt;br /&gt;Drags and pulls hair, plates don&#x27;t even touch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never in my life used a flat iron so bad.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose this explains why there&#x27;s not really YouTube reviews for this product except for HSI stealing and reuploading other YouTubers review videos for OTHER flat irons from DIFFERENT BRANDS and pretending they&#x27;re positive reviews for their flat iron.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this hair straightener. Heats up very fast, gets nice and hot, straightens perfectly!</li>
    <li> This product has met my expectations. The shipping was fast too! The oil is wonderful and leaves hair smooth. The iron works well on my fine hair. Overall value for money!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned, including really expensive ones over $120!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this product works fantastic! My hair has never looked so good straight.  I would highly recommend this product.  Great value!</li>
    <li> Have been using this flatiron for 2 weeks and I love it.  My husband says my hair never looked better.  This is the first time I have ever straighten my very fine hair.  It took a little getting used to, but is very easy now.  I especially like the ability to set the temperature.  I do not use the glove, but like the free Argan Oil.  Good company with a great product.</li>
    <li> Still getting used to a heavier flat iron. Straightens well...now to get the weather to cooperate!</li>
    <li> This works wonders. No more burning smells when you starighting your hair. Lowest level have my hair soft and silky. Very inexpensive. Love it</li>
    <li> The iron itself is wonderful,  it heats up fast,  has a long swivel cord and is easy to use (I just need to work on my technique and watch some more tutorials). The real winner of this product is the hair oil sample that currently comes with it. I love this stuff! It smells amazing and makes my hair shiny and beautiful, whether I am styling it or leaving it as is.</li>
    <li> Love it. Comes with little bottle of hair treatment, a glove, heats quick and works great. arrived in one week!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know why but I plugged it in and my light started flickering. I got scared and unplugged it. My other straightener does not do this. Any help?</li>
    <li> I love this product! Not only was the delivery quick...my hair never looked so great. Why spend a fortune on a chi when this not only works just as good but even better. I love it and i will never go back to chi.</li>
    <li> Needed a flat iron for international travel and I came across this product. I really like it and it worked great in India. Would recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener to use on a recent trip to the UK.  It worked perfectly with an outlet adapter/converter.  There is an internal mechanism that automatically recognizes the required voltage. No switches or dials to remember to flip!  The straightener itself is of good quality and runs smoothly through the hair, giving great results.  I use it daily and recommend it to anyone looking for a professional grade straightener.</li>
    <li> Purchased flat iron as a replacement for my household of girls. Item gets very hot very fast. Small enough to take traveling. Does the job it needs to.</li>
    <li> I just broke my Chi straightener a few days ago, and with my hair, not having a straightener is almost as bad as running out of toilet paper in the middle of a poison ivy patch. Embracing my inner curls for a few days, I warned my co-workers that this is what they would have to look at my big hair until I got this delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As promised, it came two days after I ordered it, and came in great condition. Glove, pouch, and oil all came with it as well. Granted for my amount of hair, the oil wasn&#x27;t really sufficient, but it was still nice to get a bit of extra shine into my Saturday night hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener itself is great. Coming from a background in Chi&#x27;s, this is just as good. My hair was straight, silky and manageable. My only fear is that with continued use, it will get dry and break. Let&#x27;s hope not! I may have to update this review.</li>
    <li> nice and smooth hair straightener... i don&#x27;t like the plug as you need to reset sometimes. i&#x27;ve had others where you just plug and it goes. you might forget to do that and it&#x27;s not heating up meanwhile you wasted time waiting. but other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron with extremely high expectations and was sadly disappointed, this flat iron worked extremely well for the while I had it and I used it faithfully and I took great care of this product. However, that did not to prepare me for when the flat iron would not turn on, I tried everything using a new plug, resetting the flat iron, and even seeing if there was an internal problem however nothing helped. I was only able to use this flat iron for about one year before it died on me, I still have the flat iron to this day in hopes that one day I can plug it up and it will turn on. That has yet to be true and for that sole purpose I would not recommend purchasing this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase, and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Very happy with this straightener. Thank you</li>
    <li> Not my first HSI product. I will keep coming back for more. I love it</li>
    <li> A good product. I liked it. Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why someone would have ever paid $100 plus dollars for this product. I purchased it on sale and still think I paid too much.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas. I don&#x27;t know much about hair straighteners, and I wanted to get her a nice one without spending 200 dollars. She loves it and says it&#x27;s perfect and really good quality. Can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Straightens my curly hair like it was done in a salon.  Works great with the argon oil that is supplied and have been able to find more in local dept. store.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have thick, long and coarse hair and I can straighten my hair in less than 30 minutes. Before, it would take me over an hour. So happy I purchased this straightner!</li>
    <li> My 86 yro mom would always wince and complain when I brushed her hair.&lt;br /&gt;With the HCI Pro she barely notices I am brushing it.</li>
    <li> no instruction with product</li>
    <li> So far so good..I read the reviews and it seems to break easily, but Im hoping that doesn&#x27;t happen to me because I really do like it a lot.  It straightens good and it also styles the hair..I would definetly recommend it</li>
    <li> At first I loved this iron. It worked very well and I agree with many of the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, as of late it hasn&#x27;t been working properly. I have had it for a little less than a year and use it 6/7 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;Lately it is not heating up properly. When heating up when complete the red light should turn green, well mine isn&#x27;t turning green anymore.&lt;br /&gt;And when I use it nothing really happens? Its not even flattening my hair like it did before. Perhaps I got a defective one? I don&#x27;t really know. .</li>
    <li> When I initially got the product it wasn&#x27;t working correctly, I emailed the company and they quickly sent me out a new one and it works perfect. I love this wand. I recommend using the glove because it does get extremely hot.</li>
    <li> it did everything other reviewers said it wouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used it one time and it does not hold heat, rips my hair and left my head a frizzy mess!! Do not purchase. Returning!</li>
    <li> Does a great job straightening my wavy hair BUT at the corner edges of each hot plate there is a space that pulls rips out any hairs it comes into contact with. Huge bummer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it just for a week now, and so far I am pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up very quickly, and it leaves my hair smooth, shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Like that it has adjustable temperature. I have curly hair and it does not take a lot of work to get it straight.</li>
    <li> Awesome product - brought to Italy from the US, worked perfectly without any issues. Great find for those of us who travel internationally for work!</li>
    <li> My cheaper flat iron (that albeit broke) was able to heat up in a fraction of the time, so I was a little disappointed in that aspect. Otherwise the product has been working well and really makes my hair VERY straight!</li>
    <li> I chose this because of the great reviews and love it. The glove comes in handy as I have the tendency to burn myself. I also bought the stand for it. It is wonderful to have piece of mind with it. In the holster I don&#x27;t have to worry anyone will grab it and burn themselves.</li>
    <li> Fastest hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned and the bag makes it easy to travel with! You can choose a temperature at which to straighten your hair as well.</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast.  Good results that last for days. Light weight. Very practical accessories, glove, good looking carrying bag.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  What a great price!  The iron just glides through your hair and makes it shine.  A nice product at a bargain price.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves it, my only problem is I was not allowed to order the stand to hold it after she used it!</li>
    <li> Efficient and fast.  Light weight so that it is easy to carry when you are travelling.  Good price.  Good product.  Easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair, and this product works great on it.  I have had regular department store flat irons in the past, and they do an ok job, but this product works really well for me.  The only thing I would count off for is the temperature knob and power button are inside the jaws, which doesn&#x27;t seem very handy, but this does not affect how well this product works.</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional hair straightener heats up for use quickly, but does not become so hot that it burns your hair or scalp. The angle of the design is perfect, allowing enough room for those of us with thick hair. Very good value as well.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant on whether or not I should but this item because it had such mixed reviews. My old flat iron finally gave out so I decided to try this. It works like a dream. I have very thick, wavy hair and I managed to straighten it in 30 minutes (record time for me). It works way better than any flat iron I have ever had, including my multiple CHIs. I am uttterly amazed with this product. The item arrived sooner than expected too, which I was very happy about. I do not understand how anyone could give this product anything less than five stars. If you are in the market for a new flat iron, this is the one to buy, hands down.</li>
    <li> fast ship, boxed well and really works well, we had one of the acclaimed better ones named Chi and this one beats it soundly, My daughter recommends it highly!</li>
    <li> I knew I needed a new flat iron and thought I&#x27;d take a chance on this one.  BEST flat iron ever - my hair was so smooth and silky!  It has adjustable heat settings which are wonderful so you don&#x27;t burn your hair. it travels well and is most definitely worth the money paid.  This flat iron works as well as the one my stylist uses in her salon.  The edges of the flat iron keep your scalp from being burnt by the ceramic plates and allows you to work with short hair as well as long hair.  definitely a MUST have item.</li>
    <li> This is great, it heats up fast and makes quick work of straightening my hair.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fantastic flat iron, especially for the price. I&#x27;ve tried Chi and other expensive brands (I have very thick, wavy, and somewhat fine hair) and this works just as well if not better!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron I&#x27;m able to straighten my hair and do beautiful curls with it</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Not as strong as I would have expected but does a nice job straightening. Like that it comes with a carry case.</li>
    <li> Feels great having a new straightener again. Heats quickly and smooths hair without pulling.</li>
    <li> ive had this for over a year still works like new.</li>
    <li> This is a great value!  I needed a straightening iron that gets as hot and works as well as the one that the woman that cuts my hair uses.  Different brands that I&#x27;ve purchased over the years didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  The tourmaline plates glide through your hair without catching and pulling hair.  This also came with a heat resistant glove, which comes in very handy, a sleeve in which to store it, and a sample of Argan oil.  Love this iron!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, great job on my course hair! Makes it silky smooth. Fast shipping, great customer service.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does a good job silking the hair.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this flat iron.  She loves the fact that you can set the temperature settings unlike the CHI iron she had before.  She also liked that it same with a glove and carrying case too. Definitely would recommend as a gift for your wife.</li>
    <li> My hair is basically straight but there are times when I let it air dry that it needs to be smoothed out. This straightener couldn&#x27;t even do that! Seriously a$25 hair straightener from Wal-Mart worked better than this. Thankful that Amazon is so great with returns.</li>
    <li> Not the best flat iron but it will do for the price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because of the great price but I read a few reviews and decided to order. I love my flat iron! As a mother of four boys I don&#x27;t have time for my hair, this iron let&#x27;s me rock cute waves daily. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I really loved it.. makes my hair really looks great esp with the use of the oil.. I&#x27;ve been a fan of HSI!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Heats up nicely. Love the long cord.</li>
    <li> Such a great product at a great price!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I just purchase this item and it was not work well I plan not to purchase anymore items from amazon</li>
    <li> Shipped &amp; arrived as promised and GREAT product best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I like mine so much I bought one for my daughter and she&#x27;s in love with it too.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has never been happier with a flat iron in a LONG time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product with incredible parts committment from HSI!</li>
    <li> Was pulled in by reviews.  Discarded within two weeks and went back to Chi.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron is a great product.  I&#x27;ve never had one before and it is very easy to use.  I love the adjustable heat and the glove that came with it, although if I&#x27;m careful I don&#x27;t seem to need to use it.</li>
    <li> i received an email asking if I was satisfied with my purchase . I replied that the iron did not work as well as I thought it would and was leaving my hair frizzy. They suggested it must be defective and sent me out a new one. I tried it and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company truly stands behind the products they sell. I give the product and company 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> Amazing product and very well priced.  I did a lot of checking before ordering....this flat iron had excellent reviews and was just what I needed. It heats up VERY FAST and the controls are simple to use.  Best of all, it straightens quickly with one pass and leaves my hair shiny..! Plus the results last...I am very impressed and happy with this purchase. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a great! I&#x27;ve been borrowing my roommate&#x27;s for years and finally decided to buy my own.</li>
    <li> The item that I got was a defective. After I leave it on for the highest degree setting, it only heated up a little above room temperature. I could even touch the iron with my hand and didn&#x27;t feel too hot to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned the item and I am waiting for refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trusted on the high review ratings...but I guess I am the only unfortunate one??!!</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron!! I&#x27;m use to using my 2\\&quot; wigo flat iron and loved it - it got misplaced after we moved so I had to get another one.  I was apprehensive about going to a 1\\&quot; but saw the HSI and read the reviews so decided to try it out ... I&#x27;m glad I did!! It&#x27;s a great product - I have long, curly, thick hair and this iron glided through my hair effortlessly! I didn&#x27;t have to go over my hair more than once for it to straighten it either! Also, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out a lot like others I&#x27;ve used - don&#x27;t get me wrong it does pull but only once in a while not w/every glide! Plus, I was surprised to find that I got the glove and storage pouch w/it so that was nice! As I thought they only came w/the $70 bundle but to my surprise they came w/mine too!! If you&#x27;re looking for a well made flat iron that actually works this is the one for you!!</li>
    <li> I really love this iron...what I really love is the fact that you don&#x27;t have to go over the same hair twice to straighten, which will really help to keep hair looking and feeling healthy!  The Argain Oil is great and I think that it&#x27;s a great idea to include it with the purchase of the iron...I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more Argain Oil when it runs out!!</li>
    <li> So far so good - I am hoping it works in Europe too!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after my old one finally crapped out on me.  I read so many reviews about this one and SO many others (I think I spent days reading reviews, lol!).  I was very nervous purchasing a product like this on-line, as I had never heard of this brand especially.  I have had mine now for about 3 months, straightening about twice a week and I absolutely love it!!!  It has cut down on time, used to take me about an hour to straighten, now about 35-40 mins.  It does not pull your hair and clamps down really tight.  I have fine but thick curly/wavy hair, a few inches below my shoulders.  Before using my straightener I use a couple smoothing prep products in my hair (which you should always do when using heat or a hair straightener).  I blow dry using a big round barrel brush, after I run my HSI through my hair, only having to go over each piece once or twice.  It gets perfectly smooth just like you would get in a salon.  My hair stays perfectly straight for days afterwards and it&#x27;s so silky smooth!  Has even stood up to humidity!  The straightener gets very hot so be careful to not burn your hands (or hair).  I would highly suggest this product to anyone, you will not regret it!  :)  P.S. I did get the bottle of the Argain Oil with mine.</li>
    <li> Using this took some getting used to. The edges did pull out some hair, and I had to use it on the highest setting to iron out sections of clip in hair extensions. I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than 39 for it.</li>
    <li> sent this back to difficult for me to use.</li>
    <li> This a great flat iron and I would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and course and extremely curly.  This iron is so good that I only need to run it through each section once and I&#x27;m done!  It cut my styling time in half!  It&#x27;s sleek design feels great in my hands too. I&#x27;d reccomend this item to everyone with hard to manage hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron and for the price. I&#x27;ve used many irons and this is one that I must say works to straighten my hair to a silky shine and smooth straight. I have very Thick, coarse hair but this iron does the trick. I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product...temperature selection and indicator light are nice.  No tangle cord also a bonus.  It hasn&#x27;t broken on me yet and I&#x27;ve had it for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve had it for a year and even taken it with me on a few trips.  I use at least once a week.  Still not broken...pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have been using the instyler for 2 years and it was causing breakage.  Am so happy to have my locks tamed by something that does not damage my hair.  And the hair product given with the iron is great too.  Love the little pouch too.</li>
    <li> Well made, gets very hot as promised- well designed.  Love that it came with little sample of Argan Oil- smells great.  Doesn&#x27;t smooth out my hair QUITE as well as I&#x27;d hoped but my hair is very difficult.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron for my little sister who has really thick hair - and I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say her hair is thick. Her hair is that in-between straight/wavy.  Her old flat iron took nearly 2 hours to &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; her hair. Really, it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference. After a few hours out in the southern weather her hair was back to a frizzy mess. So, I decided to surprise her with a new one.I was really impressed by the quality of the straightener even before we used it. It&#x27;s really well made and the argan oil that&#x27;s included smells incredible! (I just ordered a full size bottle.) You also get a glove to protect your hand from the heat. (It was way too big for either of us, but we have really tiny hands.) The plates on the iron are wide, but not too wide. It&#x27;s the perfect width, in my opinion. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but it&#x27;s not lightweight and cheap-feeling either. And it has a swivel cord to prevent the cord from tangling.&lt;br /&gt;I set the heat near the middle of the temperature control knob. I&#x27;m guessing it was just a little over 300F. We put the argan oil in while we let the iron heat up. (It heats quickly!) It takes only a couple of drops. Just rub it on your palms and spread it through your hair. It makes the hair so smooth and gives it a nice sheen, without looking oily. And it smells so good! I could go on all day about the argan oil itself. I really love that stuff. :) Some reviews state that the iron didn&#x27;t stay hot, but ours did. It took less than 30 minutes to straighten her hair and it came out pin straight. She walked around the house for the rest of the night grinning from ear to ear and playing with her hair. We were outside for 2-3 hours in the 80+ degree, humid weather and her hair remained straight and frizz free.  Her dad also commented that her hair looked healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the straightener out myself the following night. I have fine, blonde hair that&#x27;s easily damaged by any type of heating tool.My hair is straight, but on this particular evening I woke up with slight waves. I just really wanted to try the straightener on my hair. It only took about 10 minutes for me. I&#x27;ve only used a straightener on my own hair a couple of times before, but this iron is so much easier to use than any other one I&#x27;ve tried. I used the lowest heat setting and it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Then, the night after that I used it to put curls in my ponytail. It took me few tries to get it right, but it made some really cute barrel curls. They were barely there after a night of work, but I didn&#x27;t use any other styling products to hold the curls in - just the argan oil and iron.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing bad to say about this flat iron. It exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend it. Just be careful where you sit it while you&#x27;re using it or while it&#x27;s cooling down, because it gets hot. The handle itself doesn&#x27;t get hot, but the plates certainly do. We use the carrying pouch to rest it on while doing our hair - then place it inside the pouch while it&#x27;s cooling down. You could go ahead and buy a full size bottle of the argan oil, because you&#x27;re going to fall in love with it. It doubles as a thermal protectant and leaves your hair looking smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> The glove, oil, and heat protective sack are just perks - this is a really nice flat iron- especially for such a resonable price. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not a fan - it doesn&#x27;t work on thick hair.</li>
    <li> Works great and the price was very reasonable.  I have coarse semi wavy hair that is difficult to straighten and this by far is the best professional straightener I have purchased.</li>
    <li> This hot iron came with a little sample of Argan oil and a coupon! I am hooked on the oil! It&#x27;s amazing and much cheaper and better  then the other brand I&#x27;ve purchased at the salon! The packaging that came with the iron is so nice! Beautiful little cushioned pouch to store it in.  This is a very good price for this iron!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron I am natural and it straightens my hair real good! Blue Novelties has great customer service, you have a question they are very quick to respond!</li>
    <li> I got such a great deal on this that I just expected it to not work...but it works great! I just have the 1&amp;#34; one and I thought it wouldnt be big enough for my thick hair, but it works great. gets super hot and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for a professional stylist because of the comments. However, it heats up so much at the handle that it is not possible to finish without pausing. I was expecting to perform close like a CHI given the good reviews but there is no comparison this is a cheap product not for professionals.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is really great with all the features you get for the amazing price. It has an on/off switch , and adjustable heating dial and it really does a great job. The company was very quick with the delivery and all in all it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This flat is amazingggg. Works as well as, if not better than chi. Price cant be beat either. Also comes w a gorgeous red satin bag to hold your iron in. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter since her salon-purchased one ($110 - at cost 2 years old) had just quit.  This is one of the best deals EVER off of Amazon.  Her hair NEVER hangs up or snags on it.  It has worked perfectly since purchased.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this flat iron, since the price was 40 dollars from 200. After reading the reviews, I was certain that this would be a great buy, but after using it once, I realized that it did not get very hot. Loved the price, and it was shipped very fast. Returning the product was very easy, UPS came the next day with the shipping label, overall I&#x27;m pleased with the transaction, but disappointed in the merchandise.</li>
    <li> This flat iron gets really hot nice &amp; fast so my thick, wavey hair is manageable after I use it. Either to curl or straighten, it&#x27;s fast &amp; easy!  I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Before i purchased this product all i knew about it was from reviews, never heard of the brand, yet i decided i might as well try it out. So glad i did, this is probably the best hair straightener i have ever owned. Heats up super fast and hot, and has a little light to tell you when its ready. Most straighteners take up to 30 minutes to straighten my whole head, this one completes it all in half the time. Even comes with a travel case and a bottle of heat protection. Probably the best thing to get on amazon.</li>
    <li> I wondered about the reviews, if they were legitimate or not, but the flat iron works great! I loved the free sample of oil that came with it, my hair feels so soft and looks shiny.</li>
    <li> This product did straighten my hair and then my hair puffed up shortly thereafter.  I&#x27;m black with coarse hair.  My hair was very fizzy afterwards also.  I didn&#x27;t return the product but I probably should have.  After several tries, I gave up.  I may try the FHI.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shipping.  Excellent condition when I received it.  Would certainly order again.  Product gets hot enough to straighten my daughter&#x27;s long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener after my old one from a CVS started cracking at the edges and eating my hair.. not okay! So far I am satisfied with the HSI straightener; it gets very hot and straightens easily. The sample of bio silk that comes with this is also great as a finisher!    The only drawback is that the coating (a rubbery material) gets very hot sometimes, and it is hard to hold onto both ends when straightening. There is a glove provided, presumably to allow you to hold on to the hot parts, but when I am trying to do my hair quickly it is not something I would take the time to use. It would be nice if there was a small grip at the end that did not warm up, but oh well.</li>
    <li> I buy from Amazon because it is trusted and reputable. I don not pay to receive an USED ITEM! I have never had this problem before. I received the package today and when I opened it, I saw that ceramic plates of the straightener has scratches on it and it looks used. Also the the 5ml Argan oil sample is missing. I am very disappointed. Was looking forward to use this product and I don&#x27;t even want try it.</li>
    <li> Worst hair straightener EVER! You would be better off buying a cheap one from your nearest Wal-Mart. The heating does not stay consistent what so ever. The only time that the temperature would stay up (while turned all the way up) was if I wasn&#x27;t running it through my hair. After running it through more than 2 sections of my hair the temperature would decrease and it would stop doing it&#x27;s job. It also constantly pulled my hair. It took twice as long to straighten my hair (which has a medium thickness and length) then it ever has in the past. The only up side to using this tool was that it did leave my hair feeling soft. But, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you wasting your money!</li>
    <li> What a value! Fraction of the price of that &amp;#34;other brand.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Heats in an instant, with a wide range of heat settlngs.&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out so silky. This is your flat iron, forget the rest!!</li>
    <li> I had to give to someone else, and now I have to buy a real one, I buy it just for the good reviews, but I&#x27;ve noticed that reviews are manipulated, rather now pay attention to the bad reviews, because when I read the bad review of this irons were just reality.</li>
    <li> She likes it. Had it a month now. Works as described, no complaints. Would buy again, especially for the $$$</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Able to straighten and curl hair. I really like the ability to control the temperature unlike many chi flat irons. Nice grip on the handle.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and the sample of argon oil is very nice</li>
    <li> Works wonderful. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> I love this HSI flat iron!  This flat iron is lightweight and easily glides through my hair.  It has a variable heat setting which is great for me.  I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Thought at first different and was not going to like but I love it once you get settings adjusted for you type hair it is great. I recommend to anyone to purchase especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not used to using a flat iron--my experience with this was my first time actually! As an amateur, I found it very easy to work with and to get good results. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll get even better as I get more used to the whole thing!&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived on time and in nice packaging. Happy, happy!</li>
    <li> It came looking very used.  I actually had to check and make sure I didn&#x27;t buy a used one. I tried it out just one time and it straightened my hair just okay.  When I went to unplug it, the cord box came apart and I can&#x27;t get it back together again.  This is being returned for sure. :(</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! My hair looks like a professional styled my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Does everything it says it will do for your hair. I have naturally coarse wavy Asian hair and this iron takes care of that problem very well. Definitely would recommend to a friend. Price point for this iron is great.</li>
    <li> Works great. Hot enough to smooth out and shape my already straight hair, but not so hot that it makes my hair flat. Heat dial not quite to hottest setting.</li>
    <li> Works great. I have wavy hair that will Friz if I let it air dry. With my new straightener it doesn&#x27;t even matter. I can tame the beast! Lol</li>
    <li> Have been searching for the fight straightener for the longest time and finally came across the HSI professional straightener. It met all my expectations. The packaging was great and the things included were just right. The straightener does not burn ur hair and does not have an unpleasant smell like other straightners. The straightener does not damage ur hair and leaves it feelings soft and silky. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to carry.Not to forget to mention it&#x27;s affordable price. Recommended for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. I have had high end, expensive models and lower end cheaper ones. This one is fantastic and works just as well as one three times the price. Very satisfied with this purchase. Seller shipped quickly. The sample of Argan Oil was a nice little bonus!</li>
    <li> Great price on a professional quality flat iron!  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This flat iron is better than most irons available in retail stores. However, I did expect it to get hotter than it does and to hold a little tighter while using one hand.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She says it does a great job on her hair.</li>
    <li> Glad i bought it. wish to buy 1.5 or 2 inches</li>
    <li> My current iron seems to be dying, so I thought I would pick up another before it actually does!  It lasted strong for the last 3 years!</li>
    <li> Met every expectation I was hoping for on a brand I knew nothing about. Leaves my hair soft, silky, smooth &amp; healthy looking!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS IRON, ITS HEAVY, HEATS FAST AND WORKS SOOOOOO GOOD. i WILL MOST DEF ORDER ANOTHER IF THIS ONE GOES BAD. LOVE IT LOVE IT. I HAVE AFRO AMERICAN NATURAL HAIR. AND IT LEAVES ME SILKY AND SHINY WITH NO OIL IN MY HAIR. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The wife says it&#x27;s okay. She is still experimenting with it and says she has to learn how to properly use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter in college.  She has extremely curly long hair.  It used to take her over an hour to straighten yet it was never pin straight. This did it. Her hair is straighter then ever and it only take 30 minutes. She has wanted this one for awhile now so we finally got it for Christmas. A+++</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift. My daughter loved it. It was exactly as described,arrived on time and was packaged perfectly. It works well and we are very pleased with it. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Recommend this highly... great Flat Iron, you can&#x27;t beat the price, quick delivery... Very happy with this product... Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this one!</li>
    <li> I am Asian with typical Asian hair.  I have been using a 2&amp;#34; Chi for the past 6 years, but unfortunately it died.  I decided to give this one a try because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 again and it got great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It straightened my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It takes over 4 minutes to fully heat up.&lt;br /&gt;The power switch is on the inside of the straightener, which is inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;It snags on my hair.  I think it&#x27;s the clips that hold the plates in place that&#x27;s doing it.  Not enough to pull it out, but enough that it&#x27;s not a smooth straightening experience and is mildly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give me that smooth, sleek look.  I still had flyaways when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I would have been happy with the HSI if I hadn&#x27;t already owned the much better Chi.  For something I use every day, I&#x27;d rather have something better.  I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I went all natural with my hair now using my HSI flat iron everyone thinks that I have a perm. But I don&#x27;t. Love it to death!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it. I would highly recommend it for anyone who&#x27;s looking for a cheap price!</li>
    <li> You can change temerature as you need. You can make curves or straight hair. Safe for your hands, because it has comfort shape.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter in law and she says it works great. It even came with a free case.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a nice flat iron for a while but didn&#x27;t know if I wanted to shell out the funds for a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;  one. This ceramic iron seems to work well at flattening my hair and does make my hair soft after ironing. The package included a sample oil to assist with straightening, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet. (I don&#x27;t really put products on my hair if I can help it)&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a &amp;#34;CHI&amp;#34; brand iron so I don&#x27;t know if I am missing anything there, but for the price this one works great for me. It comes with it&#x27;s own bag and a glove (which I have not used yet) to protect your hand while using it. I have noticed that it does tend to get hot, so it may be a good idea to use the glove, but I haven&#x27;t needed it so far. The cord has a nice rotation feature so I don&#x27;t get tangled in it while using it. The iron has a dial button to set the temperature. I have thick, frizzy hair so I set it to about 1/2 way on the dial.&lt;br /&gt;So far I like this iron and would recommend it to someone that would like a decent straightener without paying big bucks for one.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely great product for the price. Plus, it&#x27;s great that it heats up within 30 seconds!</li>
    <li> Having  extremely thick and course hair has always been a nightmare when it comes to straightening. This product is AMAZING. Hair was done in less than 10 minutes and left it feeling smooth &amp; has a gorgeous shine. Shipping was fast and would definitely refer this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This is the best iron I have used yet. It left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> The product came in fast. And absolutely met all the expectations. My curly hair were tamed in seconds</li>
    <li> Was looking to upgrade my straightener and this was perfect.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron....heated up super fast and makes hair shiny and smooth. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Pleased.  I have hard hair to straighten and this works.  Very glad. I have tried so many straighteners  very happy</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, she liked it out of the box, but then discovered that it was hard to get an accurate adjustment on the temp.  Sometimes too hot (burned hair) or too cool (not effective).  Sent it back.  Fortunately Amazon is great about returns.</li>
    <li> I took my  chances  on this  flat iron  because  of the  reviews.  If you like  a flat  iron that doesn&#x27;t  straighten  with  out  going  over  and  over  and  leaves your  hair  frizzy  this  is for  you otherwise buy a chi or my favorite  is fhi. My hair  is thin and  naturally  curly /frizzy.</li>
    <li> i bought one of these over a year ago--and it finally hit the fritz.  I liked it while it worked and paid about the same price the first go round.  So I repurchased and it is NOT the same. Hair catches way too easily, doesnt seem to get very hot.  Either its a fake or I had a better fake before. Who knows....I returned it.</li>
    <li> Love love love soooooo surprised the quality of this flat open for the price!  Bought it as a gift and it&#x27;s just as good if not slightly better than my flat iron I paid $100 for!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this!</li>
    <li> I felt like it took forever to get this product seeing that I&#x27;m used to pretty quick shipments from Amazon. Once I got it, I opened it immediately to try it out.. It was ok. I have very curly hair that&#x27;s thick in some places and thin in others. I chose not to put the heat up to it&#x27;s highest but did put it up pretty high. It made my hair straight but not bone straight and it was still pretty frizzy afterwards. Maybe I have to put it on it&#x27;s highest setting. I&#x27;ll try that next time..</li>
    <li> Does what my granddaughter wants: straight hair.</li>
    <li> I just wished it would have a higher heat setting. The packaging is nice and I like the heat bag. I&#x27;d recommend this product if you need something to take you in between times from salon visits.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and it works great.  It&#x27;s easy to use, heats fast, and I especially like the variable heat dial for my thick hair.  A good hair day for me!  Thanks for !he quality product and good service.</li>
    <li> Does. A great job of. Straightening hair.</li>
    <li> This iron is really good. My mom has really frizzy hair and with only one time her hair was perfect. And she still has straight hair after two days! I have straight hair but I use it for the ends cause they are dead &amp; they go up &amp; this last like a week. I totally recommend this iron !</li>
    <li> My hair has the texture of a brillo pad. I heated this amazing device up in less than one minute. My hair was smooth shiny silky and straight in less than 5 minutes. What an amazing steal at $40! I would have paid full price if I had known I&#x27;d get the same results. WOW Don&#x27;t pass this up! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Much better than my gold &amp; hot. Heated up quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to put it up to the max temperature in order to straighten my hair. I received my order quickly.</li>
    <li> Seriously amazing!  I actually enjoy straightening my hair. It looks like it does when I go to the salon. I have thick , curly,  course hair,  and it looks so shinny and sleek. I also love how quickly it heats up. The argon oil is a must buy next on my list.</li>
    <li> When I received the flat iron and pouch and Argan Oil the oil had previously been opened and leaked out in the box and all over the pouch.  As a result I had to throw away the box, pouch and oil.  So I&#x27;m not happy with the packaging and/or shipping process.  I actually believe the flat iron had previously been used.  That said I&#x27;m a working mom of two boys so I don&#x27;t have the time to send it back so I&#x27;m just using it.  I previously owned a CHI that lasted me about 8 years.  I feel the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron is not as good as my old Chi.  I have to go over my hair more than once to get it as straight as I did with the Chi.  However, overall it does an okay job.  I will use it until it stops working and then probably go back to a Chi or try something else.  But for the price it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> My old straightener didn&#x27;t have different heat settings or ever get hot enough, but that&#x27;s not a problem with this new straightener! I also really like the red pouch that is included. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as a CHI (I think)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flat iron. It gets my wiry, bushy hair smooth, and it does it quickly. I keep thinking I will use a straightening treatment, especially in  the summer, but then I use my flatiron and think, why bother? Really does the job!,</li>
    <li> Great product, came with nice bag and heat resistant glove too which was surprising. Very quick delivery too!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair and heats up really fast.  It also comes with a nice travel bag!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my g/f and she loves it! She came from and GVP flat iron that started to fail on her. The packaging and build quality of the HSI was surprising... so surprising that if I had hair I would have tried it out! ;-)  Overall, this is a fail safe gift that the recipient will be more than happy to receive. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron through Amazon and received it in less than a week. This is an easy to handle flat iron that heats up quickly and does a great job straightening.</li>
    <li> Received product and was excited, hair long, thick &amp; coarse, took me 6 hrs to flatiron w moderate results, when hair flat ironed by someoe else, results great. Will use flat iron for touch ups. Recommend item regardless. Beautiful packaging, did not use oil, but will.</li>
    <li> But works well abroad. I took this on my visit to Morocco and Spain.  Plugged it in using a converter.  It worked well but that plates are not as silky and smooth. They are a bit harsh but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This Tourmaline Flat Iron Straightener is great!  It heats up instantly and leaves your hair smooth like silk.  It is nice having a cord that rotates - such a nice feature.  Being able to select the temperature for your hair type is such an added bonus.  Purchased three, one for each daughter and one for myself.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was very excited when my iron showed up on my doorstep a day before its earliest expectance, waiting for arrival is a huge part of the experience. i opened the box and found several neat gifts that came with the iron-a very nice and attractive silky protective pouch, a small bottle of argan oil to make my hair eve silkier, and others. the best part is that the iron itself is excellent quality. i love it, and ive had quite a few irons in the past. this is one by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> This straightener works ok for the price. Mine has some sort of defect where I have to turn it on and then shut off/ turn on again to get it to heat up &amp;#34;HOT&amp;#34;. I have thick wavy/curly hair (it&#x27;s different textures all over). I find I still have to blow dry my hair straight with a round brush and then run the flat iron over it for smoothing effect (which doesn&#x27;t always work the greatest). It&#x27;s definitely not a curly to perfectly straight iron, it needs help from the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This I&#x27;d a great product for the price! I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand but will definitely being buying another one for my mom!</li>
    <li> First time owner of a flat iron so had no idea which one to choose.  Went by the reviews and they couldn&#x27;t have been better for this brand.  Am still learning how to use the flat iron, but am very please with all aspects of it.  Would definitely recommend this brand for anyone looking for a quality flat iron.</li>
    <li> i like it.. it was a good buy... i recommend to buy it. it is okay nothing special...nothing wow at all</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron in July based on the reviews I read.  I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it.  It doesn&#x27;t work better than my last $30 model but does what it is supposed to do.  I really was hoping it was going to be a \\&quot;hair changer.\\&quot;  It might just be me.  It does heat up fast but does not shut off by itself over time (not a good thing).  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair but then it doesn&#x27;t really clamp down well.  I have to use my other hand to apply pressure.  Other than that, there&#x27;s not much more to say except I will look for a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> We have been using the straightener for about a week, and it is working well.   We weren&#x27;t sure, based on the price, but are very happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> This is the best iron I&#x27;ve ever had .It worked perfectly. It heats up fast. Comes with the Argan Oil, glove and pouch. It makes my hair feel perfectly smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> One of the worst flat irons I have owned.  Noticeably more damage then when I used other irons.</li>
    <li> Love it. Heats up so quickly.  My hair looks great, straightens almost as easily as combing my hair.  I&#x27;ve used straighteners that cost triple what this one did that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Arrive quick, heats up very fast..</li>
    <li> This was for my wife and she loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;She is able to style her hair more quickly and it looks better than it has in a long time ( but don&#x27;t tell her that last part).</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener. I have bought two slightly different models of this iron, the digital LCD one first for myself, and then this one for my daughter because I loved mine so much. She prefers a temperature dial to the digital, so I got her this one. In my opinion, this is a must have beauty tool and kicks the pants off of the Chi ( which I used to own) in value, price, longevity, and performance. It straightens quickly and smoothly with less passes, and also does flips, curls and waves. It heats up quickly and evenly, and moves nicely and smoothly through my hair without tangling. I have long wavy hair down to my rear that that takes forever to straighten, and this iron makes it as little work as possible. The swivel cord makes it easy to move and twist the iron around for making curls. The heat glove and storage bag, while not a large part of my purchasing decision, are a great addition also, along with the sample of their Argan Oil. (Trust me, you&#x27;ll want more of this magic stuff when it&#x27;s gone.) Overall, it is a great tool at a great price!</li>
    <li> Hi everyone, this amazing product exceeds our expectations, is very effective and easy to use. I will recommend it to anyone looking for a good product.[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment]]  You will love it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t get as hot as the others I have purchased</li>
    <li> Flat iron works really great. I have really thick hair and this works great on my hair. Also my daughter has thick hair and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price and very pleased with how it works and the case and oil it comes with. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good product, im pretty satisfied with the quality of this iron i have had use it for 1 and a half months and everything works as it should, Thank you, Sincerely, DAGM</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She has very thick, frizzy and wavy hair.  It works great.</li>
    <li> mine didn&#x27;t heat up returned it</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the performance. Iron heats up quickly and is able to straighten my long thick wavy hair in no time.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have purchased!  It straightens my hair beautifully and heats within a couple of minutes after you turn it on.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased. They both seem to work very good, quality of product is fabulous, built very well and amazon pricing was great.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works wonders on my hair. It leaves my hair shiny and smoothes the ends without leaving them rough and dry. The rounded edges makes curling hair a breeze. Another plus is that the temperature dial and on and off switch are located on the underside of the iron just below the iron plates. This is great because I never have to worry about accidentally increasing/decreasing the temperature or turning the iron off while styling my hair(This was a constant problem I had with my chi air smart). I use this flat iron in combination with got2b guardian angel flat iron balm spray.</li>
    <li> Iron heats up quickly, feels good to hold, forms a nice grip on my hair, and straightens effectively.  I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and nice product</li>
    <li> I bought a HSI Flat Iron for my daughter for christmas and she kept complaining that it was not working right and that she didn&#x27;t like it. I just thought it was normal teenage daughter stuff till she was telling her hairdresser about it and the hairdresser said something must be wrong with it because I love mine and it heats up real fast (we were having trouble with that).  I contacted the company and even though it had been over 2 months they were absolutely wonderful to us!  They shipped us a new one right away and it works great!!!  She had used a CHI before but she loves the HSI much better. Now my daughter is much happier and that makes me(mom)happy.</li>
    <li> Heats up really quickly, glides through hair really well, and is a great price.  I&#x27;m super glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It does what is expected of it and it comes at a great price. If you&#x27;re going to end up buying a straightener, get this one.</li>
    <li> Got it as a birthday gift from my boyfriend. Its alright for the price. I have wavy-medium thick hair, it did not make my hair sleek and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the second flat iron am buying for my sister . Have been using one myself for almost 2 years now . Love it !</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is a great deal, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more. I&#x27;ve owned quite a few more expensive hair straighteners and this is by far my favorite. It heats up quickly and not only straightens my hair, but makes it healthier looking at the same time. Great buy!</li>
    <li> helps you achieve that killer look you&#x27;ve always dreamed of. it&#x27;s superb!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this hair straightener..I was really upset when my prior Corioliss Straightener burned out on me..I researched and thought and thought about what to get next..I have also had a CHI as well and was not highly impressed especially for the price!  So after reading lots of reviews between Amazon and google and looking for the \\&quot;best hair straighteners of 2012\\&quot; I finally decided the reviews on this one were very high with lots of happy people..I figured if I didnt think so I could exchange it for something else...with the GREAT price though I had to check it out...MAN AM I HAPPY I DID!!  I think this is literally the best one I have had yet..I have tried every single cheap and expensive one too..I have finer frizzy curly hair that just hates the humidity and let me tell you this thing is GREAT!!  It straightens with ease without pulling, burning or drying out my hair...I dont have to go over the same spot more than once (maybe twice if unruly) and it is constructed well I feel it will last a long time..I promise you, I was not sure of it and am glad I decided to try it out..you will be highly impressed with the product AND the great price!!!!</li>
    <li> Flat iron works will. And was here in no time.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soon smooth  and straight. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Great price.  Great service.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I&#x27;ve had it about a year, but it recently started not heating up all the way, and losses heat when you run it over your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my Farouk chi broke after 7 years. This product isn&#x27;t bad for the price. But I can most definetly say there&#x27;s still a difference in straightening abilities. I have long wavy hair. This product doesn&#x27;t give it the same shine and volume as the chi did. I decided to keep this at work in case of emergencies and I purchased the chi again.</li>
    <li> Gets hot enough, but if your hair has the least bit of moisture, it will frizz.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use and loved how my hair felt.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with the product</li>
    <li> Love it, fast delivery and everything works great</li>
    <li> Perfect service and good product</li>
    <li> This is an enormous improvement on my old straightener, especially for the price. Gets hair nice and smooth in only one or two passes, which is quite a feat considering how difficult my hair is. Delivery was fast and everything was great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> very good product with a reasonable price. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like this one just as much as my Chi for half the price</li>
    <li> Great gift for Mrs. is doing her hair professionally now lol.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom and she loves it. Very good quality and works better than the chi she had!</li>
    <li> Great product. Made a perfect gift for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool.  Heats up quickly and does an excellent job.  It really makes hair smooth and glossy!  Negative is that it takes a while to cool down.  Great price for a great tool!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! It heats very quickly and comes with it&#x27;s own travel pouch (very handy for transporting when it is still hot). It leaves hair straight and shiny with no iron marks and can also be used to put a curl on the hair as the edges have a slight curve. The money was well spent!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for a great price!</li>
    <li> I used to have a CHI Hair Straightener but lost it.  When I found this product online I was skeptical, because I had always thought the CHI was the best brand \\&quot;out there\\&quot;.  To my happy surprise, I actually found this HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for a great price and think it is the same if not even better than the CHI I used to have :-)</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome for the price.  I was looking at the CHI and FHI models but after reading the reviews on this iron I figured I would give it a try!  It works amazing, leaves my hair soft and smooth.  I have long hair and can usually flat iron my whole head in about 5 minutes!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace a chi that I had for several years. This straightener is ok and does straighten hair, but I do not consider it the \\&quot;best\\&quot; on the market. I do not like the way it feels on my hair and I do not think that it makes my hair look or feel soft. I will shop around and I will pay more to replace it with something more appropriate for my hair and style.</li>
    <li> I needed a straightener that would travel the world with me, and this one fit the bill.  I was a bit concerned about whether it would heat properly and be sturdy enough, but my concerns were unfounded. This thing works perfectly!  I tried it first at home, and it heat up quickly. It was actually a bit too hot for my fine, straight hair (yes, even straight hair needs \\&quot;straightening\\&quot;), but the temperature was easy to adjust.  I packed it in the silky sleeve that comes with it.  The power cord does not fit in the sleeve easily, but you can get most of the cord in with the straightener if you leave the actual plug out.  I never understood the purpose of the included glove, so I didn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;  The first overseas trip started in England, and the straightener worked fine there - plenty of heat, and no problem with just using the adapter plug needed in England.  I like the size of the plates, and the edges are protected so you don&#x27;t burn your head or hand, and it is easy enough (for me) to turn the heat dial to adjust it. I will say the dial is in an odd place (inside the 2 arms of the straightener), but it&#x27;s far enough from the heating elements that I never got burned. I couldn&#x27;t actually see anything written on the dial, but I figure it&#x27;s always trial and error in the first place, and it was not a problem for me.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and I hope it works for a very long time.  It&#x27;s a great travel companion!</li>
    <li> This is a great product - smooth and shiny results, heats up quickly, and the voltage is appropriate for international traveling.  As a &amp;#34;busy and quick&amp;#34; person getting ready in the mornings I really wish it had a safety auto-shut off after a certain period of time. I have, unfortunately, left this on one too many times ALL DAY as I am at work.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener.Not as good at my friends chi but much better than my crappy walmart one. doesnt seem to damage my hair</li>
    <li> HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER    This is my 3rd flat iron.  But this one the best of all, perfect for my hair, handy and easy to use, and very affordable. &#x27;love it!</li>
    <li> wife needed a hair straightner while on a trip to US. product is fantastic and price is great.Will buy again from Blue Novelties. It was a no hassle ecperience</li>
    <li> I think the HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON is very much worth the money. I was skeptical and really hoped this would tame my wild hair. My hair is natural, long and hair type of 3B,C. I do not wish to add a lot of heat to my hair and even though this flat iron gets super hot, I feel it is better then using the blow dryer, 3 to 4 times of straightening with my old crappy flat iron and then having my hair frizz right away. I 1st used the HSI on the worst day possible, 100% humidity and terrible storms all weekend. My hair did frizz a little but that is expected with the rain and my hair type. I waited til the rain was over and did 1 light flat iron with the HSI, my hair has been perfect ever since. I was going to break down and go back to perming (I perm 2-3 times a yr), but with this straightener I no longer need to perm. I loved the argain oil so much that I added it into my deep conditioner and leave in steps of washing my hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great.  I have no complaints about the product, but I did not receive the BioSilk sample like advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron hair straightener... it is working well&lt;br /&gt;And quick and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much</li>
    <li> Although I had never heard of this brand, it seemed like a great price, so I gave it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did! The plates are very smooth, and glide over my hair easily. It&#x27;s also the perfect size to curl or \\&quot;flip\\&quot; your hair. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron. Heats very quickly and straightens my hair perfectly (I have awkwardly wavy hair). The oil that was included for your hair also works extremely well to smooth and add shine. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair and love the way this flat iron lets me style it. I wish I&#x27;d invested in one years ago...I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing! I&#x27;ve been using a large barrel curling iron to straighten my hair for years and this does it so much better. The heat control is fantastic, I can use just enough heat to get the job done without frying my hair. You gotta get one of these!</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair looks and feels after using my new HSI flat iron, it&#x27;s shiny &amp; holds the curl for days. I have fine, color treated, long hair.  After using the free sample of Bio Silk sample before using the flat iron, my hair looked healthier than before.  Even better, I can achieve the look I want on a low setting, which keeps my delicate, processed hair from being fried like with my old straightener.</li>
    <li> I used mine twice and I&#x27;m in the process of returning it. The indicator light was glitchy, and as it fluctuated in color (red to green to red) so did the heat level. I have another flat iron (the brand Sedu) that goes up to 350 degrees and there&#x27;s no way that this one gets any hotter than that. No idea how this product has so many reviews... wondering if they&#x27;re all legit. Not to say some people haven&#x27;t had a good experience, as my product was just faulty... but still.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these irons in February of 2011 as a replacement for an inexpensive travel model that had become unreliable.  I wish I&#x27;d hung onto that travel iron, as the HSI has proved to be either poorly designed or defective.  (I&#x27;ve been unable to find any internet address for the company, so there&#x27;s no way to contact them and ask if the problems I&#x27;ve been having are inherent or the product of some defect.)  Here&#x27;s my experience with this product:  1) No matter what temperature setting is used, the iron seems to be exceptionally hot.  I understand high heat is the essence of these things, but even quick, light pulls with the iron set at low temperature leave the room smelling vaguely of cooked hair.  2) The green \\&quot;Ready\\&quot; light almost never comes on. The iron can be left on for fifteen minutes and the green light still won&#x27;t have appeared.  All the same, even with the red light still on the iron is hot enough to straighten  --  or cook  -- hair.  3) It takes forever (or at least half an hour) to cool down after use.    Again, if there were some way to contact the company I would have, but since there isn&#x27;t, leaving a bad review for a product that might be simply defective  -- rather than poorly designed -- is my only recourse.  And based on this experience, I&#x27;d never buy another HSI product.</li>
    <li> I love it makes my hair super soft and straight &amp;#60;3 and I can make nice curls using it it was a great but the glove is really useful and the case for it is really nice thank u :)</li>
    <li> I have been using the same chi straightener for 6 years now and when it broke I was terrified to try something new and worried that nothing would compare to the chi at the end of the day. However, I decided to take the risk and try a new brand and when I saw the amazing price of this HSI product as well as the other raving reviews people left I was sold. After receiving my new straightener I can safely say this is one of the best purchases I have ever made on amazon. It comes with a pouch and glove which I found adorable but, more importantly, the straightener leaves your hair smooth and works like magic without requiring you to go over strands multiple times. It doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking fried or otherwise damaged and I&#x27;d even say I like it more than my chi.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. My hair looks healthy and shiny again. I also noticed it takes less time to straighten my hair compared with my previous flat iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite impressed with the value of this tourmaline flat iron. My order arrived before the estimated arrival(shipped to San Jose, CA) and included a flat iron, red satin pouch, glove, manual, and a 5ml bottle of HSI Argain oil. This is my 3rd flat iron and so far the best value. I blew my last iron while travelling abroad due to voltage difference. This is a decent product, it glides smoothly on my coarse Asian hair and the iron heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I love it! I wish it had auto off switch..left it on for 4 hours the other day...</li>
    <li> Works great and love the accessories.</li>
    <li> Not only were the ceramic plates broken when I received it, the straightener has now stopped heating up all together. Very disappointed I spent this much money on something that doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, fast shipping also!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and looks high quality.</li>
    <li> It has been great for curling and straightening hair. Hair stays straight until washed when using a heat protective spray. Heats quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty bog standard flat iron. It does the job reasonably well, but there isn&#x27;t anything that blows me away. I recently used it for curling my hair and the results held well for most of the day, but by the 2nd day they didn&#x27;t quite have the same tightness. Compare that to a GHD that my hair stylist used one time and the HSI comes out at a far second. Overall, though, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> well is was a gift to my sister, and she send me a messagge for thanks, she love it and works good on her hair, is like that she want. SHE LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this flat iron, I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose with it being on sale.  I must say that I am ultra impressed and agree that the HSI is at least as good as, if not better than Chi.  I love it!  I highly recommend purchasing the stand as it saves counter tops and creates that true professional feel. Thinking about ordering a second one.</li>
    <li> OMGGGG, what a bargain. I love this product so much, I barely want to share it with anyone else. LOL. How selfish, right?    Let me tell you, my hair is very thick. I am Asian. My hair is naturally straight. I mostly use this product to curl my hair or add waves. In comparison to my regular hair curler (the round barrel)it takes me 15-30 minutes in comparison to the 1-2 hour I used to spend on curling my hair. In addition, once it&#x27;s curled, it stays that way and doesn&#x27;t easily fall out. I love love love this product and at that price I feel like buying a back up in case anything should ever happen to the one I have now. Not only am I benefiting from this product, but so are my sisters! I curl their hair and now I&#x27;m the go to person when we want to get all dolled up! :)     Did I mention, shipping came as fast as promised. Yay!</li>
    <li> if you do not use a flat iron often it may be tough to get the hang of it even says so in the pamphlet that comes with it... but it works really well! You have to get used to the heat it puts out I use the glove that comes with it but that makes it a little difficult to section your hair but it is easy to do on someone else. I have done my daughters hair a couple of times and we both love it! You can have super tight ringlet curls to big sexy curls or just flat or you can flip the ends! Its better than any curling iron I have ever owned! it also comes with a little bottle of the HSI oil for the pretreatment! I got  an extra cause I didn&#x27;t know it came with it!</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron. Leaves my hair smooth and shiny. I like that I can turn down the heat and use it on my daughters hair also. Haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it to curl my hair yet but looking forward to that.</li>
    <li> As an African American finding a hair product the works is very hard, but this one does.  My daughter and I have different grades of hair and this product is flexable enough to  handle the different types.  It is a excellent product and I will be purchasing more of   them for Christmas.[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free Bio Silk Sample]]</li>
    <li> The HSI is truly amazing. You won&#x27;t go wrong when you buy this product. I like it so much I am buying another one. One for my home and one to keep in my camper. It straightens your hair quickly and leaving it beautiful and shiny. I love, love, love this product...    Thanks,  C.S.</li>
    <li> I have been buying cheap flat irons for years and finally bit the bullet and bought one that has good reviews.  I have been using this flat iron for a week or so and I love it!  It heats up quickly and has a visible ready light.  The only problem I had with this flat iron is the temp control is situated in a spot that is hard to get to and read.  Other than that, it works like a dream!  The heat proof case is nice also for traveling.  I would recommend this flat iron for anyone looking for a professional quality flat iron, but not willing to pay professional prices!</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. A gift.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Great experience!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great on straightening my hair without doing too much damage to it!</li>
    <li> this iron works great heats up quick and stays hot</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. She loves it. Shipped fast works great</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she LOVES it.</li>
    <li> Nice, quality item.  I only wish that it had automatic shutout, otherwise, nice size and weight. You can tell it&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> Finally found a straightener that works on my super thick hair :)</li>
    <li> I didnt have a chance to use this product. It was too heavy for everyday use. The price was good, but I just think it&#x27;s too bulky</li>
    <li> I have been reviewing several flat irons once I had a chance to test one out in a mall.  They said it was a ceramic flat iron and therefore won&#x27;t damage the hair.  I have hear of Chi before but they are super expensive.  The one at the mall (it was one of those kiosks/cart vendors) wanted $128 for it and I didn&#x27;t recognize nor did I pay attention to the brand.  Therefore I went and searched for one that had lots of good reviews.  Chi was up there in price, but I don&#x27;t do my hair on a regular basis therefore not about to pay that kind of price.  At the same time, I did not want to get a bad one and damage my hair the times I did use it.  Looking for a happy medium here.  That is when I found this one, HSI ceramic flat iron that sounded like it did it all, great price, great reviews.  So I tried it out and it was good.  It got hot real fast (turned it on while I brushed my teeth, when finished, it was hot hot hot) so not a big deal with waiting for it to turn on.  I started to go strand by strand and worked it well.  I need more practice with it, but once I get a handle on how to use it well, it should be a breeze.  Highly recommend using the glove so not to burn hands/fingers.  Overall for the price of this product, you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd HSI.  I&#x27;ve never found a flat iron that works as well as the HSI products.  My hair is long, to my waiste and it looks so healthy and shiney since I&#x27;ve been using the HSI flat iron.  The last one got left at my boyfriends house in Oregon, so I needed another one, because I won&#x27;t be seeing him again.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really great, and if you have natural hair it works even better. Definitely worked out good for the price and I think it&#x27;s the same or similar to what my hair stylist uses.</li>
    <li> Great product and even better deal! This hair straightener blows the Chi out of the water. I have super thick hair, but with one swipe with the TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON, my hair is straight and lays perfectly!   You will LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> A great hair straightener which leaves your hair silky and soft. It gets hot quickly and your hair is super shiny. I highly recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> came earlier than promised and works great!</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s a must buy. I recieved this product with great care and this was shipped to me through my prime account in time for the holidays!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  What she loves...the floating plates, does not pull or catch her hair when she irons, keeps it smooth and not frizzy, heats well...she LOVES IT!  She recommends to anyone!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works fantastically.  I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
    <li> Product was a present for my teenage granddaughter. She used it immediately and was extremely pleased with the results. Works very well to straighten curly hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> A great product for the money!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome straightening iron.  It heats up fast and I love that you can adjust the temperature (something the Chi cannot do).  You can hold the ends without burning your fingers and the plates just slide through your hair.  My hair gets really straight and shiny everytime I use it.  I am so very happy I ordered this Straightener. I will be recommending it to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> I have used a Chi flat iron for the last 2 years and borrowed my friend&#x27;s Remmington in the past.  The results do not compare to that of the HSI.  The HSI is wonderful for all hair types especially curly. My hair is a medium thickness and naturally curly. The HSI did a better and quicker job of straightening than the Chi. Plus as it heated up, it was easier to hold than the Chi throughout as a result of the grips and grooves that are all over the handle of the flat iron.  Additionally, the heat glove that is provided can be used if your hands are more sensitive.  Overall, if you have curly or wavy hair, this is the straightener for you.  It heats up quicker, straightens faster, and is easier to hold/use because of the groove-design on the product itself.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this in April of 2014, used it the first time and it was essentially useless, but refrained from writing a review until I had really gotten real use out of it.  8 months later, and it is still a terrible straight iron.  Even at 450 degrees, it takes several passes over my hair to even remotely straighten it, and thats after blow drying it.  My hair is average and not resistant to any other heat tool (of which I use rarely).  Very disappointed in this iron after all of the rave reviews which encouraged me to purchase it.  It was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is ok....I don&#x27;t think it is better than chi, but it&#x27;s great as a backup or to use for travel.  I use it at the highest setting, and it straightens my hair just fine without pulling.</li>
    <li> Really love this flat iron. I think its better then they CHI I&#x27;ve used. I love that it comes with extras! Really happy about it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! My hair is fine and a tad wavy and currently styled in an a-line bob. This iron is easy to use, straightens beautifully, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair full of static. So happy with this product that I&#x27;ve just purchased my second one!</li>
    <li> this is just what I wanted it to be. very happy with this so far. heats up quickly, nice pouch and l love the oil too.</li>
    <li> bought it for my 24 year old daughter who has really thick long hair and spends 30 to 40 minutes straightening her hair. She called the night after xmas to say &amp;#34;hey mom you get the best gift award again&amp;#34; LOVE my hair straightener 13 minutes… &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The packaging came in really bad shape. It was in such bad shape I could not give it as a gift, which is why I bought it. It is way to small for someone that has long or a good amount of hair.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. I bought this exact one last Christmas, still working perfectly! Bought another this Christmas for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;It works better than our first iron, a Revlon, that seemedto tug and leave dents and bumps no matter how carefully it was used.&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron glides through smoothly.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter. My wife compared many reviews on many models online and in stores.&lt;br /&gt;This product was spot on for how it is described and how it performs.  For the cost and performance, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a flat iron.  The HSI unit deserves 5 starts.  Construction, performance, and value all add up to a must buy.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this product!  Works as good as her sister&#x27;s CHI!</li>
    <li> Have had it for 4 weeks. Works great no issues. Very good quality product. Even if it only works for a year people cannot complain about the price. Sure you might get a bad one but that happens in every product line market in the world. People that are not happy with this item maybe should have thought before buying such items on Amazon. Great Item, Great Value...... I recommend the purchase of this item 100%.....</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Arrived on time and was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight thick hair but wanted a flat iron for a more polished look. I can use this to achieve a nice curl at the ends, which also replaces my old curling iron. Very glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this flat iron. Heats up QUICKLY. I have medium length hair with stubborn curls/waves and this iron works wonderfully on it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out and \\&quot;fry\\&quot; my hair like my old iron. My hair feels soft afterward.  It was everything I expected after reading so many wonderful reviews. And at that price? You&#x27;d be crazy to buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Works great!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and item was as described. This was a gift and at this time I have not been told of any negative issues.</li>
    <li> Amazing. does my girlfriends hair better than a chi she says</li>
    <li> I bought this iron when it was 44.00 and was  worried about the quality. I figured if I didnt like it I would return it. I am happy to say I will not be returning the iron any time soon. I love the iron. It heats up fast and handles my hair nicely. Even with out blowdrying my hair first it turns out great. This was a great buy</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister as a replacement for her previous hair straightener that cost $125 and lasted for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because of the solid build, the reasonable price and universal voltage.&lt;br /&gt;I update the rating after solid use.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  I am a african american and it straighten my hair with one swipe no more than two at the most.  It heats up really fast.  Don&#x27;t waste your money buying a expensive one buy this you will not be disappointed.  The packaging was very impressive too.  It came with a red bag great for traveling. I would recommend for anyone who wants to straighten hair fast.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the fast, and reliable service offered.  The hair straightener is working great, and took less than a week after purchase to come!</li>
    <li> I was just about to return this, when I read a review in another area from someone who had the same problem with this exact iron - she plugged it in, turned it &#x27;on&#x27;, but it would not heat up.  The person said to PRESS THE RED RESET BUTTON FIRMLY.  I did that and, now - tah dah - it works!!  (It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t say to do that somewhere in the instructions.)  I love the swivel cord, and it&#x27;s a longer cord than my last which makes it easier.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair.  Now I am happy.  Yay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many flat irons and this one is by far the best. Gets very hot and straightened my hair very quickly leaving it shiny,  straight and frizz free.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the heating on this unit.  It was returned after the first use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and so far, I love it.  Easy to handle and he temperature gauge is great!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.....works great</li>
    <li> I have been using an HSI Flat Iron for the past 4 years, I love it so much I&#x27;m getting this one for my sister for Christmas and I know she will get just as much use out of it.  The swiveling cord is a fantastic feature and allows you to twist the flat iron in your hands and not have to worry about getting the cord twisted up, and it heats up so fast that quick touch ups are not a problem at all!  My hair has never gotten caught in it (as it has with other flat irons) and it is easy to curl my hair with it as well. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I had originally written a good review because out of the box the product was great. Unfortunately a few months later, a puff of smoke came out of the on/off switch and it was dead. I followed the warranty repair/replacement procedure shown in the manual and sent my receipt, a check for $19.95 and information regarding the defect to HSI. It is now 60 days since they signed for the package and I still have no straightener or communication. At this point I believe that the warranty is a scam and will never again purchase any HSI products!!!</li>
    <li> This straightner works great!!! It gets very hot and makes it easy to style your hair anyway you want. It comes with a glove which is nice because it does get hot. All and all its a really nice I would definately purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Love my new straightner . Arrived quickly packaged nicely and just as advertised. It works 100% percent better than my old one .</li>
    <li> I have been using this flat iron for about 1 week now. My hair is thin and fine and it works great at straightening it.  I use the small bottle of oil that came with and it really adds that extra touch of softness and it smells great!  The only downside that I could say is that my hair does get hung up and is sometimes pulled out. OUCH!!  I was not expecting that after reading some of the reviews. Instead of there being just a smooth plate surface, there is a small piece of molded plastic in all four corners of each plate. I am not sure why its there, but I think that might be where my hair keeps getting pulled.  Maybe a re-design without the extra molded plastic?  I did consider sending it back but the quality and value, it is a very nice hair straightener, out weighed my decision to send it back.  The heat dial only shows two temps, the 410 and 140.  I keep mine closer to the lower end and it does a great job.  I have seen this for a much higher price so when I opened up the box I was thrilled when I realized what I had received for the price.  I would recommend this!!</li>
    <li> So much better than my chi flat irons</li>
    <li> This is a very nice professional quality hair iron. The velvet bag is a nice touch to store the unit in. The holder for it is a must buy too.</li>
    <li> The product is a good size and feels very sturdy. It heats up quickly and does exactly what it is meant to do!  I recommend this product for anyone looking to get a great hair straightener! My sister loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my Granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. It&#x27;s easy to use and heats up quickly. She likes the little red case for storage when she travels.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I ethnically mixed, when my hair is worn natural I have a fairly tight curl pattern and my frizz is easily controlled with a good conditioner and serum when the weather isn&#x27;t conducive to my curl. I have quite a bit of hair but the individual strands are not particularly thick.   I always start by blow drying my hair with straightening product in it, I use Bumble and Bumble Straight, and Spray de Mode.  Then I flat iron section by section.  This routine with a CHI flat iron gave me smooth shiny hair--not perfect by any means but still fairly weather proof and maintainable between washings.  The same routine with the HSI left me with a coarse looking finish, I attempted to re-do the roots not in individual drops but by looking for coarse pieces while my hair was all down.  A short walk with my dog proved to be too much, though it was cold and dry outside I returned with puffy hair and no \\&quot;bump\\&quot; in the ends.    I purchased this flat iron when it was under $50 dollars I noticed the price recently jumped so I decided to review it.  I think the bad reviews are  accurate, you have to be wary and take your texture into consideration. I will keep it as a back up my last CHI actually lasted 6 years in retrospect spending 50 extra dollars would have been worth it. At $144 I would not buy it unless your hair has very little natural texture (curl).</li>
    <li> I think this would  be an excellent product, except for, what I consider to be a flaw in the design...there are plastic pieces that are on all 4 corners of each heating plate (which I guess are there to hold the plates in place)...unfortunately, they kept snagging and pulling my hair (and my daughter&#x27;s hair) at each pass through.  If not for this, I would probably rate this product much higher.  I wish they would redesign this, and I would definitely repurchase this...</li>
    <li> The flat iron works well. According to the directions it says to use medium heat for normal hair...I thought my hair was in the normal range because it&#x27;s not fine or damaged but it&#x27;s also not super thick or curly. I tried it on medium heat but it wasn&#x27;t really doing much so I turned it up a bit and it worked well. I guess my hair is thicker than I thought. It doesn&#x27;t say in the directions how long it takes to heat up, but that&#x27;s not a big deal, because most flat irons take about the same time to heat up (I think!) Anyway, I like the flat iron, because it works well for my hair. Despite what it said in the online description and on the box mine did NOT come with the sample Argan Oil, which was disappointing, but it&#x27;s nice to finally have a good solid flat iron.</li>
    <li> Wife said it works great..</li>
    <li> This was researched by me for about 4 days and then I called the salon that my wife uses. They had a more expensive version of something similar. I looked at it since it was a local purchase and decided that $230 was to much and I also thought the unit was comparable to the one I could get here. I came home and ordered this one and then when it got here had my wife&#x27;s best friend look at it to tell me what she thought, a big 2 thumbs up. My wife has used it nearly every day since Christmas and she said just last night how much \\&quot;she loves that new flat iron.\\&quot; She has Asian long hair, that seems to want to curl and she always complained that only salons have the right iron for her.  If your lady, or you are a lady, with thicker hair or coarse hair this is a great product. Two women who use these daily gave me big props for getting this one. I also coupled the product with the stand to put it in and that was an awesome purchase as well since it stopped clutter on the vanity. This also has a nice pouch it came with and my wife loved that.</li>
    <li> Just perfect to hold and do my short hair. Quick heating and less than 5 minutes, I&#x27;m ready for the day. Thanks</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time for the holidays. The presentation box inside is beautiful and it contained everything it had promised. The wand heats up very quickly and I am getting used to doing my hair small sections at a time, when you use the Moroccan oil that comes in the package your hair shines like glass. I recommend this product and would buy it again if necessary.</li>
    <li> I am very please with the hair straightener. I have used it almost every day since I bought it. I recommend it for daily use (with a heat protective serum for your hair). Great product.</li>
    <li> Really, I do not think this iron gets that hot. And when you use it, it does not keep the heat..the green indicator light comes on when it gets fully heated, but does not stay on after you use it. Thinking of returning this item. I will say that it only took 2 days to get to me..I just wish it was hotter.</li>
    <li> I wanted a good professional straightener but didn&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg -- this one works great for the price. excellent buy. would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. I highly recommend this straightener. Best one I&#x27;ve had yet!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron it makes your hair feel so good and the oil that comes with it smells good and works really well. I would buy another it is a great product and it came at a great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  She actually requested this iron by name and made it very easy for me to shop for her.</li>
    <li> This is a really good hair iron, you won&#x27;t regret buying it. I have had HerStyler straighteners and I&#x27;m proudly saying that this one is way better. It leaves with hair soft, and the straightener glides smoothly on the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> Very nice product! Heats up quick and works great!!</li>
    <li> Great curling and straightening iron!  This flat iron is able to put the slight curl to my straight, shoulder length hair. I am surprised at what little effort it takes to turn the ends under with a slight curl. And, it stays curled all day! It heats very quickly, ad has an on/off control I like. I don&#x27;t even have the heat all the way up for good results. The argan oil sample included is the right size to &amp;#34;try out&amp;#34; the product. I ordered a 4 oz size bottle of it soon after I tried it out. I even sent my sister her own bottle. The smell of the argan oil is so pleasant!</li>
    <li> Wife loves you product it made her happy...</li>
    <li> This product works well, but you get what you pay for. It is similar in quality as other $40 hair straighteners I had bought in the past. Definitely not worth the original price of $200. It gets the job done, but I have to cover the same area multiple times to get it to stay straight. I wish it got hotter as I think this would help it work better. They do sell one that gets hotter but that is more expensive. I like that you can curl hair with it too so it&#x27;s like two hair stylers in one.</li>
    <li> Had to edit my review because after only after 6 months the straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot. It only gets warm, even on the hottest setting, so now it literally does nothing for me even if I try using it painfully slow. I also tried resetting it. Really disappointed about wasting my money now, guess it&#x27;s time to look for a different flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this specific iron due to the dual voltage and great price. I will be traveling out of the country and my flat iron is not dual voltage and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot for a new iron. I have yet to use this iron but it looks to be good quality.&lt;br /&gt;What is great about this purchase? All the extras that come with it! A protective heat glove so you don&#x27;t burn your hand. A tiny bottle of Argan oil, perfect for traveling and a bag to put the iron in for easier traveling.  The bag looks like it has some small heat resistance but I will probably wait for the iron to cool a bit before placing it the bag.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there is a heat control on the dial. My hair is somewhat damaged from coloring and I don&#x27;t want to fry my hair with high heat.&lt;br /&gt;So far I think this is a great purchase!</li>
    <li> So far this has been a great iron! Heats up quickly. Good cord length. Lightweight. Classy packaging. I use it as my primary flat iron (daily). Excellent purchase for the low price.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. My hair is so shiny and smooth with very little effort. I barely have to go over an area twice. It helps that I have wavy/straight and  not so thick hair. Very happy with my new investment!!</li>
    <li> The flat iron straightens as advertised and does curl hair. It is however difficult to curl because consistant pressure is required while turning and twirling the iron. Not easy to do yourself. The enclosed glove had no instructions and so I inquired online what it is for. I was told it was for professional stylists to use who like to hold the hot end of the iron while using it. I would say great value and quality for an all ceramic flat iron. Use it mostly to straighten and a little wave or curl but save your round irons for really curling your hair.</li>
    <li> I am real satisfied with this product. It met all of my expectations, I was given a great price, and it was also delivered to my house on time.</li>
    <li> This straight iron does a pretty good job. It is however missing a couple things that I feel are important. It does not have an automatic shut off so it will stay on as long as its plugged in. I also don&#x27;t really like the turn knob for the temperature, would rather a digital setting so that you may see the actual temp. I&#x27;m not sure if it got as hot as it says it does but overall it does a pretty good job of straightening my hair. A good buy for the price</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and works great.</li>
    <li> Previously, I have spent waaay too much money on flat irons.  From $100 to $200 dollars.  None has lasted more than a year.  I have had the HSI for a month now and am very happy with it.  It feels so smooth when I am using it.  My hair is prone to be very frizzy, and I have &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; hair which can be difficult to work with - this smooths it out nicely.  Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> My hair is really thick and wavey and this straightner tackles it like a champ! love this brand! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Previously had a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; straightener and it took forever to smooth out my hair - the HSI takes half the time and the results are way better - enough where people have actually commented on it.  I almost want to buy another to have on hand in case something happens to this one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for thick hair and for professional use.  My hair isn&#x27;t fine but it&#x27;s not real thick either. So even with the heat level turned down as far as it could go it was still too hot. I felt like I was burning my hair.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the authentic ceramic straightener &amp; it was a wonderful price.  She uses it daily on her hair.  Great present</li>
    <li> Pretty good does the same as a chi iron but great prize heat control great does not burn hair  excellent</li>
    <li> I love it and use it everyday but i thought it was suppose to come with glove and hair oil.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality flat iron as I had purchased a cheap one to make sure it would be something I used. This one is fantastic. I kind of wish it had an automatic shut off, but as it is a professional one, I understand why it does not.</li>
    <li> The glove is a nice addition, but the plastic ends that hold the ceramic plate on the iron grab and snag my hair. I am having enough issues with hair loss and I don&#x27;t need it getting pulled out by this iron. It is disappointing as I was given this as a gift.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift. My daughter-in-law was thrilled with it. i don&#x27;t know anything else about it. I just gave it three stars because i don&#x27;t know anything about it as I said it was a gift.</li>
    <li> Really good. I was happy with this product. generates right amount of heat and the straightening is easy. nice to have it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used. My boyfriend got me this for christmas and I was not disappointed. It heats up fast and works just as well. It comes with a glove that you can wear while straightening it so you don&#x27;t burn your hand while holding your strands of hair. Great product for a great value.</li>
    <li> I chose this flat iron because of it&#x27;s rating and the price.  What I like the most is that it&#x27;s not super hot in temperature which helps not damage my hair.  I like that it has a bag to carry for travel.  I wish it did turn off automatically after a certain time.  It works great on my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flatiron! This is my first flatiron and was recommended by my niece. I love how my hair feels and how bouncy it is. This is an effortless tool and actually makes my hair look better than when I used a curling iron alone. Awesome product. What a great buy.</li>
    <li> She said it gets nice and hot, but doesn&#x27;t burn or fry. works great and she recommends to others. comes with a bag to store it.</li>
    <li> I have thin, curly hair and this straightens it nicely.  It heats up fast and does a quick job at straightening my locks.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener it was perfect for my sisters hair she has thin hair .. it worked good on my very thick hair too.. but I like my chi better</li>
    <li> I have the most rediculous hair type. It&#x27;s thick, tiny, resilient cork screw curls that used to take me TWO HOURS to flat iron. The kind of hair that would shrink back up in any kind of moisture. Beyond frustrating! It&#x27;s so difficult and time consuming to straighten that I was actually embarrassed to have proffesionals flat iron it because of the difficulty even they had getting it done. I&#x27;m 24, and I&#x27;ve been straightening it since I was 11. I&#x27;ve tried tons of products and so many different flat irons, including CHI. NONE of them could handle the job the way I wanted them to. I&#x27;m going to be starting school at a college of technology, and the specific degree that I&#x27;m going for is very time consuming, so I decided it was time to invest in a professional yet affordable flat iron that would cut down the time and anxiety. I scoured the internet for a few days. I&#x27;m a very frugal person, but I was willing to drop $100 plus on a new one. As it turns out, that was completely unnecessary. I tumbled upon this HSI, saw the price, read the amazing reviews, and I was sold. HSI&#x27;s website still sells this exact model for $199.99, so buying from Amazon was a no-brainer! It showed up the next day. (I paid for two day, but received it in less than 24 hours.) I did the usual routine of wash, blow dry, and seperate into sections. The very first layer took pretty much no effort to make it look perfect. I finished all of my hair in half an hour......no joke. I actually shed a few tears it turned out that wonderfully. I would recommend this spectacular, heaven-sent flat iron to anyone and everyone. Buy it, you absolutely will not regret it!</li>
    <li> After reading many of the reviews, I decided to try this straightener even though I had never heard of the brand. I was extremely disappointed when I tried it out for several reasons. It takes a while to heat up then doesn&#x27;t stay heated when in use. It pulled on my hair. It didn&#x27;t straighten nearly as well as I thought it would. It made a buzzing sound when on. I have owned 3 Chi straighteners and this is nowhere near comparable! Returning it and going back to my Paul Mitchell.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she enjoys it</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as expected. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I like this better than my CHI! Can&#x27;t beat the price. This is the first straightener I have got that will curl my hair and hold.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it but her only complaint is the corners of the ceramic plates tug at her hair from time to time.</li>
    <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s a bit bulky and somewhat heavy.</li>
    <li> I really wasted my money purchasing this flat iron. It doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as it says it does. The rave reviewers must have very thin and almost straight hair because this did not work for my hair and I don&#x27;t have curly hair at all. My hair is just wavy. I should have checked the return policy because now I&#x27;m stuck with this flat iron. I might have missed it but I thought this was at least able to set the temperature digitally but nope.</li>
    <li> It heats up very quickly and straightens hair well. I did notice less frizz after straightening my hair. I was able to do flips but not curl my hair. I would recommend that if you want to curl your hair is better to use a curling iron.</li>
    <li> HSI is a brand that I had never heard of.  I was a bit skeptical when purchasing this item, but I&#x27;m glad that I did buy it.  With my other straightener my hair would get caught between the plate and the plastic.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one.  My hair is a bit wavy, fine and thick at the same time,and without much definition, with the HSI straigtener I get sleek, straight hair and with a little product, I have texture and definition.  I would highly recommend getting a fresh hair cut first.  Dry, dead and split ends that are straightened are not pretty.  This straightener heats up quick.  It comes with argan oil, which I don&#x27;t use because my hair is fine and it absorbs the oil very quickly and makes it flat.  There is another product that I use, TIGI Bed Head After Party.  Makes your hair incredibly soft and silky.   The only con about this straightener is that it does NOT have a auto off timer if left on for too long. Other then that, it does the job very well.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It heats up really quickly! The adjustable heat is great and it didn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
    <li> THis was a good price so I ordered it based on the rave reviews I read. I was very disappointed in this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;It pulled my hair and did not easily glide up and down on my long hair. The results were not smooth. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My old flat iron would take forever to heat up. The HSI flat iron heats up very quickly. I&#x27;m still learning the settings as to how much heat I need since I&#x27;ve only had it a few days. The things I was looking for in a new flat iron was how long it took to heat up which I already mentioned that it heats up very quickly. I also wanted to know how smooth it left my hair which it does an excellent job. It also glides thru my hair very nicely. The outer part of the iron stays cool so you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning yourself. All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased so far with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently received this straightener and was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend over a hundred dollars on a straightener as I really only regularly use it on my bangs.  It has very smooth floating ceramic plates that pivot to make it easy to curl and flip hair without creating creases.  I have very long hair and found it to easily accomodate sections.  It has a nice textured grip that makes it easy to stay in control.  It opens and closes without much effort but not so easily that it snaps onto the hair.  It heats up very quickly and the outside remains cool so you can hold the end closed with your hand while turning the iron to create perfect curls.  It also came with a glove to protect your hand if you need it, though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  The temperature dial is a little vague as it only shows the high and low temps but I didn&#x27;t find this to be much of a problem.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking to create a variety of hairstyles without buying a bunch of expensive styling tools.</li>
    <li> The flattening iron doesn&#x27;t slide through my hair easily.  I am going to return it because I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as I liked my Chi that finally broke.</li>
    <li> I have used straighteners for over ten years now, this one is a great buy. I have very thick wavy hair, so it takes a long time to straighten, but this does the trick faster than my other straightener. I really like that this came with a travel bag and the oil treatment. It also comes with a glove, but I&#x27;m not really sure what to do with that. The extras are a nice plus. It also has a velcro cord keeper, which is really handy to keep the cord organized. I like the adjustable temperature, that could come in handy if you had finer hair I imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I don&#x27;t have any negatives to say about the product. It does the job!</li>
    <li> then, really, it can get through anyone&#x27;s! I have long, thick hair...and lots of it. I used a cheap straightener for a long time, mostly just for my bangs because it took FOREVER to do my whole head, and my arm was so tired by the end, it never even looked that great. I tried out my sister&#x27;s straightener, which she paid over 100 dollars for, and there was a way obvious difference...I knew I needed to get a nice one of my own. I shopped around a lot and read a lot of reviews before I landed on this one...and I don&#x27;t regret it at all. I was going to pay the 100+ if I really needed to, so for the price, this one is even more awesome. It took far less time to do my whole head, and my hair feels silky and soft. Don&#x27;t over pay for a nice straightener...this one will get the job done!</li>
    <li> Flat iron works great and the price was perfect. I was surprised that the price was reduced from about $300 to $50.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and am so glad that I did.  It heats up fast and does a wonderful job smoothing my hair.  There is a light indicator that lets you know when it is on.  The heat is adjustable to fit your type of hair.  The cord seems sturdy and swivels to avoid it getting twisted.  It does not pull my hair and easily glides over it.  I would recommend this product to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a small fortune on their flat iron hair straightener but wants a good product.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I believed hundreds of positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I used it, my hair doesn&#x27;t slide out smoothly and it pulls out my hair and it bothers me alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use expensive hair serum everyday and I have used iron about ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even $15 iron of my roommate doesn&#x27;t have this kind of basic problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I got defective product or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it right next day.</li>
    <li> So i received my package today but there was no organ oil with the flat iron. I was a bit disappointed and felt lied too. The box said it&#x27;s included but there was nothing there. Not very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price, straightens well, love that the on button is on the inside where it can&#x27;t be accidentally shut off, I was always doing that with my other straightener. Heats up fast and stays hot!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife. She absolutely loves it. She is very happy with the quality and results of this product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased about 10 flat irons over the years and this is the best out of all of them. I only have to do one pass through and my hair is immediately silky straight with lots of body...in fact, it had a salon finish and looked like it was professionally done! Great buy!!</li>
    <li> This is the first professional flat iron I&#x27;ve used and I have to say that I&#x27;m really please with its quality and how well it works.  I have wavy/curly hair that frizzes in humidity, and the flat iron has done a really great job of straightening my hair.  Love it so far!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes it better than her old chi that broke! It is thin enough to style but also provides great shine! Comes in a very professional packaging and looks like something bought for $100+! Great product and seems like it is built to last!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing and using this flat iron for the first time. I have never heard of the brand HSI (I was ready to purchase a Chi until I saw the price/reviews on this one), so I didn&#x27;t know if it would be good or not. But I just used it for the first time yesterday and I got SO many compliments on my hair. It heats up relatively quickly, goes to very high temperatures (I didn&#x27;t even have to go up to the highest temperature even though I always do!), and I straightened my very curly hair in TWENTY MINUTES. It took me an hour to do so with my old one! I also have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s not short; when curly, it&#x27;s a few inches below my shoulders. My hair is silky, very soft, and it STAYED STRAIGHT. With my old straighteners, it would always have waves in it by the end of the day but today, with second-day hair, it is STILL straight! Ridiculous. I love this product, and would definitely recommend it. Its value is much more than the price here.</li>
    <li> Customer service was amazing!  The iron works fairly well on my thick, slightly wavy hair.  My daughter has thick, naturally wavy hair and worked pretty well on her hair. the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I was wanting salon straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company and told them after reading the reviews and trying all the normal tips for thick hair(small sections, high heat, oil, go over it several times with iron, etc) that I was a little disappointed.  They promptly sent me a new one to try, in case the other was defective.  The new iron still performed the same on our thick hair but I really appreciate them caring enough to send me a new one to try!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister and she uses it EVERY DAY! She loves it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve used in a long time. I have thick hair and it gets it really straight And silky. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good straightener.  No problems.  sick shipping.  Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Came fast. Packaged great. Returned really easy. Didn&#x27;t hear up enough to straighten my hair and it pulled it.</li>
    <li> I love my hair straigtner. One of the best ones I&#x27;ve ever owned. Fast shipping also. Heats up in no time.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. Love the argan oil sample that was included! Heats up very fast. One complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a lock to keep the flat iron closed, which worries me with 2 small and very curious boys!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 1 use will be returning it</li>
    <li> makes my hair so nice and smooth! gets warm very fast. love it</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for! Leaves hair smooth and shiny. I&#x27;ve noticed my split ends have gotten better! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Good straightener. Heats up quickly. Doesn&#x27;t feel too hot for the high temperature I have it set on. Straightens quickly. The one negative for me so far is that it kind of catches the ends of my hair. I wish it was more smooth. Overall good though.</li>
    <li> Best straightener ever!</li>
    <li> Love it! It heats up super fast and does a fantastic job at straightening my hair. I like this way better than my chi- and this is so much cheaper. I straighten my hair so much more now that I have this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last june. Yesterday it would not turn on. I only used it for my bangs... and only every couple days. Got very hot very fast while it worked... but I expected more than 8 months out of it</li>
    <li> Great iron but now my hair is shorter.  Left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Works great on my natural &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair.  I guess my hair texture is around a 4a  or 4b and it straightens my hair great along with the included argan oil. Works just as well, if not better than a chi.</li>
    <li> Iron is good and satisfies the need. The price is also reasonable.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews prior to purchasing. Sadly had to return since it pulled my hair out.  Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my Conair.</li>
    <li> Straightener works well and heats up quickly. I have relatively fine hair that is shoulder length, so I am able to straighten my hair in a reasonable amount of time with this size staightener.</li>
    <li> Its better then m old straightener except not to good for curly thick hair. Besides that its a great deal for what i paid for.</li>
    <li> love it! the quality of the iron is good and it does what it should!  i got some sample argan oil as well :)&lt;br /&gt;happy ironing!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  It works very well and doesn&#x27;t overly dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> I straighten daily for 15 years and this is by far the best iron I&#x27;ve ever used! Better than my $200 chi. If you&#x27;re on the fence just order it, absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> this iron goes to my wife, she needs it a lot and has SOME issues when it comes to tangled and frizzy hair. it&#x27;s simply remarkable, this product can improve a lot.</li>
    <li> good iron but I&#x27;m not sure why it has the higher settings, anything about 2 burns my tough hair</li>
    <li> Good product for the price</li>
    <li> Great product. Glad I purchased. A+++++</li>
    <li> Not the best. Grabs hair and pulls when straightening..</li>
    <li> Love this iron, it works so well.  I used to have a Babyliss so I wasn&#x27;t sure about going with another brand but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> cheap, smoky smell after use, and takes many passes on my chin length thick hair...returning.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find a great flat iron that doesn&#x27;t cost $$$, but treats my hair the same!  LOVE LOVE this flat iron, took it traveling and used it at home as well and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier.  Does not fry my hair like my last iron did, and is soooo easy to use especially with my shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as he $100 hair straighteners I&#x27;ve used in the past! Heats up quickly and leaves your hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Flat iron was all I hoped it would be. It heated up fast and quickly straightened my hair. The temp setting is great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, just buy it. It&#x27;s more than what I actually expected, and the best part is that my hair looks better now!</li>
    <li> I was previously using the coreliiss pro and after 7 years I dropped it and the plate broke. So when I went shopping for another I checked reviews and the hsi seemed like a no brainer.  But it&#x27;s pretty basic, the plates do not spring as smooth so it pulls my hair a bit and the unit itself is a little bulky.  I wish I would have re purchased my coreliiss. It rocked, was light, super smooth to handle. Hsi doesn&#x27;t suck but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the expensive flat iron in the past and used it for many years.  Over the last few years I haven&#x27;t been using a flat iron but decided to use it again. I found my old was broken. I came across this one on Amazon and love it!  It&#x27;s just as nice as the expensive one I previously owned!  I would recommend. I have thick hair and wanted to get one that has high heat! This one does! Go ahead and try it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> works well, but no automatic shutoff.&lt;br /&gt;we often panic, thinking it&#x27;s still plugged in and our house will burn down.&lt;br /&gt;turns out we always unplug it, but all it takes is once.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron She used to use the CHI brand for many years but they always broke down. This one has been great since the moment she has been using it.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific flat iron.  The iron has smooth edges that allow you to put a curl in your hair as you flatten.  The temperature is easily adjustable and it heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> So far I like it. I hope it will last for long time. I will add more comments after few months if this is really worth it.♡♥♡♥♡♥</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically review products.  I have had bad luck with hair products in particular.  Now that has changed.  This Tourmaline ionic flat iron leaves your hair looking and feeling like you went to the salon.  Believe me, I am a minimalist when it comes to styling my hair-if it doesn&#x27;t work quickly and have noticable results, then I let it wilt in my product pile.  I read all the good reviews, liked the price and tried it.  I am very happy with my purchase- wish it wasn&#x27;t bedtime so I could use it after my shower!  My only other comment is that I use this product with a professional grade hair dryer ( I use a Solano) - together the salon tools made my fine sometimes frizzy hair sleek and stylish with oh-so little effort.</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one for my little sister for her birthday, and of course, being her big sister, I had to try it out first just to make sure it worked ok.  :)  I tried it and immediately loved the results, so I ordered one for myself.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and love it just as much now as I did the first day.  It doesn&#x27;t leave lines in my hair like my old one did and my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> This a nice flat iron for the $$ however, my daughter owns a Chi that I have used and I think it heats better than this one.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as efficiently as the Chi as far as really changing my very curly hair to flat and soft.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter-in-law.  She loves it.  She says she can straighten much larger quantities of hair at one time than with her old one which was a different brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice to the hair straightening world, and I am very satisfied with the flat iron. It heats up very quickly and works well. I especially like that the heat is adjustable so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m cooking my hair.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get my first flat iron.  However, on the first day it didn&#x27;t work at all.  No heat.  Since, I have found out that this product requires a much higher volt than my bathroom has installed.  I am sorry that I have to use a different room to use this flat iron but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the HSI ceramic hair straightener. It heats up in under a minute and glides through hair very smoothly. The only hiccup throughout the entire process was that the tracking system kept saying the straightener was in Miami even after it shipped (earlier than I expected). Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent product and having gone through roughly 3 other straighteners, am absolutely enthralled by this one. Other reviews make mention of a gap formed by the straightener when clamped, I didn&#x27;t see any evidence of this in my straightener, hopefully those customers had their minor defect resolved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised that this is the top hair iron on amazon. It&#x27;s just ok, not great. I was looking for another iron I could take on trips that wasn&#x27;t as expensive as my BaByliss nano titanium and gave this one a chance. But honestly, it doesn&#x27;t even hold a candle to the nano!!  There is NO comparison!! The BaByliss blows the HSI out of the water!!!  And since they&#x27;re basically the same size, the HSI isn&#x27;t any more compact for travel, so I&#x27;m going to return it.  I guess for the money it&#x27;s good, but the nano left my hair so much silkier and smoother and I won&#x27;t be happier with the HSI knowing it provides a sub par performance.  If you want the best hair iron the market, then save yourself the hassel and just get the nano titanium!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. Works better than some more expensive flat iron&#x27;s I have tried. Great investment would give the product an A+ rating.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let you know how impressed I was with your customer service on our product that stopped working! You handled it so professionally and so honestly! If everyone did things this way the world would be a lot happier of a place. Just super impressed and will do business again for sure. I will refer people to your business no doubt!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
    <li> My wife was skeptical at first as she has always used CHI flat irons. But after just the first use she absolutely loves this flat iron as well as the oil that came with it. Looks like we are an HSI house now!!! Thanks to the seller for the extra fast shipping and everything was exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item on May 4th and have used it about 25 times total. It worked just fine, though I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have a timer &amp;#34;auto-shut off&amp;#34;. The second to last time I used it was at someone else&#x27;s house and it took me a few tries to get it to even turn on. I thought maybe the outlet was bad, or the plug needed to be reset. Eventually it worked so I didn&#x27;t think much of it. Got it home and tried it today and discovered that it won&#x27;t turn on at all. Less than two months old and it conks out? I don&#x27;t think so...</li>
    <li> This is a good, salon quality flat iron for a great price. I used a Chi before and decided to take a chance on this one. Glad I did!</li>
    <li> It doesnt slide through my hair as easy as the chi air does. I had better expectati</li>
    <li> This is my second HSI product and I should have learned the first time.  I have no idea how this product has so many 5-star reviews, maybe I got a lemon but I really don&#x27;t think so.  I bought this on 4/20 and it arrived on 4/24 (Amazon Prime is amazing).  I used it yesterday (4/26) for the first and last time and it is currently sitting next to me waiting to be dropped off at a UPS store so I can get a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long Indian hair that is wavy when I let it air-dry.  I blow dry it straight most of the time and then use the straightener to go in and really give my hair a polished look (so essentially, my hair is not hard to straighten and most straighteners should be able to get the job done).  I use Lush&#x27;s R&amp;B to protect my hair from the heat it&#x27;s exposed to when blow drying and straightening (I didn&#x27;t even open the oil that came with the straightener, I knew it wasn&#x27;t something I would buy or use in any other circumstance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second I started using the straightener I knew it was a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The knob to turn the heat up is poorly placed and you can&#x27;t control it very well.&lt;br /&gt;- No light indicator to tell you when it&#x27;s \\&quot;ready\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- Never got that hot even though I had it up all the way&lt;br /&gt;- The bottom part of the unit has a ridged pattern, it was very uncomfortable to hold (and I gave up with this straightener within minutes)&lt;br /&gt;- I could hear and feel it ripping my hair out (I was not holding down too hard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no pros for this straightener except for that it is sharp looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife&#x27;s birthday.&lt;br /&gt;She has used it and she loves it. It came&lt;br /&gt;In a fancy box and a fancy bag and it looked expensive. She was shocked when I told her the price. That was a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is happy with it and this makes me happy too.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 17 year old daughter who recently went from very long to shoulder length hair. She had never used any type of styling tool. She was able to master this Flat Iron in one session. Her goal was to get the wispy flips at the ends. The rounded edges of this flat iron perfectly gave her the flips. I think I will try it next!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter after reading so many positive reviews. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for such a highly-endorsed product. I have Amazon Prime, so it came very quickly (I LOVE Prime!)After trying out the flat iron for myself, I decided that I definitely wanted one as well. It got hot very quickly and made my hair very smooth and silky. I am not very skilled at using straighteners, but this one was easy to use. My daughter and I both LOVE this HSI product!</li>
    <li> We were in a bad situation. My wife&#x27;s hair straightener died while we were on the road. I placed an order for your product and a couple of days later, your product was at our doorstep. She used it, loved it and your straightener saved the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn out her much more expensive straightener was not dead. The power to the plug was but she keeps using yours! That is a recommendation if ever there was one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. Delivery quick, price fair and product works. What more do you want!</li>
    <li> Everything about this product is first class. Iron does not pull at my wife&#x27;s hair as some irons have done in the past. Temperature control is good. Using the oil provided as a sample leaves the hair looking in great condition with no \\&quot;frizz\\&quot;. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Super fast heat up!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my fine hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;Glides through my hair effortlessly and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s old flat iron crapped out so I went online here to find a new one.We had not heard of HSI but took a chance from the reviews I read.My wife is happy and so am I.</li>
    <li> Having recently moved out of my house and having no other girls around, I found myself being flat iron-less. I scoured the internets looking for a flat iron that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank, and this one kept coming up in my searches. I just used it for the first time and I was pleased with how my hair looked afterwards. Personally, I don&#x27;t enjoy when my hair is pin straight. This flat iron straightened my hair but left it all volume-y, I think it was because it didn&#x27;t get super hot (even on the highest setting). This is a pro or a con depending on how you like your hair to look.  I also received it sooner than I thought I would, since I opted for free shipping, which made me very happy. All in all, I think it was a great buy for the price. Another good thing about it is your hair won&#x27;t get stuck in the hot plate thingys, so it&#x27;s pain-free. All the free stuff that came with it was also cool.</li>
    <li> So far really liking my new flat iron.  I find it much hotter than the one I had before and glides through my hair much nicer.  I also like that the cord swivels around base.  One thing I do not like is that there is no auto shut off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m greatly enjoying my new HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron. I put a tiny bit of straightening hair cream in to protect from the heat and straighten with the iron. It works great! I have normal-thick hair with some crazy wave in certain sections. This iron takes care of it and makes my hair so smooth. It definitely saves me time compared to my old iron, because I&#x27;m not having to re-iron every section. If I move slowly enough the first time then I don&#x27;t have to iron again. It truly makes my hair look the best it has in a very long time! Great item and great seller!</li>
    <li> After the second CHI broken iron in 4 years, I was in the market for a new flat iron.  I&#x27;m a creature of habit, and came to Amazon to search for the same one. (I know, I know!)  Good thing Amazon looks out for me and dropped the HSI professional iron in my search for a new CHI.  I was surprised at how inexpensive this was, but was hesitant to buy at first.  I looked at the reviews and figured for 40 bucks, I can give it a try.  I will NEVER go back to a CHI.  The HSI is great and works just as well, if not better, than my old CHI.  The item came with a carrying bag, argon oil, and a glove.  I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet, but the oil is nice and the bag will come in handy for travel.  I have a natural 3B curl and this straightened it out very nicely.  It heats up fast and I love that you can adjust the temperature setting.  DO NOT pay high price for iron from the other manufacterers.  This iron is worth every penny and every good review it has and it&#x27;s 1/4 the price of it&#x27;s competitor.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I wanted a hair straightener that would work when traveling overseas due to voltage differences (you will still need an adapter).  The price was great.  The product is great!  I only wish that it had an automatic shut-off, but you can&#x27;t have everything.  I am very pleased with how smooth the plates are because my hair glides right through.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It works really well, and heats up quick. I like the pouch it comes in and even the glove is nice because it gets so hot. I have thick, coarse-fine hair, and I saw a lot of reviews where just one pass over the hair would straighten it. I won&#x27;t give it all 5 stars because I still have to do multiple passes over my hair to get it straight, but not as many as I used to with my old straightener. Yet, like I saw in the other reviews it really does go very smooth through your hair and also leaves it feeling silky, and helps calm the frizz.</li>
    <li> This is a nice flat iron for the price. Some people say that it pulls hair when straightening and i did notice this the first time i used it, but not since. You just have to adjust your grip and it doesn&#x27;t pull. It also comes with a travel sleeve and argon oil. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!!  It&#x27;s smooth,  gets hot fast.  My hair doesn&#x27;t  pull,  break,  is very healthy.</li>
    <li> Though not quite as quick to heat up as other flatirons I&#x27;ve owned, once the HSI is hot, it turns my long, wiry, Norwegian hair into shiny silk more like Asian hair. I love the way this flatiron makes my hair feel...and so does my boyfriend(!)</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, leaves my bleached hair in better condition than other styling tools. I highly recommend it! I also ordered the HSI THERMAL PROTECTOR 450, which helps protect my bleached hair, while leaving it feeling softer.</li>
    <li> Received extremely fast; great shipping; product works great-no complaints!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this item to anyone; my hair is fairly thin so straightening is a breeze. The hot temperature setting would be perfect for my course hair, though.</li>
    <li> I like this hair straightener. It heats up quick. I bought it at a great price and it gets the job done! My hair is straight and silky in 2 passes of the hair straightener (my hair is pretty thick and waivy). I like that you can adjust the heat, but I wish I would have gotten their digital one because you have to estimate the temperature you are using.</li>
    <li> My very expensive flat iron broke so I ordered this one. The price from this seller is good compared to some others. BUT, right after I received this straightner, I found the same one for around $20 on a couple other sites. Because I needed it so bad, I didn&#x27;t return it and reorder elsewhere. Not saying it&#x27;s not worth the money, but didn&#x27;t want to spend more than I had to!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightner is OK. It makes my hair straight but not silky like my old one did.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It is easy to use and works fast on my hair. I don&#x27;t have to iron a ton of times to get it straight. Also the glove is a nice feature to not burn my hand.</li>
    <li> Though, not lightweight, this straightener is well worth the purchase. I&#x27;ve owned a number of very expensive straighteners in the past and this stacks up right against them in terms of quality. There&#x27;s no burning smell during the process, it heats up quickly and is easy to use. Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER. I also tried a Chi straightener when deciding and this one wins hands down. The HSI straightener heats up quicker, straightens my hair fast and smooth, and has a lovely heat control button that the Chi one doesn&#x27;t have. I haven&#x27;t really used the oil or the glove it comes with but it&#x27;s a nice bonus. The bag it comes with is a great addition since I can put the iron in that while it cools.</li>
    <li> Fast dellivery and decent product</li>
    <li> Great, affordable product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank and this straightener straightens and curls my hair effectively.  I would suggest to most hair types, even the curliest.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome.. Worth price</li>
    <li> This iron heats up really fast and does a nice job achieving a smooth look. I bought it to create beach waves, however I think the edges may be too thick for that. Or, could be user error although I&#x27;ve tried a few times with no luck. The oil that comes with the iron is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m puzzled by the high reviews on this item. I was so excited to try it but it is mediocre at best. I&#x27;ve never owned such an inefficient hair iron. I use it to refresh my blowout in between appointments, so my hair is already pretty straight. It is impossible to get it slick straight with this iron though. If that&#x27;s the look you seek, find another model. I was replacing my Remington which broke after about 5 years of use and wish I had gotten the same one.</li>
    <li> Professional HSI. It is heated up for use within 20-30seconds, so fast. And it&#x27;s delivered fast with Argan oil. Good price. So far, good for hair, no rip out, snag or tug hair. Easy for travel.</li>
    <li> Originally worked very well, until it fell off of my desk, roughly 3 feet down onto my CARPETED floor.  One of the plates broke off the corner, and the other one is slightly popped out and doesn&#x27;t go back in. It still heats up, but is completely unusable. I am extremely disappointed in the quality, and I will never be purchasing HSI again.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this as my old straightener finally bit the dust. So far I am very pleased with it and would recommend to others. Also, I received it in a timely manner and woudl order from seller again!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of the rave reviews and great price. I was leery because I thought I needed to pay more for a great flat iron. My last one was $180. Wow was I wrong! It works perfectly with enough heat to style my thick hair. I am considering buying another one for future use. Only drawback is that there is no auto shutoff and no beep letting you know it&#x27;s ready to use. But, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Its an excelent iron, my hair is  thin and dont need to much heat on it, this iron doesnt damage my hair its amazing. And the costumer service is better, so happy with this iron. I totally recommended</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for about a year then one of the ceramic plates cracked now I can&#x27;t use it because it pulls my hair</li>
    <li> I think it works great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product initially for it&#x27;s dual voltage feature which I needed for my trip to Europe.  I was not expecting to like it as well as my expensive straight iron that I have used for a couple years.  I was pleasantly surprised to find I like it better!  I have continued to use it even after returning home.  It is easy to hold and does a better job at smoothing my hair out.  My sister-in-law used it on our trip and loved it as well.  Would definitely recommend to anyone for travel or home use.</li>
    <li> Very happy whit this product, easy to used. Brand new, works perfect and live the hair super shine and soft.</li>
    <li> This works great for me! Then again, I&#x27;m competing it to my ancient straightner I used to have :) but it does heat up fast and my favorite part about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy (which is a problem of mine). I haven&#x27;t tried to argan oil yet...but I&#x27;m excited to give it a try!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could replace my Chi, but when &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; died....I had to.  I could have bought another, but the price point was a factor.  The other reviews eased my fears and I am sooo glad I did.  I had never heard of this company before my search on Amazon.  My new favorite hair utensil.  Very hot; works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED SEVERAL OF THESE HAIR STRAIGHTENERS OVER THE YEARS AND USUALLY GET THE CERAMIC TOURMALINE TO KEEP MY HAIR HEALTHY. IT HAS A NICE LONG CORD, HEATS UP FAST BUT TAKES A COUPLE OF TIMES OVER EACH SECTION OF MY HAIR BEFORE ITS EFFECTIVE.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is totally awesome! Very high quality for a great price. My hair appears to be healthier looking after using this product.</li>
    <li> I love it and I will recommend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use,practical and good value.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really above my expectation.</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic flat iron hair straightener is a high quality product, works fantastic, I have course, thick curly, hair and this iron works very well in getting sleek, smooth, silky hair.  Great price, save money compared to other very comparable and way more expensive quality flat irons.</li>
    <li> The product is a good flat iron, It could be better if the heat control was located in another place, Don&#x27;t quite know what to do with the glove.</li>
    <li> We love our new straightener. We love that we can adjust the heat on it. Also, easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> I got this item and was a little disappointed,  my hair is very thick and curly and it. does straighten my hair fairly well but its not frizz free and shiny i expected more out of a 199.00 straightner</li>
    <li> One more wonderful product offered by amazon. I am very happy with the quality and price of the item. There was a great video online by an equally satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;It delivered what was promised. No complaints here...&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> The iron worked okay but it was pulling my hair.  I used it about 10 times to see if it would smooth out and quit grabbing hair but I finally sent it back.  It was damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON-I HAVE LONG THICK HAIR AND THIS FLAT IRON  REALLY WORKS WELL ON IT-JUST ONE PASS AND I HAVE STRAIGHT SILKY HAIR-WORTH THE MONEY-VERY PLEASED</li>
    <li> My wife has never used a flat iron before this purchase.  This iron is very easy to use and it comes with a glove so if you need to use two hands, you won&#x27;t burn the other hand. The oil that is included is a leave in oil and does not leave your hair oily so you can use the iron immediately.  She says this iron is as nice as the CHI (which was used on her at her salon)and less expensive.  She highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It smooths my hair out and no frizz! A great straightener! I highly recommend it. It heats up really fast.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, I was happy with this product.  The sample size bottle was near empty when I received my box, not sure if it leaked or what, but the company was great- I let them know and they replaced it right away!</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty straight and I use this to get the few waves out from sleeping with my hair a little damp. It straightens well with just a few pass overs, heats up very quickly, my hair looks shiny and smooth. My only gripe is that it does pull at the ends of my hair and hurts sometimes.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  It&#x27;s way better than my old one that I bought several years ago.  Highly recommend!  And it&#x27;s a great price, too!</li>
    <li> I bought a Chi recently on Amazon that did NOT heat up to the level that I needed for my thick, unruly hair ... so I was a little nervous buying an &amp;#34;off-brand&amp;#34; straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this straightener gets SUPER hot and keeps my hair smooth all day - and that&#x27;s quite a feat with the combination of my super thick hair and Texas humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she&#x27;s been thrilled with the performance of the iron.  It used to take her over half an hour to straighten her hair and now she&#x27;s able to do it in about 15 minutes.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great price on a product that is even better than a Chi straightener!  Shipped fast, great product, would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Everyone told me to buy a CHI but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money, the HSI received great reviews and for good reason...it&#x27;s AMAZING! My daughter is mixed and has very thick, curly long hair...this is a \\&quot;one pass\\&quot; operation.  That&#x27;s all it takes to get straight the first time.  I love the free sample of argan oil they give you, unfortunately I cannot find the exact same to buy so I purchased Moroccan Oil.  The two combined are amazing...tames the frizzies and keeps her hair straight with little to no touch ups till next wash.  You won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron! It use to take me 60+ minutes to flat iron my hair. I have THICK, medium length hair. With this flat iron, it takes me about 30 minutes, so I no longer mind having to do my hair. I appreciate that they send the glove with it, because sometimes my hair gets so hot, it burns my hair. It really helps out. The cord for it is quite long too, so you don&#x27;t feel like you have to stay right up on the wall when doing your hair. If I had to name any &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; to this, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side... but that&#x27;s honestly it.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It heats up very quickly and straightens (or curls) the hair effectively leaving it smooth, shiny and soft. My hair is naturally wavy, dry and frizzy. I live in Arizona where the super dry climate makes hair really hard to manage. I consider any flat iron that can tame hair living in Arizona to be superlative! And this one does it. I have straightened my hair and also created big ringlets quickly and easily with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron has a dial to regulate the temperature of the iron from 140 to 410 degrees F. There is a little light on top which is red when you first turn it on and which changes to green when the iron has heated up and is at the temperature you specified with the temperature control dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a nice heat proof glove to handle your hot hair without burning your fingers, a very cute heat proof pouch made of red satin, and a tiny bottle of Argan oil. All very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Bought this straightener as a gift for my sister in law for Christmas. And she loved it. Said it was an amazing straightener. Would recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> I found this company one day while surfing the internet. I was looking for a flat iron that worked for my super curly hair that was affordable. I never expected it to work as well as it does. This iron leaves my hair silky and smooth for days and the argan oil works like a charm. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my hair stylist recommended a CHI flat iron that I loved when she used it on my hair. I got this one instead because it was less expensive than the CHI irons and it had very good reviews. I received it very quickly and it is a fantastic flat iron that makes my hair look shinier than my old flat iron did.</li>
    <li> very easy to use , good</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my 13 year old daughter. She loves it and makes her naturally curly hair look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE November 7, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I needed to contact the companies customer service and found out that they have the best customer service of any company I have dealt with. For this reason I wish I could give it a sixth star.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Works well.</li>
    <li> Got the flat iron but its not getting hot enough and its not straightening my hair. I think I got a defective one :(</li>
    <li> Does not heat quickly and not easy to slide through hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron pulls and snags your hair.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> It works great and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she loves it. She uses it once in a while and she really likes it.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron, I use to straight my hair but also to curl it and it just works great. My hair feels silky after I use this flat iron. Totally remmend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She loves it! She says what used to take her 30 minutes with other irons takes her 10 minutes with this iron.</li>
    <li> Just as good as my chi. 😄</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and no other one has worked but I love this one! Would recommend to anyone and it is really affordable.</li>
    <li> I received this iron promptly. It works as well or better than my Chi iron and was half the price. There is one possible downside. The on/off switch and temperature control are on the inner portion of the handle. This makes it difficult to adjust temperature and turn off when it is hot. On the other hand, sometimes I inadvertently turned off the Chi because the controls were on the outside. I guess it&#x27;s personal preference. The Chi has a digital display that gives the temperature while this iron just has a dial, no numbers. All in all, thought, I really like it. It heats quickly and straightens well. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this flat iron to replace my old one that i had left at my gym. This flat iron works great for creating a curled or straight look. It came with it&#x27;s on bag which is great, i can stick it in there even when it&#x27;s still a little hot and have had no issues putting it in my gym bag. Great for travel too, not so bulky, plus it&#x27;s professional level!</li>
    <li> Bought the product for my gf she thoroughly enjoyed it and uses it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Would defiantly recommend this to anyone trying to get a complete and professional grade hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s simply the best! good value</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron and highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love my HSI flat iron.  Having an included storage pouch is a major bonus!  The Argan oil that is included really helps smooth my coarse &amp; unruly hair.  I will continue to purchase this oil to use with the iron as I feel that these two combined are what makes my hair smooth &amp; shiny.  Delivery was fast and arrived sooner than I expected. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the temp setting is easy to bump with your fingers on accident. I&#x27;ve accidentally turned the heat down a few times by hitting it. Overall though it&#x27;s nice and I like it. Works well on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, different heat levels and easy to store away. Love it!</li>
    <li> The straightener quit working on me after about 6 months.  The light would come on, but it would never heat up.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi for many years but when it quit working I decied to try something with good reviews but was less than the cost of a Chi. I bought the HSI and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The flat iron was received promptly and I love it. It came with a very attractive red satin pouch, also glove and small Argan oil. I have fine short straight hair and had been looking for a larger flat iron as I had been using a small one. This does a much better job and is so easy to use. Very nice product and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron, heats quickly and does a great job the first time through. Just as good as a Chi at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Incredibly awesome hair straightener my wife loves it and I love how her hair looks and feels!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever!! I&#x27;m a natural girl and my hair is bone straight after I use this straightener! Love the oil that came with it also!</li>
    <li> Great quality especially for the price! I have moderately thick hair and it usually takes me about 30-45 minutes to straighten it, but this morning I spent no more than 15 minutes and my hair feels so silky.  I&#x27;ve owned plenty of flat irons but this one definitely tops the list. The travel case and hot glove are awesome bonuses that I haven&#x27;t received before in other similar price flat irons.</li>
    <li> Already reviewed this! Granddaughter loves it! Nice that it has carry case because she goes a lot for a sport she is in and it makes it handy and protected.</li>
    <li> I love it! The best flat iron I ever owned.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. Works great!</li>
    <li> Went out on a limb and bought this for my wife, she loves everything about it. Not to mention her hair is looking fantastic now!</li>
    <li> I have course wavy/ curly hair, this straightener makes it smooth and straight in one pass! I love this one!</li>
    <li> I have really damaged hair. I do a lot of bleaching and dyeing and general fiddling with my hair and this is the first flat iron that really smooths out the frizz and makes it look like I haven&#x27;t made a hobby out of changing my hair color. It&#x27;s a really good product at a really good price.</li>
    <li> This is a truly professional flat iron. Usually people advertise as the best, professional and so on. I had the iron for few weeks now. I can not be more pleased with it. It leaves the hair look like silk! I had a hairdresser that used it in the salon. Five stars, the best iron I ever had!</li>
    <li> I work on movie sets and commercials.  This iron does a really good job with my actor&#x27;s hair.  Love it.  It&#x27;s as good as my GHDs and CHIs.  Could have done without the pouch - but I can see someone in a home using it.</li>
    <li> works really well.  quickly straightens my hair in only one or two passes</li>
    <li> I cant give it any star ..this is the worst one ever!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have 4A/4B type hair and relax it every 6 to 7 months. At times I am very lazy to was my hair do my &amp;#34;rolos&amp;#34; (as Spanish girls) say and go under the hair dryer. I come home and wash my hair, condition it, and blow dry it with a wide comb so I don&#x27;t split ends. After is dry I flat iron it and I feel like a new me. My hair goes from somewhat kinky and wild to straight and silky without burning your hair.  At the end of the day we all have different views on items/products.I recommend trying this yourself and seeing how you feel about it.  If you are looking for an easy effective way to straighten out your hair without damaging this is the way to go. I highly recommend it.  (Ill post a before and after picture next time do my hair).</li>
    <li> I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THIS FLAT IRON FOR ANYONE WHO HAS COARSE HAIR.  I AM AFRICAN AMERICAN AND I HAVE RELAXED HAIR.  I PURCHASED THIS FLAT IRON FOR MY 5YR OLD DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR.  HER HAIR IS VERY THICK, DRY, AND COARSE.  THE FLAT IRON I HAD BEEN USING WAS OKAY FOR MY HAIR BUT DID NOTHING FOR HER HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER READING REVIEWS I DECIDED ON THIS FLAT IRON OVER THE CHI BRILLIANT BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAPER AND SEEMED TO OFFER STILL THE HIGH HEAT OPTION THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO PRESS/STRAIGHTEN HER COARSE HAIR WITHOUT DAMAGING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE PASS, OR TWO AT THE MOST AND THE HAIR IS STRAIGHT FROM ROOTS TO ENDS!  HEATS VERY QUICKLY SO YOU CAN BE OUT THE DOOR FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT FOR GREAT PRICE! FAST DELIVERY AND NEAT PACKAGING.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  It gets hot quickly and stays hot.  I will get my hair straight the first time I go over it and does not leave a bunch of frizzy pieces of hair.  I also  like the price.  My daughter and daughter-in-law recommended it to me after they both purchased one.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter who has thicker and very curly hair compared to my own.  The flat iron workds great on her hair, I was so impressed.  The one thing that took me by surprise is the safety shut off feature, I didn&#x27;t realize it did this so when I came back to flat iron her hair it was cold.  But it does heat up quickly.  When I use this flat iron on my hair, I turned down the heat and it worked perfectly.  This flat iron is a super great deal especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I enjoy using it. All the features are useful.  The carrying case is a plus.</li>
    <li> This straightener does its job, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it works any better than my old cheap drug store staightener. I wish it had auto-off, and it smells weird. I thought the smell might have been the new plastic and it would go away after I used it a few times, but it still smells so weird - sort of like chlorine. I kept hoping it would go away, so I missed the return window. I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> Best curling/flattening iron I ever brought. It is amazing! Much better than the more expensive ones that I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> soo amazing love it and it dosent make my hair look oily fast like other straigtetners love it five stars</li>
    <li> This is a good straightener for the price. It heats up quick and does a good job straightening your hair, but it does snag on your hair which gets a little annoying.</li>
    <li> I have had an HSI in the past and wanted a new one--the old one still worked, but was SEVERAL years old.  My dtr and dil have had 2-3 Chi flat irons to my one HSI.  This one is just as good.  This one has the thermostat that the old one didn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> I bought this recently for my wife and she really liked the product. The quality is pretty good and the ceramic plates do the job quite well. Overall we are satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, long cord, high heat, easy to use, smooth finish, great customer service. Highly recommend this product, and would buy again.</li>
    <li> They look exactly as advertised, but for some reason they did not look brand new. ....they work well but I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, everyone who has used them seem to be pretty satisfied. Straightens and styles my hair just how I like!</li>
    <li> Ive had it for about a week. Love that it straightens my hair really well and my hair stays straight without knots for days. Most straighteners straighten my hair but I will get knots somehow throughout the day. Their Argan Oil is also great. I am thinking about purchasing some. I only gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t know how long the straightener will last. It looks like its good quality and works great but with much use I can see this lasting a year before I have to replace it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone likes this so much.  Maybe mine is defective.  Leaves my hair dry, works about as well as a cheap one from the drug store.  Miss my old straightener but it died on me so I thought I would try this one.  This is mediocre at best, save your money.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and long hair, so I was looking for a hair straightener that is powerful enough so I don&#x27;t spend an hour trying to straighten my hair. This HSI straightener heats up fast to a high temperature which cuts down my time from an hour to less than 30 minutes. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t reheat as fast so there&#x27;s a little wait time in between.</li>
    <li> Felt like it was pulling my hair out! I had to go over it many times to get it straight mind you that was after I blowed my hair pretty straight. I would NOT recommend this. The price seems good but it&#x27;s no high end straightener. Oh and the sample it claims to come with wasn&#x27;t even in the box when I received it. I sent this straightener back and got a full refund.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair and it used to take me almost an hour to dry and straighten my hair.  I would have to straighten it with a brush and then use my iron to complete the job.  I hated having to do my hair!  Now, I can just dry my hair, without a brush and finish with the iron.  It took an hour chore down to about 20 minutes.  And, it works very well.  My hair looks better than it did when it took me an hour.  I don&#x27;t know if this is just the difference between a normal, non-salon-type iron and a nicer, more expensive iron or not.  But, it was definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface that I&#x27;m a dude writing this review and although I wish I could brag that this was bought to give my hair that 80&#x27;s, rock star, makes women weak-kneed because how awesome my hair looks... I really bought it for my wife because her old straightener worked only slightly better than the clothes iron from my bachelor days...Not sure why we still have that thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as you can imagine, with my limited knowledge of how the bloody thing works and what difference a flat iron versus a crimp curl thingy is... I naturally turned to the reviews instead of looking at voltage ratings and the specifications for every single straightener available (yes... there are a lot of them). So rather then sift through all the details for each variation/model I chose the &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In end I proved to be an expert on straighteners (or at least my wife believed me when I said so) and managed to impress her with this little beauty! Her hair is smoother, shinny, more radiant, and less damaged (her words, not mine). So... if you know absolutely nothing about straighteners but want to appear like you spent hours analyzing and comparing different straighteners to chose the best one.. . I&#x27;ll save you the time and say just get this one! And don&#x27;t be ashamed if you use it on your hair too.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. My wife says it works great. It is just as good as she uses at the salon when she has her hair done.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a trip to France and Holland. Even with converters, every time I&#x27;ve ever traveled to Europe I always have trouble with my hair appliances. This worked as promised.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST flatiron I&#x27;ve ever used! I have natural hair and it got my hair sooo so smooth. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> worlds of wonders, gives me that salon look every time. this flat iron is very efficient, sleek and does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my teenage daughter for Christmas.  I can honestly say that it is used tiredlessly with amazing results. Her hair doesn&#x27;t acquire the &amp;#34;Over Heated Look&amp;#34;. I too enjoy using it more than my own straightner:-)  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron... It&#x27;s just what I was looking for. I like the heat setting flexibility and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love it. It smooth my hair very nicely. You can control how hot you want it. The price i got it for was the best.</li>
    <li> I ordered this particular flat iron because it is dual voltage and sometimes we travel overseas.  Have been very satisfied with the performance and the quick delivery from this vendor . Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really nice item. For the price, it is going to do the job. I have fine hair that is just a little wavy, and this helps me get that straight look. The style stays. Also, I do not get the static fly-aways like I do sometimes with other straighteners or the fried feeling or breaking hair, etc. Very happy with that. This feels good quality in your hand. It heats up nice and fast.  The only thing is there was no argon oil sample in this package. The pouch is very nice to have for travel.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up quickly and straightens hair well.  As with any hair straightener, you have to use it slowly and on small sections, but overall I am satisfied with how it works and I am happy with the high temperature it can reach.  1.5 years later, still using it almost every day, no problems!</li>
    <li> This product does just what it says it does to my amazement.  I wish there was a larger size sample of the argon oil that was in the packet because there wasn&#x27;t enough to test its true effectiveness from the small pouch included.  Other than that, the actual straightener is awesome.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have curly hair and have been a faithful chi user for years. I ordered a baby liss per my stylists recommendation- I knew about 1 minute into my first use that it was no good. I got in Amazon and found this HSI- read the reviews and gave it a shot. I absolutely LOVE this iron! My hair is smooth and frizz free, and the best part- the price! I she $179 for my previous flatiron and I&#x27;m way more satisfied with the HSI which cost me around $40. I HIGHLY recommend this product, curly haired girls rejoice :)</li>
    <li> Works as I had hoped.  Looking forward to taking it to Europe later in the summer.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! It straightens so much faster than my old one, does flips and curls that are amazing!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery...great product</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. She is even able to straighten her hair on her own.</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron!! Very happy with the product!!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fantastic. Whether I dry hair and iron it immediately or let it air dry and iron it the curls, it works amazingly. I&#x27;m very happy with it. My last flat iron I kept for years and I&#x27;m hoping this will last just as long, especially because it works better!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this flat iron, it&#x27;s the same one sold at malls and it is the same as many other brands available....herstyler, pyt, hsi, evolution, bebella, The list goes on. Anyway, it&#x27;s way cheaper than many other flat irons and according to my wife it performs very well. She has owned multiple chi&#x27;s and some other salon brand that cost around $100 from state beauty supply. Fast shipping too</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron!  Easy to use for styling and straightening leaving your hair soft and shiny. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Also very pleased with the follow up emails I received checking if all was ok with the order.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a superior hair straightener at a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife along with the other 100 gadgets she has. waiting for her to say she did not have a bad hair day</li>
    <li> Love it. Fast to heat up. Light weight. Love it.</li>
    <li> need flat my hair and this iron is great</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Works just as good as the ones double the price! Heats up quickly! Use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Anytime i there is more than 2 plugs plugged in my extension cord, this flat iron shuts off automatically. My other iron never did that. so i have to unplug my hot rollers to plug this in.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews on this thing... It puts of an awful smell and does not straighten my hair well at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.  I steal it from time to time as its the only thing I&#x27;ve found that will curl my pathetically straight hair.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> There is no Argan oil in the box!</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had! So glad I got it on sale, but I would have gladly paid full price. It straightens my hair for days! As a mixed race woman with not so straight or easy hair this iron certainly makes doing my hair much easier. I love that it has a carrying bag, but the cord does not fit in it. I totally recommend this to anyone who wants quality and is willing to pay for it.</li>
    <li> I am fairly disappointed with this product. I read that it was supposedly better than a Chi, but that was definitely wrong. It pulls my hair SO bad. I have had it for maybe 2 months and I have all sorts of breakage around my hairline (even with heat protectant spray) that I never had with my Chi. The LED light is on the side (which I thought was odd) and seems to blink randomly even after showing that it is heated up. The flat iron is also heavier than what I&#x27;m used to, and when you have a ton of hair like I do, this isn&#x27;t a good thing. It looks nice, but it just isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m looking for in a flat iron.</li>
    <li> After my $200 flat iron broke (after only a year and a half), I was on the market for another flat iron but I was hesitant to spend a couple hundred bucks on another flat iron that would break after 18 months so I shopped around and found this great product.  I can honestly say that this works better than expensive flat iron ever did, plus I loved the little extras that they included (argan oil, glove, drawstring bag to carry it in).  I&#x27;ve used flat irons from all of the top brands and this is just as good if not better.  Get this product, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> This is an overall great product. Makes my  hair silly smooth no more fly aways or damaged  hair. Would recommend to people with even the toughest  hair, mine is very thick and wavy. Great great product  for a fraction of the original price!</li>
    <li> Dries out my hair too much. I was excited with reviews that it would be the perfect one -- my Ed Hardy 1 inch ceramic iron is far better and not by brand name. That&#x27;s just me, though.&lt;br /&gt;-Thick, long, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons!!!  My daughter has natural hair and they got her hair super straight and they even made her hair look healthier!!!  I love using them on both of us and I will soon be ordering another pair as a backup pair!!!!  I am so in love!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the results she gets with this flat iron. She says her hair is straighter &amp; stays straight for longer than when she used her previous flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair straightener I bought and I wished I got it sooner. I love it, I think it&#x27;s better than getting a hair curler since this allows you to curl your hair too.</li>
    <li> First of all I was thrilled that you offered  a dual voltage flat iron!  I bought it to use on a future trip to Asia.  In the meantime I used it at home and loved it.  I like the floating plates and temperature control. My hair turned out beautifully smooth and shiny. The pouch, glove, and Velcro cord organizer were definitely a nice bonus.  I would highly recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I LOVE this hair straightener!!! My Chi and her babyliss died over the summer and we have been on the fence about spending $100 for another straightener. This HSIANG straightener is even better then my old chi! Love it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she really loves it and likes that it gets hot enough to do a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before so I&#x27;m really glad I could get this at such an affordable price.  Seems to work fine. I&#x27;m still learning, but I was surprised it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I&#x27;d have expected it to.</li>
    <li> Got this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She said it doesn&#x27;t dry out her hair like her old one. So, so far, so good!</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great.  Gets nice and hot for my coarse thick hair.  I absolutely love it.  It arrived on time and packaging was solid.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is compatible to any of the other expensive flat irons on the market. Two complaints, though. 1. It takes a little longer to heat up than I am used to with my 8 year old Chi flat iron, and; 2. It pull my hair just a little bit. I am super sensitive on my head so that it a little irritating. But, it does a great job styling my coarse, frizzy, hard to manage hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron to replace my Chi, which I&#x27;ve had for about 4 years. I was looking for a new iron that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair as much as the Chi (my hair would usually smell burnt after using it). This iron doesn&#x27;t necessarily cut down my styling time, but it doesn&#x27;t damage or \\&quot;fry\\&quot; my hair at all (even though I put the temperature on max since I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s really thick). The iron glides through my hair without pulling any strands. I&#x27;ve used it to flat iron and curl my hair. It does a great job at both and it leaves my hair soft and smooth after straightening it.  It&#x27;s true what others have said about the indicator light. Sometimes it won&#x27;t turn green at all, or it&#x27;ll turn green and then read again. This doesn&#x27;t really bother me though. I don&#x27;t even check to see if the light is green; I just start using it after about 30 seconds or so. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this iron and so far have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new flat iron.  I&#x27;ll have to say, it works way better than my last Chi, but of course I had it for quite a few years &amp; I think it just lost it&#x27;s heat.  The plates are the smoothest I&#x27;ve ever seen and I like the heat control!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Really helps keep the frizziness down!</li>
    <li> Love it! Affordable and does the job! Small and easy to take when traveling! Will def purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this flat iron. I read so many reviews and had to try it out. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and I love it. It used to take me about a half hour to straighten my hair with my old chi. I really loved it but I needed a new one because my cord was falling apart. I was going to buy another CHI but decided to check out other avenues. It now takes me less than 10mins to flat iron my hair!!! Yeah... Seriously, 10mins!!! And it leaves my hair feeling so soft and easy to run my fingers through and so shiny! The argan oil they give you with it... There aren&#x27;t even words for this little miracle in a bottle. This is how my hair looks after a day at the salon getting deep conditioning treatments and all the dead ends cut off. This product is definitely salon grade quality and I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> It worked AMAZINGLY well. I am a black female and I have VERY thick hair. I haven&#x27;t put a relaxer in it for over a year now, this straightener is the best one I&#x27;ve used in my hair so far. It heats up high enough to really tackle my hair, and it&#x27;s fast too. I was worried when I bought and now I can&#x27;t shut up about it. Really good product.</li>
    <li> Return was approved waiting for label to return item..</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after my Chi gave out after 3 years. I bought the HSI based on the reviews. I would say this straightener is ok...I have straight, long, thin hair I use a straightener everyday to just smooth out the kinks in my hair. Since my hair is so thin it shouldn&#x27;t take much effort to get it straight. I put this straightener on the hottest heat setting and it still takes multiple times to get small pieces straight enough. Even on the hottest setting it doesn&#x27;t seem very hot. When I had my Chi you could see steam coming off of the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this straightener is that it pulls your hair, like others have said. It is annoying. I used the argan oil that came with it once, didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair after using it. Not sure why this straightener comes with a glove because it does not get hot enough to worry about burning your fingers.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener. I don&#x27;t need it super often, but it is absolutely perfect and a great price for those occasional uses. Nice to have the argan oil thrown in for good measure - I have fine, color-treated hair so it helps keep it from getting too brittle when using heat products.</li>
    <li> Love it and it Heats up quick. The packaging is wonderful and I love the free mini Argan oil. This flat iron is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had a CHI before this and while this one gets the job done, it pulls my hair more and I have to run it through the iron more that I did with my CHI. The reason I bought this is because of the price and the reviews. While it does what I need it to, I still don&#x27;t like it as well as I did my CHI.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the worst I have ever owned. It pulls at my hair and doesnt leave it smooth like they say it will, and my natural hair is almost straight as a stick anyway. Product is horrible. I only bought it because of the awesome reviews it got. I don&#x27;t agree with the people that gave this a good rating</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great flat iron. I have very straight hair that is difficult to curl. With this iron, I can get nice curls without burning my fingers. It&#x27;s also much faster and easier than a curling iron. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair too for beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> Leave your hair beautiful one of the best products I ever brought on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and decided to do something different with it, meaning I would wear it straight. I purchased this flatiron having read that a ceramic flatiron is the best. I have used it a couple times and really like it because I can adjust the temperature and also it is constructed so that it would be near impossible to burn your scalp. I had never used a flatiron up to this point and was a bit intimidated by it, but have been pleasantly surprised at the ease of learning how to use it. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a flatiron!</li>
    <li> Great just what the wife wanted</li>
    <li> It was very easy to use</li>
    <li> Wonderful iron.  Wonderful company.  Wonderful argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love it... Natural hair and it straightens my curly/wavy hair. I do not have a keratin treatment and I&#x27;m happy with results</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron. I went through 5-6 before just trying to find the right one. Either the flat iron wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough or wouldn&#x27;t clamp my hair the way I needed it to. I have thick curly hair that flat irons super well with this iron. Takes me 7-10 minutes, which I love!</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and worked out well.  I wanted it for a trip to Europe and needed an iron that could be used with 220/240 voltage,with a European plug adapter.  It operated flawlessly in both Croatia and Italy. I can also use it here in the US as a backup to my 110V flatiron. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have thick curly hair and this flat iron does a great job of smoothing it out, and lasts several days. Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off feature.</li>
    <li> Totally ripped my hair and now have a ton of fly aways. Do not recommend</li>
    <li> Love it. Straightens beautifully.  Will recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> My old flat iron broke so I bought this one based on the great reviews and price. I was not disappointed! The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected it to. But it works great on my hair :)</li>
    <li> It does get hot and it does work well. It pulls my hair once I get to the ends. I just wish I can find a product that work just as well on my hair to make my hair last long when I strength it.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron ever, I am enjoying it. Thank you seller.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent flat iron. It heats up in about 30 seconds which is great for those mornings I&#x27;m half asleep and forget to turn it on! My only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is that the clamp is a little tight. I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up after some more use though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to replace her Chi that recently broke.  I cannot comment personally as I am just the dad who spends the money but my daughter said it is better than her Chi and she loves it.  She loves how it leaves her hair shiny and smooth and her hair is done in less than 15 minutes.  As I father, I reviewed this product extensively prior to purchase as it was a surprise for my daughter.  After comparing with several similar products, the reviews on this sold me along with the great price.  I am not disappointed in the least and recommend this to anyone looking for a quality straightener.  Read the reviews and compare.  You won&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
    <li> Straightener works really well!  Even better than I  expected!  The pouch is also handy and super cute!</li>
    <li> I have owned only high end, salon brand flat irons. This is a really good flat iron for the price, however, it does not slide as smoothly through my very fine, blonde hair as well as the more expensive brands. I do find that it is less damaging, though, which is great. I like the long cord and the variable temperature setting. Oh! And I love how quickly it heats up. Takes longer to cool down than other brands though... So it&#x27;s a great value for price, but not quite a &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> A superb flat iron.  I love the adjustable feature and the extra long cord!!!  It heats quickly but doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  the temperature adjustment feature is very sensitive and seems to be just what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new flat iron to replace my Solia one, which broke, and I was not disappointed. The HSI Pro works marvellously. It gets my thick, wavy hair super smooth and straight, and leaves it quite soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller got it to me quickly. I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener at a great price.</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with this straightener. It works quite good for my daughter&#x27;s frizzy and curvy hair. Most important thing is that it will not have the burning smell. This is the right straigtener I strongly suggest to use.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Works great! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two straighteners in the past, and I rarely ever used them because it took so long to straighten my thick hair. It would take several passes on the same strand of hair to get it straightened to my liking. With the HSI straightener though, I was pleased to find that it was so easy and quick! Very happy customer, I appreciate being able to adjust the temperature settings and the straightener itself is very sleek and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Once again pleased with Amazon and also their vendor. The description of the hot iron was exactly what I was looking for with a trip to Italy coming up. It&#x27;s light weigh,heats up and cools down quickly, a long cord that swivels so no knotting of the cord. Leaves my hair less frizzy then any other iron I have  used and the price is great. Very happy</li>
    <li> My first non-Chi iron and I am satisfied with my purchase so far. There is definitely a quality difference between the HSI and the more pricey brands. However I got tired of spending $100+ on these irons that don&#x27;t last that long. I am hoping that it will do the job.</li>
    <li> just got my hsi flat iron today! came in a cute red pouch with small bottle of this hsi oil thingy a heat protected glove, the flat iron gets hot quickly it straightens great its DUAL VOLTAGE!!!!! LOVE THAT it curls beautifully i curled my hair real quickly to see how it would turn out it was beautiful very nice hard curls!</li>
    <li> This straightener does well to straighten...for like 5 minutes.  I do not have extremely coarse or curly hair, but by the time I got done, I had to go back over my hair again.  My hair was not smooth or shiny, which is what I expect from a flat iron.  It does heat up fast, has a readiness indicator light, and I like that I can adjust the temperature, but it just didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! I recommended 100%! Thank you for selling a great product for such an affordable price! Sincerely, happy customer :)</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I have to buy a new straightener about every 2 years. I have purchased all different brands and none have compared to this straightener. The price is amazing. I have spent 4 times this amount on other straighteners and not gotten the result that I get when I use this flat iron. When I use it my hair is straight and it stays that way regardless of humidity. I can sleep on it and it stays straight as well. I am a huge fan of this product and highly recommend it to anyone that has curly or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> The flat iron plate is short, only 3-1/2&amp;#34; long, which is not stated on the packaging.  Difficult to use in real life.  The free Argan oil sample advertised is misleading.  The advertised sample shows a bottle.  What you get is a flat, one-use squeeze-out packet.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love it!!!. Now she can straighten her hair quicker than ever. The glove its very useful to grab the hair when your are using the iron. Comes with a bag.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!.</li>
    <li> After my Paul Brown flat iron died after having it for 8 years and I was undecided on which flat iron to buy. I was debating between a HSI and a Chi. Since I have extremely thick hair, I needed a flat iron that was able to reach a high temperature in order to straighten my hair in one sitting. I AM very happy I went with the HSI because it immediately worked well for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair as I&#x27;m straightening it and the having the glove really helps so I&#x27;m not burning my hair with the high heat. I am forever HSI fan and this really beats the Chi.</li>
    <li> My old flat iron was at least 3 years old and cost about $150. I didn&#x27;t think it was heating up properly anymore so I started to look at new irons. I found the HSI 1\\&quot; ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It heats up super-fast and just glides through my hair. I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far it seems to be a great product at a great price! Hope you like it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a flat iron before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but after seeing my friend&#x27;s hair after using some expensive straightener I decided to purchase one for myself. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t afford anything expensive, but it happened that I found this HSI iron for a really good price and I purchased it. I received it very quickly, nicely packed and loved it after the first use. It didn&#x27;t pull my hair, went very smoothly through it. The temperature control allows you to set it at your desired level. I&#x27;ve got the great final result in practicaly no time. I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this iron! It has professional grade plates but comes with a wonderful price tag. I wasn&#x27;t going to get a cheap drugstore version because I wanted to curl the bottom of my hair every day and this iron does it just right for a great price, rather than a $200 or $300 salon grade flat iron. It also straightens pretty well as I have straightened out my hair after having it in a tight braid all day. It has a wide variety of temperatures from ~200 to ~400 degrees F so it works for all hair types. I highly recommend it and will be sure to buy this one again if mine wears out in a few years!</li>
    <li> Great for the price, way cheaper than any retail establishment. Works great, I use it all the time... No problems here!</li>
    <li> I wish it had an auto shut off because I am terrible about leaving it turned on, but it does cycle so it doesn&#x27;t overheat. I know my husband would prefer if it just shut off. Gets really really hot though so I keep mine turned down quite low.</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this because it had such good reviews but I am very displeased. Maybe mine is a lemon, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot at all and is pretty much pointless. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works amazingly! I have very coarse and dry hair (naturally it is the kind of hair that shrivels up into a tight, packed afro at any sight of mist or water). Even though it is relaxed now, it is still very thick, somewhat kinky and dry. It gets damaged easily! This flat iron not only got it straight, but also made it shine and bounce (and all I used was a little bit of olive oil in my hair). It looked as if I had walked straight out of a shop!  In addition, it comes with a heat glove to protect your hand, a pouch to slide it in and a small bottle of hair serum (I have yet to try). Furthermore, it has a rounded shape so you can easily use this flat iron to curl your hair as well (which I also did). The curls are beautiful, bouncy and last. I have been searching high and low for a flat iron that is both affordable and provides salon results for African American women. I have found it! It is worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> When I got this in October for $50 it was a really good straightener.... but within 20 uses it was not nearly as good but still did the job. Now, less than 8 months later, it is broken and I need a new straightener.</li>
    <li> The iron heats up incredibly fast and does not drop in temperature as you straighten your hair.  It&#x27;s a great iron overall and I have gone through dozens of hair irons, including name brands that did not work as well for me.</li>
    <li> I love my new HSI Flat Iron. My old one just seemed to have worn out, but this one is so much better than my old one ever was. This new iron was half the price and its twice as good . I really love the way my hair comes out now.The style seems to hold better and longer because the heat is more intense.  You do not need to set it to the hottest, it is intensley hot at about 3/4 to full temp.</li>
    <li> Good quality flat iron.  The only feature I don&#x27;t like is the temperature wheel.  It&#x27;s buried inside the unit (plus it&#x27;s very small), making it difficult to reach and almost impossible to see what temperature setting you are on.  Other irons I&#x27;ve had have this wheel on the outside of the unit where it&#x27;s easy to see.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron! Quite simply...the best flat iron I have purchased and by far my favorite one! It works great, with exceptional results!</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife.  In the first week she used this product she told me people commented on how silky and strong her hair looked.  She mentioned it takes half the time to flatten her hair with this unit, but it does make her hair hot to handle.  She loves the product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this flat iron...was looking at a CHI and would recommend this brand!  Heats up to 400 degrees too!</li>
    <li> I have never heard of HSI until I started looking around amazon for a new flat iron. I was looking at the CHI and BaByliss straighteners that were about $100. I&#x27;ve used my friends CHI several times and love how soft my hair was after using it and I wanted to finally spend the money to get my own. I stumbled across HSI for $47. I figured it was going to be another Wal-mart quality straightener since I have never heard of it. I was impressed that it had such good reviews from about 800 people and had a better rating than the CHI. After reading the reviews I decided to take the plunge and try it out. I thought I was only getting the Argan Oil and the flat iron but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came with a pouch and the styling glove. The straightener heated quickly and easily glided through my hair. So my hair is in DIRE need of a haircut after an at home hair bleaching incident and it still straightened easily and left my hair feeling soft. I love my new HSI and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a chance. Oh and I forgot to mention that it comes with a year warranty!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get hot enough after the 5th use. Would&#x27;ve returned it but it was too late.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, and works well in Europe with an adaptor! Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> So far, just as good as my CHI, if not better!</li>
    <li> Product is good wasn&#x27;t the straightener I was looking for but this one works fine!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Though be careful, if is fragile. I had mine for a few months and had to replace it when my ferrets knocked it off the counter and the plates shattered.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product. I have had many straighteners through the years and this is by far the best. Paired with their amazing argan oil, this straightener leaves my hair frizz free and smooth and silky. I am also thrilled that I was able to get this straightener at such a great price through Amazon :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron was a great purchase.  I have thicker, wavy hair, which can look dry after using a flat iron. The HSI flat iron works really well, and my hair is softer and more manageable after using it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Great price! Great quality!</li>
    <li> Straightens my thick hair very well &amp; makes it smooth.</li>
    <li> I use to use the wet to straight straightener and even though it worked for a little bit my hair felt dry and once humidity happened with hair from walking outside my hair frizzed out. I was very happy I came across this item. Product heats up quick within a minute and its ready to straighten your hair. I have natural curly hair and when I straighten my hair it was soft, and stayed straight for the whole day. I use this item 2 times each week This item I am very happy with and impressed with. Item comes with the argon oil, which works wonders and has a pleasant smell. I have highly recommended this to my friends as well.</li>
    <li> bought this flat iron for my wife. found it at a great price on amazon, product came sooner than promised, she has had it almost 1month uses it almost everyday and no complaints</li>
    <li> The product came in a timely manner and the seller was very prompt.  The actual flat iron pulls out my hair when I use it.  The end of the iron has a raised portion that grabs pieces of my hair.  I am usually able to readjust the iron before any actual hair loss occurs.  I am going to discontinue using the product due to the damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> This does a great job straightening my hair. I also have been trying to use it to curl my hair. It does work but I believe I need some more practice to get it right!</li>
    <li> It does the job gets really hot no complaints. You can gauge the heat the cord doesnt tangle. Great on weaves not so much natural hair im african american coarse hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a CHI flat iron daily for about 7 years prior to this, and it finally stopped working. Was going to buy another CHI to replace it, but with the low price of the HSI and the online rating I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was not impressed at all. First time using the iron it snagged and pulled out a some of my hair.  The iron felt rough and did not glide through my hair nicely at all.  Gave it another shot the next morning and the same thing, snagged, pulled and ripped out my hair again.  The HSI flat iron is on it&#x27;s way back today, and already ordered another CHI flat iron instead.  The CHI flat irons are worth every extra penny paid compared to this iron.  Definitely would not recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I feel I am always buying new hair straighteners from the drug store or a Big Box store after one or two years because they break so easily and are not that high quality. I decided to invest in a higher-quality product and was pleased with the HSI Professional. I have not had any problems with the straightener and I loved the packaging. It came with a glove, a silk storage pouch and a sample of Argan oil. Great product. It was delivered speedily as well.</li>
    <li> Powerfull ceramic I liked it alot</li>
    <li> I have had so many compliments on my hair since using this straightener. It is awesome.  My hair even feels healthier!</li>
    <li> wow, I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud or what.  There are so many glowing reviews for this straightener, but the one I got is not great at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly thin with just a bit of a wave.  I&#x27;m not trying to straighten incredibly curly hair or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience was like many of the low reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it took quite a long time for this to heat up.  I&#x27;m used to my previous conair one that was ready by the time I used the bathroom and brushed my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-after heating up, when I started straightening, the light started blinking right away showing that heat was going down, so it needed to heat up again.  By the time I got to the second side of my head, I could tell it was not very hot at all on my hair.  (I don&#x27;t believe it gets as hot as it claims it should).&lt;br /&gt;-in the end, my hair really didn&#x27;t straighten that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s not as $$ as a Chi etc, but it&#x27;s not the cheapest thing either...I expected a lot more, especially from the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning it.  I picked up the Remington silk ceramic for half the price of this one at a local store and I can already tell it is way better.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the flat iron.  The product was shipped and received promptly.</li>
    <li> Bought this flat iron about three months ago. I did not want to write a feedback until I have used an item for at least a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron does not disappoint. Very easy to use. I don&#x27;t think that the on button&#x27;s placement was a problem. Heats up fast and leaves your hair shiny and with more volume than you first started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with a flick of your wrist, you can do curls with this, too. Bouncy and perfect ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for this is very reasonable. And works as good if not better as the very expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this one would last for a long time like my last one.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic straightener. The included HSI oil is so good too I purchased a bottle. I had my previous straightener I paid a lot more for burn out and decided to give this one a try. May I say this one seems to be of sounder-quality and comes with so many goodie freebies. I don&#x27;t use the glove myself, but I think I just got used to not doing it that way. Comes in handy with curling though!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron, I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes my hair so soft, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that burning smell the way my Andis flat iron did and I love the various heat settings. Also, It doesn&#x27;t take me over an hour to flat iron my hair, and it looks great if I part larger sections to flat iron, whereas with my Andis iron, I had to make skinny sections to flat iron, in order to get my hair straight. Also the Argan oil, smells so good- and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a major upgrade from my old Conair hot iron.  My last one took about 5 minutes to heat up, and it did not get as hot as this new HSI.  Also, the HSI has much smoother plates.  Yep, I&#x27;m in love with this one!</li>
    <li> I love my HSI flat Irons. After using the flat irons, my hair felt soft and silky. I&#x27;m a 4c natural, now I can transition between straight and curly</li>
    <li> I really like this straighter, much better than my last one. It is odd that I have to reset it before it heats up. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dry or frizzed out.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing price and it works great. Bought it for my wife to use in France. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a ceramic flat iron but was finding them very expensive. I discovered yours by accident and very glad I did. The price was very reasonable and I love the way my hair looks and feels after using the iron and the added bonus of the argon oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this after being the subject of a mall kiosk demo. It is highly rated on several sites. It works fairly well and I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. Only two drawbacks: the directions say not to set it on any surface while hot. It is impossible to use without setting down somewhere to gather my hair. Second, one of the ceramic plates was chipped when it arrived. I still use it.</li>
    <li> gets hot fast... works well on all hair types. My clients and I love this hair iron.</li>
    <li> I b;ought this for my daughter and she&#x27;s EXTREMELY pleased saying it works very well. Enjoys the added bonus of a bag for travel purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d personally give it 5 stars based on price compared to comparable irons / i received it in a very timely fashion and boxed- store quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL GOOD- I&#x27;d buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 different ceramic flat irons over the past years.  I have very thick, fine, curly hair.  I like to go straight on a regular basis for several reasons besides I like the look as much as I do on a good curly day.  This flat iron works better than any of the other ones I have ever owned.  I can actually get it as flat and straight as the salon stylist can!  My oldest daughter has tight curls and I have straightened her hair a couple times now.  This is the first flat iron she is happy with.  It used to be, I would straighten her hair and by the time she returned home from school it was mostly curly again.  Not with the HSI flat iron.  She gets compliments and people are shocked at how beautifully straight it gets.  No fuzz or extra body.  I would recommend this to others for sure.</li>
    <li> TIP: reset the button on the electric plug before using. Mine didnt work at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair shiny and soft. How does it do that??&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. I used CHI hair straightener for the longest time until it recently died on me, but this is just as awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!! It heats up fast &amp; works great. You can&#x27;t find a better one for the amazing low price. As an added bonus they send a glove &amp; pouch. The pouch is great when carrying the straightener with you on the go.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair straightener I have ever owned. I straighten my hair every day and nothing beats the quality of this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they ship incredibly fast. We are military stationed over seas and most shipments take forever to get to an APO and this one was by far the fastest in under a week! I&#x27;ve waited months for items, so I was so excited!</li>
    <li> What an amazing deal! My Chi broke after five faithful year and travel from the United States to Japan and more! Even using on the Japan watt, it was bliss, so I thought until I received this work of art! My hair is light brown thick and down to my waist. It only takes about ten true min. to get the straight, curls on the ends I want! Such nice packaging as well as feel and style. I&#x27;m for sure loving the price. No auto off but I unplug when I&#x27;m done so that&#x27;s no bother for me. Super deal ladies, don&#x27;t pass this up!</li>
    <li> Quick product . Wife loves it... Happy wife happy life get hot quickly... Wife says the hotter the better... She had to turn it down it&#x27;s so hot</li>
    <li> I really like the flat iron and love the price.  It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like my last one.  Would highly recommend this flat iron</li>
    <li> The product works great for the price.  My hair is frizzy and when is hot and humid nothing seems to work. It works ok other than that.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used!  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the way my hair looks every time I use this that I&#x27;m compelled to write a review.  I have also purchased an additional bottle of the argon oil because I love this hair product too; it really does make your hair softer!  I no longer spend the additional money to have my hair dresser blow dry and flat iron my hair because it&#x27;s so easy with this flat iron and I look great doing it myself - this saves me $25 a month!!!  I forgot to mention that I have naturally curly long hair; which makes this pretty impressive.</li>
    <li> The package came faster than expected! The flat iron has worked wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Great product and much better than the old Kambrook one I had. I love it</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick and coarse hair and this iron does the job. The one i use never worked well on her,so very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have never had a Flat Iron before, so there was a learning curve for me.  I have  found this to be a very nice item .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one who spends much time on &amp;#34;doing&amp;#34; my hair.  I have very long straight hair and am a wash and go kinda girl.  When I get a hair cut often my stylist uses the flat iron and I see the amazing results ... so I thought maybe I should give a flat iron a try.  I read so many reviews stating how great this product was and decided to order it from the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The packaging is quite impressive.  I like that it heats up very quickly and the results are instant!  I don&#x27;t use it every day because my hair is already straight ... but when the weather is humid it is the only thing that keeps my hair straight and flattens out the frizzies.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> So far I love it. Good for daily use! Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I had an expensive flat iron that died after several years but didn&#x27;t want to invest that much money again. When I found this flat iron on Amazon I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am more than happy with it. My daughter has curly hair that she wants straight and it gives her great results. We&#x27;ve tried inexpensive flat irons from the store and did not get the results we do with this flat iron. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the flat iron.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good flat iron...I have spent close to $200 for a flat iron and this one works better...highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Unlike any other straightener I have ever used! In love!!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It is very good quality and works great!</li>
    <li> so far I used it twice , n I like it :)</li>
    <li> Second time we have bought one. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this after I dropped my Chi on the tile floor and broke it. Okay, I&#x27;ll admit it, I cheaped out and didn&#x27;t want to spring for the $100 to buy another Chi.  This HSI had such great reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. (had already returned A Revlon flat iron to Target-didn&#x27;t like it)..For the price, and with Amazon&#x27;s 30 day guarantee, I thought what can I lose?....thousands of people can&#x27;t be wrong, right? This iron does what it says it will do.  Heats up very quickly, slides easily through my hair and does a great job.(BTW, I have short hair). I&#x27;ll probably never use the glove or the sleeve, but it&#x27;s a nice little lagniappe. My only gripe is it doesn&#x27;t show the temperature and the controls on the inside of the iron are a little awkward. Of course, if they are on the side, as with other irons, then it is easy to accidentally hit them and shut the iron off or change the temperature when you don&#x27;t want. Overall, I am very pleased with the iron and I LOVE the price. Call me cheap, but happy. Now I can spend the other 60 bucks on something else fun! Oh yeah, the dual voltage is great. Won&#x27;t have to mess with a voltage converter next time we go overseas.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with the quality and value of this product. I needed a second flat iron and this was a perfect choice!</li>
    <li> I am from North India and my hair is dense, curly and thick. This hair straightener works perfectly on my hair, straightening it in one go and I didn&#x27;t even have to use the highest temperature setting. My hair feels soft and silky, taking away my fear of abusing my healthy mane! The effect has lasted for four days now :)</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Flattens and curls my hair!</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron except that I would have liked a light on the iron to show when it is on.  Other than that,  it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Love the size, will be using it to travel. Will update review when i&#x27;ve used it in Italy.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! My CHI broke so I started looking for a new one and saw that this one had a lot of positive reviews. I decided to buy it and I am very glad that I did! This straightener is just as good, if not better than my CHI was. It has never once snagged my hair and leaves my hair super straight and soft. It is also really good for getting that curly/wavy look as well. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I had never used a flat iron before and I didn&#x27;t want to send a lot of money on one.  I read many reviews and decided on the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  So far it seems to work fine.  I&#x27;m afraid of damaging my hair so I try and use it infrequently.  It heats up quickly and straightens the areas I use it on.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job and is a good price.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it&#x27;s durable but it did come with argan oil which was a nice bonus and  I do like the glove they provide with it as it&#x27;s longer (so covers my wrist) than most gloves you get with heating tools.  It&#x27;s pretty standard, I do find it a little bit harder to use for curling hair than straightening (I used to use &amp;#34;Hai&amp;#34; straightener for curling my hair which I loved but they broke every year).  I think for straigtening hair this is a good tool.  Maybe not so much for curling.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast, straightens hair on first run through... Not like my old one which took multiple attempts... Doesnt snag or pull hair... Absolutely everything a straightener should be!! Love love love!</li>
    <li> Heats up within seconds and works great!</li>
    <li> Hair iron heats up fast and works well.  It came with a nice carrying case, argon oil, and a glove.</li>
    <li> Works fine but could get a little hotter&lt;br /&gt;Came with one glove which is very useful</li>
    <li> A very nice flat iron; it is a good size to fit in your hand.  It has a very nice travel bag included with the flat iron.  It also comes with a glove to use; which I have not used because the iron does not get hot where it is held. It straightens my hair with no burn or frizzing of my hair.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved it took to a wedding with her and they liked her hair so much she wound up having to use it to do 11 girls hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron performs just as I had hoped.  I have just started straightening my very thick and wavy hair for the first time.  After using my daughter&#x27;s professional flat iron, which  she paid three times as much for, I was a little concerned that this would not give the same results.  It turned out to be just what I needed and performs as well as the more expensive one I had tried.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I had been searching online and was considering a chi. Being on a budget, I found this one. I am so glad I did. We live in the south and humidity is not my friend.</li>
    <li> Returned it. Bought it after reading the awesome reviews but I figured that there are better products available out there.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time getting this iron to work at first because I made the mistake of following the directions and pressing the reset button. I took me quite a while to get it to turn on. Once I was finally able to turn it on, I used it at a relatively high setting and it made my long, curly and sometimes very frizzy hair very straight in about 10 or 15 minutes. The down side is that my hair was smoking. I&#x27;m still playing with the heat settings to figure out the lowest setting I can use and still have straight hair. This flat iron is a good product and gets the job done for me at higher settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to change a few things about the design although I know others would disagree with me. My biggest complaint is that this iron and many like it don&#x27;t have any numbers, only a half circle that gets thicker to indicate higher temperatures. This may be to make it more versatile for other countries but I don&#x27;t like having to guess at the temperature. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the on/off switch is in between the two jaws. I find it a hazard and have to be very careful turning it on and off. The cord is also way too long for me but others might find it handy. The cord comes with Velcro attached to keep it tied when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a super large black glove that I thought was supposed to be worn to protect my hand, but the fingers are so long that I think it would be a hazard to use. It&#x27;s also 90 degrees out right now, so I&#x27;ll pass on the thick black glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My three star rating is partially because of the design and partially because I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. If it were designed more to my liking, I&#x27;d probably give it four or five stars.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this iron. Barely have to use any product to straighten my hair. Whats better, if i pull my hair up into a ponytail when i take it down there is no crease from the ponytail. Just smooth hair.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product that would straighten my hair, keep it straightened, and still leave it in good condition. I have very thick, coarse hair and nothing has worked. I thought I might as well give the HSI a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My hair straightens quickly, stays straight, and feels so soft! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for my daughter. Heats quickly and hair looks smooth and healthy. Great quality.  Love the mitt also.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product as a replacement to my CHI which died after 5 solid years of use.  I was happy with the look and feel of the HSI.  It straightened nicely, but was not as good with controlling frizz as my CHI had been.  I bought this product in March 2013 and it dropped on the floor yesterday and one of the ceramic plates shattered.  My CHI was dropped many times and never broke with the exception of maybe a corner plastic piece, but not the actual ceramic plate itself.  This just tells me you get what you pay for.  Spend the extra money and get the CHI!!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener 1 year ago. It was great when the adjustable temperature worked. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair. But now the light never turns green to say that it is ready and it seems to get as hot as possible, regardless of the temp setting. Fried my ends a bit as a result. No auto off either, which I find is a must have on anything that gets this hot. Replacing it with something different.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this straightner. It got really hot really fast. The ceramic plates left my hair looking healthly and shiny. My hair looks and feels like I just went to the salon. Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Bought a flat iron August 12, 2014...within a few days, the flat iron wasn&#x27;t functioning properly.  The company did provide good customer service and sent a replacement right away.  However, it hasn&#x27;t been quite a year - just about 11 months, and this flat iron is malfunctioning.  I did enjoy the flat iron while it lasted, but I&#x27;ve never had one that died so quickly.  I would love to buy another one if I knew that the lifetime of it would be longer than 11 months.</li>
    <li> My HSI Professional Ceramic flat Iron came new as promised and packaged perfectly. I was exceptionally surprised and happy at the quality of the carrier bag that came with it. And as stated I also received a free trial size of Argan Oil which was great when using to style my hair.</li>
    <li> I have struggled my whole life with limp, half curly, half straight, frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of conditioners and products, but nothing has ever really worked and I&#x27;ve always hated my hair.  I decided to try HSI Argan Oil since the reviews were so good.  I got that first before the flat iron and it made my hair really nice and smooth without being greasy.  Then I decided to buy the HSI flat iron since it was on sale and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The difference in my hair is amazing and the best part is that it will stay straight and shiny all day (except when it&#x27;s raining, but nothing works miracles).  Even on rainy days though, I can actually go out without a pony tail.  Now I can save a ton of money on all the ineffective products I was buying and just use the oil with the iron.  The oil lasts a long time too which is great.  I put a little on before I blow dry and a little more on before I straighten it and the results are amazing.  I highly recommend the oil and the flat iron to anyone.  It&#x27;s the first thing that has ever worked for me.</li>
    <li> Quality straightener that won&#x27;t damage your hair. This product was a wonderful surprise. It heats up quickly. I only wish the plates were a little smoother. But still a very solid product.</li>
    <li> I must say that I had doubts about this flat iron although I seen so many good responses, I just never seem to get good results with irons.I just received my package today and I am definitely impressed with my purchase well worth the money! I&#x27;m an African american woman and this gets my hair super straight and shiny! I think I&#x27;m in love :)</li>
    <li> HSI - works for me.  I love the way my hair shines after just one pass.  The light turns green to indicate when it is ready making it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like the HSI Flat Iron. I&#x27;ve used a Chi for a couple of years now and loved it but it was wearing out.  I was skeptical if the HSI would even compare to the Chi.  But I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a good flat iron online for a reasonable price and I stumbled unto this HSI flat iron. It had plenty of good reviews so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I have to say that I&#x27;m very impressed with it&#x27;s performance. I have thick, wavy and frizzy hair, and it did a good job at taming it down and giving it a smooth, straight and shiny finish. It was really easy to create curls with this flat iron too, I wear my hair with curls now because of that, it doesn&#x27;t take long to curl my hair either unlike my con air curling iron. Other things I like are the adjustable heat settings and the swivel cord attached to it, you can adjust the heat according to your hair type so it&#x27;s not so damaging to your hair and the swivel cord makes it easier to style your hair. I did find this flat iron a little heavy though but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I didn&#x27;t feel like it damaged my hair or anything, I use heat protectant before using the iron. I love this flat iron and would definitely recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> Light weight and easy to use. I appreciate the heat glove that came with it and I use it often. It&#x27;s so much easier than burning my fingers. The edge makes it easy to flip the hair out for a different look than just pin straight.</li>
    <li> The HSI straightner works great on my thick curly hair. My only concern is that sometimes when I plug it in, I have to push the reset button on the power source a few times for it to turn on. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue with the outlet. Overall, this is a minor issue, and the straightner works great. A great value!</li>
    <li> I love this flatiron and the glove that came with it. I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my hand when I&#x27;m doing my hair. The flatiron works great, and leaves my hair feeling soft and looking shiny especially withe the help of the Argan oil. I literally cannot stop touching my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works very well, heats up quickly, stores easily, most importantly leaves hair looking smooth and silky.I am a very satisfied customer.I also really liked the argain oil !</li>
    <li> I have opinionated hair...it curls sometimes, will lie down sometimes, but smooth and straight is not usually an option.  This iron and the oil really made a difference.  Hope it works as well for you.</li>
    <li> great product and service.  Shipped in less time then stated!!Great transaction.  Would gladly purchase from them again.  The product worked better than the last iron I had and the variable temperature setting is great.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is worth every penny spent on it. After years of using cheap flat irons on my thick, curly hair, I finally decided it was time to invest in one. The price was right for this particular one and after hearing good things about the brand, I went for it. It&#x27;s awesome. My time spent on my hair went from forty-five frustrating minutes to fifteen-twenty minutes that were not frustrating at all. It heats up quickly, the outside plastic does not get too hot (and burn my fingers), and it leaves my hair silky and smooth! It also doesn&#x27;t leave that awful burnt hair smell that would happen with my other flat irons. I am super pleased with this product and will be recommending it to everyone!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener literally saves my girlfriend 25-45 minutes every morning. She&#x27;s been praising me on my purchase, so I must praise the sellers on their product. Thank you, a million times, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of having to go over the same spot 10+ times, she can straighten or curl ONCE, and be finished with that area. Amazing results. Please buy this for your girlfriend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(11/29/12)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dogs knocked it over and broke a piece off of the iron. Still worked, but obviously repurchased again for saftey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIRLFRIEND STILL THANKS ME after all this time. Gotta love it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron--works well and was reasonably priced. I put off buying one thinking I had to spend a lot to get a great flat iron--should have bought this one a while ago:-)</li>
    <li> Greatt iron for greatt price !!!!  Came quickly and leaves my hair shinny and silky !! I can even create curls with the floating plates !! I was one to never trust online shoping much butt this product made me view diffrent :) lovee ittt</li>
    <li> It was beyond swell! I cannot believe the incredible quality. All my friends are jealous and are begging me to let them use it.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality professional flat iron. I love the floating plates, adjustable temperature setting, and size. I can straighten, flip, or curl my hair with this, eliminating the need for multiple styling tools. The price is just icing on the cake. What a bargain!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my teenager and she Highly recommends it. She owned other lower end brands and was not happy until now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because she had been wanting a new flat iron. Now that she has tried it, here are her thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does great for her flip.&lt;br /&gt;Good heat control, enough heat for her needs.&lt;br /&gt;Cord control seems to work well&lt;br /&gt;Has a good weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;The heat plates don&#x27;t close flat without additional pressure compared to her old one. This will take a small adjustment time, so not a huge issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.  She likes it, I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this flat iron after reading all the good reviews.  I have owned 2 (amazon) chi flat irons and while pleased with them, they die too quickly.  I just used the HSI, and yes it does straighten my hair, but the dragging feel (and sound) as I pull it through makes me feel I&#x27;m damaging my hair. Even when I use a very light touch (squeeze) it just doesn&#x27;t glide through.  Sending this one back.</li>
    <li> I needed a flat iron to replace my Chi. I accidentally ordered this one and it was a blessing. I LOVE this iron. I have exceptionally thick, wavy hair and this iron works really well. I don&#x27;t miss my Chi at all!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Well worth the price. Heats up quick and gets very hot. Threw out all my other flat irons and replaced it with this one. Excellent customer service.  Received item earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Dont be fooled with the high ratings, this straightner sucks, wasnt impressed. I have thick hair and it didnt heat up enough.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is okay. I wish I would have just shelled out the extra $30.00 and went for the &amp;#34;Croc&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, and still find myself using the hottest setting. That being said, its very hot!! I like that you can adjust it anyway. I&#x27;m not sure if someone had extremely thick hair, if it&#x27;d be good enough. Ultimately I think great, not $100 like you can spend in the store.</li>
    <li> This Flat Iron is the best one I have ever had.  I have wavy/curly hair which frizzes easily.  This iron worked so well, it took me half the time and it was a joy to use.  My hair looked almost as good as when my hairdresser does it and it lasted!  I am so happy with this product.  This iron makes my last one seem like a toy.  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace it but I thought it was just me.  If you think you want a new Flat Iron...do not hesitate to purchase this one.</li>
    <li> I bought the flat iron for my daughter.  She uses it on a daily basis.  I like that it heats up fast and stays hot for enough time to straighten her past the shoulder hair.  It also came with a holder!  If you saw the top of her dresser from the previous flat iron, you would understand the importance of that to me!  My only regret with this product is that I only bought one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a girl that has to be all perfect looking, and I have curly hair that is a little chaotic. I DO like to pick my moments when I want to look polished though.&lt;br /&gt;I have a curling iron, a rotating curling iron/brush thingy, and a \\&quot;wet to dry\\&quot; flat iron (that&#x27;s not really flat). I have recently been trying to get my hair straight, but it&#x27;s a no go. All my heat tools were crap. I&#x27;m seriously going to take them to goodwill now that I have this great little flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;It heats evenly, it makes my hair perfectly straight, and my hair does not get pulled on- this tool glides so smoothly. I finally have something that feels as good as my hairdresser&#x27;s flat iron. Love this, and I hope it lasts forever. Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the oil that comes with it yet, though it smells nice- I didn&#x27;t want to have my first impression of this thing skewed by some new product. I used the same leave in conditioner I always do, and I got amazingly straight, shiny, healthy looking hair.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for two things: it often gets caught in my hair and pulls it out (ouch!), and it doesn&#x27;t easily sit up like it shows in the picture. This wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much if the top weren&#x27;t where the faint green &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; light was - I often forget that it&#x27;s on before I leave for work because it&#x27;s on its side and the green light is so faint. Otherwise very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I had many differents flat iron for the last 10 years and this one is the best, very happy that i found it!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought a Flat and I am so glad I purchased this HSI product.  It is so easy to use and the results on my hair are amazing. The free sample of Argan Oil that came with it left my hair smooth and silky...a must have.</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron it works wonderful on my hair. Disappointed I didn&#x27;t receive the travel size Argan oil that was supposed to be included.</li>
    <li> The HSI is a great hair straightener for the price.  Heats up very quickly, does not burn hair.  I straighten my hair very often, and for that reason, I&#x27;d pay a little more and get a CHI, as the Chi moves through the hair a bit more smoothly (which I&#x27;d rank a solid 5).  I  find the HSI \\&quot;catches\\&quot; more than the CHI does, though not to a big extent. All in all, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the performance of this flat iron. I was able to get very close to my roots. My course hair smooth out with one pass on the medium temperature. The price was phenomenal!</li>
    <li> Straighten works great and just as good as more expensive ones.  It heats up quickly and comes with bag to put in when traveling.</li>
    <li> There is a short in the light and it will not always turn green when ready. I loved that it came with a heat resistant cloth bag so I don&#x27;t have to worry about anyone burning themselves if they don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, very fast shipping and the glove comes in very handy. I will probably buy one more for our guest bath.</li>
    <li> Loved that this straightener came with the glove and oil and pouch.  Feels very sturdy and does not pull hair.  I have very curly hair and this has done a great job.  I do feel like I need to go over it at times but I believe it is just the texture of my hair.  Only negative is I paid for 2 day free shipping.  I paid for it on a Thursday and did not receive until the next Wednesday.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd HSI Flat Iron I have bought for my Daughter!  She dropped and cracked the plate on her first one, had it almost 2 years was still working great!!  So when I went to buy a replacement I was soo happy to find another HSI Iron.  SHe has curly hair and hates it so I was buying a new iron every year till we bought her first HSI.  Only brand I will buy for her now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a CHI for five years and wanted to try a different flat iron. Well this one is PERFECT. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can straighten my hair in just 20 minutes with this awesome straightener! Do it! Buy it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Before I give my amazing review on this iron, I just wanted to say that I am a lady who tried EVERY flat iron from different companies, big or small. None of them gave the result I wanted since I tried this hsi professional flat iron. I have thick, course, medium length hair and this iron works wonders! I spent about atleast $500 on my other straightners and this flat iron is the only one who can give justice in my hair. I always get compliments every time I go out and some even said my hair looks healthier! Even when I&#x27;m in a rush, this iron still gets to straighten my hair flat as if its my natural hair! The price is a steal! This iron is seriously the best flat iron on the market today. I will definitely continue to do business with hsi!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this flat iron. I think I&#x27;m going to return it. The two sides of the iron don&#x27;t come together evenly. One end closes tight together and the other end doesn&#x27;t even touch. The result is that part of my hair gets pulled and other parts don&#x27;t even get ironed. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair is not curly anymore, but it needed something to tame the tendency to stick out when I wanted it under.  I knew my daughters used a product similar to this one.  After reading reviews, I figured I would try it.  It is great!  I love that I can control the amount of heat as my blonde hair is rather fragile.  The price was right, too!</li>
    <li> This is much better than my old flat iron.  It gets hot faster, and stays hotter.  Works well on my thick hair.  Takes me less time to get ready in the morning.  The storage bag it comes with is functional, but the design/style could use some work.  Reasonable price.  Looks like it was meant for some &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; items instead of a flat iron.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and thin and damaged from years of abuse, so the fact that this product isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;miracle-worker\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a GREAT price, and it does come with a nice silk case, as well as a trial of leave in oil (which I have yet to try). It heats up quickly,and glides through hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give you that silky shine, but it definitely straightens and gets rid of a lot of the flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had an automatic shut-off, but it does have a temp control knob, and that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price, it&#x27;s a nice product if you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix for a straightener, but it&#x27;s not the one I&#x27;d buy if I were looking for an investment flat iron.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great straightner and it heats up pretty quick and gets the job done! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the light to tell you its ready is on the opposite side of the straightner and it pulls on my hair just a little sometimes when I do little strands! It&#x27;s does straighten very well for the price! WAY better than a chi. I have thick curly hair and I really only have to do one swipe and its straight! I love it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I bought the HSI to replace a Sedu Revolution straightener I had for about two years. My Sedu now loses heat easily and doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as it used to. I&#x27;ve used the HSI a couple times now and I think my old Sedu works about as well. I don&#x27;t believe the HSI could have originally cost $200. That would be a rip off. I&#x27;ve had a brazilian blowout that is fading out, which means my hair is straight but with some waves. It still took me 20-25 minutes to straighten my hair with the HSI, and my hair isn&#x27;t even stick straight. I would compare this HSI to something you would buy at Walmart. I&#x27;ve learned this lesson too many times...You get what you pay for!! The best I&#x27;ve ever used would be the Chi, then Sedu. I will be returning the HSI.</li>
    <li> I have used this flat iron twice and I liked the way it styled my hair. Very easy to use. It heats up quick and I am able to flatten my hair in less than 10 mins. It did not damage my hair unlike other heat products. Could have been perfect if it had a lock and digital display of temperature. I gave 4 becoz I did receive Argan oil of small one use sachet just :( otherwise it great buy!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this flat iron.  Bought one for my daughter and now this is our second one - for me!</li>
    <li> The flat iron works great.  Great value considering the price.  Loved the Argan oil sample and ordered more.  Only downside is that the flat iron doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off so you need to be diligent about turning off.</li>
    <li> This product is working well on my girl&#x27;s hair. She has typically Asian hair, thick and hard. With a little practice, I made beautiful curls on her. My hair is too short so I just use this iron to straighten it. It looks smooth and shiny if I use the right oil. The reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is there is some glue on the ceramic plate that I can&#x27;t remove. It&#x27;s only a cosmetic defect.</li>
    <li> This product straightens hair well, and curls it too!  And it works just as well in either 110/220 V.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the volume, I like it to look a bit more natural, less matted down.  And it doesn&#x27;t at all burn my hair, even at the highest heat setting at 220V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it feels very cheaply made, which isn&#x27;t a problem except that it takes a lot of effort to hold it and squeeze it properly so that it doesn&#x27;t catch or pull your hair.  I really think there are products out there that have the same results as this without this drawback, but I don&#x27;t know enough about straighteners to find a better product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  The iron is well made, handles beautifully, and delivers a consistent style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also very impressed with the prompt service and outstanding price of the iron.  This is an excellent bargain.</li>
    <li> if you want this iron to be around for a long time without you having to buy a new one, i would find  a good iron elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Flat iron works great, fast results. Leaves hair smooth and silky. The flat iron performs like a professional iron. Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> A flat iron was always a wished for tool, and I finally decided, while shopping on Amazon. I&#x27;d been looking at different types, models, ...not sure what to choose. This item, I purchased along with an edge|root straightener. It came with the pouch, a heat-resistant glove, which I use on the hand holding the hair(!), and a one-use sample packet of argan oil leave-in treatment which I liked. Claims to also include a case. I assume the case is the box it&#x27;s packaged in - it IS sturdy!! and bright red!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was originally a concern about the location of the controls, but they are far enough away from the hot plates to allay any fear. Iron heats up and cools down very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding this flat iron very useful and easier to use than I anticipated. My hair feels sooooo soft. Because I&#x27;m new at this, I&#x27;m using a low setting, AND I&#x27;m taking my time. As I gain more experience, I know the time needed to complete the task will decrease after a while. I&#x27;ll soon be a pro ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good, compact flat iron that works well, and travels well, I recommend this one. I&#x27;m loving it !!</li>
    <li> I have only had the HSI for a few weeks but I am very pleased with it so far.  I find the heat glove isn&#x27;t necessary, and it curls my hair much easier than my 8 year old Paul Mitchell straightener.  The carrying case is a nice plus too.</li>
    <li> It was just as I expected!! Good price and very good quality!! Very satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and amazing customer service.&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering buying it...order it,you won&#x27;t go wrong.Its worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Good quality!</li>
    <li> High quality flat iron. Have purchased in the past and we are never disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I have curly frizzy long hair which usually takes 45 min to an hour to straighten. This cut that in half! The seller is also great. I had my package within 48 hours.</li>
    <li> It is amazing for the price! Reminds me of One Pass which was over $100. I like it better than the Chi. Cannot believe the price on this! Bought it due to the rave reviews and have not been disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like Chi would sometimes do.</li>
    <li> Awesome Straightener for the price, I love the 1&amp;#34; so perfect for curling my hair too! I&#x27;m able to do Super cute hairstyles with it &amp; make my hair look Amazing, can&#x27;t imagine how I lived without one before.</li>
    <li> One of the best straightners I have ever used..</li>
    <li> This is the second HSI Professional 1 flat Iron I have purchased, for a family member, and am extremely impressed with the quality.  One of the main reasons I purchased this particular model is because of the 220v feature and it worked flawless on a recent trip to Europe.  The temperature adjustment also works really well. The storage pouch it came with is also convenient. I have and would recommend this flat iron to others.</li>
    <li> works like it should.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! I love the texture it gives me after doing my hair. The only thing I would change would be for a light to indicate whether it is on or not. :)</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace my CHI, but didn&#x27;t want to spend another $100+.  I tried this after reading all the great reviews.  I don&#x27;t have experience with a bunch of flat irons, but this one is certainly as good as my old CHI, for less than half the price!  It&#x27;s solid construction and heats up to where it needs to be.  I have medium length, fine hair with a wave/frizz that I like to tame.  This iron did the trick, with only one or two passes thru my hair.  No burning or frying my hair.  I would highly recommend this product, as it rivals models that are much more costly.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!! It gets hot really fast and works well. I also live the curls and can get with this straightener, it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
    <li> At first I needed to turn the heat higher because my hair is thicker. But as I try out the different settings I&#x27;m liking it more and more.</li>
    <li> I bought this and a Chi brand straightener. This one lasted much longer, plus it came with a few essentials. It is by far one of my longest lasting straightener&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I researched this straightener prior to purchase. Reviews on it were good. I am disappointed in the results. I find it does not straighten and get the frizz out of my hair like my previous flat iron.  Also the samll &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; sample of argon oil was empty. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> The plate was chipped. Returned to amazon with no problems.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron....  n the free oil that comes with it. Lol...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron! Was very happy to receive a trial size bottle of argan oil too - thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron, daughter loves it</li>
    <li> Great product which comes with a bag and glove for protection.</li>
    <li> Based on all the reviews I expected a greater quality item.  I had a chi, and wasn&#x27;t looking to spend so much money. You get what you pay for.  It took me double the time to do my hair and the finished look still wasnt great.  I have fairly manageable hair,  just had some wave and it couldn&#x27;t seem to get the job done.  Dissapointed!  I will stick the CHI.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> This flat iron does what it said  what it does and I love it</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the longevity of this product! I bought this as a Christmas gift and not 3 months later it is useless. It was not even used every day</li>
    <li> after reading many reviews, I purchased this straightener because I have very thick, frizzy hair and it seemed to be perfect. It wasn&#x27;t! It takes way longer than my other ones and leaves a greasy feeling, and I only used a little of the spray to see if that made a difference...it didn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
    <li> In love with this flat iron ! Even my hair stylist wanted to steal it, the packaging was elegant and detailed i loved every aspect of it. I&#x27;ve had it for the last month and it&#x27;s been nothing short of perfect, it even makes these amazing curls !! I&#x27;m so mad the wand went back to regular price but this flat iron curls and straightens hair flawlessly</li>
    <li> This flat iron truly seals the frizzies leaving hair non-puffy, silky, and straight.  Easy to add a few piecy waves, too.</li>
    <li> Heats up Fast, is easy to use, nice packaging and equally nice travel bag!</li>
    <li> Initially I was diaappointed anticipating I could easily flip a switch to change voltage and used a transformer. But the iron wouldn&#x27;t heat up so I removed the transformer concerned I would fry my Iron. However to my delight the iron heated up right away.</li>
    <li> After being in the beauty business for 35+ years I&#x27;d like to think I know a good product when I see it. I&#x27;d purchased an excellent flat iron for my hair a few years ago and paid about $200 for it. In traveling I somehow lost it and obviously was upset. I read reviews and searched the Internet before ordering another.i was concerned about the lower price and quality of the product. I&#x27;m so happy I ordered two! ( one for my daughter also) it is at the very least, equal to the expensive iron I was accustomed to for years. The size (width) gives me much more control and options in styling. I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about highly recommending this product to anyone as a gift or personal use. It leaves my hair with a beautiful shine and seems to even hold better in the humidity.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is so smooth. It doesn&#x27;t tug or pull my hair. Great value!</li>
    <li> My hair is about 5 inches below my shoulders and curly. This hair straightener worked &amp;#34;like a boss&amp;#34;! It allowed me to style my hair in 1/2 the time of my previous straightener and tamed my mane. I definitely recommend it. Furthermore,  I&#x27;ll be looking into other HSI products!</li>
    <li> Great straightener for the price, heats up quickly and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter who uses it daily and I occasssionaly  We both love it, heats up quickly, very smooth and frizz free hair</li>
    <li> This is an awesome straightener for the price. Does the job perfectly and heats up really quickly. Fast shipping and great customer service. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the argan oil that comes with this flat iron</li>
    <li> This works great for my hair. I have wavy, long hair and it takes only minutes to style with this flat iron. It heats up really quick. I definetly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the iron! I received very quickly and the item was as described.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair, so easy to use. Heat glove helps as well!!!</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! I have thick hair and it didn&#x27;t take much time at all. It heats up quickly. I was skeptical because the price is so amazing.</li>
    <li> Takes a little longer than I would like to straighten thick hair but it is a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have always used a cheap flat iron in the past; this one really is awesome;  such a difference in my hair!</li>
    <li> This is the best straight iron I have ever used! I have naturally thick curly hair and it usually takes forever to get it straight, with this straightner it doesn&#x27;t take long at all! My hair looks awesome when it straight when using this! Works great to curl hair as well! It is nice it comes with a glove because it does get very hot! The sample of hair oil they give you is the best!! Love this straightner and will continue to buy the oil!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with your product.</li>
    <li> Works well and I like the curved sides, but I&#x27;m disappointed it does not have an auti-off feature</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and got this item to straighten my hair. Tried only twice since got it. It&#x27;s working good. Will post more later about how it works after 3 months. Hope it works fine. Till now I m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift off of my amazon wish list. With so many positive reviews I was excited to own am awesome flat iron. Well, it is horrible. The plates are not very long, it doesn&#x27;t open far, and it absolutely does not get up to the temperature it says. I have fine hair that only takes a little heat to curl and I had to turn it up close to the 350 range to get any curl at all. The buttons are in a very awkward position inside of the iron. Lastly, it left little lines in my hair because of the shape of the edge of the plates. Returning :(</li>
    <li> it works good but i wander what a CHI is like. I think ill try that when this one dies. still a pretty good straighter for 15 bucks.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this flat iron but it seemed to pull my hair.  I ended up purchasing another tourmaline flat iron from a local store and it works much better.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of mixed reviews of this product, but in my first week with this straightener, I have to say, it works great.  I have never had a CHI, and i had an old school straightener before.  I don&#x27;t find that this takes a long time to heat up, I think most people have to remember to hit the \\&quot;reset button\\&quot; on the plug.  I find that the heat is great, I don&#x27;t have to make as many runs through my hair for it to straighten (my hair is pretty fine), and the straight stays all day.  The case is nice too.  So I would recommend it, though I didn&#x27;t get an Argain Oil sample.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either for a ceramic tourmaline straightener.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!!! I love it! I purchased it to take it to Paris. The dual voyage is perfect. I&#x27;ve been using it at home also!</li>
    <li> It came earlier than the estimated delivery. The straightener glides smoothly and leaves the hair soft. But it doesn&#x27;t get hot quickly and I feel its not hot enough when I do the straightening. The Remington I used earlier gets super hot very quickly and did a job good and it was only $15. Overall, its a good one but I don&#x27;t think its great.</li>
    <li> Works well for the price. Got each of my girls one for Christmas and they love it. Smooth, shiny finish curls well also.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It heats up really fast and flattens my hair really quickly. I like that it has a temperature control on the iron so I can control the heat and try not to burn the heck out of my hair!</li>
    <li> I used to use a cheap $15 straightener, and once I got this on sale, wow, you can DEFINITELY tell the difference in using two classes of straighteners. My hair, when I used the $15 one, you can see the creases in the hair where i&#x27;ve put the straightener, but with HSI, you can&#x27;t tell at all. It makes my hair style look more prominently sleek and cleaner. I absolutely love this hair straightener to death. It was totally worth it, which I was pretty lucky to have gotten it on sale for $40. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love, this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my last hair straightener suddenly stopped working. In the past I&#x27;ve done a lot of research into which straightener to purchase, but my hair is a frizzy mess if I don&#x27;t straighten it so I needed something ASAP so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep using the tiny travel straightener I have. I had actually first planned on going to my nearest CVS and buying whichever straightener they had, but they were sold out of them so I went to Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have this one I&#x27;m glad I had those problems! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s newer or what but it seems to be working a lot better than the old one, and the extras that come with it are great. There&#x27;s a very nice bag for the straightener, what I assume is a glove to protect your hand from heat, and of course the argan oil. The cord is a good length and it heats very quickly too- I love the indicator light, which is red while it&#x27;s heating up and green when it reaches the temperature you chose. Much better than previous straighteners I have which only had an indicator for whether it was turned on or not, so I had to just guess when it was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this straightener is that it doesn&#x27;t have auto shutoff. The on/off switch is also a tiny bit awkward to reach, but at least you can&#x27;t accidentally turn it off.</li>
    <li> Amazing service and product!! ❤ my straightener!!! Amazing low price for such a high end straightener!! You will definitely not be disappointed with this product!</li>
    <li> I buyed for my wife and she loved, the corners don&#x27;t heat up so she never burn herself like with others she used.</li>
    <li> i order this ionic flat iron because of the ratings but i feel dissapointed when i receive it coz it does not work at all...maybe you should try the product before you shipped it...</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is definitely an upgrade from my $25 straightener from the grocery store.  It works much more quickly and just makes my hair look smoother and sleeker.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s pulling a few hairs.  The way it clamps down, it just targets a few single hairs and then they pull and break, which is painful and also not great for my hair.  Perhaps the plates that I got on mine are just a little off on their alignment, I&#x27;m not sure.  Other than that, this hair straightener is great and definitely worth the $50 sale price.</li>
    <li> I had just gone through my second Chi straightener (which I loved, when it was working!) and I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100+ on another Chi. I read the reviews for this HSI flat iron and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, especially since it was half the price of a Chi. After using for a month, I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair quite as well as the Chi but with some smoothing product, it does the trick. I&#x27;d recommend this straightener for anyone looking for a more affordable alternative to the Chi.</li>
    <li> nice little straightening iron.. shipped quickly, price was affordable with a lot of extras like the glove, pouch and argan oil sample.. does the job, heats quickly and really straightens.. i have long, thick, wavy/curly hair that is frizzy/coarse but was able to straighten it in 25 minute versus the usual 1 hour using my old flat iron.. happy with the results..</li>
    <li> I bought this because my CHI flat iron straightener no longer heats up. Was planning to buy another CHI when I saw that this product was highly recommended by a lot of users so I decided to try it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- dual voltage (110AC; 220AC) so you can bring it to other countries that have 220AC&lt;br /&gt;- temperature control; you can adjust the level of heat/temperature depending on the hair texture&lt;br /&gt;- reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- the handle gets warm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it is definitely worth your money. Will consider buying another one as a spare. When my CHI broke, I had 4 consecutive terrible hair days until this product was delivered.</li>
    <li> I have had a Chi before and I definitely prefer this flat iron.  Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and I use it everyday.  It is perfect for the super straight looks or flipping the ends.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> After owning several flat irons in the past, I can say this one is the best I have tried for the price.  It did an excellent job of straightening with no frizz.</li>
    <li> It came on time. It works perfect. We have used only once, no problem yet. If there is I will later update my review. If not updated, then that means I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI flat iron after my 4 year old used my CHI to do her barbie&#x27;s hair and ruined it. I have had the HSI flat iron for almost a month now and have found that it works just as well as my old CHI. It heats quickly and straightens my hair with just one run through. It included a protective glove for your hand, but I have not had to use it. I have not noticed the temperature on the external parts of the flat iron becoming to hot to handle. I was also able to purchase it at a great price, which was an added bonus. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever purchased. I was prepared to spend upwards of $100 on a Chi or Babyliss flat iron.  But when I read the positive reviews on this cheaper model, I decided to give it a try.  The positive reviews are RIGHT ON!!  This is a fabulous buy.  Doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pull\\&quot; my hair and leaves it straight and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great straightener, better than the high priced ones and less than half the price. I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s super frizzy, and this does the job quick. Love it!</li>
    <li> The iron won&#x27;t come on and heat up after only two weeks! The fuse reset on the plug does not pop like it should, meaning something is wrong in the plug. Such a shame because my wife loved it sooooo much. I am in the process of receiving a refund and will probably buy it again just to give it one more chance. I really hope the second one works. Other than not working, everything else was fine for the first 2 weeks. My wife said she can straighten her hair in half the time it would take using her CHI or PAUL MITCHELL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with everything :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener to replace another model made by another manufacturer.  Prior to selecting this product I did some research since I wanted to order a reasonably priced, quality product that was also half-way decent to my hair.  I try to minimize how much heat or products I use on my hair to avoid damage, but unless going au natural it is difficult to completely avoid tools/products.  Since my hair is fine I wanted a product with a temperature control and one with ceramic tourmaline plates.  This straightener was perfect in meeting my needs.  I have a friend who does hair and she stated some of the more popular, high-priced items (Chi) are not all they are cracked up to be so I don&#x27;t solely rely on brands.  I am very satisfied with the product and will recommend it to others.  Besides a glove and the sample of Argain Oil, this product comes with a nicely-made, lined straightener bag in a rich shade of red.  Very classy.</li>
    <li> Works great. Heats up fast. Love the red carrying case. And my hair responds well to the Argain oil. You just use a little bit but it makes a big difference in your hair feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price! I have thick, wavy hair and this flat iron makes my hair super sleek and straight.</li>
    <li> The recipient was very happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> It came in earlier then the date so i was excited about that..i love this hair straightener i always wanted a chii but this works just as good at a wayyy b9etter price thanks!</li>
    <li> I  am very pleased with the hair straightener and it&#x27;s ease of use.  It heats up quickly and makes it quick and easy to style my hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried the oil yet, so can&#x27;t comment on that yet.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Glides great on hair, heats up fast and it makes your hair feel very silky :) very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron.  Very good quality.  After i use it my hair looks so soft.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> ***UPDATED*** ***When I first got this flat iron I was so happy. But now, they don&#x27;t get hot anymore. They literally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; just after having them for several months. I don&#x27;t even use them everyday so this product has become a disappointment. I hope there is a warranty so I can send them back. I will update my review if I am able to exchanged.  My review went from 5stars to 3   So happy with this purchase. I researched for weeks on a new flat iron and was going to get a CHI. But after reading tons of reviews all over the internet I settled with this HSI and GLAD I DID. The price and quality are amazing. Leaves my hair ( weave and natural) shiny, bone straight and gives great curls. I love the travel bag and glove that it came with as well.  This is a great flat iron and worth every penny! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Wow I ordered these yesterday and used my PRIME 2 day shipping, but surprise these arrived the next day. Very fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box and found more surprises, it came with a glove, oil and a case to keep the flat irons in. I was definitely not expecting that! For the price I was thinking too good to be true this must don&#x27;t work good at all...... SURPRISE AGAIN these flat iron straighten my hair 100% better than my CHI&#x27;s not to mention my CHI&#x27;s broke after only being used lightly for 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE these, they are awesome! Plus you can set your temperature which is a +!  These are definitely a must have take my word for it ! I don&#x27;t usually review Amazon products but this one was full of surprises !</li>
    <li> I had a Chi for about 5 years that died on me a couple of weeks ago (it worked great in the time I had it).  I researched and then purchased this item on Amazon after reading all the great reviews (and the bad reviews seemed to be more about defective straighteners and not so much about this being a bad product when it was functional).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this straightener twice - and am very happy with the results.  It came with a satin storage sleeve and a glove which I have used both times as it makes straightening easier and quicker (I&#x27;m not the most graceful when it comes to using a hot iron so it is a good preventative measure I never thought about until I pulled it out of the box).  I did use a tiny bit of the oil, but not enough to form an opinion (it smells great - I just worry it will make my hair too oily as some leave in conditioners/oils do).  My previous staightener was 1.5 inches, but I definitely prefer the 1 inch plates as it makes it easier to curl the ends if I want (with the 1.5 inch it was awkward and fried the ends if I tried to do this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most certainly re-post if my straightener unexpectantly craps out, but so far I have had a very positive experience and consider this an exceptional value.  It definitely works as good as my Chi did, but keep in mind my Chi was 5 years old and one of the basic models when I bought it back then.  The selling company sent it on time and shipping was free.  I am very pleased :)</li>
    <li> I loved the way this straightener worked on my fine, thin blonde hair.  It heated quickly, had multiple settings and curved plate edges.  But after only nine months of not even daily use, the cord came out of the end of the straightener.  I am very good about folding my cords up after each use (not winding them around the straighteners or irons).  There was no abuse or misuse!  The cord just popped out one morning.  Very disappointed.  Other than that, it was a fabulous product!</li>
    <li> When I recieved this hair straightner I was really excited. It came and was exactly how described by the seller. I used it two times and it worked great! However, on my third use I was using the straightner and it was not working as it had the previous two times. Turns out one side of the hot plates was not working at all. Do not buy, it is a waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> My CHI broke a few months ago and I bought a cheap straightener to replace it until I got another CHI. After awhile my hair was dull and very dry. I realized it must of been the straightener I was using. I searched Amazon and found this straightener. After the first use my hair was noticeably more shiny and healthy looking and feeling. Glad I got this product!</li>
    <li> This flat iron has a great look and feel.  It comes in a nice satin bag and also included a free little bottle of oil leave in hair treatment which is a must have when flat ironing hair.  It heats up quickly and straightens my hair nicely and doesn&#x27;t catch or pull my hair.  The size is perfect allowing me to have good control.  It was a great deal/great price, too...I received it just days after ordering it which was wonderful!  I recommend buying it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Easy to use. Saves time gives better results in Less passes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better that other products twice the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No : PULLING, tugging on hair leaves hair feeling silkly smooth&lt;br /&gt;Great investment&lt;br /&gt;And the seller was amazing&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product and seller</li>
    <li> I did not like the product. It is heavy to hold and did not serve its purpose. It might be possible that I am the unlucky one to have receive one of the broken products .</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this flat iron. It is easy to work with and I love the little bag that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Works great on my thick hair!</li>
    <li> mother says that she loves it and that she will be using it very often its a very nice thing for its price</li>
    <li> I needed a flat iron to take on a trip with me.  I already have a Chi but since it is not only mine I had to buy one, and almost bought another one until I read the reviews for this one on Amazon.  I had never heard of this brand but decided if I didn&#x27;t like it I would return it.  You girls were NOT wrong!! It leaves my hair straight the whole day and it leaves it better than the Chi.  I am done in less than 5 minutes doing my hair, plus it heats up super fast.  If you are thinking between this and the Chi, save yourself a few bucks and go with this one.  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived really quickly as always, with no issues. The flat iron works great! Best one I have owned by far.</li>
    <li> After placing an order for a HSI, I COULD NOT wait to open it and try it out! My last hair straightener broke down on me, and I was desperate to get a new one. Unfortunately, when my hair air dries it isn&#x27;t a pretty sight..in fact most wouldn&#x27;t argue with the fact that it is often just plain scary...Months spent reading reviews finally paid off, after using this tool for the first time it was quick, and quite painless. One stoke to unkink, a second to soften. Lookin good is only a matter of minutes now!</li>
    <li> Sturdy design and functions better than many other products of this type that cost far more.  Bought this product because the reviews were high, and those reviews were right, this product is the best bang for the buck.  This HSI product feel well built and the buttons are of good size to use.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, but with this flat iron you would never know! With my old iron I would have to go over the sections of hair multiple times in order to achieve what this does with one time! The only negative I have with the product is that it does not have an auto shut-off function. The sample bottle of Argain Oil works well too!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I had a chi..and i would say this works better! My hair is so straight now that i hhave been using it! Wont regret purchasing this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Works Great!  I received this for Christmas and was so disappointed when it didn&#x27;t&#x27; turn on... However once i received a working one I was extremely happy with the quality!  I have curly dry hair and it made my hair look wonderful.  I love the  Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment - I plan to buy a non travel size :)</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner for my daughter. Her old one pulled her hair each time she used it, breaking it off. This one is doing a great job.</li>
    <li> I have been looking around at stores to buy one and when I saw all the reviews on this one... I felt safe to purchase it.  Glad I did and I see why there are so many positive reviews.  It really is nice and a great price too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she LOVES it.  She says it is the best iron she has ever owned.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have VERY thick long curly coarse hair it usually takes about 45 mins to straighten it with this it take less than 30. It heats up really fast, the cord is long (almost as long as the couch) usually I have to use an extension cord but not with this one, it does not pull my hair!! I have had many straightens over the last 15 years and this is the best one by far!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I like that it has the feature of choosing your own temperature which is safer for your hair.</li>
    <li> Works well for the money.</li>
    <li> If you have very thick, coarse, long hair like mine you&#x27;re going to love this.  My old straightener probably cost me $25 and took me about 30 mins to REALLY straighten my wavy hair. This straightener took far less time and actually made it sleek-feeling. I didn&#x27;t even need to run the straightener repeatedly over the same section!&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried any of the more costly straighteners like CHI, but since this had so many good reviews and was in the budget I went with it. So glad I did!!</li>
    <li> I was nervous buying a flat iron let alone one I have never heard of. I have to say this set far exceeded my expectations! I have super thick hair and once I am done using the flat iron my hair is so sleek and perfectly straight! I like the on/off switch and the fact you can change the heat setting with the dial. Again my hair is thick and the medium setting works very well and gets the job done. When using a flat iron you always want to use the lowest setting possible so as not to damage your hair. The flat iron is sturdy and solid yet easy to hold. Well built. You can tell it is of high quality. I bought this flat iron at a great price but honeslty if is worth full price. I love the cloth/sateen case. It is great for traveling. The glove is a nice bonus too. Make sure to use a heat styler and protectant on your hair first. Love love this iron and highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener not only looks professional, it works like a professional hair straightener! I only have to go over my hair once or twice and it is pin STRAIGHT!! This straightener is lightweight, easy to use, and it performs astoundingly. For this price, this product is unbelievable!!! A hair straightener this good would sell for hundreds in the store, so thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I have owned several flat irons in the past.  Most have been mediocre.  This straightener is different.  To say my hair has a nature curl would be kind.  It&#x27;s frizz.  We lived in Arizona and it was manageable with lesser irons because of the lack of humidity.  Then we moved to Connecticut and I soon realized I would need to invest in a better product, if I wanted to look my best.  After reading several reviews I decided to purchase the HSI 1\\&quot; Flat Iron Hair Straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box it feels good in your hand.  Not too heavy and can be easily manipulated in ones hand.  My husband and I chuckled a little at the included glove (which I had never had with any other straightener).  After using it for just a moment I realized why there was a glove.  The element produces so much heat I needed the glove.  As I said I hadn&#x27;t had or needed a glove with any other flat iron before.  The iron has worked flawlessly and straightens difficult to manage hair in New England humidity without difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;Them my 4 year old decided to take the iron out of mommies drawer and give it a bath in the sink.  Oops.  My husband said \\&quot;buy another, it worked better than any other that you have owned.\\&quot;  We let it dry out for a couple of days, and I hoped for the best as I plugged it in.  No Problem.  I am not saying that every straightener by HSI will withstand total submersion in water, but mine did.  Thus far I feel I have definitely received my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to using a flat iron, so I was looking for a product that would work well but did not break the bank. I am so happy I bought this.  It is super easy to use, it works great and it does not damage my hair. It has a temperature control dial that you can adjust.  This product is worth buying.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment]]I recently ordered the HSI Professional flat iron and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and have tried many different irons, including the chi, and would never go back to any of them. Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift to my mom and she loves it. She has thick hair and it works great on her. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I love using it with the Argain Oil, it totally makes my hair shinier and healthier! Although I had a problem with the product, it was solved right after contacting customer service. I would totally recommend it to a friend because it works well and customer voice is valued by the company as well.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Salon quality for a low price. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Horrible flat iron.  It&#x27;s heavy which I could get over if it didn&#x27;t badly snag with every single stroke.  I have a lot of experience with flat irons and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try based on the reviews and great price.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  The one my hairdresser uses (obviously not an HSI) glides through my hair as smooth as silk and leaves it super shiny. I couldn&#x27;t take the snagging and horrible results from the HSI so I purchased the one she uses - there is absolutely no comparison.  I would give the HSI 0 stars if it were an option.</li>
    <li> I initially was going to invest in a Chi flat iron, but heard and saw so many complaints from friends and on the product themselves that they go out or break easily and the customer service is horrible. With that brand being sooo very expensive I decided to go somewhere else even though I always get hit with the \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; thing. So I decided to search on here to find one cause Amazon has never failed me. I found this seller and this brand, the HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. I&#x27;m not big on name brands cause I just flat out don&#x27;t know anything about hair products (and electronics lol) and it was my very first hair straightener and didn&#x27;t really know what I was looking for and everyone I told about this one (friend wise) said don&#x27;t get it cause it&#x27;s generic and probably cheap/will break/won&#x27;t work. It turns out this is the straightener that my actual stylist uses and has been using. She&#x27;s never had a problem with it and loves it. AND she&#x27;s had it for a long time and uses it everyday for her business and she&#x27;s really popular and busy and it has yet to fail her. Well, I got it in record time, cause these sellers are amazing. I immediately started experimenting with it on myself to learn how to use it on my own hair. Well, let me tell you. My hair is notorious for NOT holding any curls or even after styled with the Chi or any straightener. I put this one on several settings and used it over a span of two weeks to see what worked for me. Turns out that I need really, really high heat and this iron had the settings for it. I have never been more happy with my hair!! This iron works very well for me. Anyone who says anything about the controls being inside instead of the outside complains. But I love it. I am a total klutz and will forget to set it to the correct settings or bump it and change the settings or flat off turn it off (this is my experience with curling irons), but with this one, since it&#x27;s inside I was able to be set and permanently set for my special needs. Like I said others I&#x27;d bump and it would change the setting to low (from my friends irons). I&#x27;m still on those settings and it&#x27;s is really portable and STILL doesn&#x27;t change my settings! My stylist actually told me the reason why people haven&#x27;t heard of this brand is because it is used specifically with professionals! I was blown away that she actually approved of something I bought FINALLY!! LOL But I have had it for months now and the oil they include in it is amazing (I recommend in investing in a whole bottle of the oil, it&#x27;s that great!) The oil and the straightener makes my hair so shiny, health looking, full bodied, flippy and moveable without falling, even in Texas humidity. I barely use hairspray cause of this straightener is just that strong. I LOVE IT! I highly recommend it and I think the only way it&#x27;s going to fail is because of age (which will be a long time) or if you drop it or do something to make it not work. Yes, it turns off automatically, but it&#x27;s a nice safety feature, especially for someone like me. I have nothing but great things to say about this about this straightener and could go on and on how amazing it is, but you really have to experience it out to for yourself to understand my enthusiasm about it. I bought one for my cousin, who has a Chi, and she&#x27;s since given away her Chi and even bought a back up one just in case she loses her HSI...cause she&#x27;s goofy like me! If anything ever happens to mine, I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one. And the price is oh so great! &amp;lt;3set for my special needs. Like I said others I&#x27;d bump and it would change the setting to low (from my friends irons). I&#x27;m still on those settings and it&#x27;s is really portable and STILL doesn&#x27;t change my settings!

    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She says is it very good quality and leaves her hair shinny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was very upset when my previous straightening iron fell on the floor and broke.  After using this flat iron I realized it was the best thing that could have happened.  This thing is great!!  It straightens quickly without making my hair feel like it&#x27;s getting damaged.  My hair looks better now than it ever did with my old iron, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this straighter. Heats up fast and works on wet hair. Thin and easy to use. Goes through hair smoothly. I have medium length hair and I finish straightening my hair within 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> My stylist straightened my hair and I just loved the silky feel to my normally thick and curly hair. I ordered the HSI from Amazon after reading the reviews. I love the bag that was included with the flat iron. The fact that you can adjust the temperature is a great feature to have. The only thing I would change on this iron would be putting the on/off switch on the outside of the handle, not the inside. It&#x27;s not a big problem...you just have to be careful when turning off the appliance. My hair didn&#x27;t turn out quite as good as when the stylist did it--but that&#x27;s not the iron&#x27;s fault. I just need to practice. Great price and prompt service. P.S. This is the Mrs. reviewing--Scot&#x27;s hair is already straight. LOL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just bought this product and used it a couple times already. I have thick hair and the HSI flat iron worked beautifully in them. It also straightened the hair very quickly. So far, it was worth buying.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and overall I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: gets hot quickly, heat is adequate, iron is a good weight, price was right&lt;br /&gt;Cons: nothing to do with the iron itself, more to do with the tedious process of straightening my hair! Several people mentioned the floating panels to be problematic. I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case.</li>
    <li> it was good one I like this product</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I need. I have very thick long wavy hair and this gets so hot it cuts my time by 1/3. I didn&#x27;t need the glove it came with but it is nice to have it in case.</li>
    <li> Finally! A high end quality straightener at a regular joe price :) I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with HSI straightener. It&#x27;s easy to hold, handle doesn&#x27;t get too hot. And does a beautiful job penetrating my deep and thick hair. With other straighteners, they only scratch the surface because my hairs too thick. Not the case with HSI! Finally, sleek and frizz free hair!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly but still doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my Chi.  Area is a bit smaller so it takes a bit more time to straightener.  Value price wise is much better than other straightener.</li>
    <li> So the reason I give it, just an ok.  I was so excited to find such a highly rated flat iron, the day my Chi broke.  I could have bought another Chi but decided to give this one a try- plus it was a fraction the cost!  So, lovely packaging, nice argon oil sample, nice silk travel case with padding, and the iron itself feels nice in the hand.  Quick to heat up, I was surprised to need higher heat on my hair.  Now the thing I am disappointed in- the edges of the heat plate have little corners that drag and catch on my hair- I would have to take very, very small sections of hair for this to not happen.  This did not happen with my former flat iron.  I have decided to continue to try to make it work for a while but we will have to see!</li>
    <li> Perfect for thin hair. Not very durable. My counter is small so my hair gadgets fall off a lot. This took 3 times falling off before one of the plates quit heating. Worked perfectly until then. :(</li>
    <li> Used just once so far.  Love it.  Makes my hair so smooth.  Lasts into the next day.  No bed head.  My hair is wavy with some cow licks.  This iron does the job.  Hope I love it in 6 mos.</li>
    <li> Not salon quality. . Im a stylist and should know.</li>
    <li> My mom was in the market for a new hair straightener but wasn&#x27;t quite sure what brand she wanted. After reading these reviews and talking to some friends who also have this brand, I bought it for her - and she LOVES it. She said it heats up quickly and evenly and works great, even on her wavy (and sometimes unruly) hair. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s very hot, takes a few minutes to do my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice iron.. seems like it needs to get hotter.. but maybe I need to let it heat up more</li>
    <li> My flat iron finally gave out, so after talking to my hair dresser went with this one.  It heats up quickly, and I don&#x27;t have to go over a section of hair repeatedly.  It&#x27;s my first ceramic, and I can&#x27;t believe I went this long without one.  It does everything it says it does, and I haven&#x27;t singed my hair yet!  I am very happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really makes my hair beautiful.Thanks ♡</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener. You have to use small sections and move slow but it doe the job very well.</li>
    <li> Take a little longer to heat up than my last straightener.  I like that the heat setting dial is on the inside because I don&#x27;t bump it while using the iron.  The iron does a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Good product, I really like it</li>
    <li> Mine stopped working in one month-never reached the heat advertised.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery of exactly what I ordered with everyhing included. I&#x27;ve used the iron twice now and it works even better than the last HSI that I had.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron, heats up quickly does the job.  Others I have tried do not completely straighten my hair as well as this one does.  Nice, silky smooth hair.....LOVE this flat iron.  The carrying case, when turned inside out makes a great &amp;#34;pad&amp;#34; also.</li>
    <li> After just a few days of having the straightener it wouldn&#x27;t stay hot. Fried my hair and made it super dry. Definitely bummed compared to all the other reviews that were so excited about this item</li>
    <li> It arrived on time but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people natural hair.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly.  Good quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> Love everything about my new straightener!</li>
    <li> I recieved my flat iron about 2 weeks ago and i absolutly love it. I have ver thick hair which usually takes me about 45 minutes to straighten,  with this hsi it takes me 15-20. The pouch and glove come in handy. I am prone to burning my fingers when using s flat iron,  the glove helps alot</li>
    <li> We are so pleased with the quality and value of this product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She tried it a few times and it just doesn&#x27;t straighten too well. Certainly does not work as well as a few of the other straighteners she has used. She feels it may not be getting hot enough.</li>
    <li> Towards the end of it&#x27;s lifespan (one year), the temperature would be untrue to the setting and burn my hair. There were many times I had to set the straightener to the lowest setting to hope my hair wouldn&#x27;t burn. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Satisfied with it but do wish it had the capability to close while heating.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product so far. I gave it 4 stars because of the temperature dial. It is not really effective because only 2 temperature settings are displayed and you have to guesstimate the others... The design is nice and it came with a few extras such as the argan oil. I have highly textured hair and this flat iron seemed to work.</li>
    <li> Update - I purchased this flat iron because of the great reviews.  The pros is the swivel cord and it does get hot very quickly, however, I do feel that it pulls my hair.  At first I thought it was just the way I was using it but fast forward and I still have the same issue.  I don&#x27;t feel it adds any shine to my hair and actually looking for a different one at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review - I am very happy with this flat iron. It is easy to use and the case is very pretty. The glove is really helpful and the Argan oil smells wonderful.  Excellent purchase for a great price.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s awesome and it&#x27;s smooth hair of curl.  Prefect!!</li>
    <li> This came exactly as described and works great!</li>
    <li> I just receive this product so far so good it came just as described and work as describe so far I&#x27;m happy only had it a week so I gave 4 stars want to see how long it last then I would give it a 5 star</li>
    <li> Works well with curly hair! Although straightening curly hair is always a pain and it&#x27;s very hard to get perfectly straight hair. What I love most is the Tourmaline coating which is healthier for your hair. I only wish it had a bigger light to see if it&#x27;s on from a distance and that it had an automatic timer that would shut it off. I often leave it on for the whole day by accident because I don&#x27;t notice the tiny light. Good news is that it never burns anything! so even if I do leave it on, my home is safe.</li>
    <li> Bad product. My 5 year old Chi works better than this. Will be returning this.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in perfect condition. I am African American,  with natural hair. This flat iron did not burn or drag over my hair. It has been 5 days and my hair is still fairly straight.  Using the glove makes styling fast and easier. The only issue I had was the fact that it took four days to ship. However,  it shipped on a Thursday and arrived Sunday morning.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly.  Does a good job straightening and also seems to leave my hair softer.  Good long cord too.  I like it better than the $200 Chi flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price. Arrived on time.happy with purchase.Leaves a good shine on my hair!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she has a lot of think hair, this straightener does it&#x27;s job. It doesn&#x27;t damage her hair, its quality exceeds expectations, and it makes her hair look exactly as she wants it to in a quick manner.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to purchase this item because of all of the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, my experience was less than positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  I ordered and paid for the one with the LCD digital temperature screen.  I got sent the other one.  The process to return and get completely refunded is a hassle.  I opted for a $10 refund and decided to give the non-digital screen one a shot.  Amazon&#x27;s fault (not Blue Novelties)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  I was supposed to receive a free trial size argan oil sample.  It never shipped with the product.  Amazon&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  The coating on the plates did not cover the whole plate.  The edges were uncoated and as a result, my hair fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  It took SO long for the iron to heat up (at least 2 minutes) and when it was at the &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; full capacity, did not straighten my hair.  I have wavy / fine hair and it should have straightened it but did not.  I still have a wave and some weird helmet-hair thing going on this morning as a result of using this iron.  I actually had to drag out my old straightener to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to finally get a new straightener and after carefully exploring my options, came upon this one.  The overwhelming positive reviews made it *seem* like a sure bet.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend a large chunk of change for a straightener but after my experience with this one, am definitely feeling that the extra money spent might have been worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good straightener, steer clear of this one.</li>
    <li> Great product at very reasonable price. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hair stylist,I have worked with several high end flat irons.I would recommend this one to be just as good and the pricing evan better.You do have to break them in to get the reaction your looking for.</li>
    <li> I have thick and frizzy hair. This straightener gets the job done. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> *****UPDATE****** so my flat iron stopped working after almost a year, but my warranty via Amazon expired a month after I purchased it, so I was pretty steamed...but, I contacted the seller, and they sent me a brand new iron NO QUESTIONS ASKED! They didn&#x27;t even ask for it back!( I threw it away) ...Anyway I&#x27;m now back to loving my flat iron, and now have a huge amount of respect for this company and their customer service...  I LOVE  this flat iron!!! a week before i got this iron, i purchased the &amp;#34;One Epic flat iron&amp;#34; for 250.00..it was solid ceramic, tourmaline, digital heat setting with flash heating and auto shut off and went up to 450....on paper, it seemed to be a no brainer that this would be a great iron, and i would have no problems..however,what i learned from this purchase, is that extremely high heat does not a good flat iron make..i used it 2 times, hoping that maybe my hair would look better the second time around...but my hair looked AWFUL..i&#x27;m an african-american woman with medium length hair..after using the epic, my hair looked fried! even lowering it did not make my hair look silky, and it had no movement..after researching flat irons, i came across the HSI Professional..it had such excellent reviews so i brought it..WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!! my hair looked shiny and silky and had plenty of movement..since i don&#x27;t usually use a lot of oil in my hair because it tends to weigh it down, i was apprehensive about using the sample argon oil that came with it..but it wasn&#x27;t heavy at all! it added a beautiful sheen, didn&#x27;t take away any body, and it didn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell..i love this flat iron, and it taught me that just because a flat iron is really hot, that doesn&#x27;t NECESSARILY mean it&#x27;s better...i&#x27;m not saying that the &amp;#34;Epic&amp;#34; is a bad flat iron, but rather, a bad iron for MY hair..u have to know your hair type and decide what flat iron will work best with your hair..this one is definitely for me, and i&#x27;m SO GLAD i bought itr MY hair..u have to know your hair type and decide what flat iron will work best with your hair..this one is definitely for me, and i&#x27;m SO GLAD i bought it</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! I&#x27;ve not used one much, but I can see that this one is good quality, hats up fast, and will be easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to flat irons.  After looking at all the offerings on Amazon, this one impressed me with both quality and price.  I was happy I chose it. Easy to use, even my first time using a flat iron, and my hair looks so much better after using it.  Love the extras included with it, the satin case to store it in, the glove to prevent burns, and the sample of Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Great quality at a very reasonable price. Heats up quickly, and the carrying pouch is a great addition.</li>
    <li> I have been using this flat iron for a few months.  I am transitioning to natural hair which means I  try not to use too much heat on my strands. I do not want to do any damage to my hair,, The HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC is really a professional flat iron.  I know some say they are and you spend hundreds of dollars on it just to be disappointed in the quality. NO DISAPPOINTMENT HERE, I love that I can set how hot or cool you want it. I just use my HSI on my new growth, just 2 or 3 glides and down to the ends I go... I have used it to curls my ends also and it really did a great job.. I love how it is packaged with its own red silk sleeve and a glove if you need it. My daughter bought one of the high end flat irons (no name mentioned) but it was over $100.00, She tried my HSI and to her excitement she loved it. She said that it was just as good or better than hers,,,, WOW  The price is affordable and it works like a dream...&lt;br /&gt;YES I recommend the HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON ... I love it and am so glad I purchased it....&lt;br /&gt;God bless and happy flat ironing,, lol</li>
    <li> Great and very affordable product! After one use, my hair felt very smooth and slick I recommended this product to a lot of my friends who were searching for a new flat iron.</li>
    <li> I wanted a hair straightener. I demand a high quality product but not a premium price. Fortunately for me I did not need to read through a thousand reviews:  I am the mother of a teenage girl with naturally curly hair who spends an insane amount of time de-curling, de-frizzing her hair 6 times a week. She recommended this product to me! It couldn&#x27;t get a higher recommendation even from a prof hair stylist. I am the person who gave her the curl gene (!) and so yes, I do have wavy hair that looks unruly in humidity. This is a great product that is easy to use. I love the temperature settings as I do not wish to fry my hair into a straight look. It soothes the outer layer of the hair making it appear manageable and healthy. It is very light weight which I like as its easy to pop in a suitcase when travelling. I have only one complaint and it is minor - they supply a sleeve to keep it in and the sleeve is so narrow that you cant fit the hair straightener and its plug in there at same time - minor!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase, item is just as described and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a professional straightener and found it here! The quality is great and it was shipped quickly. Happy I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! Working good so far.. Heat really fast ..</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it was a great product. Not quite as nice as a top brand straightener but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery. Works as expected and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It is not travel size; it has a travel pouch.  This pouch is great for putting away a hot iron, which I do because I don&#x27;t leave it sitting out like most people. It has a long cord as well. It is good for my shoulder length hair and makes it easy to get close to the roots. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> No more Chi for me! I have had this over a year, and I love it. African American hair, no relaxer, very thick. The temp control allows you to cater to your hair without damaging it.</li>
    <li> Highly satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Absolutely pleased with this product. Straightens hair in much less time than my previous straightener. Handles well and makes my hair really soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I took awhile to rate the HSI because I wanted to test it out longer than a couple weeks.  I am disappointed with this flat iron because it didn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected or had hoped.  I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s relatively wavy, so imagine why the heat temperature is so important.  I had a chi that I had over 8 years, and frankly I wish I hadn&#x27;t given it away because despite the crack, it still worked &amp; got super hot.  This flat iron doesn&#x27;t go above 410 and it takes over 10 minutes to heat up.  I would not recommend this flat iron to anyone that has thick, wavy, or curly hair because it will take over 45 minutes to get your hair straight.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy to use, I do my hair only in 15 minutes, is easy to handle, i liked that came with a glove to protect me.</li>
    <li> Love the brand, its a wonderful item and at a great price. If you are looking for a great flat iron go for the HSI product you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron by far. Better than chi. This is my second one. The last one I had for 3 years and it fell and plates broke.</li>
    <li> I am natural so i bought this product thinking it would be great for my hair for those times when i wanted to straighten. I was wrong. These were the worst flat irons that I have ever used. I bought some from Walmart and they work better than these. I cant believe the regular price for them is as much as it is. So not worth it either way but glad I didn&#x27;t spend hundreds.</li>
    <li> Very easy to work with, couldn&#x27;t be happier with this!</li>
    <li> Love the product! Easy to use with great results! First one did not work after about a week, but second one seems to be fine. Loved the first enough to try again. :)</li>
    <li> Nice iron. It works fast on my hair. I would like it better if it is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> This iron works very well... it&#x27;s sturdy and is exactly as described. I gave it a 4 star simply because it can&#x27;t work magic on anyone&#x27;s hair so don&#x27;t set too high expectations and you too will be satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great tool! Beautifully straightens my hair. The only thing that&#x27;s holding me back from giving 5 stars is that it takes too long to heat up for my liking. Mine takes about 4 minutes to fully heat up. But I can look passed that because it does such a good job on my thick, wavy, hard to handle hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I just did not know how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> These flat irons are the ABSOLUTE BEST!!! Professional quality in the comfort of my home! Would definitely purchase them again!</li>
    <li> This product works great! Has a heat dial to adjust the heat to just the right temp. for you and an easy on/off switch</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever. Also make amazing curls. Wish I bought years ago.</li>
    <li> While this product is better than most irons bought at discount stores, it has a few drawbacks, the major one being that if I use any kind of heat protection spray, the plates tend not to glide through the hair. Also, it does get REALLY hot, even on the lower temps so it&#x27;s best to start on the lower end and see how your hair reacts. I&#x27;m a proud &amp;#34;mixed chick&amp;#34;... Afro-Italian, with lots of heavy curly hair that is somewhat fine in texture and this does an ok job if I want to sleek out my curls!</li>
    <li> The product arrived very Quick! Leaves my hair súper shiny and so much better than buying a chi! Recommed!</li>
    <li> Excellent product-works so well on my frizzy curly hair when I want a sleeker straighter look. heats up quickly and came with nifty travel bag and argon oil-which I love. Service, shipping etc fantastic. couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Excellent...Fine product&lt;br /&gt;HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER&lt;br /&gt;Power Balance Performance Technology Bracelet in (Black/White Lettering)</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great!!</li>
    <li> All I can say is Wow! I originally had an issue with this flatiron. The one that I received was \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but not great. And I wrote my review accordingly. The company saw my review and contacted me! They were concerned after reading my review that I had received a defective one. I had the flatiron for over a month and they did not care. They sent me a new one priority mail. And they were right. The new flatiron is awesome! It heats quickly, stays hot, does not pull my hair and does not seem to be damaging my hair. I highly recommend this flatiron and am really impressed with the level of customer service.&lt;br /&gt;** original review** I was very excited to receive this flatiron because the majority of the reviews stated it was a great product but I must say that I am disappointed. It does heat up very quickly and gets extremely hot. However, it still takes several passes to get my strands remotely straight... And I don&#x27;t even have very wavy or hard to straighten hair. It also pulls strands and it can get very painful. Overall, I would say that it works ok and eventually gets the job done but I have definitely used better.</li>
    <li> I received just in a day after placing order using standard free shipping. My wife is using this product and is completely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Snagged on my hair and didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all. My hair is wavy and had a very dull look after using this iron.</li>
    <li> I got this as my first flat iron. I have thick, naturally curly hair and it took me about 15 minutes to straighten it. I had it set all the way up to the 450 degree setting, but it very quickly straightened each section on the first try. I am super happy this is the iron I got and did not spend the high dollars on a CHI or other much more expensive irons.&lt;br /&gt;I will update if anything goes wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for my trip to Europe next month. It works great and will for sure use it while I am over there.</li>
    <li> I am African American, and I have relaxed hair. My hair is not thick nor is it thin, I would say it&#x27;s somewhere in between. I have to say that I love this flat iron, it is by far the best I ever used. It gets really hot at the high setting, I am sure that it would work just as well on thick hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an Ok product. Nothing spectacular. It does not heat up enough for those with thick hair like me. I am using it, but it is not a favorite. Once it burns out, I will not repurchase. I do not recommend this product for people with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I ever had</li>
    <li> Broken all ready just bought at Christmas 2014</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my college student and she loves it.....ty for having a great product for long hair. Works great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great iron. Irons perfectly with only one pass. I have 3 daughter&#x27;s and they all love it too!  Doesn&#x27;t pull hair also.</li>
    <li> Wonderful flat iron that works great and the price was awesome!  The shipping was fast and the product more than met my expectations.</li>
    <li> So, this straightner is just okay, nothing really special about it. I really liked how they included the carrying case and the protective glove, that was nice. It might be just my hair type (i&#x27;m half puerto rican, half panamanian) and my hair type is thick and really wavy (not curly) but using this flat iron, it took multiple times going through that same piece of hair to get it straight. I like having to go only 2 or even 3 times, and that&#x27;s it. I even used it at the highest setting, and it took at least 5 or more times to get it straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does straighten, but it takes too long to straighten my type of hair. It could be great for someone with thinner hair, naturally straight or slighty wavy hair. I think people with curlier, thicker hair should get a 2 inch flat iron, because 1 inch is not enough. I&#x27;m probably going to return this, and try to find a higher quality 2 inch iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another weird thing is after about 2 hours or so, I see my hair starting to get wavy again. I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with the flat iron, again, it could just be the way my hair is. Give it a try if you have thinner, straighter hair.</li>
    <li> love this. works on my very thick hair and love the free oil treatment included. will be buying the oil treatment next.</li>
    <li> Works well...love it! Nice to have a sample of Argean oil to try. Would definitely buy as a gift again.</li>
    <li> seems great so far my daughter straightens her hair all the time and her hair seems les damaged by this product</li>
    <li> Based on the other reviews and the number of high ratings, I erroneously assumed that the straightener would be of high quality. I have used a Solano ceramic tourmaline flat iron before and I thought that this would come close it, but for a fraction of the price.  Needless to say, the Hsi straightener did not live up to my expectations and fell short of previous reviews. All in all, I think this straightener is similar to my previous Revlon straightener which was only $20 or so and lasted me about 6 years. I found the Hsi to be somewhat chintzy-ly made and the temperature dial makes it impossible to tell what temperature the straightener is at unless you are maxed out. What really disappointed me though is that when I tried the straightener on my hair, which is naturally straight, but gets slightly wavy when air dried, the straightener pulled rather than glided over, which is what my cheap, non-ceramic, non-tourmaline Revlon straightener did. Sad face. The search continues.</li>
    <li> Just received my item I&#x27;m not too sure I like pwhere the on/off and heat control switches are though,I suppose with more use it will be fine. I also don&#x27;t see myself using the glove but it came with it.I do like it and my hair is much smoother.</li>
    <li> It was a gift.  I don&#x27;t use it, but my wife likes it.  Also really like thst it is dual voltage.  Burned the last one up in France.</li>
    <li> This appears to be the only full size dual voltage flat iron on the market right now. There aren&#x27;t any switches you need to flip for the voltage - it automatically switches on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I used it both at home (PA) as well as in Rome (with a simple plug converter, NOT voltage converter since that wasn&#x27;t needed), and it performed just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this to the CHI, which is what I use at home, I would say that this flat iron is much heavier, and fuller around the handle part where you hold it rather than the CHI. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal, but worth mentioning. Also, sometimes it felt like my hair was being pulled. I stopped using the iron and looked at it to see what might be causing the pulling, but nothing was obvious.&lt;br /&gt;My end results were the same as with using the CHI, so I was pleased with that. Overall I&#x27;m happy that I purchased it, but will use it only as a backup to my CHI, and for travel.</li>
    <li> Hate it. It breaks off my hair, or pulls it out!!!</li>
    <li> Love ,Love it and the nice red pouch is a plus especially for travel</li>
    <li> I love this straightener keeps my hair straight all day. I always have trouble with different straighteners because my hair is so fizzy and looks horrible if I just blow dry it. It also heats up really fast.</li>
    <li> This thing works great!</li>
    <li> It gets hot fast and it straightens nicely. I like it a lot. Hoping it continues to be good.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really well on my thin but frizzy hair.  I love the argan oil that comes with it.  I would definitely recommend this flat iron.  The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Love it. It gets really hot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item twice. First time I bought it, it stopped working after 5 months. It wouldn&#x27;t heat up when you turned it on. I ordered it again thinking maybe I broke it some how. After 2 months of having the 2nd one this one won&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
    <li> Worst flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. My blow dryer got my hair straighter than this. I have really fine hair that is usually very easy to straighten. I just slammed this thing on the ground and broke it in frustration because my hair would not get straight.</li>
    <li> Bought this to take to Europe with me as I didn&#x27;t have a converter for the outlets.  It was extremely useful on the cruise ship (Celebrity) and in Italy.  Worked great.  But upon returning back to the US, I noticed it&#x27;s performance dropped a little bit.  It didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it did overseas; I kept the temperature the same as I did on the cruise.  I have naturally curly hair and it takes more heat than other peoples&#x27; hair to do the trick.  The metal plates had a hard time touching each other unless I pushed them together hard, which made for sore hands and arms after two minutes.  I compared to my other iron and I used light pressure and the plates touched, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use this iron if I go oversees, but for stateside use, I will stick with my old flat iron.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great! I am so glad I decided to purchase this! Such a great deal! The only thing I&#x27;m worried about is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic time off. But I always unplug when I am done so it doesn&#x27;t matter really. love this straightener.</li>
    <li> Works perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Gets hot very fast, has a reset button and protective cord which a lot of straighteners do not have!&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> It sucks! So disappointed! It snags your hair and pretty much breaks your hair! I need to return this ASAP!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Easy size to use daily on my shoulder-length hair; small enough for travel; heats quickly; easy to use dial control for heat.  Like the free argon oil and red silk storage bag.  The one glove isn&#x27;t necessary unless you really heat up your hair, which I avoid doing.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever bought - it works great &amp; is just an all around great product.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift; it stopped functioning within 40 days (just after the end of the return period) although it had only been used about 5 times. The &amp;#34;manufacturer&#x27;s warranty&amp;#34; requires a payment of $19 for shipping&amp; handling. That plus the costs to ship it back to the manufacturer makes the warranty useless. If you buy this item and notice that it seems to work sometimes but not other times (or heats up in an even manner), it&#x27;s probably going to stop functioning within a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery; product as promised; very satisfied.  Would order from you again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron for the last 10 years.  First, I owned a professional series CHI (which I loved) in the $100 price range. Then I purchased a Paul Mitchell Professional iron in the $120 price range.  They both quit after about 3-5 years.....I bought this because it had great reviews plus the price was fantastic.  Here&#x27;s what you need to know if you use flat irons.  After owning CHI and Paul Mitchell, the HSI is heavy and is not comfortable in the grip.  It feels bulky (?).....It takes a couple of minutes to heat to the maximum setting.  It doesn&#x27;t glide quite as smoothly over my hair even though it&#x27;s ceramic.  I don&#x27;t hate it because of the price. I&#x27;ll wait a little longer for it to heat up and go slower in the press.  If one had $100 to spend, I would recommend the Paul Mitchel or CHI (mainly because of the quick heat ability and both are lighter in the grip making them less cumbersome to flat iron long hair) but money is tight these days.  If you&#x27;re looking to try a flat iron for a new style, try the HSI.  When I first used a flat iron, I purchased a store brand, Conair or Revlon..When I decided to keep my straight hair style, I opted for the more expensive irons....HSI is above Conair, Revlon, BedHead irons but not to the level of CHI or Paul Mitchell. I did appreciate HSI sending a sample of their Argon oil.  I loved the oil and will order it after the sample is depleted.</li>
    <li> Iron is very easy to use and leaves my hair smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> Am writing this for my wife .She the one using the product.Is well satisfied and ordering another for our daughter  in law.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron! I am very pleased with this quality product. I have naturally curly hair and the iron gives me straight beautifully styled result. Definately recommend. It only takes a few uses to get the hang of it . I am a first time user of a flat iron, without the aid of my hair stylist...</li>
    <li> no more Janis Joplin hair!!!</li>
    <li> My grand daughter was skeptical as she wanted a +$100.00 flat iron.  After a couple of weeks she could not be mare happy and as her grand daughter so am I.  She sits in front of a mirror &amp;#34;all the time&amp;#34; playing with her hair and I can&#x27;t imagine by now she would not know every strand.  She&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best straighteners I have purchased.  It heats up fast and maintains a steady temperature.  It is easy to use and glides through the hair with ease.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job smoothing my hair and leaving it shiny.  My only disappointment is that the dial that regulates the temperature does not have a very visible dot to indicate the level of heat that is being used.  I had to paint the almost invisible dot white so that I could see the amount of heat I would be getting from the flat iron.</li>
    <li> Exceeded all expectations</li>
    <li> Easy to use, warms up quickly.  Only takes a couple minutes to straighten my thick head of hair!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have responded to your request.  I am very satisfied with the HSI flat iron.  The price was good and delivery was sooner than expected.  The product works very well, and the extras sentences are appreciated.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too happy with this flat iron because it ripped my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this straightner.  She said it was the best one she ever had.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my Chi hair straightener that I had for 5 years, and there was really no comparison. This straightener is barely better than the $20 conair ones. The fact they say the retail price is $200 is ridiculous. It is nothing like a $200 flat iron. It barely gets hot enough to make my hair straight in one pull, and I have generally straight hair already. Instead, this makes my hair staticy and stiff. Byfar the worst straightener I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Quick order processing and great product. I love this for the days I don&#x27;t wash and blow out my hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> I finally used the flat iron yesterday and was very pleased with it. The iron performed well and didn&#x27;t feel like it was &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; my hair. I also like the small size. Easy to travel with and performed like my larger one.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. Very satisfied with product. Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> My previous experience with flat irons has been with Conair and Revlon. My Conair is slowly dying and I decided to upgrade. The thousands of rave reviews about this model caused me to overlook the negative comments. This flat iron seemed impressive when compared to my Conair. I so wanted it to be great, the price was great at about $39.00 when I bought it two weeks ago.  After 3 uses it stopped heating enough to do anything to my hair, although the temperature was set at the maximum. I returned it and went to Ulta and bought a Chi. The Chi is everything I hoped this HSI professional would be. Amazon was great about the return.</li>
    <li> I decided to try a flat iron to tame the frizz often caused by blow drying. I chose the HSI Professional after researching several models and found this to have favorable reviews. It did not disappoint! It does not pull on my hair as curling irons tend to do. I&#x27;m able to adjust the temperature so I don&#x27;t burn my fine hair. And the rounded edges allow me to curl my hair if so desired. No auto-shutoff feature but that&#x27;s okay. I was aware of this &amp;#34;limitation&amp;#34; prior to purchasing. I simply make a point to unplug as soon as I finish.</li>
    <li> My sister loves it. Sadly, our cat got to the power cord.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  it does snag your hair if you are to close to the tip but it leaves my hair looking better that my previous expensive flat iron. I have had this flat iron for a while now and I REALLY LOVE IT!!  it is the best one I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Flat iron is wonderful great product</li>
    <li> Great deal! Quick delivery! Just as promised!</li>
    <li> This item is very basic and easy to use.  Leaves hair feeling so much better than retail store bought flat iron.  Wish my hairdresser would have recommended it sooner.</li>
    <li> I ended up returning mine as I couldn&#x27;t get it to straighten my hair on the first or second pass.  Company sent me a replacement stating I must have received a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; or defective one but the new one works the same.  Very disappointed, I was hoping this would be like the one my hair dresser uses which straightens my hair perfectly.  I am happy with the customer service at this company though.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Just as good as my Chi and much less expensive</li>
    <li> This is better than Chi. I love it</li>
    <li> Flat iron works so much better than the cheap version u used before!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this. Very high quality. I love doing my hair every day. Love the smell and feel of the oil that came with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great styling result!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good quality flat iron..it leaves me my hair straight and very smooth..I love it</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews I thought i&#x27;d try this iron. When I got it I tried it right it right away. I noticed that the iron wouldn&#x27;t close completely on the hair. I contacted the company and sent pictures that they requested. Their response to my pictures was &amp;#34;I do not see what you are talking about&amp;#34;. This purchase was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my 16 year old daughter for Christmas after reading reviews of various types of professional flat iron straighteners.  She couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It does just what she wanted.  Arrived quickly and at such a great price compared to other options.  Recommend it and the seller highly.</li>
    <li> I have an ancient straightener that says it heard up to 200 degrees. This one claims to be WAY hotter than that, but it&#x27;s not even hot enough to straighten my hair! I have fairly thick, dark blond, WAVY (not even curly!) hair. Even after I had it professionally straightened, this thing won&#x27;t even give me that extra shine my old (way cheaper, I might add) straightener. Back to old faithful, I guess.</li>
    <li> I thought I would upgrade and try a new flat iron.  I looked at the reviews and decided to try this one.  I used it the first time and noticed that it heats quickly, so was pleased with that, but it pulls my hair and it hurts!  Tried it a couple of more times thinking it just needed to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34;, but it did the same thing.  It&#x27;s like my hair gets caught on something.  I tried to adjust how I did things, but It kept happening.  Let&#x27;s be honest here, Folks.  This is a flat iron and it doesn&#x27;t take a degree to use one!  I put it away for a few months, but decided to try it again.  Maybe I was doing something wrong.  So tried it again and got the same result.  It pulls my hair.  I&#x27;m selling it on a garage sale.  Done with it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this flat iron. I ordered this for the adjustable temperature. I have very fine, thick hair that is naturally curly and the lowest setting straightens my hair. I always use the lowest heat setting to dry my hair also to keep from causing damage. Most flat irons are excessively hot. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I had a more expensive Sedu that finally crapped out on me after about 6-7 years, and I replaced it with this. Great price and does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good flat iron. I have very thick hair and was frankly expecting a little more &amp;#34;bang&amp;#34; for the buck, but it still takes a long time to iron my hair -- just like the cheap-o Conair flatiron I had previously. Oh well!</li>
    <li> It was for christmas gift so i think it turn out very good. The only thing i heard from it is the it is very for the price. However, the shipping was quick!</li>
    <li> I have been using a CHI straighten for years and finally it died, so after reading some of the reviews and seeing the price I though I would give it a try.  I returned it the next day.  I have very curly and very thick hair.  It takes about an hour to straighten it, so time is important, I don&#x27;t want to be standing there even longer.  This straighten didn&#x27;t even get half as hot as my old straightener did, and I was going over sections of my hair 4-5 times.  It took forever to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice spend the extra money and get a better quality product.</li>
    <li> Works very well - heats quickly and there is a light indicating when ready..the only thing that could make it better is auto shut off</li>
    <li> Works great on curly or frizzy hair! Love it - and it gets hot fast! I read mixed reviews on this before I bought it but I can&#x27;t say I have any complaints to add as of yet.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter.  She has used it almost every day and loves it.  She has had no problems.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good flat iron for a few years now. One that didn&#x27;t cost a lot and did what it says(flat iron hair). I had always seen the Chi flat iron advertised at the mall for $100.00 and wanted it but thought it was overly priced. So this year I started looking on amazon for one and found theHSI Professional ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron, plus it was on sale. I read the reviews watched them on YouTube and decided to order one for myself. I am so happy I did. It works as well as the Chi and cost half the price. I give it a 5 star rating and have recommended it to all my family and friends. Thanks HSI I have truly enjoyed your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn W.</li>
    <li> Great iron. Really have enjoyed using it. Does a great job on my hair. Great buy and price during the holidays.</li>
    <li> Product is light weight and quickly straightens thick hair. The cord swivel design is a plus - doesn&#x27;t get crazy twisted.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. This even impressed my 17 yr old niece. That is very hard to do. Love the Argan oil too.</li>
    <li> after reading all the reviews I decided to try this product over one that I had used and purchased previously and loved...I like this product but am disappointed in it.  I thought my hair would be straighter like it does when I get my hair done from the salon; this product states it is professional quality.  I do have thick course hair, but it never seemed to be as straight as I like the day I straighten it, it looks much better the next day after been slept on.  I would rate this product good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron with hopes of having beautiful, silky hair. Well, I have definitely had better flat irons than this. I gave it 3 stars because it will straighten your hair...I just see fly aways to the extreme and am disappointed. I was also looking for something that made my hair flatter...and this doesn&#x27;t cut it. Like I said, I&#x27;ve had some that do, and this isn&#x27;t it. It may really work for some people, just not for me.</li>
    <li> This little flat iron warms up quick and seems fairly easy to use. As a first time user of flat irons it&#x27;s not too difficult. The shipping was delayed and a received it a few days later then originally estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work the way that I was expecting. That was probably due to me not know much about flat irons to be with. It&#x27;s to be used on completely dry hair only. Which I did not realize. I was looking for one that could be used on slightly damp hair and produced steam when you used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for a really good price, so it still makes it a really good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for its dual voltage feature to use for traveling. Like it better than my current straighter. It is now my daily straighter at home.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It comes with a lovely red case. It heats up quickly and gets the job. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The service was great (very rapid delivery). The product is the second one I have bought as a gif for they same family. The product arrived in two days and was exactly the same as the last one, which was what was needed.</li>
    <li> Totally LOVE it. This my second one..Only one draw back it doesn&#x27;t have auto turn off..However would still STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> This flatiron works great. It heats up super fast and glides through my hair smoothly. I do wish it had an automatic shutoff, though.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works great!  It heats up quickly and has settings so it can get VERY hot.  It also has a neat swivel device on the cord so it won&#x27;t get all tangled when I pack it in a suitcase for travel, which is useful.</li>
    <li> The HSI professional 1\\&quot; Tourmaline Iconic Flat iron is a great product. I have been searching for flat irons that would straighten my hair just like the salon. These flat irons smooth out your hair from root to end with ease. The best part is that they were affordable. I would absolutely recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect tool, my hair looks like I was at the salon for hours. So worth the money I spent</li>
    <li> This flat iron does an excellent job of straightening my wavy, fine textured hair.  It stays straight all day.  I like that the heat is adjustable.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of HSI before ordering, but I will definately buy any other hair tools that they make. The iron heats up quickly and has floating plates. My hair was very shiny after use, and I didn&#x27;t need to use any sprays or sheens. With this flat iron, I can curl my hair, flip my hair, and of course straighten my hair. After use, my hair was bouncy and it looked almost as good as when I go to the hair salon. I will save a lots of $ now using this product rather then going to the salon! I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I read reviews that this flat iron is better (and I got it cheaper) than the chi. I&#x27;ve never owned a chi, but I wouldn&#x27;t switch after trying this one. It works great. It heats up quickly and does a great job on my hair. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off. I don&#x27;t know if other brands do or not but it would be nice. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the flat iron and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really like the straightener. Gets very hot, very fast and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair. I miss my old flat iron, but this one has been a great replacement!</li>
    <li> My sister has this flat iron and I used hers a few times and fell in love with it, so I had to buy my own. This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and it works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other flat iron hair straighteners but this one is the best i&#x27;ve used yet.  I&#x27;ve already told my family and friends about it.  It is a great product</li>
    <li> I purchased this HSI iron and I absolutly love it! I have thick curly hair and I have used CHI and Paul michelle irons before but the price on this this one i thought i would give it a try. It only took me me 15 mins to strighten my hair and this iron did a wonderful job no snaging or frizz also does a great job curling under as I was straighting my hair in the end my hair was soooo soft and with a little pomade no fly aways this is a great choice if you are looking to purchase a new iron :)</li>
    <li> This is such a high end flat iron!  There are so many great details.  I&#x27;m fairly new to these irons so I read a lot of reviews and checked out a lot of different brands.  I finally settled on this because it had all the features that I was looking for, had reviews that warranted my attention and the cost was more than reasonable.  It comes with a  luxurious  red satin carrying pouch ( very sexy).  You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, thick blonde hair that will not straighten with the cheaper curling irons and has tried many.  I found the HSI on Amazon, ordered it along with the holder, it arrived in four days even with standard shipping.  I was afraid the iron would get too hot and melt her bleached hair.  We smoothed a bit of the oil sample that came with the iron on her hair and in five minutes she had beautiful, glossy, healthy hair. It was still straight the next morning too. Just amazing how well the iron worked with so little effort!  Also, the controls are on the inside of the handle so it won&#x27;t turn off while using it.</li>
    <li> It works really good. The only thing about it is the piece of the cord that&#x27;s attached to the back of doesn&#x27;t stay in. I actually shocked my self trying to put it back in. The flat iron really straighten your hair the cord is just a hassle.</li>
    <li> I bought this Item on sale and love it. A straightener you only have to use once over your strands of hair. It cut down on the previous heat damge by other Hair straighteners. This is a must have for those people that like to wear their hair straight.</li>
    <li> The Flat Iron &amp; Bio Silk Sample is Awesome easy to use and comes with a nice pouch to store it in.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about buying a new flat iron. I had a professional Fusion flat iron that a stylist friend of mine got me at cost &amp; it made my hair look amazing! When it broke I wasn&#x27;t sure what to buy because of all the options &amp; costs. I assumed I would just get a Chi because I was so familiar with the brand, but did research anyway.  This iron had great reviews &amp; it sounded promising, but I had never heard of the brand before &amp; that made me nervous. I sat on it for a couple of weeks &amp; then I just decided to go with it &amp; trust the reviews. I am so glad I did!! Once again my hair looks amazing! I have spent a lot of time swimming this year so I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing the magic when my hair is healthy. Great product, would definately buy again &amp; recommend it.  :)</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great. The glove a great bonus as I have bad rashes on my hands so the heat does not hurt my hands.I am new at using a flat iron but this was easy to use and my hair looked great. I have curly hair and this worked great.</li>
    <li> This straightener retails for over $100 or you can buy direct through amazon and get it a great deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this straightener because it had great reviews and I lost my old one. I do substantial research on products I intended to use for awhile because I don&#x27;t want to be dissatisfied and have to buy another one spending more money. 95% of reviews are highly satisfied with this straightener and I am no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin hair so it is easy to burn with hot tools. This straightener did not burn my hair at all!! No matter how many times I went over it to get it straight!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes beaitufally packaged and they include a heat glove (which was MUCH APPRECIATED)and a trail size package of argan oil (which I am not addicted to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOUR IN THE MARKET FOR A STRAIGHTENER, BUY THIS ONE FROM THIS SELLER AND YOU WILL KNOW YOU GOT A GREAT DEAL ON A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightner. My hair is about halfway down my back. My HSI has my hair straight in less than ten minutes. I would highly recommend this product to everyone, especially since it works so well and is less than $50.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my daughter and one for me. I had never used a flat iron before, and my daughter&#x27;s previous flat iron stopped working. We both LOVE this new flat iron. It&#x27;s so easy to use and is truly as advertised. Would recommend for anyone looking for a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Works great.  This is a great product for a great price.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new hair straightener.</li>
    <li> I had a flat iron that I hardly used because I didn&#x27;t like it and didn&#x27;t know how to use.  I went in for a haircut and my hairdresser used a flat iron on my hair and I really liked the look so I decided to get a better flat iron to try out.  After seeing other reviewer&#x27;s comments I decided to get the HSI product.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s a quality product that feels great on my hair and makes my hair look great.  I can quickly heat it and run it over my hair for a sleek look that looks like it could have been done at a salon. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone and at a great price too!!</li>
    <li> Like most people that buy things, we all generally read feedback left by purchasers. I just received my package a few days ago and have been using my new flat iron everyday. So far I love it. It&#x27;s really heats up fast. For the price... its a great investment.</li>
    <li> I like the flat iron. It works well. However, I have really thin hair so most flat irons work well for me. The only problem I have is the lack of automatic shut off. I thought all flat irons nowadays had that. I assumed mine did and left it on while I took a nap accidentally.  TLDR: NO AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF, SO BE CAREFUL</li>
    <li> I love love love this straightener! I will never ever ever buy another walmart straightener! Glides through my thick hair and leaves it shiny and smooth! It&#x27;s amazing! I received it in less than 4 days and it came with a case! I recommend getting this one!</li>
    <li> This is a great value!  Heats up fast! I would buy this same item again.. It is for my daughter and she uses it better then I do..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL after 2 months of use the ceramic has become loose and the company WONT stand behind the item</li>
    <li> I was excited to purchase this item after reading all of the positive reviews.  What can I say but, \\&quot;seriously\\&quot;?  I&#x27;m not sure what is going on.  I will say it heated up quickly which was nice but now the positives end.  It not only snagged my hair but made it full of static.  Not pretty.  I&#x27;m returning it, don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money.</li>
    <li> Since it said &amp;#34;ceramic tourmaline&amp;#34; I thought it would be like my Crush by One flat iron.  NOT!  This flat iron constantly snags/pulls my hair!  I would NOT recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Up to now, my only experience with a flat iron is with the Chi flat irons.  I loved the Chi, however, they are quite expensive.  The HSI was about half the price and the reviews were good.  So, in an effort to save a little money--who doesn&#x27;t want to save some money these days?--I decided to take a chance on the HSI flat iron.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I have been using my new HSI for a couple of months now, and it is everything I hoped it would be.  It is a fantastic product.  I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> The temperature gets hot quickly. Lightweight. Great price. I love this flatiron. I use it on my natural curls and my daughter&#x27;s chemically relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered my HSI straightener because my daughter had already purchased one.  I have 4 girls living in my house, and 1 straightener wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I love this product.  we now have two and they are being used religiously everyday.  Our hair is silky with no flyaways, and the adjustable temp setting has elimated burning our hair.  We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with your product!</li>
    <li> This is a great professional grade flat iron for a great price.  I just started using this a week ago an have been very happy.  It straightens my hair and I can use it to curl the ends if I don&#x27;t want it stick straight.  It heats up very quickly and has a little light on the side that starts as red and turns to green when it&#x27;s ready.  There is a heat dial and on/off switch.  My only complaint is that the dial and switch are on the inside of the iron, right next to the hot plates, a little strange for when I am trying to turn it off and not burn myself.</li>
    <li> This product performs exactly as I wanted. It heats up quickly and it is small so it works well on short hair.  It has a high enough temperature to work on my coarse thick hair.  It came in a brand new box with a pouch and some oil.</li>
    <li> We received our product on time, and everything was as expected. We are very happy with our order and will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this HSI ceramic flat iron because of all the great reviews.  I am so glad that I did!  My hair is curly and kinky and absolutely impossible to straighten....before I got the HSI flat iron.  A lot of my friends have other flat irons to include Chi products.  This is by far the best.  With my hair I have to first blow dry it with a round brush, I then follow up with the HSI flat iron.  My hair went from frizz city to being sleek, shiny and soft.  I have tried others and they have never accomplished this.  The iron is easy to handle and is not hot to the touch.  The 360 degree cord keeps it from tangling and inevitably breaking like some of my friend&#x27;s flat irons.  This is a professional flat iron.  It has multiple heat settings and floating ceramic plates that make straightening my hair a breeze without heat damage.  The price for this HSI is more than reasonable, especially compared to the other brands out there that claim to be top of the line.  The impeccable quality of this flat iron at the price of $44.95 offered by Blue Novelties is an absolute steal.  I would definitely recommend this HSI flat iron to anyone with any hair type that wants professionally looking straight hair.</li>
    <li> Item came very quickly, works well on my shoulder-length hair for straightening and flipping.  Haven&#x27;t tried to curl yet, as I am not quite that talented on my own hair! Like that the iron came with a heat-protective glove to wear on the hand that is handling the hair, makes it easier to handle the pieces while they are hot. Overall I like this iron very much.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price and received it the next day. I like that it leaves my hair shiny and silky looking.</li>
    <li> Not only its wonderful!! I´m obsess with it! just be careful not to burn your hair or the tips use it on low to medium heat. doesn´t need to be to hot to work its magic.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great! It got hot fast and it was so easy to use! That was very important to me since I am new to using a hair straightener. My hair was nice and tamed and I love my results!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for my CHI because the CHI&#x27;s plug broke :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after reading the awesome reviews about this flat iron, I decided to get it. Plus it was on sale so I got it for a great deal. It works wonderfully. I have naturally curly hair (3B) and I blew it dry first, then used this iron and literally I was done. Super easy, and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> Product works good, gets hot enough and doesn&#x27;t take long at all. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a like product.</li>
    <li> My CHI broke and i didnt have the $ for a new one.Saw the reviews and ordered this one. Works just as good as my CHI and half the price. Great product.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great. I was expecting it to be a little bit more powerful to get straight hair faster, but it&#x27;s still very good.</li>
    <li> Was able to take this straighten to Australia and it worked perfecty! It changes voltage automatically, heated up quickly and it made my hair straight and silky....an awesome dual-voltage straightener!</li>
    <li> I was able to plug this into 220V outlets and have great looking hair in minutes.  I can also use it at home in 110V outlets, so it&#x27;s for more than just international travel.  The travel case is a nice addition and allows for easy packing when the iron is still hot.  I normally use a Chi iron and the HSI performed just as well, so at less than 1/2 the price of a Chi it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my straightener. I am very excited I have heard amazing things about it and read all the great reviews .I turned it on and it heated up fast and hot. I have very curly ,kinky hair that seems almost frizzy at time and with the Argan oil sample it was such a fast process Im used to swiping my old straightener 6 times or more for a good straight this was one swipe and a perfect straight I am very happy with this straightener and the price is amazing if you go to the HSI website its 199.99  for the same straightener. so Im happy</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way. So happy I found this and made decision to purchase. No problems....works great ...strong heat...would recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who was using a Chi and she says this is much better and gets hotter.  She has had it for about a month now and uses it daily and has no issues.  She doesn&#x27;t were the glove but hasn&#x27;t burned herself like she used to with the Chi.  She has very thick and frizzy hair and this tames it like a charm.  I like the tangle free cord as it is less of a mess than the Chi. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This iron gets hotter on a lower heat setting than my old styling iron did at a higher heat setting.  However, the heat from this iron does not damage my hair, it leaves my hair looking and feeling healthier.  My hair seems to absorb the heat. To get the same amount of heat from my old iron I would have to use a higher setting that would leave my hair smelling burnt and looking and feeling damaged.  Needless to say, I am very pleased with my purchase.  BTW I am a 59yo AAF w 4a relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and have used many straighteners on my hair. I have to say, this one is fantastic! I have a certain section of my hair that for some reason is near impossible to straighten but I only had to go over it once and it was straight with this HSI. Also, my hair is normally frizzy but after using this my hair is always smooth and shiny. You can&#x27;t beat it, especially for the price! I have previously used the instyler, wet 2 straight, revlon, and even a CHI. I would rate this one as the best out of all of them.</li>
    <li> This is the best!!!! loveeeeeeeeeeee</li>
    <li> Works better than expected! My Paul Mitchell straightener died on me so I needed to find something inexpensive but effective. I love this straightener so much, I&#x27;m really starting to second-guess spending $200 on a new one!</li>
    <li> Really liking this straightener for the price.</li>
    <li> does not work like a better brand would, waste of money wish I had read the reviews on it first!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in Europe this summer.  I tried it at home and it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  Hoping it works better on my trip.</li>
    <li> Love it.....!!!! Leaves my hair the way I want it in a couple of minutes....!</li>
    <li> I have VERY curly hair and have never used a straightener on it because it never looked as good as when the salon did it. Except for some occasions where it pulls (this might just be a me thing until I get more practice - but it&#x27;s the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars), this item makes my curls straight. Better still, it can make soft curls as well! Loving this!</li>
    <li> Worked well on my hair,though it takes forever to get my hair straight, which is probably more my hairs fault than the straighteners</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Hope it works abroad. 😀</li>
    <li> For the price, this was an excellent purchase.  I will probably like it even more when the humidity calms down in my area!  I have very thick, curly hair, and I&#x27;ve had a pretty easy time getting it straight.  It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;miracle iron&amp;#34;, but as I said, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t use it.  But, the wife loves it.  No complaints thus far, and none are expected.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. It does its job well. Other than that, nothing special. It has weird smell.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this flat iron , very good quality !!!</li>
    <li> Great price and works well.</li>
    <li> came faster than expected. I have very thick, coarse hair and it worked fast and left my hair smooth and shinier then I thought it would</li>
    <li> The iron I bought was completely defective and pulled and snagged my hair! Not at all happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use - love this product! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Works great!  Does pull my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Works really well. Only complaint is it takes longer than most to heat up.</li>
    <li> AWESOME I love this iron it makes your hair look so smooth</li>
    <li> This flat iron works wonders!!! I have curly thin hair that always curls right back up after flat-ironing it and after using this my hair has been straight for 3days so far with no touch up! The leave in Argon oil worked great as well. Didn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or sticky. I really love these products😊</li>
    <li> I was amazed with this product. It delivered on time and works great! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product lasted less than one year....stopped turning on.  Difficult to adjust settings inside bar.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> This a a great flat iron for the money.  The only problem I had when I tried it out was sometimes hair gets caught in the end of the plates.  Will be taking to Europe later this summer and will be able to better evaluate it.</li>
    <li> Great product! It takes hardly any time to get my hair straight with this tool. Before, I was just using a blow dryer and round ceramic brush to straighten my hair and it would take an hour to get decently straight. With this straightner, it takes me about 20 minutes now to go from my crazy curly and frizzy hair to sleek and chic. Great buy!</li>
    <li> this straightener definitely did not let me down. I was nervous about it since it was so inexpensive and I have thick and curly hair but it works really well and leaves my hair feeling soft and looking great!</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!  Works better than products more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair and this flat iron works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Product heats up very quickly and is super easy to use. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Sparked upon plugging in.  Returning ASAP</li>
    <li> I needed a universal flat iron that had a high heat. This product meet by needs, for I am going to Europe</li>
    <li> This is an okay straightener for the price.  Pros- It has 100% ceramic plates that reduce the risk of hair damage. It has adjustable temperatures. It is lightweight. It has dual voltage. It straightens nicely, and leaves the hair soft and shiny.  Cons- The plates do not fully come together. The plates pull on my hair. The plastic casing feels cheap.  I will be returning it and investing in another GHD straightener that lasted about 4 years until the plug part came apart. If your hair straightener is one of your prized possessions like me, I would recommend spending the extra money to invest in a nicer one.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron and all it&#x27;s features!  Easy to use and am REALLY going to appreciate the dual Euro/USA electrical feature when traveling.  Works great and comes travel ready with pouch, and small jar of Argon Oil.  And the price was great too!!!</li>
    <li> It does not due what I expected from a flat iron.  I had previously owned a Ceramics straightener and thought this one would be the same, if not better, for the way it was advertised.  I have relatively straight hair and use a flat iron for touch ups, but it leaves my hair frizzy, where as no other flat iron had before.</li>
    <li> Th product was just as described...love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this when my Chi of five years died. I read the reviews so I thought I&#x27;d try this one but it just doesn&#x27;t do the job. Ordering a Chi from ulta now!!</li>
    <li> Read some reviews on here before buying and the majority said it works as good as a $200 straightener so don&#x27;t waste your money on another one. It pulls at the hair and doesn&#x27;t straighten nearly as well as my last one. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very Good!  I like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews, but I was surprised that it does not even straighten my hair. It does have a burning smell when it is warm before it touching my hair. Not nearly as good as my old angelique straightener that I dropped and broke. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great straightener - perfect amount of heat, easy to use. One pass through does the trick.  Nice margin between heated surface and edge so you&#x27;re less likely to burn yourself! Recommended highly.</li>
    <li> When running the iron down my hair, it tends to pull my hair out. Smooth on the iron part, but the tips are not.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend. She has been using a cheap straightener for about 7 years and she loves this thing. Good value.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my mom, and she loves it. It still works after a year and she says it&#x27;s the best hair iron she&#x27;s ever had. Take it from her, buy it.</li>
    <li> My hair occasionally gets stuck in some part of the ceramic face, which HURTS when it gets ripped out (or worse, broken mid-strand).</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve had yet. I have curly hair and it gets frizzy easily. This straightener was excellent. Recommended to my aunt and I believe she bought it too. The argan oil is really good too. It makes my hair shiny and shift. Make sure to use a heat guard as it gets really hot.</li>
    <li> Served the purpose, Good use for my wife&#x27;s hairs</li>
    <li> #1 issue: does not have auto shut-off. This safety feature is a must-have in a flat iron. #2 I did not notice a huge difference between this straightener and a cheaper Conair brand I had previously. And the Conair brand had a great comb feature. A positive: it heats up quickly and HOT.</li>
    <li> I am completely happy with this product!  I love the red satin pouch and the glove.  You will never regret purchasing this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Great straightner that provides an out of the hair salon kind of look. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially at the price on amazon</li>
    <li> My wife had a Chi iron for 5 years that finally died and she decided to try this to replace it. It lasted 3 weeks before the ceramic plates cracked and broke.  It is no longer usable.  She will go back to a Chi that is durable and unforgiving.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price and quality! I feel this straightener is better quality than those that cost $100.00 or more.</li>
    <li> Comes with glove and sleeve. Has temperature selection up to 450º. Great product for the price. My  stylist recommended ceramic product.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely curly hair and it often took her hours to straighten it all.  When her old straightener died, she was dismayed at finding a new one.  She ended up purchasing two separate straighteners at local stores only to find that they couldn&#x27;t do the job on her coarse, curly hair.  We found this straightener and it seemed to have great reviews so we bought it.  It arrived earlier than expected and worked amazing!  It now takes my daughter about a 1/3 of the time to straighten her hair and it cools down a lot faster than her old one.  We are very impressed and would definitely buy again from this seller and highly recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> Spring started squeaking VERY badly. Returning for replacement. But unsure of the overall quality.</li>
    <li> This is a good flat iron for the price. I like that it has adjustable heat settings. The only issue I have is that the on/off switch would be easier to use if it was on the outside of the unit instead of in between the ceramic plates.</li>
    <li> First time I have bought and used a flat iron.  So far I really like this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still unsure about this product. I have a cheaper iron that seems to work better but I guess I need to try this more and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> This one does the job. Got it for a trip to France and worked well. Very compact to pack for travel</li>
    <li> This works better than my chi! I have long, thick, coarse, spiral curly hair and unlike the other reviews, I can&#x27;t get it perfectly straight in one pass but I can in two. It&#x27;s wonderful I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> The digital one  work good.I recommend the digital one over non digital you can control your heat better.The non digital one I had bought previous was loosing heat at high temps the light would turn from green to red on and off.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly frizzy hair...I got this because a few friends were raving about how great it was. I gave up my wet to straight for it. kind of an even trade. For all the hype I thought it would be better. Alot of people say that you only have to do one swipe over the strand of hair...I have to do several on high heat...so its pretty much the same as any other flat iron in the price range. You get what you pay for. Came in a nice package and still works...so thats a plus.</li>
    <li> So far, so good for my wife.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this flat iron. I received it today and was so anxious to try it after reading all the great reviews. It was a complete let down. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot and it snagged my hair so bad I was only able to finish half my head. Save your money. This flat iron is just awful.</li>
    <li> I was pleased that it got so hot! It was much faster to do my hair with.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. My hair was smooth and easy to manage. Heats up quickly and ceramic plates don&#x27;t seem to scratch. Love that it comes with a temperature dial, heat resistant carrying pouch, and a sample of Argan oil.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair straightener.  I highly recommend it.  I have long thick black hair, and it works really well.  Leaves my hair looking tidy and straight with beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> It works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> The plates are very smooth and they never snag any hair when I pull through, which is great because that was my major issue with my last straightener. It heats up quickly and overall its a good product. I gave it 3 stars because I have to turn up the heat all the way to get my hair straight and even then it takes several tries to tame my hair. I&#x27;ve tried some more expensive straighteners and they didn&#x27;t take quite so long to get my hair straight. However, this one was affordable, I love the aragan oil, and I&#x27;m very happy with it for the money I spent.</li>
    <li> This is the best straighter ever! Best purchase I have ever made!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for two years now and it still works wonders! I have curly hair that is kind of difficult to straighten but this does the job effortlessly and beautifully. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever spent more than 10 minutes on my hair. Perfect! I&#x27;m so happy to have found it!!</li>
    <li> the unit is larger &amp; heavier than expected I have small hands &amp; slight arthritis in right thumb. I gave it to my stylist. temp settings etc all good..</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this flat iron! Makes my hair shinier than my previous straighteners and glides through my hair very nicely.  Works just as well as my friend&#x27;s straightener that was more than twice the price. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the name brands!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!  I had a hard time deciding between this and a CHI, but went for this product based on the great reviews.  I was not let down.  It heats up quickly, and leaves hair very silky and shiny.  Plus, I love the protective traveling pouch.  I learned how to flat iron curl my hair with this, and the swivel cord makes it so easy to do.  My bottle of oil did leak during shipping, but I wasn&#x27;t too concerned as I was mainly interested in the straightener.  The Blue Novelties people heard about it, though, and are sending me a replacement bottle.  How awesome is that?  Great product, seller, and especially great price!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Heats up fast, works well with my hair and the long cord is so convenient! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Excellent! I have VERY, VERY thick hair that is almost impossible to style (for reference i have straight-wavy hair. not curly or highly textured.) My last flatiron was not up to the challenge, this one is. I love the solid construction,  the 360 cord, and the truly adjustable heat.  my hair is silky smooth after use.  I didnt have any clue what the glove was for so i tossed it. the carrying case is wonderful as i travel A LOT for business. I&#x27;m grying the free sample of argan oil and it feels nice but i dont think its helping the straightening process very much. i probably wont go out of my way to get more. but i would re purchase this flat iron in a heatbeat!</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and moderately coarse, and after a quick at-home blowout, this straightener works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> Straightens well and fast, but the plates do not float and so it leaves crimps when curling. I bought a cheapy one from Burlington coat factory and it does a better job.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the low ONE DAY pricing of $38.xx and I was very happy when it was delivered!  It came sooner than estimated and it is a great straightener.  I have used the same CHI for years and this is very comparable.  The only downfall to it was that my hair doesn&#x27;t glide as easily as it does with the CHI but this is still a wonderful straightener and I love being able to set the temp also.  I keep it on the highest setting to get the best results but the lower settings work great for getting that beachy curl look.&lt;br /&gt;RDA at [...]</li>
    <li> Put a perfect finish on my hair and Perfect for my international travel.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my purchase. The HSI heats to temperature quickly and perfectly straightens my hair. One pass through my naturally curly locks left my hair straight and silky with no frizz.</li>
    <li> Works great on my curly Asian hair</li>
    <li> This straighter is really good!  Its gets really hot, but it keeps your hair straight throughout the day unlike other straighteners where your hair becomes curly in humidity.  It has different heat levels so you can have it warm or salon hot. It is a definite buy!!</li>
    <li> I have always been using Conair items. Realizing my hair wasn&#x27;t getting good quality anymore from the flat Iron. I decided to get a new one. Looking on Amazon and reading reviews I decided with this one. It was pretty easy to use. End result.... LOVE IT! No, problems so far so that&#x27;s great. I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Quality product, Exactly what we were looking for! We would also recommend the flat iron holder by HSI.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this straightener and loves the nice cover it comes with....it worked very well on her hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener is ok except it snags my hair.  Was expecting it to be comparable quality to a Chi straightener.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it!!  She uses it 3-4 times a week and has not had any issues at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener seeing that it had many positive reviews. Originally, I was going to purchase the CHI straightener, but I opted for this one instead. After three months, it suddenly stopped heating up.  I hardly used it and I took good care of it.</li>
    <li> This iron is probably everything it says it is, however it doesn&#x27;t suit me.  I have used flat irons for several years and love them.  This one is definitely for professional use.  It is heavy to hold and awkward to maneuver.  The plates also drag and tug on my hair - no other iron I&#x27;ve used has done this.  Also, it has one of those big plugs with a circuit breaker which is a pain if you have more than one appliance plugged into an outlet.  I&#x27;ve never returned a product to Amazon, but I&#x27;m considering returning this.  In either case, I am definitely replacing it.  I don&#x27;t need to begin my day fighting with my flat iron every morning.  That said, it is probably perfect for professionals.  It is sturdy (heavy), heats up fast, and has a variable heat setting (oddly placed on the interior of the iron arm).</li>
    <li> Came in the mail a few weeks ago and I love it, it makes my hair so silky and smooth! I never thought I&#x27;d find a straightener I liked more then my Remington but this one sure beats it I just hope it lasts 6 and a half years like my Remington!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my hair straightener... when  I receive it I was missing the oil they said went with it....but after I told them, the oil was on it&#x27;s way....good customer service... great product....great price!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for Chi. I did my research and picked HSI (at less than half the price). So far she&#x27;s been thrilled with the gift. Delivery was quick, and the package arrived fully intact.</li>
    <li> This flat iron has probably been the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while. It was well worth it and it&#x27;s great. It makes my hair silky smooth and straightens/curls very easily.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Great service, quick shipping and awesome price!  This is my second HSI flat iron, and think it&#x27;s as good as my previous CHI.  You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this one.</li>
    <li> I love these! Great for straightening and adding waves. Arrived quickly (less than a week). Very impressed!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! It heats up fast and does a terrific job on my thick wavy hair! I bought one a few years ago and I accidentally dropped it and the ceramic plate cracked, so right away I knew I wanted to get another one as fast as I could! You won&#x27;t go wrong with this iron!</li>
    <li> This straightening iron looks nice, similar to the Her Styler I had previously but it just didn&#x27;t heat up enough to really straighten my hair. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I thought that this hair straightener would be on par with one I have purchased in the past - Farouk developed by Chi. It was not. I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem with this implement is that it is long and heavy. Fine for professional stylists but cumbersome for self-styling. The other problem was that it did not slide through the hair easily; rather, it stumbled down the length of hair with starts and  stops. We could not explain why this occurred on two different types and lengths of hair, so we returned it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron pulls my hair.  Will not purchases this ever again.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  It is easy to use and came with a case for travel.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron straightener I have ever bought!!! Heats up extremely fast and works awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> Excellent professional quality at a great price</li>
    <li> Great product at cheap price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My curling iron is no longer needed!  Heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and can give you as much or as little curl you may want. I like getting a nice lift and this does the trick.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t even flat iron my hair, i was shocked it was number one on amazon very disappointed with product</li>
    <li> Absolutely seamless buying experience, and really lovely product. Absolutely the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Works great! Dual voltage was wonderful during a recent trip to Europe. The glove that came with it is a bit of a waste. I threw it away. The flat iron is relatively small and easy to pack but large enough so that it takes me no more time to use this than it does to use my regular flat iron.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my flat iron for about a month now and I absolutely love it.  It easy to use and heats up quickly.  The Argan Oil is great. I have used other brands and none of them measure up to the Argan.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy or oily at all.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I have not really ended up using this much since I purchased it. The plates are just too narrow to work well with my thick, coarse, wavy/curly (Caucasian) hair. It takes a very long time to straighten my hair with this because I can only do very small sections at a time. Therefore I just don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s sad because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better designed than the old Conair plastic and ceramic straightener from c. 2004 that I was trying to replace, but the Conair model is at least twice as wide (and therefore twice as effective) as the HSI. I&#x27;d recommend you keep the size of the plates in mind when shopping for a straightener.</li>
    <li> Straightener seems great so far.  My hair is very coarse and thick, this smoothes it right out.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  All that matters</li>
    <li> First time using a flat iron, so this was an experience, especially since I have a cast on my arm for a broken wrist.  But the flat iron was easy to use and gave great results.  We&#x27;ve had so much rain &amp; humidity this summer that my normally straight hair just turns to frizz, so this purchase has been a real help.  Would definitely recommend.  (But I was a bit disappointed that the free case was a cloth pocket...I thought it would be a silicone sleeve to easily pack up a hot iron.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing straightener</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron it does a great job!</li>
    <li> Great product! Heats up fast and fits in my hand well.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron! I do wish it was a bit easier to read the temp control, but besides that I have no issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It is high quality and I like that it heats up very fast. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice design is quick to heat up and easy to use.  We appreciate the universal voltage capability as our previous flat iron did not have this.  One trip to Ireland and it died even though we had all the right adapters and converters.  The only downside is the temp dial is somewhat difficult to access.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works just as good if not better than a Chi. My Chi broke a year after I bought it, it just stopped working completely. So far the HSI is awesome! I hope it lasts longer than my old Chi.</li>
    <li> This is what my daughter wanted for Christmas. She likes it.  What more can I say.</li>
    <li> I have very think hair and it is curly I bought this flat iron because of the reviews and it works !!!! I flat iron my hair and looks amazing, I dont have a smart phone to post pictures but it works, the service was promtly I got it 2 days later after I purchase it .  it came a casewith a red oiuch and glove and a little bottle of the argan oil also came with 2 coupons to buy the full size bottles, I love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price :-) I am happy</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Remington straightener since I cut my hair and I figured a 1 inch would work better. Anyways. I&#x27;ve had this straightener in the past and then it broke so that is when I bought the Remington. But for some reason, the one they sent pulled on my hair way too much and it did not get hot very quickly. My $20 straightener works better. So I put it in for return and did not realize I had to pay for my own shipping. Shipping was almost the same price as the damn straightener. I regret trying to buy/return this thing. Waste of my money and time.</li>
    <li> I love this so much I bought one for my daughter too. Heats up fast and you can set the heat for your hair type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for the past 2 years &amp; still works - that just tells you something :)</li>
    <li> I loved it and i use it very often .</li>
    <li> Feels well-made, heats up quickly, and works well. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Gets caught on your hair.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. The product description and reviews are accurate and I love the fancy pouch it came with. I&#x27;ve used it twice and it&#x27;s gotten my hair as straight as salon blow out!</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener. It works very well. I like that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and heats fast. Only con is that there is not auto shut off if you forget to turn it off. Definitely worth the price I paid!</li>
    <li> Really nice. I also buy another for gift.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing flat iron!  I have very thick,  coarse &amp; curly hair.  I could never get it straight with other irons.  This iron gets my hair straight with one pass!  It is much cheaper than other straighteners but don&#x27;t let that fool you. It is fantastic.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I also use argan oil heat protector on my hair.  Using both my hair is super straight &amp; very shiny.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great flat iron. Only problem is the cord had burn marks, as if it had been used but it&#x27;s listed as NEW.</li>
    <li> I wish I can rate it 0 stars. Sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t want to heat up and after 5 min it will be lukewarm. Other times it will heat up but not nearly hot enough. Very rarely will it heat up to the proper temperature. The surfaces also don&#x27;t touch, propagating uneven heating and straightening.  I have a 40$ temperamental paperweight.  Waste of money, I am deeply disappointed and will avoid this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener for my wife .. it is awesome product .. I&#x27;m so satisfied with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> This is a really nice, high quality straightener. I have very thick hair, and it works really well on it, and I haven&#x27;t been seeing any frayed ends either. It heats up very fast and does a very good job...the only small issue I have with it is the size of the heating area, which isn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be, but it still works really well.</li>
    <li> I travel international for my job. Bought this to take to Germany...it worked great. Last trip I took another brand and it fizzeled out. This one did great and now use at home as well in the states. Only con is it does take a little longer to warm up. But does a great job! I would buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Delivered fast and works wonderfully! I love that I can straighten and curl my hair with it! And the oil that came with it was good also! I&#x27;m thinking about ordering more!</li>
    <li> Great product! Exactly what I wanted and received before estimated delivery date. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I took this straightener with me on a trip to Spain, and it worked perfectly with an adapter (to fit into the round-prong outlets). This was super helpful, given that my regular straightener didn&#x27;t work, even with a converter. The straightener already knows what type of outlet it&#x27; being plugged into, so you don&#x27;t need to adjust for 120V/220V. The sleeve that was included was helpful too, as I could tuck the straightener back into my suitcase without worrying about it burning anything. The only drawback is that the plates are a little small, so you can&#x27;t get a big chunk of hair in one swoop.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! I have long, very thick hair. I also did a lot of research before buying, it was between the CHI &amp; HSI  for thick hair I gotta say I&#x27;m glad I tried this brand :) &amp; also heard CHI has counter fits that are sold on Amazon just a FYI for you lady&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This flat iron is not professional grade. It pulls your hair and causes dryness. It does not glide down your hair smoothly. I would not recommend this purchase. you get the quality you paid for - cheap.</li>
    <li> When I am going to buy a product, I always make sure I do my research first. I keep careful and detailed accounts of the pros and cons of each specific product I look at, and I continue to refer to my lists until I have narrowed my choices down to what I believe to be the best products for the best value. In this case, the HSI Professional straightener won in each and every category I was researching. When the straightener came in the mail a few days after I ordered it, I was extremely excited to try it out. It came with a knit-glove, a silk carrying case, and a trial-sized bottle of argon oil - something I had never tried before, but soon fell in love with. I also was not disappointed when it came to the straightener itself. The conclusion I came to after my research rang true - this straightener worked even better than I was expecting. To be honest, I&#x27;d never used any kind of styling tool on my hair before, so I was a little nervous about using it for the first time, but those fears were unfounded. This tool could not be easier to use. It has a swivel cord, so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled up with your hands as you&#x27;re using it, which definitely cuts back on the time it takes to style your hair. The heat setting ranges from 140 degrees F to 400 degrees F, giving you control over how much heat you are applying to your hair and making this the perfect tool for all hair types. I have very long, very thick hair, so I generally turn the heat up all the way and can finish styling in about ten-fifteen minutes. You have every right to be impressed by that; I know I was. My hair has never looked better - it&#x27;s controlled, it&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s silky...I had been thinking about just chopping my hair off because of how unmanageable it had become, but thanks to my HSI I no longer have to. The plates are ceramic and do not extend, something I personally prefer, because I feel it makes it easier to style your hair when the plates don&#x27;t slide up and down as you&#x27;re working. I&#x27;m also impressed by how cool the tool stays - the handle doesn&#x27;t get hot at all. I use the glove provided on the hand that&#x27;s going to touch my hair, because for the first couple minutes after running the straighter through, your hair will maintain the temperature of the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly give this product five stars. My hair and I have no complaints.by how cool the tool stays - the handle doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.

    <li> Outstanding product. My wife love it. Once she got it, couldn&#x27;t stop using it an now is part of the family.</li>
    <li> I love the flat Iron. Even right before my hair appointments it always makes my &amp;#34;much in need&amp;#34; hair sleek, shinny and smooth. I tried several others before I found this one. It beats them all hands down.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of all the great reviews. I flat iron my hair less than four times a year. I have my hair flat ironed professionally when I get it cut and bought this to use to maintain the style for the few days after I leave the salon. This morning, I went to plug it in and there was a spark in the unit where the plastic and the plates meet. After that, the unit would not turn on. Save your money and find a better unit. Wonder how the market price could be almost two hundred dollars and it manages to sell on here for less than forty? Well, there&#x27;s your answer.</li>
    <li> I love these irons.  My hair feels and look good. Fast heat up and the oil is great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  My previous iron cost over $100 and was good, but I was truly amazed at how much better the HSI Professional iron works. It smooths very quickly and I love that it can be used in Europe also as I travel there for work. Wish I had known about this iron before I bought the previous one for $100+.</li>
    <li> Since I have naturally thick and wavy hispanic hair I am always looking for a flat iron that will completely straighten effectively. I set a budget of 90 dollars for this purchase and was pleasantly surprised at the fair price!&lt;br /&gt;  HSI has made a great product, the plates are fully ceramic, not just ceramic plated, the parts themselves have a curved edge so that you may curl your hair and not leave any creases. With thicker hair it&#x27;s nice to have a flat iron that goes up to 410° F. I have been using this product for a week now and i am completely convinced this is one the best purchases I have made concerning my hair care needs!&lt;br /&gt;  As for shipping, it was accurate and timely! Seller processed and shipped my HSI flat iron promptly and everything was as promised and was well packaged! I would definitely recommend these companies to anyone and will definitely purchase from again in the near future!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and curly, so nothing straightens it. I thought this would because of all the GREAT reviews.. Well it doesn&#x27;t. Same as always. I dont know if its just my hair or the iron but it didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> Works great. Neat little case. Was looking for something a little smaller for travel and this one wasn&#x27;t it... normal size. Otherwise, great product</li>
    <li> As I stated so far so good. I have not had the flat iron long enough to comment about its workmanship, but its working beautifully for now. The most important feature for me was the ability to adjust the temperature of the iron. My hair is dry so this feature is wonderful. But, it doesnt indicate the temperature on the dial so you have to guess the setting that is right for your hair. No big deal, just a tad annoying. Over all I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have had this flat iron for awhile. Easy to use,gets hot pretty quick. Comes with a sleeve we rarely if ever use. But is good for traveling. Also came with oil but was really small and out of it after first use. Really have had no problems with it which is great! We went thru 2 other chi irons within a couple of months before ordering this flat iron and have not had to order another it has worked great!</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic - it is so quick and easy, as I don&#x27;t have to go over the same piece multiple times. My hair looks as good as it does when I leave the salon.</li>
    <li> I love the HSI Professional Flat Iron~ it gets hot and makes my hair smoothe.. I love it better than a chi</li>
    <li> returned it, was defective...</li>
    <li> i have read some of the other reviews. the positive reviews are correct. this flat iron is great. i have thick, frizzy hair. it makes my hair smooth and shiny. i did have an issue with the product and it was taken care of quickly. i love the flat iron and would definately recommend it to anyone! it keeps the frizz out all day, even in the rain!</li>
    <li> Before I write about the product I would like to say that the Seller has been easy to work with ie., Product arrived quickly and when I wrote yesterday that I needed to return it, they immediately provided a label online. I havent actually printed the label but it seems that it will work fine.  Now for the product: The packaging was great. The product simply doesn&#x27;t work. There is no light anywhere, indicating the iron is on. Additionally it didnt get very warm and I had to mess with the dial to make sure it was on its highest but still didnt get results thus I am writing this review. I am use to the highest quality flat iron (GHD) thus I have high expectations.  I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up fast. No light to indicate its on. I&#x27;m use to using Chi flat irons so maybe I&#x27;m biased. But I didn&#x27;t care for this product.</li>
    <li> Super lite &amp; easy to use. GREAT PRICE ! Would recommend to everyone and I purchased as a gift for a friend too.</li>
    <li> Great heating, and fast.  Hate there is no auto shut off and have left it on by accident twice.  Looking for something comparable that has auto shut off feature</li>
    <li> This straightener works great when it works.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or leave it frizzy.  The problem is it shuts off before I&#x27;m done.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a product defect or if it&#x27;s on a timer or what. It&#x27;s very annoying to straighten part of my hair at one time, then it shuts off, then I have to let it cool down, plug it in again and finish straightening the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> Had CHI flat iron before - you get the same quality for half the price. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Free and fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of the different products out there many people use, like moose, sprays, etc. I recently got highlights and I noticed that my hair became rather difficult to style. It is oily at at the roots, thin and soft. I also wanted to start using flat iron. When I applied the oil, it made my hair very easy to work with and it now has a natural shine without being oily. It smells very nice and it feels comfortable.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last minute as I needed a flat iron to use in an overseas trip. It&#x27;s the best last minute decision I ever made. I looked at all the reviews and decided that I would try it. With 3 girls using the flat iron one after the other, there were no problems. I am considering picking up a second one just to have. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Heats very quickly &amp; the long cord makes it very easy to work with.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It gets hot really quickly, but I especially like that the edges of the ceramic are rounded rather than straight. The straight edged ceramics leave lines in the hair at the insertion point, whereas with this one, it&#x27;s a smooth look. The iron was not shipped in a timely manner for me to receive it in the time stated, upon my calling the iron was shipped via next day. Despite that, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron based on the reviews and its dual voltage option, but unfortunately I am going to return it. if you have thick, dry and frizzy hair don&#x27;t bother buying this straightener. It may work perfectly on thinner or less dry hair although. The highest heat setting goes up to 410F, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to produce enough heat for straightening my coarse hair. It doesn&#x27;t glide smooth over the hair and feels very dry. I guess if I put an argan oil on my hair it would&#x27;ve done a better job, but so would any other much cheaper straightener on the market. It is also kind of heavy. But again, if you don&#x27;t have frizzy, thick hair like  mine you may be very satisfied with this product. It is also has very smooth edges which allows you to curl the ends of your hair.</li>
    <li> The HSI straightener is a must have! It arrived a day ahead of schedule. The HSI straightener leaves your hair shiny and feeling silky smooth. The heat protection glove, cover to the straightener, and sample oil are an added bonus. Also, you are able to register the straightener for a one year warranty. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Hair straightener works great and has nice safety features.  Terrific value for the price.  Glad that I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I have very thick, curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough and it doesn&#x27;t grasp the hair tight enough.</li>
    <li> It works okay. It seems as if the plates aren&#x27;t very well aligned and so it doesn&#x27;t grip my hair very well. There is quite a gap actually. I also don&#x27;t like that the plug is a three prong and I can&#x27;t have it and my blow dryer plugged in at the same time. I actually wanted to return it but I waited too long.</li>
    <li> I ordered my HSI and within a week I had it. I didn&#x27;t get the oil that was supposed to come with but I ♥it!! The price is perfect, I was going to buy a CHI but decided to try this.. like why not for 40$. I am satisfied with my product overall.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Do not buy this. It doesn&#x27;t not heat up at all.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and thick application part. I did not use this product for a while and after the first time I used it, I wanted to return it but I had missed  the window. This product is heavy, the tips are way too thick and not round. They are square. How the hell do you do a round curl with that feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron as a replacement after my Croc and Chi iron broke. Great inexpensive replacement. Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> The straightener works great! I have very thick, wavy hair and with this product I was able to get it sleek and smooth in 15 minutes. It&#x27;s lightweight so my arms don&#x27;t get as tired and it has a great case taking it along with me. The long cord is also a plus! Best part was the price! Definitely a great deal!</li>
    <li> This was a great hair straightener for a great price, but it broke after 1 year.  Might spend a little more many next time and get something that will last longer.</li>
    <li> I ended up returning this, which was disappointing. After reading all the rave reviews for it, I thought it might make a good replacement for my 6 year old chi straightener, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that was not the case. The HSI took a long time to heat up (I have long, thick hair) and then as soon as I would start straightening my hair, it would have to reheat up again. So straighten one piece of hair, wait for it to heat...and repeat. Not only that, but it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair well at all. I would have to go over the same sections of hair 3-4 times. This was possibly related to the heating issue, but it was frustrating nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of trying to use it, I gave up and went back to my old chi, which straightens my hair well in less than 10 minutes. One time I even used the HSI and then followed up with the chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that my chi spoiled me; if I had been using a cheap straightener, this one would have seemed pretty great. However, since I&#x27;m used to a pretty nice straightener, this one was disappointing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to see why I ordered this straightener, fantastic reviews, great price, and the product looks great...well it&#x27;s all true. I love it! I&#x27;ve had it for a few days now, everything came just as advertised a couple days before the expected shipping date. It&#x27;s so easy to use, get&#x27;s got fast! The glove was too big for my small hands but I probably wouldn&#x27;t bother with it anyway. I havent used the oil yet, but I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed. the straightener works great, curls amazingly, works great on bangs, works just as well as the professional salon straighteners. 100% satisfied with this product!!!</li>
    <li> While the straightener works very smoothly, in order to straighten my thick, curly hair I had to turn up the heat level to maximum to get it to work for me.  It heats up quickly and while the first one I recieved was making a strange electrical, buzzing kind of noise that was worrisome while I was using it on the highest heat setting, the customer service person contacted me immediately and sent another one that works perfectly with no problem at all.  The free oil is a wonderful bonus, as is the wonderful thick, luxurious carrying pouch it provides.  I would highly recommend this product based on their excellent customer service alone!</li>
    <li> Lightweight product doesn&#x27;t tire your hand to hold or use. The adjustable heat setting allowed me to manage the heat so it wasn&#x27;t too hot but hot enough to do the job without cooking my hair. Hair glides smoothly through the two plates. The cord is long enough to not need an extension cord. Comes with a handy storage pouch that holds the tool and cord. Took only a few minutes to complete my whole head of hair and, with the argan oil included with the tool, my hair was shiny and smooth and straight--and stated that way, with NO frizz--until I shampooed it again.</li>
    <li> As soon as I got this I decided to try it out. It heated up within a minute. After using it on a section of hair, my hair was very smooth and straight. I also decided to try and curl with it. It made a very nice curl. I am glad I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I had previously had (and burned out on international trip) a much more expensive flat iron.  Have also owned and tossed cheaper ones that didn&#x27;t really do the job.  This combined both features - inexpensive yet VERY effective!</li>
    <li> The professional HSI 1 ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener that I  ordered and received its absolutely wonderful. I replaced a perfectly good, functioning flat iron with this new one and cannot believe the superior performance I now enjoy. This iron works more quickly and with the free sample of Argain Oil, leaves my hair beautifully straight and shining. The oil keeps working until shampooed out, making daily grooming quick and so easy. What a great find!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair and have been straightening it for 3 years now. I had a chi but it died so I searched on Amazon for a replacement and saw the good reviews for this one and ordered it. I&#x27;ll probably keep this as a \\&quot;back up\\&quot; but need to order something better at holding it&#x27;s heat because it takes so long to heat up and then after a pass through my hair it needs to heat up again. I section my hair when I iron it so it&#x27;s not going through a ton of hair but it loses it&#x27;s heat right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;In expensive&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all (my old Chi used to sometimes snag a strand of hair)&lt;br /&gt;Temperature control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not maintain heat&lt;br /&gt;Cools off too fast&lt;br /&gt;Takes a really long time to warm up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin-ish hair with a gentle wave, this may work for you but if you have thick wavy/curly hair this is not your best bet as it takes way too long to heat up and heat back up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and it leaves smooth and shiny. Its better than my Chi flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great iron for the price. Would recommend to a friend. Bought this one for my sister. I liked the iron</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for xmas and she loves it.... great price for a great product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister this past Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  She&#x27;s told me that it straightens so well that it last for days.  It also heats up for quickly so you can get it done fast!</li>
    <li> My grand daughter and her friends love this flat iron very much.  She has several but this is her favorite.  Thank you very much.  It got here fast and the price was fair.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever used! I was a bit skeptical because I was a previous Chi owner, but this one far exceeded my expectations!! My hair is naturally curly and super thick and this definitely gets the job done! I convinced my brother to get one for his wife for her birthday and she fell in love as well! Recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> great item for price. works as well as the other big brand. nice long cord, fast heat up time. no complaints here.</li>
    <li> I loved the iron for two months but then right before a really big party, it stopped working! very disappointed :( Waste of money.</li>
    <li> My original purchase I gave the product an unfavorable review, but the company Blue Novelties contacted me immediately and offered to send me a new one, as the one I received must have been defective.  I accepted their offer.  I very quickly got a new one and it is better, still have to let it heat up mid hair fix, but it only takes a second or two to reheat, just enough time to brush teeth and resume hair styling.  I am most impressed with the company seeking me out to make this right.  I would definitely recommend this product and especially the company, Blue Novelties.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Leah Liedke</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the HSI ceramic Tourmaline ionic.  It works well in straightening my curly hair.  I will experiment more with it as I use it more.</li>
    <li> Very well made and love the different heat settings to try.  The glove and cloth to store when not in use is an added plus along with the sample Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment. So glad I chose this one</li>
    <li> I was very excited to have received the my HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron! After reading the reviews I was expecting it to be a quality product with quality results and I&#x27;m very happy to say I was not disappointed! This product is great! I have natural kinky hair and used the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Flat Iron along with the sample of Argan Oil Leave in Treatment sample that was provided and was very pleased with the results. I have never used a flat iron before and my first try was a little awkward. After the second time of using the product I was straitening and curling like a pro! Even my ends were sleek! So far there are pluses across the board on the features that have been highlighted in the product description.  I love the Argan Oil Leave in Treatment also. It compliments the flat iron well.  Great, Great product!!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever had.  I am now ordering one for my daughter!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I probably just got used to the way my old straightener curled but I think what makes the difference is that it doesn&#x27;t open very wide.  I also don&#x27;t like that there is no auto shut off or cool down, i get mini panic attacks throughout the day not remembering if i turned it offf.</li>
    <li> I honestly feel that I made the best decision for myself and for my hair! This flat iron works wonders! And is the best that I have used and I have used a lot of flat irons in the past. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this!! The customer service was awesome! &amp; the delivery was very fast! I am really impressed! :-)</li>
    <li> I am glad I bought this product it is really working out for me I did my granddaughter hair and it came out like silk thanks again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product so far. It arrived very protected in it&#x27;s package and is exactly what I was expecting. Thanks for the great service!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, smooths my thick coarse hair easily!&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable value!!</li>
    <li> I have loved this straightener for about 1 1/2 years, but over the last few months have had to turn down the temp setting as it was getting too hot.  Then it started tripping the reset button on the plug and buzzing really loud.  It was getting really hot and my hair stylist suggested I don&#x27;t use it anymore as it might fry my hair.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL be buying another HSI since I did love it!!  My friend has had one for 3 years with no problem.</li>
    <li> I have a Chi and thought, because this has a high temperature option it would work better but it doesn&#x27;t.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I have used it for about a week &amp; I like it very much. It was not hard to get used to using even though I had always used a curling iron. It makes my hair look much nicer than the curling iron did. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron it get really hot .. One of the best I have had .. Works great will order another product soon.</li>
    <li> It has turned out to be a great iron for the price. For some reason I thought I was getting an iron with an LED/LCD screen, but it&#x27;s probably purchaser&#x27;s error for not reading through the product description well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came when it was supposed to, unlike my Prime Pantry order, which got all the way to my city and was sent back because it was thrashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good quality, gets hot. Placement of the on/off switch is annoying, but I can live with it. Enjoy that it has a reset button at the plug in. The &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; we&#x27;re a plus too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great experience with this vendor. Would use again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I choose this rating good quality and great on my hair. I gladly appreciate doing business this was a wise choice for me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> Flat iron works great. Good price. The only drawback is that it does not shut off automatically, which is sometimes a problem for me. Other than that, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> GREAT!  My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality flatiron. Gets really hot and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I just got my straightener and I absolutely love it! It makes my hair so soft and heats up fast! It makes my hair smooth and  my hair stays straight for days! So worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best hair straightner! If you want salon  experience at home this is the one! So happy with purchase :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it and my hair stays straight for days after I straightened it.  Also, leaves my hair shiny and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed, nothing more nothing less. Price was great! I don&#x27;t use the glove, but some may think it is useful</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough to remove the curl and frizz from my hair. Returning it and buying a Croc.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It works as good as the one my stylist uses.  Love it so much.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the HSI Pro ceramic flat iron for about a month and I am very pleased with it.  It heats quickly and straightens my hair with one application to each section,  The ordering and receiving process was smooth, and the item arrived  in a timely manner.I have found nothing to be dissatisfied about with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> My hair is super curly and I bought this flat iron and I love it. My hair looks so straight when I used.</li>
    <li> My hair smelled like metal after straightening.  Adjusting heat didn&#x27;t help as then it didn&#x27;t really straighten very well.  I also own a Chi that I love, but doesn&#x27;t have international 240v conversion, so for travelling abroad this will do:)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife because she needed a hair iron that was dual voltage because we do travel overseas often. She loves it and stated it was a very well deaigned hair iron and the glove as a great addition so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally burning your hand. Overall an excellent hair iron.</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy hair, and before getting this straightening iron I had a $30 conair that worked well(it just stopped heating up on me one day so that&#x27;s why I bought this).&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work just as good as the conair if not better(I&#x27;m hoping). I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and it does a good job. I never used any of the much more expensive irons so I can&#x27;t compare to them.  I put the temp up at either 410 or the highest, 450, and using the included glove(which is a nice addition-so you don&#x27;t burn your hand!) it takes me about 20mins. or so to straighten all of my hair. I do have to go over some areas a couple times, but I figured that was normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the buttons being on the inside of the iron, as some other reviewers mentioned, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal as you just hit it once when you turn it on and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> In LOVE! Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Great item!! So happy with the acquisition!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this item. This is my 2nd one. My first one went out due to wrapping the cord. Would love a better explanation on how to store. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product the only downfall is that it does not have an automatic shutoff and it gets really hot!</li>
    <li> I had been using previously a Chi straightener and it had broke over time.&lt;br /&gt;I would get this straightener over the Chi anytime. Great hair dos and does it the job quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener that I have ever come across. It makes my hair look so pretty and shiny. And I love that you can straighten or curl your hair with it. I will always own one!</li>
    <li> Believe the ratings. This straightener is as described. Top shelf and better than products I&#x27;ve purchased before. Even my wildest frizz is tamed with this.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. I have thick, wavy hair and have a difficult time straightening my hair within a reasonable time. I have tried many different brands and types of straighteners. This one works so smooth, couple passes and my hair looks perfect.😀 I will for sure be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> I really love this flatiron! It works on my thick polynesian hair. I have been trying to look one that would work on my hair and now I found it.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this given the great reviews. When my product arrived the box was open and the hair oil was missing. Not sure it is better than my $20 hot tools straightener. Jury is still out on whether I will keep or return this item.</li>
    <li> I brought this after my ConAir straightener disappeared. I was looking at best flat irons I came across this one. I was amazed it was less expensive because it was a older model. I brought it after all the good reviews. It worked perfectly. It heats up fast. Comes with the Argan Oil, glove and pouch. It makes my hair feel perfectly smooth and shiny. No snags like my old flat iron. I have frizzy wavy hair and it works better than my old flat iron. It even last more than one day. I would recommend to anyone who wants a amazing flat iron on a budget.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase! Works much better than my previous flat iron. Long cord, fast heat up, arrived much faster than I anticipated. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair look sleek and shiny.</li>
    <li> Heated up slowly, but overall a good product.</li>
    <li> glossy straight hair. gets hot really fast.</li>
    <li> My daughter says this is a quality product and she is happy with her purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this iron, having great results on my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this iron with high hopes. Well, I can definitely say it was a smart purchase!  I love this flatiron! It gets hot very fast and it straightens my natural hair very well. AND, the price was right!</li>
    <li> I liked my last one a little better but at close to $200 it only lasted a year. It was not a very good value. This one is a great value even if it only lasts a year.</li>
    <li> My mother had this on her Christmas Wish List on Amazon.  She was really excited to get this product.  So far she has had no complaints with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this iron for a week now and I love it! I have thick, medium curly hair and I find it works great! I don&#x27;t notice any of the hair pulling issues mentioned in other reviews when I&#x27;m using a thick enough section of hair. I have noticed some pulling if the section of hair I&#x27;m working with is thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say about this product is other irons I&#x27;ve used allow you to set the temperature of the iron by degree. The temperature setting on this iron is a turn knob so it took me some time to figure out the right temp setting for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it... it heats up quickly.. Straighten hair beautifully&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Easy to store&lt;br /&gt;smooths hair out, gets the frizz out</li>
    <li> All I can say, is WHY did I wait so long to buy this?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wild, curly hair, along with extensions for length, and this straightener fixes my &#x27;80&#x27;s party hair every morning into something sleek and tamed.  Without this straightener, I&#x27;d be a total &#x27;80&#x27;s throwback, unintentionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I need to buy two more of these so my daughter&#x27;s stop stealing it out of my bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The glove is awesome for those of us with two left feet..err...hands.  And the oil included was a bonus, it&#x27;s an oil I already use and love.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is TOTALLY worth the price, BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> My wife had an expensive Paul Mitchell flat iron that she complained about since she began using it. FINALLY about a month before Christmas it died. Saw this HSI flat iron on Amazon for much cheaper than the HSI sites. Bought it my wife LOVES IT! Says it is much better than her other one ever was. You definitely need to purchase this iron,I did and I&#x27;m still opening my gifts lol.</li>
    <li> For the price it works well, but I have very thick hair so it takes quite a few passes to get flat.</li>
    <li> So far works great. Definitely worth the money. As good or better than the Chi. 1/4 of the price. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Its is very good and My hair looks naturally straight.The temperature adjustment is good and it allows to use the reqired heat.The only thing one star is reduced is sometimes the end of iron gets stuck in my hair.Otherwise for first time buyers it is very good and the argon oil free is bonus makes ur hair shine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, gets nice and hot, leaves my hair gorgeous! Works best with &amp;#34;Straight and Sexy Balm&amp;#34;. I have thin fine natural hair and thick frizzy extensions and it treats both very nice. I recommend it, especially for the awesome price! Also, the product came packaged very nicely and assured me I was getting a good product!</li>
    <li> This is what I need to fix my hair.  It is easy to use and very light.  The result is a professional looking hair!  I love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I dropped my Solia Flat Iron and broke one of the plates, I&#x27;ve owned the Solia one for almost 10 years. I used this HSI flat iron for 6 months and I prefer my old Solia much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HSI flat iron&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up faster&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;High temperature setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair frizzier&lt;br /&gt;Feels like it&#x27;s damaging my hair more, even though Solia goes up to 450° as HSI goes up to 410°</li>
    <li> Great product.  Heats up very quickly which is a great feature.  Great product at a good price and nice travel pouch</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter - Sh has long thick hair and this flat iron works great for her hair. She has had not issues and said it works better than her other iron.  I am very happy with the purchase and the price was fantastic compared to so many other flat irons out there.</li>
    <li> After tried many flat iron, finally I fund one perfect for my hair, light weight, warm up quickly, easy to carry in your purse. Professional quality great price</li>
    <li> This iron works GREAT, and I have purchased three now...BUT but they seem to have a more limited lifespan...one stopped working randomly after 1 month of use, the most recent one one of the ceramic plates detached with very minimal trauma.   I think this works better than my Chi/comparably (very easy to curl hair with this iron) but I had my Chi for about 6 years before it needed replacement...</li>
    <li> The straightener works incredibly well and heats up quickly. It also stays warm while you are using it--something other straighteners I&#x27;ve used have failed to do. I absolutely love the swivel cord as well. It arrived soon after ordering it and came in perfect condition. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> This is my very first flat iron, but I am SO VERY impressed! It did a great job with my hair. I don&#x27;t have naturally curly hair, just a little wave.  However, I wanted to plan ahead, as I anticipate getting a perm soon.  From what I&#x27;ve experienced so far, it will work wonders at giving me more options once I take the perm plunge, and WITHOUT standing in front of the mirror for half the day!! Way to go HSI, affordable and efficient hair care!</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I had a gift card for amazon, so my price range was limited , but this transaction was great. I got my order quickly, and I have very straight hair. Great first iron, so far.</li>
    <li> I had a flatiron for almost seven years that I loved, so I decided to go with the same company. I was completely disappointed. I was nervous to venture outside to a company I&#x27;ve never had before, but I did my research and decided I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the price of this one, and the amazing reviews. Did not disappoint! To give a clear review, I should list my hair type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally straight, decently thick hair. I use a flat iron to make it pin straight, and to get the puffiness out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener has temperature control, which is great. It&#x27;s pretty heavy duty. I only have to go over a chunk of hair once and it&#x27;s super straight.  It heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 4 stars: It doesn&#x27;t make my hair as silky as my last straightener, and I find that the ends of my hair get a bit of static from it.  When I&#x27;m straightening my hair with it, it makes it feel like my hair is really dry; it doesn&#x27;t feel smooth when it goes through it, which is probably why I get a bit of static-y hair after. It does NOT pull my hair though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it really does get thr job done. Extremely straight hair, and it lasts all day, which is a big pro!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT, IT IS EASY TO USE AND WORKS GREAT ON YOUR HAIR.  I AM AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HAVE THICK HAIR SO IT USUALLY TAKES A LONG TIME TO STYLE OR STRAIGHTEN WITH THIS IRON IT CUTS THE TIME IN HALF.</li>
    <li> This would be the second hair straightener I have owned, the first got two uses, and then found the trash, because it fried my hair, tangled in my hair, and earned a well deserved trip to the dump. This one is fantastic! It reaches high enough temperatures to actually work with my naturally curly hair, it overcomes the frizzies, rarely needs a lot of leave in treatment to keep the straighten, and hasn&#x27;t burned my hair yet. It works like a charm!</li>
    <li> It works, but not a $199 iron - only worth $39.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife had an expensive iron to compare this too.  She got this as was hoping that it would compare considering how the normal price is $199.  It doesn&#x27;t.  There&#x27;s no auto-shut-off feature.  The build quality is noticeably worse (but not terrible).  Also, her hair catches in it.  You get what you pay for.  Worth $39, but not more.</li>
    <li> I just received this flat iron the other day and wanted to try it out right away. I bought it after I had searched on the internet for the best priced iron with one of the highest ratings here on Amazon. I tried it and I am so pleased with the results! I love the sample of serum they added with it! I have very thick, wavy, and unmanageable hair, so I was a bit skeptical before buying this product. But I&#x27;m sure glad I spent the $45 for it. I haven&#x27;t heard of this brand before, but I will continue buying any other hair products they sell.</li>
    <li> This item showed up on time and in great condition. It is by far the best hot iron I&#x27;ve ever owned- it heats up and cools off in less than a minute!</li>
    <li> I am new to hair straightening and but I have always heard about the CHI. I didn&#x27;t really want to spend that much $ on something that I didn&#x27;t know if I liked it. This is the economical way to do without sacrificing the quality. I use it with the Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray. My husband loves my new hair as well as my 6 year old son. I get compliments all the time about my hair on how shiny it is and how healthy it looks.  It came with the oil and the glove so I don&#x27;t burn my hand with hot hair.  *****This is a must buy if you are considering a flat iron*****</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener I have ever used. It heats up in about 30 seconds and straightens really quickly.</li>
    <li> I like the flat iron they work great on my hair. Even though my hair is nature, mean no chemicals. I was a disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive my travel size Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> The straightener leaves your hair really straight and smooth as if you just came out of the hair salon.  Receive compliments more than once and has been asked if I got my hair done!</li>
    <li> I bought this HSI Flatiron because my Chi of ten years died. I was worried about whether or not it would live up to the Chi standard and it does. It came with a nice carry bag, a heat glove and hair oil. Pretty great stuff. Really good deal for the price. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron to replace one that was broken. Received it quickly and used it the same day. Excellent product and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I thought about investing in a new hair straightener for awhile now as my old ceramic one never really cut it for me.  I have long, partly curly partly wavy hair and always found that it took way too long to actually straighten my hair to the point of it actually looking straight (and staying that way) and would only pull out the straightener for special occasions.  My sisters have always purchased CHI straighteners, but they were too expensive for my to justify (well over $100) and they have gone through multiple straighteners in the last few years.  After reading the reviews on this, I decided to try it since it was reasonably priced.  This straightener works fantastic!  I can fully straighten my hair in about 10 minutes and it maintains its smooth, silky straightness for the whole day!  It works much better than the CHI and I would highly recommend it.  Best hair straightener on the market!</li>
    <li> I have a Chi and I couldn&#x27;t help but grab a great bargin and try this out.  IT IS AMAZING!!  I literally feels like it softens my hair, it gives it a smoothness I haven&#x27;t got with any other flat iron. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old flat iron and I really love this one. It does not heat up as fast as my old one but that&#x27;s not really a big deal since I always turn it on before I start to dry my hair with the hair dryer and by the time I finish is just right. The Argain Oil is AMAZING, I&#x27;ve been needing a haircut because I had some split-ends and my hair just needed a trim. I haven&#x27;t had time to go get it cut but the first day I used the flat iron and Argain Oil several people (including my husband) kept telling me how healthy my hair seemed now that I got my hair cut, I loved telling them I had not cut my hair and it was just my new flat iron and AWESOME oil treatment. It makes my hair so smooth, is amazing. I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just got this for my birthday. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I like it. I like that is has a heat dial.</li>
    <li> I originally gave this product 4 stars only because I did not receive the trial size argan oil but soon after I wrote the review the seller contacted me and said that they would ship it out and they did. The flat irons are more than worth the price and the customer service was excellent!  I&#x27;m happy :-)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a professional iron that would really straighten my very curly hair.  I have found it.  HSI does it.  This morning I let my hair go curly until it was completely dry, then straightened it.  After I was done, I didn&#x27;t look like the same person that I started out as!!  Curly to Straight, love it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron went above and beyond my expectations! It is hands down the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever owned. Quick heat up, reaches hot temps for flawless straightening and a solid luxury product! Look no further</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, heats up quickly, and easy to keep clean. Very happy with this purchase, especially since there were more expensive options that did not have as good as reviews.</li>
    <li> It looks as if if all of us who have recently purchased this item have been getting a defective one.  I&#x27;ve used almost every flat iron out there ranging from inexpensive to extremely expensive.  The Chi has been my choice for years.  This one came nicely packaged, but the iron was awful.  The material over the plates was peeling off, took a long time to heat up, snagged my hair, didn&#x27;t straighten well, and heavy and uncomfortable.  My $20 Conair worked better.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron as it is everything that it promised in the advertisement.  It was delivered promptly and it is beautifully packaged.  The product is very smooth on the hair and leaves the hair with a silky feel to it.  I have not tried the Argon oil yet as I wanted to try one thing at a time.  So I still am using my regular hair hair products with my new flat iron.  I find the flat iron very easy too handle and maniuplate on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and needed a new iron for work so I started scouring sites looking for the best product at the best price. I hadn&#x27;t ever heard of this brand before, but the reviews were pretty good, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I was a little confused about the light on the iron. It goes from red to green, and I figured when it turns green, that means the iron is heated to temp; except after it turns green it goes back to red even if I haven&#x27;t used it. I couldn&#x27;t find any info on the light in the manual. However, the iron seems to stay hot, whether red or green, so I quit worrying about it. It&#x27;s also a little too thick for my preference, and heavier than what I used before. But as far as straightening ability, it&#x27;s fantastic! It glides smoothly and doesn&#x27;t drag or pull the hair, and leaves hair silky smooth with one pass. So far it&#x27;s been a great iron and well worth the $40 I paid.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item based on other reviews, however the straightener made my hair feel very dry. Additionally it is much heavier and thicker than other brands out there.</li>
    <li> This is only my second flat iron I have ever owned, but I really love it! I have short hair only a little past my ears so I really only use it on the sides, but it does a great job in straightening it!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice flatiron, works very well and does seem to be professional quality. I am not at all disappointed and would buy it all over again.  The iron is sturdy, has a good length cord with a swivel, which is a must.  It heats up very quickly and to a maximum intense heat although the heat is adjustable.  I like that the power light changes from red to green once it has heated up and is ready.  Very nice product and the protective sleeve is pretty nice too!</li>
    <li> First of all that little sample pack of argan oil isn&#x27;t even for one use (maybe half), in the pics they showed that you were going to receive a small sample bottle.... I got a packet. Secondly my flat iron was scratched all over and doesn&#x27;t even look new, not to mention the ceramic plates are all shaky and not in tact. I gave this 2 stars because I tried straightening my bangs and it actually did an okay job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed in that argan oil though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update when I do all my hair.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and uses it not only to straighten but curl. It is made very well. Seems sturdy and for my sake hopefully it will last forever..   If you need a straightener, get this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron as a x-mas gift for my girlfriend. She has used a couple of different flat irons and could never find one that she liked. She says this is the best flat iron she has ever used. It came with a glove that you can use so that you don&#x27;t burn your hand and she loves the Argain oil. Thanks HSI for making me look like a shopping expert in my girlfriend&#x27;s eyes. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best flat iron I have ever had. First of all, I have thick and really coarse hair, so I need a certain straightener to do the job. This is the one, It also comes with some great argon oil that makes your hair shiny and soft. When you pick up the flat iron, you can just tell it&#x27;s a professional flat iron. Usually it would take me two hours to straighten my hair and after a couple of hours, it would always become wavy. Now, I can straighten my hair with this flat iron in 15 minutes and it&#x27;ll last me throughout the whole day. Even in the summer when I sweat, it still looks perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone. For the price, it&#x27;s a bargain, why would you buy a $100 straightener when you can just buy this and it works just as well?</li>
    <li> the ceramic iron works wonders on my natural curly hair, it leaves it much softer then my old iron i used, and the oil helps to keep my hair in tip top shape. thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas! She absolutely loves it!! Now looking at buying one for myself! Shipment was fast and efficient, and great customer service.</li>
    <li> You are never quite sure about the product quality or the service you&#x27;ll get when buying on-line.  Confidence and great value is what I received with this product and seller.  I can already tell it is highly durable, perfect heat, great surface for the hair, and came with a few more amenities than mentioned in the add.  It also came sooner than promised.  Repeat business for this seller is a given.</li>
    <li> A nice professional iron straighter. Buy it and your hair will appreciate it. Used it a few times and no problems o far.love it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and purchased this flat iron because of the high ratings.  I didn&#x27;t see the same results, and found this flat iron didn&#x27;t even straighten my hair.  It is not for every hair type, and didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought the hair sraightener for daughter-in-lalaw...she is very happy with it it works as promised in the product description. If she is happy, I am happy.</li>
    <li> This straightener was for my daughter.  She previously owned a Chi straightener, which also is a quality product.  My daughter really likes this new straightener and it even came with a glove and some special hair treatment oil.  The product was also shipped very quickly!  Very happy with this seller and the exceptional value of this product.</li>
    <li> works great on my hair.  I can get done faster and don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron.  Love the product</li>
    <li> I used to own a CHI and many other drug store irons.  This is my second favorite after the CHI.  It is of course much affordable than CHI, so if you are looking for better than drug store quality and a bargain deal, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not impressed,  I have at the highest setting, and it seems to vary how hot it gets each time I use - plus, my hair stylist says it&#x27;s maximum heat isn&#x27;t high enough</li>
    <li> This flat iron looks like a very well made iron....the issue that I&#x27;m having with it is that it&#x27;s snagging my hair with each pass.  I wish I could figure out a way to avoid this....but it&#x27;s a constant ouch and a hair comes out.  I love the glove that comes with it to protect my hand, and the argan oil is nice.  Please help if you know of a way to avoid the hair getting caught in the plate!  Otherwise, am thinking of returning it or giving it away:(</li>
    <li> Heats up fast , not too hot when left on high&lt;br /&gt;small great for traveling I wish it had an auto shut off</li>
    <li> This is a nice straightener and works better than most store bought straighteners. However, those that claim it is better than the Chi probably haven&#x27;t used a real Chi. It gets very hot and works fast on my thick/curly hair, however it feels like it catches unless I use the oil product that it came with. When I use the oil it works like a dream!</li>
    <li> Did not hold heat.  I would have to straighten the same strand of hair multiple times, often having to wait for it to reheat to the desired temperature again and again.  Threw it away the next day, then went down to the local beauty salon to purchase a good quality straightener that worked. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  Excellent heat &amp; quickly straightens!!  I have very thick, very curly naturally curly hair, long hair &amp; it took no time to straighten.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!! I bought another very pricey brand years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to achieve that professional look.  This flat iron is a great product, and my hair looks beautiful, if I must say so myself:)</li>
    <li> The straightener works amazingly! It heats up really fast and can manage my unruly hair. Overall a great buy. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! Works great for me.  Also, I am very happy with how fast I received it.</li>
    <li> it takes too long to heat, and pulls my hair. definitely not a good buy for the price. it is overpriced</li>
    <li> My daughter just graduated from a very well known beauty school and as she attended she received the very best equipment, i.e. brushes, curling irons, straightners, blow dryer. This Flat Iron is even better than hers. It heats up within 60 seconds, for those in a hurry. And the way it straightens it uncomparable! WE recommend it for anyone who demands the best.</li>
    <li> After finally deciding to buy my first flat iron, I went to Amazon and found this one which had more than 500 reviews. 400 of them were either 4 or 5 stars so I took the plunge and ordered it. It came very well packed with a heat resistant glove and a small bottle of the Argan oil. The flat iron worked extremely well, the plates were smooth, heating up and straightening my thick hair without burning or singeing it in any way. It seems comparable with some of the more expensive irons in quality. I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet but I did use the Argan oil and it made my hair extremely soft, non-greasy, bouncy, and shiny. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the iron or the oil, but both products were wonderful. They also arrived on time so if you are debating on ordering it, I would highly recommend that you do.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron that I have purchased that makes my hair nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The iron is easy to operate, but it does get very hot.  My next purchase is going to be the stand for the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;The last iron I purchased was very expensive and is not as good as this flat iron.  I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This HSI hair straightener heats up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use.  It does a great job straightening my medium, somewhat curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it came with a nice storage pouch too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work so well for naturally curly hair. I will pay more next time for another Paul Mitchell flat iron.</li>
    <li> Works great, I read a bunch of reviews before choosing this iron and I honestly say it works wonderful and I love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It arrived very quickly and as stated in the description. It heats up fast and gives great results. The aragn oil is also an awesome product. Very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  It&#x27;s easy to hold and handle, heats up quickly, and smoothly glides through my hair without and hang-ups or funky bends when using it to straighten or curl my hair.  Unlike many cheap flat irons the ceramic edge is ever so slightly tucked into the unit which really helps to prevent finger burns when handling the unit.  My sacrificial left hand will be eternally grateful.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Exactly what was listed. Great quality and works amazing.  I love the travel bag that comes with it and the glove...no more burning my hands when I straighten!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener for someone who already has straight hair (I use it for kinks and getting some waves). It&#x27;s no Chi, but for the price, it was exactly what I needed. I really like the little pouch it comes in too - i travel a lot and I feel better about packing it like this!</li>
    <li> when i first received this flat iron, i liked it. I have been using it for a few months, but over the course of owning it, it has gradually started working less and less well. it used to make my hair flat and shiny, but now it just makes it look dry and frizzy (i use moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and heat protectant, when i use other flat irons this doesn&#x27;t happen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the other day i turned it on, and noticed one of the &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; plates cracked had right down the middle, and i am not sure why considering i&#x27;ve never dropped it and it always just sits on my desk. :(</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the HS1 straightener.  It lives up to the promise of the high heat and the smooth tourmaline plates.  I had a flat iron prior to this, that was a good iron, lasted about 3 years and I guess I dropped it a few times too many, and I paid over $100 for it, but this one for approx $50 is so much better, and the Argan oil is great.  I had never heard of the Argan oil before this.  Even without the oil though, you get straight, smooth hair, with no frizziness or flyaways.</li>
    <li> Sadl to say but I am very disappinted in this product the flat iron doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  I had one before and loved it, but this one, not at all! Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I sent to my teenage daughter in Palestine and she loves it, I am so glad I purchased this for her.</li>
    <li> Great product very high quality works even better then described comes in a nice box and bag to store it in when not in use and once it cools back down great for travel. I use it to straighten my voted along with some goop to keep the hair most so it doesn&#x27;t break. Product arrived fast and in great condition, would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Purchased 3.  my daughters and I love them</li>
    <li> First time I used it, I hated it! Now I use it every day! It makes my hair look so soft and silky! Good buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Chi brand in the past, and this one seems just as good; I love the ceramic plates; they make my hair so soft!  Thankful to get a good straightener at such a price.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and does great at straightening! No breakage on my hair!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome flat iron, especially for the price.  It also works very well to curl my hair.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Works fabulously. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> So far my daughter has raved about the product.  Much better cost than other &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> This does a great job. Gets hot but doesn&#x27;t leave a burning smell on your hair. I love it</li>
    <li> It pulls your hair out...it also doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair well. Ends up Frizzy! Overall...don&#x27;t buy...get a GHD...such a better straighter!</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a better hair straightener than the one I own which is a Remington product. Sadly, this was pretty similar in its performance to the one I own. I guess if I want to see dramatic results, I have to invest at least $100.</li>
    <li> I used the flat iron wtith the Argan oil for the first time and I love the results.  My hair is smooth and has a silky feel.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> Love it! Couldn&#x27;t be happier! Never expected a flat iron could also curl! The temperature range is good &amp; the iron heats immediately. My hair stylist said I need to keep it at low temp and to move hair through iron fairly quickly (i.e., not hold hair as I would a curling iron, e.g.) to prevent (further) damage to my hair, particularly the ends (I went too long w/o a cut, so my ends are fairly brittle). I can&#x27;t believe how well this iron works styling my hair, even following her instruction; I was always under the impression that irons only work best if hot and you have to hold them in place for more than a second. Two other &amp;#34;Likes&amp;#34;: (1) The price point, and (2) the textured grip that feels good and doesn&#x27;t get hot. I&#x27;ve had other flat irons that I&#x27;ve tossed or donated, but this one I&#x27;m gonna hold on to. Excellent product - and purchase! ;)</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this flat iron works pretty well on it, although I have to use the highest temperature for my hair. Other irons in the past I wouldn&#x27;t have to use the maximum heat, but this one I have to. But for $40 it&#x27;s a pretty good deal! Let&#x27;s see how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and I love this flat iron. It heats up quickly and works great. I highly recommend this flat iron and believe me I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this flat iron. It makes my hair pin straight shiney and leaves it bouncy. Oh yeah it also make my weaves look brand new lol</li>
    <li> replaces a royale, bought at the mall, and broken when the plate chipped after falling on my bathroom floor.  This is a very good ionic flat iron.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> It is doing great. It is so much hotter than my last one so this is a win in my book</li>
    <li> I bought this item for me, because my previous flat iron just died, and I love it so much, that I bought a second one for my mom. This iron makes miracle with my hair, and also reduce the frizz a lot. A few things that I don&#x27;t like that much about this iron is that is does not have an automatic turn off feature ( so you have to be very careful) and somethings the hair get stuck between the iron (very rarely). The price is wonderful and worth every cent spend. If you are looking for a good iron at a nice price, this is a perfect choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say for the price this iron works great but I have definitely used better irons in the past.  It straightens the hair fairly well but doesn&#x27;t go down as soft as some of the more expensive ones out there.  But again can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this HSI straightener.  It&#x27;s easy to handle, and straightens my hair quickly.  I have wavy and unruly hair.  I also travel overseas a lot and desperately need the double voltage feature.  It is not too bulky and comes with a pouch.  If you are a traveler, I think you will find this product very useful.</li>
    <li> Okay so I deleted what I first wrote, unfortunately I judged a book by its cover. It&#x27;s 100xs better than the one I&#x27;ve purchased at the mall for triple the price. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I didn&#x27;t have to pass the iron a million times. Nor did I have to put anything in my hair to help with frizz. I have thick wavy/ curly hair so it gets serious when it&#x27;s time to straighten ! I recommend this iron especially for the price 👌</li>
    <li> Crappy, gets hot enough to but doesn&#x27;t straighten really!! Good to leave at work or friends or family&#x27;s house but not to straighten a full head of thick hair like my mine, even while splitting it into pieces</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I knew the price was to good to be true it came broken. Threw it away not paying to send it back.. I&#x27;m not impressed with amazon at the moment went to target and bought a Chi which I should have done in the first place. You pay what you get for!</li>
    <li> First off, I love this flat iron, it is great but that is what I have come to expect with anything endorsed by Amazon. The item also arrived on time and there were no hitches what so ever. I would certainly recommend this flat iron and supplier to friends.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine hair. On my old straightener, it would take about 40 minutes to do the job but on this iron, it&#x27;s a little over 20 mins. Love it; just what I needed!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t glide quite as smoothly over my hair as I&#x27;d hoped.  Its also a bit bulky and heavy.  Overall it works okay.  Decent product for the price.</li>
    <li> I am not as impressed with this flatiron as I thought I would be based on the other reviews.  I have very thick hair and I find that it doesn&#x27;t get it as straight as I would like.  It is rather bulky to hold and the cord is kind of cumbersome.  It also has a very large plugin.  My sister uses a hot tools straightener which I have borrowed on several trips and I prefer it to this.  For the price I will keep it, but I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> It is great for straightening my hair. I like to use a flat iron to curl my hair and make waves, and it is not as great. It</li>
    <li> Works great!  Super high quality iron at a great price.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast. Love the results.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural and its been bleached and dyed multiple times and I still have to use the highest heat setting to get it to straighten all the way and if I use anything lower it still comes out supper fluffy</li>
    <li> Good straightner. I have been using it for a week daily and has not left my hair fried. I like the fact that I can adjust the temp. The oil is great too!</li>
    <li> First time using this HSI brand and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, but it does the same that the ones you get at walmart. I couldn&#x27;t use the glove because it was way too big but the argan oil and the glove were a bonus</li>
    <li> Works great, I love it!</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for a at least 3 years and I thought it broke so immediately ordered a new one. I then realized it was not broke but it had been turned off (silly I know). Regardless, I am happy that I will have enough flat irons to last my hair for the next 5 years. I love it and feel like it give me hair an awesome glow. I have an African-American female with medium length, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Works great and great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent straightner!</li>
    <li> Loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;Before this straightener, I bought a CHI but I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Not only was it more expensive but it left my hair looking brittle and very frizzy ( I have thin, curly hair). However, once I used the HSI, it left my hair super smooth and no frizz at all! I really recommend it. It is a great iron!! I also love how I can use it in Europe and it has adjustable temperature settings to reduce damage to hair and accommodate to your own hair needs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find that these hair straighteners do a very good job at all.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very smooth results.  I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be a good as my chi, but it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I am surprised by how shiny the hair looks compared to my previous straightener, but also how long lasting the effect is. Compared to Previous straightener the hair stays shiny after waking up:-)  Thank you Amazon for making such a bargain possible!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because my 3rd CHI iron has broken on me last month, so I figured for the price it was worth a try. Turned out I love this iron even more than any CHI I ever owned and the Argan oil sample is amazing!!</li>
    <li> Love this iron.  Great price for such high quality.  Also LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair especially for my little one.  I can now straighten her hair without issues with pulling.</li>
    <li> Pretty good flat iron. Better than the Black Pearl I had before. It takes fewer passes through the hair to achieve the desired result.  The only thing, is it triggers the oils in the hair and I need to wash it more often when I use it. But that is also a good thing that it helps the hair stay protected.</li>
    <li> Great packaging! Nice travel bag and oil. Over all very satisfied with the iron and package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use it, but so far I&#x27;m happy. I have fine hair and my bangs naturally want to curl even though my hair is straight. I could never blowdry them as straight as I wanted. This seems to do the trick. I use it on the lowest heat setting.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and works wonders on my frizzy hair! I use the whole system (shampoo, conditioner and leave in argan oil treatment) and flat iron after, and my hair is awesome and without frizz!!</li>
    <li> Compare to others, this was heavier, the iron does not close tighter than others.</li>
    <li> I like it so much , but I didn&#x27;t use the organ oil come with it yet</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter, she uses it on a daily basis. I came with a glove, which is a good thing! This baby gets H O T</li>
    <li> Better than I even expected. I&#x27;m happy :) Works great and was reasonably priced compared to models in the store.</li>
    <li> Much better results, then I actually expected for the reasonable price I paid.  Leaves my hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> Worth for the money paid.Works perfectly well.comes with a nice beautiful pouch.</li>
    <li> I loved it my hair is perfectly straight every time I use it. Thank you so much !</li>
    <li> it heats up quickly and does a great job on coarse thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for the value. Works well.</li>
    <li> I eagerly awaited the arrival of my new straightener.  My hair is long and very curly.  When I first used my new straightener, I was thrilled with the ease of straightening and speed at which I was finished with all my hair.  This is a fast, sleek, easy to use straightener.</li>
    <li> Works Great and I love the settings. Came in fast and was exactly what I expected. Got because of the reviews and not disapointed</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> The straightener arrived in beautiful packaging. It works amazingly! It gives your hair a soft &amp; sleek finish. It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful, too.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron. This is the first HSI product I&#x27;ve purchased and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It&#x27;s so easy to use and not only straightens my very curly hard to straighten hair but also will flip &amp; curl so I can style my hair all with the same thing.  It doesn&#x27;t leave marks in your hair like most straighteners do and no burn damage to my hair either, its left silky &amp; shiny &amp; smelling great instead of like burnt hair. I love my new hair styler &amp; the awesome storage bag &amp; glove it comes with. Most defiantly worth buying!!</li>
    <li> Best falt iron&lt;br /&gt;Simple!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect when flat irons are typically so much more expensive. This one has clear instructions and takes the frizz out as promised. Very satisfied with ease of use and great results.</li>
    <li> I used to just buy the cheap flat irons from a superstore (Walmart, Target, your pick), so I decided to buy a nicer one online.  My hair gets frizzy naturally, but this flat iron keeps it straighter for longer.  I wish I would have shelled out the extra $$ for the digital display, as you guess the heat with this iron&#x27;s &amp;#34;knob&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;side note:  The free Argan oil was fun to try out.  I personally did not like the smell though...</li>
    <li> Love the hair straightener. Heats up fast, recovers fast from heat loss while styling. Nicely packaged with travel case and bonus oil pack for hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly dry hair &amp; I absolutely love this straightener !</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great so far. I have only used it a handful of times.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister in law. The straightener is quite nice, well packed with a useful pouch. She is quite happy with the product, its simple to use and effective for quick straightening, avoids frequent trips to the salon.</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats quickly, straightens and smooths quickly and for the price is a very good value. After purchasing one for my daughter I liked it so well I bought one for myself. I initially didn&#x27;t like that the temperature was controlled by a dial but now I prefer the dial because I can leave it set at the temperature I like and just turn it on. I think it is well worth the money I and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to replace it one day with the very same item.</li>
    <li> Was a present for my wife and she absolutely  loves it.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron! Great product for a great price! Heats up fast! Works well on thick hair. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok. It does not heat up to 450. I&amp;#34;m sure of it. in any event, it&#x27;s reliable and does the job.</li>
    <li> The very best flat iron I have used, and I have bought them ALL.  I have wasted so much money on supposed top Irons...expensive and moderate and none of them are like this one.&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot fast and it holds your hair tightly and gets it straight immediately!&lt;br /&gt;My only critique is that I wish it had a light that would go on when the unit is on.  It only has an on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great item.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product it&#x27;s been a blessing to my hair!  The other hair straightener I had fried my hair this one leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Works just like promised!</li>
    <li> the best ive ever tried!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is my first one, so I can&#x27;t say how great it is to use until I learn how. But, so far, I like the size, the carrying case, the written instructions are pretty good, however, a video would have been a nice inclusion.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, and it&#x27;s nice to have a choice of temps. Would prefer digital readout, however. It straightens my faster than my previous flatiron, and it&#x27;s easy to twist the ends of my hair to create a little curl. It has taken a little effort to get used to a more narrow plate, as I am used to 1 1/2 inch iron. I am very happy with the smooth feel of my hair, and feel like I got a good value. I am happy that it is dual voltage-- it should make taking it with me when I travel very easy. I do have to remind myself to turn it off when done, as it does not switch off automatically.</li>
    <li> Works really smoothly and leaves hair super soft and shiny! And it&#x27;s cheap! Can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;Downfall, has a thick plug in</li>
    <li> The straightener works very well and gets hot quickly. It come with a bag, glove, and oil. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderful. I have naturally curly hair but it was no challenge for this bad boy lol I recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t owned or used a flat iron in years, yet this product was easy to use straight out of the box!  I have wavy hair, and in the past, I tried to achieve smooth hair through blow drying alone; this product is a game changer!  I loved how my hair looked even after the first time I used it, and it took only a few minutes to style my hair well with the HSI iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read through a lot of reviews prior to purchase and am so glad this is the product I selected!  It&#x27;s a great price, and I love that the argan oil and protective glove are included.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my girlfriend and she loves this product.  She has owned other hair straighteners and has not been impressed by many of them however, she has been impressed with this one.</li>
    <li> What a great flat iron for the price. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product was very well reviewed on amazon, which prompted me to purchase. My only issue at this point is that the iron seems to get caught on my har and pulls at them as your straightening. This can actually be painful.  If it werent for this issue, I would be completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> great service, great product</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener as a gift for my fiance after hers burned out on a vacation (forgot to use a foreign power converter...).  I read a few reviews before making the final decision and I think it was the right one.  This thing gets HOT and she tells me that it works very well.  I like that it came with a bag for storage and seems to be durable and well made.  The price was right, as this model seems to be something that actual salons might use and the retail price is more than double what I paid.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. My hair is straight and smooth without being scorched. I reccomend it highly for naturally wavy or straight hair.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Works wonders on my thick, wavy hair!!</li>
    <li> I tried this straightener because it was the best selling one on Amazon. I have been pleasantly surprised. I have very fine hair, so I was worried about the high temperature damaging my hair, but it has been fantastic. My only complaint is that the indicator light is not bright enough to notice that the iron is still on.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my much loved CHI died on me. I was weary with the HSI simply because it is $30 but I do have to say I am shocked. I love it as much, if maybe not more, than my CHI. And I have some seriously thick, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener, needed a new one after 5 years and it does the job.  Gets really hot and straightens my hard to straighten hair without snagging, blades are very smooth.  Definitely a good purchase for the price, I had a $120 Sapphire and this one just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay very much for this product but had I paid what it was listed for I wouldn&#x27;t have been very happy.  Product works fine but does not work any better or any worse than my other flat iron that I only paid $25.00 for.  The heat adjustment knob seems a little cheap and wobbly.</li>
    <li> after reading all these  good reviews. I&lt;br /&gt; Can&#x27;t be the only  one who didn&#x27;t like it. &#x27;m  African American with type 4  hair  currently  going natural.&lt;br /&gt; this  flat  iron  straightened  my  natural hair for about 2  minutes  then it was  poofy  again.  ny  ends were  not smooth  at  all. i was so frustrating. I think it worked  best on relaxed hair but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for natural  hair. I  have a  really  bad  feeling that this product isn&#x27;t 100%  authentic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this flat iron. It heats up really fast. You can control the temperature, which is very convenient. My hair occasionally got caught in my old flat iron, it never happened with this new one. Great product. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick and came in perfect condition, when I used it for the first time I was amazed how my hair looked, I used it with the free oil, it does exactly what it says, my hair was so soft and straight I am never using my old products again. You will be amazed by this!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the price, but after reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try it out. I have had CHI and other professional salon flat irons but I have to say that this is by far THE best flat iron I have ever used. The reason why the price is so low is that there are newer models with more belts and whistles, but if you want a flat iron that is truly ceramic that doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much (not like CHI, which is metal plated on the inside) BUY THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend recently baught me this flatiron along with the argon oil for my very curly frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve used it once &amp; so far it is the best one I&#x27;ve had. I have always had dry frizzy ends after straightening my hair until now. Hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron it really straightened my hair</li>
    <li> This straightner is awesome. Super deal. I bought my 1st hair straightner years ago and paid $100 or more. It lasted but was so extremely hot to the touch I could barely touch my hair. This one is super light and gets my hair straight 1st time I put it through my hair. Makes my hair feel super healthy and soft. I have natural curly/wavy hair and this iron gets my hair super straight. :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron works as well as the CHI I had previously.  The price is great, and the quality is perfect.  Nice that it comes with the heatproof glove too.  The shipping was very quick and efficient.</li>
    <li> At first I wanted a straighteners with the cute design but I&#x27;m really happy I got this. It heats up quick and straightens great! I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months and I love it!</li>
    <li> This straightener is everything I hoped for, and more. I was looking for something simple to operate, with an on/off switch and a temperature dial. This fit the bill perfectly, and came in addition with a lovely satin sleeve to protect the iron when it&#x27;s not in use, as well as a sample of Argan Oil. The oil worked wonders, and smells great. I ordered a full size bottle after trying it.</li>
    <li> I expected it too be pretty good but it was great! Works like a 200$ iron and works great. I hope you all buy specially for such a great price!</li>
    <li> Love it! I have long coarse hair and this straightener heats up fast to a very hot temp. It doesn&#x27;t rip or get caught in my hair. The oil sample is amazing it helps tames fly always and give my hair shine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron after read the great customer review, and it came very fast. The product was in a nice looking package with a pretty red cover and a free bag of hair oil, which was very nice! I right away plugged in the iron wondering how it worked. It heat up very fast and the size of the flat iron was not to small or too big, easy to apply on my thick long hair (up to my lower back) and left a smooth and shiny looking result (my hair was dyed so many time and became dry looking). I love how it made my hair silky and shiny after straighted it, then I applied the hair oil on it and looked even better. I am glad I got this product with such great price, ill definitely recommend to my girl friends and everyone else to use this product!!!</li>
    <li> I decided that i wanted a flat iron hair straightener and I thought this model looked the best. When I got it and used it for the first time I was very excited. It was easy to use and I got professional results doing it myself. I have never had results like this with any other product. It makes my hair soft and the results last longer than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> love this styling iron. leaves my hear smooth. heats up in seconds and doesnt leave your hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> The product is great. Atlas supply chain also did a great job addressing my issues.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, straight iron worked great. My hair isn&#x27;t long enough for me to try curls, but I expect that if it can handle my hair (I have a lot of hair), it&#x27;ll be able to whip out a few curls when I want it to.</li>
    <li> packaging was very nice/professional and the way they packaged the item...you would think it cost alot more than it really did! havent used it yet, but from the looks of it, should probably turn out pretty good! only gripe was that it(hair straightner) didnt close all the way(tiny gap between the plates). but i mean for the price you pay, dont really think its an issue lol.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, fast shipping. The Flat iron comes with a handy bag, a glove (?) and is clearly well made and sturdy. It heats up quickly and does the job without damaging hair. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and work great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding that I have to adjust the heat setting higher than expected for my fine hair, but it works well.</li>
    <li> Product works well. Wish it were a little wider. Happy with silky feel of my hair after use.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product!! Even a free argan oil!!</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely manner and it works beautifully</li>
    <li> My wife is totally satisfied with this product and so am I her hair looks lighter and shinier. The product is top notch.</li>
    <li> It heats fast and overall the best flat iron I have own. It leaves hair soft too. It works great.</li>
    <li> Out of all the flat irons I own the hsi professional 1in is the best.... it leaves my hair with shine;I just love this product.</li>
    <li> My straightener broke all of a sudden so I needed a replacement quick. This straightener came when it was promised and it works great! A great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of HSI brand before until i did a search for a new flat iron. I came across this one ordered it off of the huge amount of positive reviews it had on here. So from my experience, i can say that this is a A- flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*Heats up HOT (400 degrees it says). The hotter the better the iron flattens your hair&lt;br /&gt;*It flattens my hair without having to go over a strand several times for it to get straight&lt;br /&gt;*Has a good grip texture on the handle part..prevents hand from slipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*It is heavy compared to other flat irons i have had in the passed. Maybe because the plates are quality?&lt;br /&gt;* There isn&#x27;t a red light to indicate if the iron is on. I liked having this feature on previous irons i have had</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and straightened hair lasts for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty amazed at how inexpensive it was compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews that this flat iron received I decided to order it.  The item arrived quickly and carefully packed.  Since receiving this product I have been very pleased.  It is easy to use and not bulky at all.  I would recommend this product.  I would definitely order from this company again...their service was excellent!</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and is exactly as described.  It worked great!  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It doesnt straighten my hair very well- it will still leave wavy parts where my CHI never did</li>
    <li> Works exactly the way I wanted it to, with a cord adequate to what I needed.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts but after reading the reviews and trying this product out....I LOVE it! :D It definitely heats up quickly and you can see a difference after straightening your hair with it. Can&#x27;t wait to take this product on my vacation.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, thick, wirey, curly hair.  I have never found a flat iron that straightened my hair without frying it.  Love love love this one.  Half the cost of the big name brands, heats up immediately.  I am so very glad I purchased this and took a chance.  This will not end up in the flat iron grave yard!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Easy to use, heats up quickly!! Would recommend this product for the beginner or professional...</li>
    <li> Solid construction.  Heats and cools fast.  Much better than my previous brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the item arrived earlier than expected .</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Get&#x27;s hot really fast and does an awesome job on my hair.  Iron is very handy, not heavy and not expensive at all.  Comes with a glove and it&#x27;s own traveling pouch. Been looking for a good iron for a while, comparing style and prices etc. and glad to have chosen this one.  Cost for this particular one is very reasonable and affordable.[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment. WORLDWIDE DUAL VOLTAGE 110v-220v]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener before a few years ago but I dropped it so many times that it the ceramic plate finally broke. So I decided to buy another one just like it because so far it is still my favorite straightener and I haven&#x27;t found another one that I liked. It is a little heavy compared to the chi straighteners and a few others, but I like that it&#x27;s not very light and I find it easier to straighten with. It arrived on time and everything is as the seller claimed.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price</li>
    <li> Received my replacement HSI flat iron.  Heats up fast and works really well.  Have been using it for about two months and no problems.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my HSI  last week and received it 2 days later. It is by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is still straight after sleeping on it and after I braided it. I took my time looking for a straightener and obviously I picked a winner! Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> The shipment was fast and the product is more than satisfactory. It comes as a set and it totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> Received this hair straightener about 2 weeks ago and so far it works perfect. I love the argan oil that came along with it. I only have to go over my hair once on low heat. Great price for you what you get.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the amazing reviews and I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed. The iron heats up quick, but when I try pulling it through my hair, it snags very easily and pulls out strands. I have naturally straight, thick, Asian hair so I only need this to straighten bed waves and curl the ends, and though it works, the short length of the plates makes it hard to get the curls to work properly and hair near the front of my face keep sliding out of the range of the plates, making the waves difficult to get to. My roommate uses a Remington and that one works so much better and is cheaper too. It has a longer plate, doesn&#x27;t snag, and creates better curls. After 3 weeks of using this one,  I&#x27;m seriously thinking about returning it.</li>
    <li> works great.  this is for my vacation home, so I don&#x27;t have to take my original back and forth.</li>
    <li> My first flat iron was a professional one for $200 and it was heavy with a wide plate.  This one is light and I bought it to travel with.  I travel with it.  I like it so much, I tossed my professional one and bought a second one for my home.</li>
    <li> Works reallly great, gives smooth straight hairs, good for daily use</li>
    <li> It certainly gets hot, and one pass seems to do the trick.  My only gripe is that sometimes the hair gets slightly snagged when pulling through.  Overall, a good product for the price</li>
    <li> My wife is used to using CHI irons.  But, since they break every 60 days, she wanted something new.  She hated this one out of the box.  Said it pulled her hair.  She now has a BabyLiss titanium nano ultra thin iron and loves it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom for mothers day. (she&#x27;s a former cosmetologist) It was a HUGE hit. She loves it, says it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Received this super quick after reading all the rave reviews and wanted to try for myself. I have very thick, coarse hair and this works wonderfully! A lot of flat irons take FOREVER to straighten my hair because they don&#x27;t get hot enough. This one however, used on the right heat setting for my kind of hair, (high - as recommended by the instructions) is awesome! It only takes about one or two passes on each section whereas it&#x27;s usually at least 3-4 times per 1&amp;#34; section. 😳 Mine came with a glove, carry bag and a sample bottle of Argan oil that was formulated for use with this iron. Overall very happy with this purchase and would totally recommend to anyone wanting to give it a try! 👍👍</li>
    <li> My last flat iron quit on me, so I was looking for a replacement.  Going into the purchase, I was set on buying another just like it.  After searching, I found this one.  The price was great and the reviews helped sway my decision to trying another brand.  I love it.  I like how you can adjust the heat setting.  It is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I got 2 Chi&#x27;s off of Amazon and they both broke within a month.  I have had this straightener for a year and a half now and it is AMAZING! It is one of my best amazon purchases</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron! It&#x27;s heavy duty with adjustable temp &amp; heats up quickly. Perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Edit: I reduced my rating because the iron failed. It has to be reset constantly. Shame because it was good.   Originally rated 4 stars but after using I really do love this flat iron. It doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and is a great value at $40. It arrived quickly and I would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the Chi I had!  Have the price and love the Aragon oil sample it came with.</li>
    <li> love it, as described, works internationally with bot 120 and 240 v.</li>
    <li> Love the flexible sizes. Lots of hair on these girls</li>
    <li> Review from my wife: $40 is my straightener limit, but I will never by one from a regular story.  My last one from a beauty supply store lasted 9 years, and worked great.  This one also works great!  Here&#x27;s hoping it lasts nine years!  It doesn&#x27;t have a curved edge, but I can still curl with it, they look really nice, and it goes much faster than my last straightener.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.  For anyone that needs something of better quality than you can buy in a walmart or target, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed by this product.  It would heat up but would only stay hot for a few seconds before cooling down again.  This is not a good product for people with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love the straightener! I was worried about the narrow band, but it actually is so great. It heats up fast.</li>
    <li> I had the chi before this. I would say in view of the price I wish I had known about this straightener sooner it&#x27;s much better quality and much better price. It makes my hair fell very healthy and shiny compared to the chi I always felt like it made it more frizzy at times and wasn&#x27;t quite hot enough so I had to pass it over my hair too many times. This straightener is also amazing for curling (if you know how) overall my favorite stranger ever very being the amika just because of the amazing price</li>
    <li> Sorry, but can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a fan. I mean for the price, it does the job of straightening my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t look healthy--lots of fly aways and puffiness.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the previous one I had.</li>
    <li> Always leaves my hair shining and like I just stepped out of the beauty salon! Best thing ever!</li>
    <li> I Think The Iron Was Defective Because It Pulled My Hair So Blue Novelties Is Sending Me A New One. Their Customer Service Was Awesome! What A Great Company To Work With. Highly Recommend. I Think The New Iron They Are Sending Will Be Perfect For My Hard To Straighten Hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas present for my granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair so it takes little to straighten it, but this doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and used it for the first time......&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE it!!! Easy to use and makes your hair very soft and no frizz. Highly recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> Pulled my hair so much that I am now using my roommates flat iron instead which I had purchased for her as a gift from Groupon but is no longer available. &amp;#60;$29.99 for an Amore 1.25-Inch Blue Tourmaline Straightening Iron Set ($200 List Price). Free Shipping.&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a top brand and was happy until I tried this one. Very efficient. Leaves hair soft and conditioned. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great tool. It glides through my hair. Very great price.</li>
    <li> works great on my hair.  I have naturally wavy hair and this makes it very soft in combination with the argan oil.  I recommend buying the two together...It did come with a small sample bottle of the argan oil so you could try the oil before purchasing it and make sure you like it before spending the extra money.  I bought this based on the reviews and glad I did.  I did not want to spend $100 on a flat iron that I only use once a week.</li>
    <li> I was expecting amazing but it&#x27;s pretty good I guess. My cousin uses something way cheaper that does the job better though. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type because I&#x27;m African American</li>
    <li> This was a good straightener and I actually would compare it to my GHD. The weight was excellent and it really did work but, I had to replace it 3 times and each time within 2 months it just stopped staying hot and if the cord swiveled it would s*** off :(. So sad because it was good.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product for those with very thick hair that is curly..... I own a Chi and its way hotter and works way faster. With the HSI it takes several times on the same piece of hair to get it straight. It is time consuming. The price is awesome and looks very nice. Just disappointed that it was not to  my standards.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace my Chi Titanium straightener that died after a little over a year of use. So far, I have been happy with it. I only have two major complaints. The handle is ridged with a triangle pattern, and it makes it very uncomfortable to hold. The handle also gets a bit hot, which can be painful. My hair is a little drier than it was with my Chi, but it stays much straighter. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product. I&#x27;ll keep it, and just deal with the uncomfortable handle.</li>
    <li> My Metropolis flat iron broke after 4 years-disaster for my wavy hard to tame hair. After reading the reviews (both 5&#x27;s 3&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s) I decided to go for it-how could 4000 reviews with such a high rating be wrong? WRONG WRONG WRONG. Crappy flat iron. It never seemed to heat up all the way. It says it goes to 400 degrees-but even after letting it warm up for 10 minutes I could still tap the hot surface without getting burned--that&#x27;s NOT 400 degree-so maybe I got a lemon? Even so I still wouldn&#x27;t buy this. The flat iron is heavy (compared to others-no it&#x27;s not 5 lbs, but lifting it over your head everyday for 5 to 10 minutes-too heavy), and the handle had a diamond grip-bad idea. As I used it, it rubbed my palms red. I had read another review that said they got blisters-I believe it! Also, it pulled my hair out, a couple strands seemed to come out as I flat ironed the ends with every section of hair I did.&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY from this flat iron. It&#x27;s not worth the money...or the return shipping. I had since purchased a new Metropolis London flatiron for $20 more and love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have seen this product come through my line every day at work but thought nothing of it.  That is, until my flat iron decided not to work anymore.  I remembered this product when it came time to replace mines and I&#x27;ve read quite a few reviews on this before deciding to make my purchase.  For starters,  the price alone at $39.99 is a steal because it&#x27;s not uncommon to see these sold at professional shops for over $100.  I also have fine hair but A LOT of it and some flat irons are not capable of handling the thickness as well as this one did.  Talk about professional styling in the comfort of my own home and saves me lots of money from having to go to the salon.  I&#x27;ve had this product for a week now but today was the FIRST time I&#x27;ve used it.  Let me tell you...it was unbelievable and extremely easy to use.  It&#x27;s a tad heavy but not uncomfortable at all.  I loved how it made my hair feel and surprisingly so, I didn&#x27;t smell anything burning like my old one did and others I&#x27;ve had in the past.  It comes with a turn know to control the heat (it can go as high as 410 degrees) and you don&#x27;t need it that hot to get the results you want.  I can now understand why so many women are buying this and I&#x27;m extremely thrilled with my purchase.  If this ever dies on me, I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews about this product, I wanted to be one of the ones who really loved it but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  It arrived fast and on time.  The flat iron worked well but it gave my hair this horrible burnt smell.  I figured maybe the setting was too high so I tried it again another day with a lower setting and it still gave me a burnt hair smell.  Another thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it tugged on other strands of hair a lot.  Needless to say, I returned the item.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife for her to straighten her hair she likes this way better than the original chi brand at first we were hesitant on buying it since we got it on sale for only about 30$ when the original price was 200$ anyways we went and made the purchase and she was surprised how good it really was and for the price it was really amazing better than her chi brands she has anyone looking for an effortless straightening experience we highly recommend</li>
    <li> My CHI burned out after about 2 years of use (everyone in my sorority used it to get ready). Instead of spending another $200 on a CHI I decided to go with the HSI and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It gets plenty hot and straightens my hair extremely fast with little damage. I would recommend and have recommended this product to mutiple people.</li>
    <li> My wife is totally satisfied  !!!</li>
    <li> yes i love the flat iron the bag and box it comes in the glove the oil everything I LOVE IT !!! it also works really great on my hair both my natural hair and also my brazilian body wave weave hair !!!</li>
    <li> Terrible flatiron if you have coarse hair! This flatiron does not get hot enough to be effective. This is terrible! I&#x27;m returning it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Really like this product left my hair realky silky and soft i do recommend, the sstraightenner works wonderful and heats up quick</li>
    <li> I loved it!! works as is promoted!</li>
    <li> IT is a great flat iron for a first time user. Its everything I expected and I really like it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother and she loves it. She has thick, sort of wavy hair and this flatiron straightened her hair in one pass. It was smooth and silky. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair &amp; I hate styling my hair. I literally wash my hair take the tangles out &amp; let it dry &amp; just let it be . I thought I&#x27;d try this &amp; love it in 10min my hair is perfectly straight. I normally have no patience for this but it&#x27;s so fast &amp; easy. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple weeks and  so far i&#x27;ve been really happy with it. Works great.</li>
    <li> I needed a straightener after losing mine after having it for almost 10 years. This seemed a good alternative to an ultra-expensive one. I have fine hair, and relative to this straightener, I&#x27;m glad. It heats up very quickly, has an easy on/off button and temperature dial, and it does a good job straightening my hair. I could not imagine having thick or curly hair and getting it as straight as I would like, however. Also, it curls under the ends of my hair if I don&#x27;t hold it just right, which I personally don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good, inexpensive buy for now.</li>
    <li> With my straight hair a flat iron was not something I ever anticipated buying. But with this flat iron I can make my hair look shiny, smooth, and thick with lots of body and curve. It works on both dry and damp hair. I am still learning to use it, but am very happy with the easy of handling, the temperature control, and the durability (I dropped it on a concrete floor with no damage).  The satin pouch it came with is handy for traveling, but I usually keep my flat iron hanging on the wall from the molded-in loop at the base of the unit.  It also comes with a heat protective glove which I haven&#x27;t used yet--would probably be handy if I had short hair. The Argain oil included with the flat iron is a nice bonus.  I would recommend this product which I have found to be easy to use and worth the cost. Hint:  be sure to check the reset button on the plug when you first use your flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron purchase.  I brought because of the great reviews.  Product does a great job with my hair, leaving it shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> After using a high priced hair straightener for years, I was in the market for a new one.  I decided to go with the HSI, mostly because of the price.  I am happy that I did!  This hair straightener is great!  It heats up super fast, holds the heat well and is just large enough to work quickly through my hair.  I have mid-back length hair and it has a lot of wave.  I find that the HSI straightens very well, and stays straight!  The oil is really nice, I may need to invest in a larger size.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair straightener.</li>
    <li> This is the first straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought and I got it mainly for my mixed daughter&#x27;s crazy curly/frizzy hair. I can&#x27;t believe how well it straightens her hair! My only complaint is that the light goes back and forth from red to green and isn&#x27;t consistent, so there&#x27;s obviously a malfunction with that part of the item. But it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the fact that the iron heats up quickly and is very efficient in doing its job. I will continue to use it for my daughter and myself.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best I&#x27;ve had and the service wonderful as well.  A pleasure doing business with this company.  They really care.</li>
    <li> I have been using the iron every time I wash my hair and so far I have no complains. It does what it suppose to do. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron as a back up to my Chi 1 1/2\\&quot; and to do my bangs.  I was a little leery because of the low price but took a chance because of the great reviews.  I am so glad I did!  I now use it for all of my hair.  It does great for curls and they stay all day!  I would absolutely recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> This came just as advertized  Amazing deal, amazing product.. :) I knew nothing about these tools but with some research I found HSI are the best and it really turned out to be the best!</li>
    <li> I was excited as this was first purchase of flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;Ceramic plate had a visible scratch, but I didn&#x27;t have time to exchange as I was travelling.&lt;br /&gt;Also the &#x27;Argain Oil Leave in hair treatment&#x27; came in a cute little bottle; however the bottle was empty.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it was an error or if the oil had all evaporated while on route?!&lt;br /&gt;Flat iron does the job, but not very happy with visible scratch (maybe a returned item they sent me) and no oil for me to try out.</li>
    <li> Did not heat up very fast. Had this flat iron 40 days and it quit working and could not return.  So in the garbage it will go.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my youngest daughter so she would stop taking my Chi. Now I use it &amp; my older daughter does to. It straightens much better than any I&#x27;ve ever used before. This was a surprise to me because it was only $60, came with a nice travel cover, &amp; came with a small bottle of smoothing oil. In the past I&#x27;ve paid $100 &amp; more for straighteners. This does the job better &amp; with fewer repetitions. We LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace the CHI that I had that broke after 3 years of use. As far as straightening goes, the HSI straightens as well as the CHI. The result is very silky, straight hair with no frizz whatsoever. With that being said, there are some flaws that I can&#x27;t seem to overlook. One, the straightener does not get hot even at the hottest setting. I could overlook this since it seems to do the job somehow without getting too hot. My CHI got so hot that I couldn&#x27;t even touch my hair a few seconds afterwards because it was so hot to the touch. That may be a downside to some people, but for me, that&#x27;s the job of a flat iron. Two, the indicator light is virtually useless. It should turn from orange/red to green when the iron is at the desired heat setting, but it constantly switches from red to green for no apparent reason. Even if it is laying flat on a surface, it is constantly switching from red to green and I never know if the heat setting is right. This makes me think this is either a defect or that it doesn&#x27;t maintain the heat setting. In addition, it takes forever for it to get hot and add that to the problem of not knowing if it&#x27;s \\&quot;ready,\\&quot; and the whole process becomes annoying. What was the deal breaker for me is how this flat iron tugs at my hair. My head is still hurting from using it. If you can overlook these things, then maybe it&#x27;s worth the purchase because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the CHI, but I use my iron everyday day, TWICE a day, so I want the product to be near perfect. My CHI was near perfect, until it broke on me of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know how it got such high ratings because you really are paying for what you get. Yes, it does the job, but it sacrifices so many little things.</li>
    <li> The HSI straightener actually came faster than it said it would, and I loved it.  I&#x27;ve already used it many times and it is SOOO much better than the straightener I had before this one.  It takes about 2 min to heat up and I have thick hair so U put it on the hottest setting.  I really like it a lot--so far no problems!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased. I ordered and it was delivered in a properly packaged box in way less time than i was told. Ran to my house like a little school girl and began opening the package. plugged it in and started using it. right away i noticed how much faster and smoother my hair was compared to the other flat iron. The reviews on this product were great that&#x27;s what caught my eye. I have thin long unmanageable hair. doesn&#x27;t keep a curl and wouldn&#x27;t stay straight. Wavy frizzy hair. Scary really. I work with professional people from upper class backgrounds and they always look perfect. i used this one time it was fast and stayed that way. My hair was softer, shinier healthy looking and very pretty. Worth way more than I paid for it. I have been asking around what people would recommend and it was always a 200.00 flat iron. I heard all the horror stories about how chi breaks after a year and women getting ripped off at the mall for junk irons at kiosks, i didn&#x27;t want to go that route and I&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t I&#x27;m very happy with my new flat iron and who i purchased from.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this straightening iron.  I have really thick hair and thought that it would help after I read the reviews.  However, it is always in &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; mode where it is cooled down and not ready.  I have tried changing the temp and it still does the same thing.  I can go through a strand once, maybe twice, and the light turns red.  At this point, it takes forever to really straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener for the hair as my granddaughter has extremely curly hair.  She is at the age where she wants to try new looks  and change the familiar  trademark of her  curly hair for a new look.  She has always been frustrated with managing her hair in the past.  I think that this will give her a new look.  Be wishing her well with your product.</li>
    <li> After trying several flat irons I came across the HSI Ionic Flat Iron, absoutely love it!! It does the same job as if you were having your hair done from a salon!!  Definetly would recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> I have used a Paul Mitchell straight iron in the past but didn&#x27;t like the new model. I have purchased two other irons, only to be unsatisfied.  I had never used HSI before but thought the price was right. I received it very quickly, even over a holiday weeken, and love how smoothly it glides over my hair. It heats evenly and doesn&#x27;t give my hair the crimp marks other irons can tend to leave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been pretty iffy when it comes to flat irons. I have very long, thick curly hair, and I like it to still hold a lot of body and bounce when it&#x27;s straightened, and I&#x27;ve found that a lot of straighteners that smooth it also weigh it down. This flat iron doesn&#x27;t do that! Even when I straighten from root to tip, it still has tons of volume to it. Also, I&#x27;ve got generally very healthy hair, but I recently got it ombred so it&#x27;s more processed than usual. The ends that are light have more split ends than I&#x27;m used to and I&#x27;ve used a few straighteners that make them crispy and dry and feel like straw. I thought it was just something I was going to have to live with, but when I got this flat iron I was beyond pleasantly surprised by how soft my hair is all the way through. I can easily run my fingers through it all day without brushing it, which probably also has something to do with the Argon oil that comes with it (WHICH IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT AS WELL!) My only complaint is that it does sometimes snag and tug, but again that might have something to do with my hair being more processed on the ends. Overall I am EXTREMELY pleased with this product, more than worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good iron hair straightener, I read a few reviews and I decided to give it a chance, I use it very often and I like the way my hair looks right after, it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair as much as the other machines. Good package, nice presentation ... I got it on time... I&#x27;m happy with this product. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I do not see how professionals use this product. It seems to take forever to heat up. Considering the retail price of almost 2oo dollars, I expected a better product.</li>
    <li> I have much more expensive irons than this one and this one is just as good as those.  I would recommend this iron to anyone looking for an iron that straightens their hair.  Good quality &amp; good price.</li>
    <li> I love this. Works great. Very good value for the amount paid. I would say it is comparable to the CHI and FHI irons!!</li>
    <li> ***update on my last review: ***  The flat iron deserves 5 stars. Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow changing the stars so I will just edit my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review was about the iron not getting hot enough and was not working properly (my hair would not stay straight)&lt;br /&gt;The next day after I contacted them. I got an email from Jessica from customers service dept. Letting me know that she had read the review and she told me its very unusual but i must of received a defective one. Without any questions asked she had a replacement sent out to me the same day with express mail. Like I said before I give them 5 star not only for the amazing flat iron but for their great customer service</li>
    <li> Less expensive than other ceramic hair irons. Works very well on my daughters&#x27; long hair. I Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Have tried several straighteners and I have thick, wavy hair. Found that the straightener heated up very quickly, and slid very nicely over my hair. Resulted in smooth, shiny, straight hair! Extremely pleased! And for under $50, it is definitely a great value!</li>
    <li> This straightener is great for my hair. It only takes a couple of passes for each section to be perfectly straight. The heat controls are a nice feature, too (something I haven&#x27;t noticed on other straighteners I&#x27;ve tried). I think this one was definitely worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> The only trouble I have with this is it will pull my hair every now and then.  It does have a temp control which I really like</li>
    <li> I am an avid user of Amazon and purchase many things for personal and work purposes and have never had a problem. I just received this flat iren and noticed that the tape used to seal the product was cut. I thought that was strange so I slid open the box to make sure that I received what I paid for. Nope. The plates on the iron looked like they had been used and felt bumpy. I know that they shouldn&#x27;t look like that because I have owned many flat irons in the past. I called customer service and was told that it was a third party purchase, which is fine because like I said I purchase many things from third party on Amazon. I feel like Amazon should have been more diligent when packing the item because they would have seen that the tape on the boxed item was cut open. I am disappointed in both blue Novelties and Amazon.</li>
    <li> This item was 129.99 and for that price I would expect not to received a used item.  Also, the argon oil was not in the box or the protective sleeve.</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves my hair so smooth and shiny! Loved the argan oil! Great buy don&#x27;t hesitate to buy</li>
    <li> Love this iron . Great price . Works well lots of heat settings so does not burn my hair. Great value</li>
    <li> Does a good job for the money!</li>
    <li> hi i just received my order yesterday and i was suppose to receive a small bottle as a simple of argan oil i did not can u tell me plz why i didnt receive it becuase all the videos  i was watching on youtube people saying they receive argan oil hope i hear from you soon thanks.</li>
    <li> As I age, my hair gets more unruly. It has always been thick and wavy, but now it&#x27;s thick and wavy and curly and even straight in places. Plus, I&#x27;m getting gray hairs now and they are wiry and wild. My curling iron just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. I could get a good result, but it took a lot of time and once I left the house and got to work, it started to frizz and straighten and droop. The time I spent on my hair was for naught!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try a flat iron. The reviews and pictures from users had me hopeful it would work on my hair. The price was very affordable, so I went for it. I&#x27;ve used it about 4 days now and I&#x27;m VERY happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly figured out that with my hair I needed to use the highest heat setting. I have not used the Argon oil yet that came with it because I am already into a trial bottle of some Chi stuff my stylist gave me to try. I tried to use the glove, but quickly ditched it; it was just too clumsy. But boy, my hair is HOT, so I have to be careful. The first couple of times, I did pin up sections of my hair and started with the underneath layers, but now I just go for it. I have had good luck doing curls and flips as well. I&#x27;m spending less time on my hair now because unlike the curling iron, which really should sit with the curl a good ten seconds, this glides through your hair and instantly straightens or curls it. With the curling iron, I was always redoing sections that didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; the first time. Everything &amp;#34;takes&amp;#34; the first time with the flat iron. My re-dos are minimal and only because I&#x27;m still learning what I want to flip, curl, or straighten. It does a great job of taming and smoothing all the different hair &amp;#34;personalities&amp;#34; on my head. AND, my style LASTS ALL DAY!! My hair looks about 95% the same at the end of the day as when I styled it, compared to looking just about 40% the same with a curling iron. I. Am. Thrilled!!</li>
    <li> Worked great for using on vacation in europe. My wife says it snags her hair sometimes but works fine</li>
    <li> Loved it. Better than expexted.</li>
    <li> best FLAT IRON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair very straight and shiny..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most pleased with the price. Great Product and amazing price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks much! :D</li>
    <li> Hi girls!  Listen, I have really short hair and I began to notice that my hair looked like it had been singed or something. Seriously, I am 59 so maybe it&#x27;s gray hair, but I can&#x27;t tell because my hair is frosted.  What I can tell you is that my hair looked awful. I was worried.  I changed to Wen hair cleaner and that helped, but it wasn&#x27;t until I ordered THIS IRON that I really began to see results - immediately.  I like to see results NOW and this iron was so amazing that I quickly got back on Amazon and bought a spare.  For the price this may be the best iron on the market.  Just gives your hair shine without damage. It&#x27;s really sturdy and feels very well made.  The only problem I have is that it turns off automatically pretty quickly if you don&#x27;t use it and when I turn it off, the off light blinks until I unplug it so I ought to read the directions, I guess.  I just can&#x27;t be bothered with it. (ha)</li>
    <li> Love it! Great quality for great price</li>
    <li> I like it, its getting the job done. The plates against my hair doesnt feel as smooth against my hair as my old Chi straightener that broke on me for the LAST time...but it does not snag my hair by any means... just something to get used to. If it doesnt break on me before the year is up I will be ecstatic. I have had bad luck with flat irons over the past few years...  I&amp;#34;m changing my review a little bit. I tend to have more &amp;#34;bad hair days&amp;#34; with this. It just doesnt completely straighten my hair unless I am being extremely meticulous. Maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever owned a Chi, this product will never  be good enough.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic flat iron!  I have always used a Chi but decided to give this a try.  I can&#x27;t really tell much difference and for the price it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great product, just as good as any Chi but for a better price! Great settings for heating options as well.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter was visiting and curled my hair with the flat iron.  L had a lot of waves and curls.  My hair is very long and it was amazing how well it worked.  It takes practice but it is well worth using it.  It came exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Works really well and the price was a steal!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my CHI that suddenly stopped working. I have 2B-2C curls with A LOT of frizz. This straightener barely tames my frizz, and created too many flyaways, which I never experienced when using my CHI. Now I only straighten my hair when I absolutely must because the quality in this product is seriously lacking. I&#x27;m just going to save up for a CHI.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest flat iron I have ever had. Shipping was fast.  The Iton allows me to vary the temperature depending kn my hair type.  Provides a heat resistant glove and a sample of Argon Oil.  Five star greaf!!!!  The price was great also.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Its light, easy to handle, heats at the right temps and does so in good time. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants good results.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t a bad straightener. Works well to straighten thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great straightener, great seller (beautychange)</li>
    <li> I love using it.  One &#x27;flaw&#x27; for me: I am disabled in one shoulder, so the weight of the product is a little heavy for me, BUT, it flattens my hair very well!  Yes, I would buy it again!  Thank you.  Felice LEMOINE (feefeelsu@yahoo.com)</li>
    <li> Love it Works great It should be 10 stars</li>
    <li> Bought February. Not user friendly, feels awkward and heavy to use. Did not get oil with order. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener after hours of research and browsing. This iron had every feature of most $300-400 irons. I got this on sale for 40 and change and i would have easily paid more for the results i got. For your purchase you not only receive the straightener you get a hair oil and a thermal glove that comes in very handy. My hair is pin straight and soft at the recommended heat seating for normal/thick hair (370°).I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this to all reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product sporadically for the past few months and using the hair oil every time i shower. I must say my hair is amazing. Its soft, bouncy and full of life. I normally have to get my hair done every 6 months because it is so damaged and grows very slow. After using these items the damage is virtually gone and my hair is growing twice as fast. I dont know how but this straightener, even at a high temp doesnt damage my hair as much as other straightners do. I am extremely satisfied and i will also be looking into a blow dryer from this company.</li>
    <li> Very good product, heats up quickly, light weight.  I love the travel pouch and the Argan oil.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is okay. I bought it thinking I had selected a CHI instead. When I realized I had made a mistake I decided to give it a try. The product said it came with argon oil which didn&#x27;t come with the package. I&#x27;ve been to busy to get around contacting the seller and the iron has something that keeps pulling my hair. It does it&#x27;s job for the most part and I can live with it for the price I paid. If your hair isn&#x27;t really curly and you need something affordable go for it. Otherwise invest a little more for a better quality.</li>
    <li> Good flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a temporary replacement for my expensive Paul Mitchel flat iron that ended up lost with my luggage for 7 days on a trip. It works so well that the Paul Mitchel flat iron (which was 4 times the price of this flat iron) has been thrown in the back of my cabinet, probably never to be used again. My hair looks so much healthier and I have almost no fly-always! I can&#x27;t believe that my new favorite flat iron is so affordable. I&#x27;ve told all of my friends to buy it. I was wary at first because the price was so good, but I assure you it&#x27;s a top-quality flat iron and you will not regret this purchase. Definitely 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I like that you can control how hot it gets I couldn&#x27;t really do that with my other straightener which doesn&#x27;t get that hot</li>
    <li> love it! Works fast and i have a lot of hair.. frizzy hair too. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> pros: easy to use, quick, good build quality, great customer service!***    cons: hair easily and PERMANENTLY damaged.    I followed all the instructions and although I have thick hair that requires more heat to straighten, I never let the temperature go beyond 375F I applied the recommended hsi argan oil heat protector generously. The heat protector did nothing to save my hair. It&#x27;s damaged and has multiple breakage points throughout the hair. I don&#x27;t know how to fix my hair now since there are multiple breakage points throughout the length of the hair (so trimming my hair wont help).  My curler (which I used at 410F) never damaged my hair to this extent, so I think the problem is with the straightener.    ***UPDATE: I was contacted by the seller and they informed me that the product I received was probably defective since it&#x27;s not supposed to damage my hair. They were nice enough to replace it for free or give full refund. Excellent customer service! :) But I had to pay for the shipping :(</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the bomb,.it&#x27;s a must have in every girls bathroom. This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned. It&#x27;s totally worth it! :)</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this purchase!! :-) I now get my hair straightened so quickly. Love the selection of heat settings. Great design! AWESOME PRICE TOO! Thank-you so much for the quick delivery. Great product!</li>
    <li> The price and effectiveness of this iron blew away any I have ever had except for one that cost 5 times more!  Try it, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> I like it very much with the purchase price. The quality is excellent. Your hair will not get damage even with daily use.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase...very fast shipping and high quality product.</li>
    <li> Gets very hot, I have thick hair and its done in no time with out a bunch of going over my hair multiple times. I will order this again for a gift for my sisters.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever used and the oil is so wonderful. I&#x27;ve never seen my hair so pretty and sleek and shiny and perfectly straight. I didn&#x27;t even have it all the way up. Definitely advise someone to purchase it!</li>
    <li> Straightens well. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair extremely hot like other flat irons. I&#x27;ve owned a Chi and like this flat iron way more. I have ver course hair and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Was my first time using a hair straightener. Did rsearch on the net and saw that this product had thousands of good reviews so gave it a try. It was easy to use and worked great, and price is great.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this flat iron.  It heats up quickly and does a much better job than my other one that cost over twice as much.  The Argan oil made a big difference in outcome.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, but I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; switch location inbetween the plates.  Always forget which side the Ready light is on.  Sometimes pulls my hair--but never as bad as the Revlon did.  It&#x27;s ok.  Next time, I&#x27;ll try the CHI.</li>
    <li> This is the 5th (that&#x27;s right the 5th) HSI professional flat iron I buy. And no, I&#x27;m not getting a 5th one because they&#x27;ve all broken (I would be an idiot if I kept coming back for the same product if that was the case). I am buying the 5th one because everyone I know that sees it and uses it absolutely LOVES it. We&#x27;ve bought it as gifts and have even taken a few to Bolivia in South America because we&#x27;ve started madness over there with how good and reliable this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yep, this is the husband talking here. My wife is still on the first one she bought, and honestly, she says it gets better with time! The way I see it, she owns the mother of all the rest we&#x27;ve purchased for others.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this because of all the positive reviews but after few tries she is not happy. It has burned her hair, it made her hair feel weird and the temperature was inconsistent. You better make sure to use it right away and return ASAP because after 30 days you are out of luck. My daughter does not straighten her hair on a daily basis and she only used the product 3 times. She is stuck with a junk item that will be sold at our next garage sale. At least we can recoup some of money that way.Once again DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP IMITATION!!!</li>
    <li> I had these HSI Professional Flat Irons for a couple of months and one day while flat ironing my hair the entire plate broke with cracking. I would love another pair; they do get really, really hot.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, gets very hot and leaves hair smooth and straight every time. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought. I&#x27;m a picky curly and frizzy haired straightener &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; lol. This product was so great for the price. Worked perfectly I&#x27;m Israel within only the adapter. I def recommend it to anyone Looking for a great straightening iron not just for traveling but also for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! My hair has been transitioning to natural for a year and my old flat iron was awful. I am so happy I came across this one!</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating but I currently have NO issues whatsoever with it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected. Does not curl hair good. Hair smelt burnt after curling hair.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Straighter does not work very well. Lesson learned. Was not even worth the little amount I spent on it</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance because her flat iron broke.  I was also really tired of hearing her complain about her frizzy hair....she looks great to me but I guess my opinion didn&#x27;t count. She showed me this deal and I thought I would be a great guy and get it for her.  I received a nice discount if I gave my honest opinion about this product....which was easy because it works.  It was delivered promptly...thank god!  It heated up quickly and she could vary the heat with the dial. Her hair was silky smooth and our life was back to normal with her straight hair.  The customer service guy was really helpful when i emailed him with a few questions.</li>
    <li> This iron works really good my whife love it it&#x27;s super good price it&#x27;s same expensive brands</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! I have natural African American hair and it straightens it without a problem! Leaves it looking salon-finished. Only gave it 4 stars because it takes a while to heat up all the way. I&#x27;m used to flat irons that take 1 minute or less to get fully hot. This one takes about 2-3 minutes. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This has proven to be a great flat iron!  I was a bit skeptical only as I had not heard of this brand before, but after reading the reviews thought I&#x27;d try it.  It heats up quickly and cools quickly, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it either slowing me down or melting anything in the bathroom.  It straightens my hair nicely as well.  Love this!</li>
    <li> Wonderful and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL WONDERFUL STRAITENER! I SERIOUSLY COULD NOT BE HAPPIER! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! THANK YOU FOR OFFERING SOMETHING THAT IS CHI QUALITY FOR SO AFFORDABLE!</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far to straighten my hair. Once I use it to curl my hair and it curls good and easy to use, I&#x27;ll come back and rate it 5 stars</li>
    <li> This is about the fifth flat iron I have invested in. I am pleased with the results. The argan oil it comes with isn&#x27;t as great as I was led to believe by the reviews. It might be because it is such a small amount and I have thick hair. The iron itself works better than expected. It gets up to 450 degrees and it straightens and curls. The swivel cord is the best, takes away tangling frustration. I prefer this over the chi and babybliss.</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and it straightens without damaging.</li>
    <li> It did a great just flattening my thick hair on a high humidity day.</li>
    <li> Phenominal! My hair is quite curly, and I wear it both smooth probably half the time. This flat iron is the best one I have ever used! MUCH better than products which cost more. Quickly straightens, heats up very fast, and leaves hair smooth and SOFT! I bought this on the recommendation from my stylist, and I am so very glad I did. Buy it. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I needed a travel hair straightener that adjusted to the current in other countries.  I was well pleased with the product.  I will rate it a 4 because a hair product could rank no higher than a 4 in my mind.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best I have ever owned! Can&#x27;t beat the price for the quaility of product recieved. It reaches high termperatures that work great for unruly hair.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time as scheduled and I love it! It is an amazing flat iron that works wonders with thick hair!!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron!</li>
    <li> Compared to my last straightener, this one is smooth sailing! It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s pulling or tugging at my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this Flat Iron! I have used an Amika and a Chi and this is a far superior product for a great price! It heats very quickly and leaves my hair smooth and silky. My hair is color treated and I have to be careful or the heat can strip the color - not with this! Atlas supply provided very fast shipping and great followup to make sure I was satisfied. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am very impress with the results of this product . I use to be a chi girl but not anymore ! this  product really does what it said , my hair is so silky and soft I love the way it feels,. just unbelievable  I recommend this product yes for all types of hair  . love it love it.</li>
    <li> After my last trip to India, where my flat iron caught on fire even with the voltage adaptor and plug adaptor, I decided to order this iron with hopes that neither my iron nor my hair would catch on fire.  Neither caught on fire and the iron worked really well.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Arrived quickly, cut my &amp;#34;straightening&amp;#34; time down to about three minutes - from 15!  Bought a second one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned! !!!!</li>
    <li> Great product delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Works great. Glad i went with this one.</li>
    <li> This does everything as advertised.  As an added bonus, you get a glove and a case to store the straightener.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  I had one that I like but wanted a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; one. This flat iron is amazing!  I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and this works WONDERS on my hair.  They send a little sample of oil with this product and I ended up buying a BIG bottle of it.  You cannot go wrong with this flat iron!&#x60;&#x60;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price. Works well and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Wonderful ... Gets your hair really sleek and straight ... Really a great deal</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it !</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for my medium length hair.  It heats quickly, and is very effective in styling my hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I received my HSI Flat Iron a few weeks ago and I am very pleased with it.  I use it every day and am very happy with the results.  The glove and oil treatment were an added bonus.  I was hesitant to order this iron but after reading the reviews, I was confident that I would like it and I do.  The low cost made it a fantastic deal.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well on thick, heavy hair.  It gets very hot and the size is perfect for long hair.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron at a great price. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more! Came with silky case and glove, as well as tiny packet of hair oil.</li>
    <li> Works great and can&#x27;t beat the price.  Love being able to set the temp so I can tone it down on &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; days and turn it up on really humid &amp;#34;bad hair&amp;#34; days.</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought it after my hair dresser recommended it. The hair around my face was damaged by a curling iron that was too hot. I can put this on the lowertst setting and it takes out the friz. I can use it to put a little curl in it too.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good straightener for years. I have tried cheap ones and very expensive ones. This is by far the best I have ever owned. If I could give it 10 stars I would. My hair is very curly and thick so usually takes me about an hour to straighten it. I just got finished using this one for the first time and after 20 min my hair looks amazing! It&#x27;s soft, sexy and glossy. My husband just told me &amp;#34;WOW Honey I Didn&#x27;t Think I Would See You So QUickly done&amp;#34;.  If your looking at any brand this is the one! The glove is great for holding your hair... cause wow it&#x27;s hot!!!  I had to sit down right away and write this review. Everyone at work told me get a CHI. I was going to but so glad I didn&#x27;t. For the price ( which is a steal!!!!) this is the way to go!!! I read the reviews on everything I buy on Amazon so I hope this encourages someone else to buy this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have course hair and this flat iron has the tight closure and weight to straighten my hair like the salon</li>
    <li> BEST FLAT IRON!!!! It makes the hair so soft and silky especially using the argan oil first!!! Protects the hair and leaves a nice shine!!! Its better than a $100 iron!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg on a flat iron but I also didn&#x27;t want something cheap that didn&#x27;t get my hair shiny and straight. I live in Houston, TX which is crazy humid and this flat iron tames the frizz so I can wear my hair down during the summer. It heats up quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I really like the ability to change the temperature too.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! Gets all of the fuzz out... And keeps it out even with rain :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of hair straighteners over the years from the lower price range. There is definitely a big difference between this one and those. I&#x27;ve used some Chi straighteners that belonged to friends before I made this purchase and I was hoping that the HSI would be able to meet that level of quality. So far I definitely think that it has. It heats up super quickly and straightens my hair great. No complaints! I think it was a great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, bought it for a great price and works perfectly! It just to take me over an hour to do my hair now it just takes half the time and my hair looks beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is not a horrible product.... it does straighten hair.  It just was unable to straighten my daughter&#x27;s thick, naturally curly hair.  Should work fine for other hair types.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Got hot and straightened my thick hair.</li>
    <li> bought this after my old Sedu died. i can&#x27;t believe how cheap it was. so far so good. it fires up pretty quickly, too.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves it feeling silky and smooth! I agree that it works best with the HSI flat iron, but even without one, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> This was a great iron! My salon recommended this flat iron and this was an amazing price for a professional brand. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron!!  I am so glad I bought this one.  I read a lot of reviews about it and I was not disappointed.  I have used it for over a month now and have found it easy to use, very well made and an fast way to style my hair.</li>
    <li> I moved to a more humid part of the country and this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and, even though I&#x27;m still learning just how to do it, I am very happy with the results. It is a high quality product and I feel like I got a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I gave this flat iron to my daughter for her 17th birthday. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have owned so far.  It makes my frizzy hair smooth and shiny even in humid weather.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my fiancé and she loves it.</li>
    <li> After my Paul Mitchell flat iron died on me, I was skeptical to find something that worked as well on straightening my super curly hair without totally frying it. The HSI Professional definitely exceeded my expectations!! Now I can straighten my hair with minimal effort again and not have dryness or breakage from th heat. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Came fast. Heats up quickly. The only change I would make is that I wish the cord fit in the storage bag that it came with.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. Everyone that uses it loves it. Even my hair dresser. I have a thick head of hair and it&#x27;s great. Really recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for a while now and can say I am satisfied with it so far. I previously owned a Chi for over 10 years and was sad to see it go. Couldn&#x27;t make myself spend the $ when I needed a replacement (kids lol) saw this on sale and took a chance. Works great so far!</li>
    <li> The whole straightened hair with a curl at the end was what I was going for and it does the trick!</li>
    <li> I bought this in July 2011 &amp; it&#x27;s still the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m still using the same one that I&#x27;ve used EVERYDAY for the past four years. Even comes with a case so I use that to set the flat iron on. I got sick of spending so much money on CHI flat irons &amp; having them break and this works better than a CHI. It has a temperature dial so you can adjust it according to your hair type! It goes up to 410° F.</li>
    <li> My old flat iron died and I began the search for a replacement. My research suggested I try a ceramic one with tourmaline and I found this one. At first I didn&#x27;t like having the control dial inside but now realize it protects against me accidentally bumping it up or down. Also, the dial isn&#x27;t specific for temperature like a digital one is, but once I find a good temperature setting, I just keep it there. No problem. This iron doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as my old one. I&#x27;ve had to slow down and take more time with each pass of the iron, but when I do, it leaves my hair nicely straightened and soft. It&#x27;s  possible my old iron was too hot and was burning my hair. This one doesn&#x27;t do that. All in all, I love this new iron. I love the way my hair looks, but mostly I love how it feels--very soft. Also, this company was great to work with. I had some questions about the iron, so I contacted them and they responded right away. Such a good experience.</li>
    <li> The package came late! I have Amazon Prime, it should be two days. The straightener was scratched and it didn&#x27;t turn on at all! I thought maybe the on light was broken but it never heated up. Not to mention it DOES not come with Argan oil. Just buy a chi,that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do. I should&#x27;ve listened to those few 1 star reviews. I better not have to pay shipping to pay it back or I&#x27;ll be PISSED and will demand a refund! I&#x27;m so broke right now, I invested in this straightener, and I&#x27;m so mad. I&#x27;ll keep everyone updated.</li>
    <li> She use to have this item,her mom&amp;#34;borrowed it&amp;#34;end it was never returned. She&#x27;s very happy to have one back. Uses it daily.</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI Professional flat iron as a gift for a friend. I didn&#x27;t even have to ask her if she liked it, she was quick to report back to me that she loved it! She said it straightened her hair perfectly and was very pleased with it. I definitely plan to purchase one for myself after hearing her review of the product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get the HSI flat iron and could not wait to use it. I am dissapointed in it somewhat. It does not get as hot as I need it. I do not like the temp gauge that is on the inside of the iron. I miss my old flat iron.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money... This product did not work on my hair at all. (You have to burn your hair to get results) I regret not spending the money and getting a good product. I used it a few times and then invested a real flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener at a great price!  And it works so well on my very thick hair!  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Purchased by my wife.  She was very pleased at the ease of use while traveling through Europe.  Nothing of this quality in our local travel store.  She would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> It works very well!! Straightens the hair make beautiful curls and leave a shiny finish look..highly recommended for natural hair</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I thought it would make my hair shinier with the tourmaline but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Came very fast and love the oil that came with is great too!</li>
    <li> Awesome product for a great price!  Shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Very useful, the least expensive option. I am glad I bought it:))))</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described and delivery was quick.  This is a great product and I can highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  The other one I had was frying my hair and was hard to use.  This one leaves my hair smooth, never snags or pulls my hair and is so easy to use!  And to top it off, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Great for travel! Everything fits in pouch, and it&#x27;s cushioned!</li>
    <li> No complaints here! Easiest and best curling wand I&#x27;ve ever used! Curls last for a long time!</li>
    <li> This straightener is so HEAVY! You will wear out your arm from just 5 minutes of straightening. I was hoping that spending more money on one would have better results- my hair still had A LOT of frizz. Seemed the exact same as my cheap conair straightener.</li>
    <li> judging how well this product has been rated, i decided to purchase it. it&#x27;s awful. i really expected more from it. but, for such a cheap price i guess that&#x27;s the price i pay. no matter the highest setting i put it on.. usually two hours later my hair frizzes up. not to mention it poorly straightens it. i&#x27;ll never order from HSI Professionals again.</li>
    <li> I love this thing it works amazing. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. I&#x27;m amazed by how great it worked for the price I pay for it.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS PRODUCT! GREAT PRICE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It leaves my thick, wavy to curly, and frizzy hair, tamed and silky straight.&lt;br /&gt;It was a super price.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair straightener. Heats super fast and straightens with one pass. Love it! Would buy it again but won&#x27;t have too. :)</li>
    <li> Great hot iron for minimal use. I only straighten my hair about once a week or less. It&#x27;s just what I need. Heats up fast, cools down quickly. Easily storable.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about two weeks and everything is great so far. It heats up quickly, the plates are nice and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t catch or pull my hair.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!</li>
    <li> This product did not straighten my hair completely even after running it over my strands 2 or 3 times. I liked that the plates were well made and did not catch my hair but unfortunately I will be returning.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. Works great on medium heat setting for my fine hair. Gets rid of frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> excellent!  working as expected</li>
    <li> First I ordered this flat iron because the reviews were good. I ordered the basic one, but they sent me the digital one instead! The flat iron works great and straightens hair fast. They included a glove, a nice red pouch, and little packet of argan oil just as they advertised. This flat iron definitely is worth more than what they are selling it for. I recommend it %100. Thanks HSI for this AMAZING product!</li>
    <li> I have very stubborn hair and this worked better than the $250 one I just returned to Sephora. Delivery was fast, though I was nervous that it was left in front of my apartment door all day while I was at work. Since that&#x27;s on FedEx/Prime and not the seller, I didn&#x27;t factor that into the rating.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. It heats up super fast and works really well. Styling my hair is much easier than it used to be. The price is right too!</li>
    <li> grand daughter loved it and uses almost every day glad I was able to get something a teen girl likes</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever, heats properly, fast and is very manageable, it comes with gloves so you don&#x27;t have to purchase them separately. If you are looking for a good hair iron, look no more, GET THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews but in case anyone finds this helpful, I bought this specifically to use on my Kenner Blythe&#x27;s hair, to smooth and tame the frizz. It&#x27;s a labor-intessive process but it works! You have to get a straightener that is temperature controlled so you don&#x27;t melt your doll&#x27;s hair and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a new flat iron for awhile, so when I saw the HSI Professional at such a great price, I went ahead and bought it.  My old flat iron was not broken, but it wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job of getting my hair really straight.  The HSI, though, has worked wonderfully on my hair!  It heats up very quickly, and I love the digital display that allows me to tweak the iron&#x27;s temperature.  My hair gets perfectly straight with just one good pass through it; my old flat iron took several passes over the same section of hair to get somewhat straight.  I feel the quality of the HSI flat iron is equal to that of the flat iron used on my visits to the hair salon.  My hair looks silky after use, and it isn&#x27;t damaged by the heat.  Overall, this is a great flat iron, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love it and received it quickly!!!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent and my wife is really enjoying it. This is also a dual voltage Flat Iron product and so you can use it even outside USA.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small enough and heats up quickly. It is a little hard to see buttons without my glasses because the are inside the handle but that is the only issue.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY flat iron so so so so much.</li>
    <li> Like this iron very much, especially since I can easily take it on trips abroad!</li>
    <li> It works very well, and it&#x27;s a great price! I like that I can set the temperature and it gives the recommended temperatures for hair type. I have absolutely no complaints, it is an upgrade from my last one and I can do my hair in five minutes after I blow it dry. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this appliance to use on vacation to Europe.  I use my existing flat iron (Conair Infiniti) to style my hair into flat iron curls (look it up on YouTube if you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about).  The HSI flat iron does not work well at all for this styling technique.  The plates are too short in length to allow one to pull through larger sections at once, so I almost had to create individual ringlets using tiny sections of hair.  What&#x27;s more, the edges  the plates are too rounded to get a good tight 90 degree clamp on the hair while pulling it through to create the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I tested out this product at home before taking it to Europe.  Unfortunately, I assumed, based on the reviews, that this product would be flawless and thus threw out the packaging before I tried it... so now I can&#x27;t return it.  Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it does do a good job of simply straightening the hair, so if you are looking for an iron to use only for straight styles, this would probably be a good choice.  However, I did not find it versatile enough in its uses to meet my needs.  Will try to sell on ebay.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome! It turned my kinky 4a/4b hair into silky straight and shiny locks that had tons of body and bounce. It looked like I came from the salon. This seller also has amazing customer service. I would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price. Highly recommended was a gift for my wife and absolutely loved it ...yes ok</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> A great excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of all the positive reviews and ratings (and because I also needed a new hair straightner).  However, when I recieved the item, which was a day late, by the way, I noticed it is digitally controlled, which I don&#x27;t remember seeing on the description.  So, I still decided to try it out.  It heats up fast, however, the setting changes as I&#x27;m straightening my hair... it&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the price and the great reviews, and it really does live up to all the 5 stars it gets. For the price this iron is unbelievably great, best one I&#x27;ve ever had. I have curly Carrie Bradshaw type hair which can be pretty dry at the ends sometimes and looked really frayed when straightened, but with a little bit of the argan oil and this iron my is silky smooth with no fraying. I have no burning either. All the irons I&#x27;ve had have burned, frayed and damaged my hair a ton to the point where I had to stop using them, but this one doesn&#x27;t at all. Even when it&#x27;s not straightened it still feel really soft and not damaged afterward. I love the temperature gauge too, all my old irons where really vague but with this one I know exactly how hot it really is. I don&#x27;t ever turn it up all the way, my hair can&#x27;t handle that kind of heat, but even on a lower setting it still works great and lives up to it&#x27;s five stars.</li>
    <li> This straightener is a great price and it works amazingly! I have naturally wavy hair, it takes my hair from wavy to stick straight! I do use the heat protective oil on my hair before straightening. This helps too!</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron! I have long, thick hair that I don&#x27;t like to wash too often (dries out my hair) but I like my hair to look polished. This flat iron has my hair looking great for DAYS. I wash, dry, flat iron and then can let it go. I simply spray dry shampoo at night and clip hair half up.&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is easy to use (although still learning how to curl hair with it) and my hair turns out soft, shiny &amp; smooth. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. don&#x27;t bother paying more - great value!!</li>
    <li> Really great product.</li>
    <li> I love that you can control the heating on the iron. It does an awesome job straightening my hair and taking out the frizz.</li>
    <li> cord doesn&#x27;t swivel. difficult to tell what setting you have it on. burns your hair</li>
    <li> Loved it!  Amazing to how much nicer this is compared to what I was using. Leaves my hair softer and shinier!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after being very disappointed with the CHI Sapphire hair straightener I was gifted for Christmas. This straightener was 100% better than the CHI and a fraction of the cost! I love that it comes with a glove and the sample oil works well. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a high end product that is affordable.</li>
    <li> Have had for about a month or so and LOVE this flat iron so far. Heats up quickly, durable cord that&#x27;s just the right length, and works great for straightening or using to curl/wave hair. Leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> If you are considering purchasing an item from blue novelties, hesitate no longer. Their items are always top notch and wonderfully priced. When I am looking for hair line products, I will always search their inventory first. I have purchased from them before and yet to be disappointed</li>
    <li> I got it in 2 days and my girl tells me it is her most favorite in a very long time. when she plugs it in, the temperature increases immediately and becomes very hot less than a minute! great product. :)</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! It works as well as the Chi flat iron I had without paying a fortune for it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the temp. Guage it&#x27;s hard to tell what temperature you have it on. I had it all the way to the max.400 but it didn&#x27;t seem to reach that temp. I prefer the digital flat iron that reaches it&#x27;s temp. In seconds.</li>
    <li> I find it a little difficult to use this but I think with a bit more practice, I will get there.  Wonder why there is such a gap between the &amp;#34;arms&amp;#34; - and that the on-off switch as well as the settings is between the arms, which makes it difficult too</li>
    <li> Due to all the good reviews I decided to try it as a replacement to my 7 year old paul mitchell. The is by far one of the worst hair straightners I have ever used. It snags my hair and my hair looks frizzy. Still cannot believe how this product could have so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> Works very well and with the sale price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> We ordered this to replace an aging Tool Science iron from Sally&#x27;s. we are happy with its performance. Be mindful that it does not turn itself off. I have noticed that there are times when it will catch a hair or two... not a deal breaker. The one I purchased from Amazon had a Bonus sample of Argan Oil with it. Was disappointed to find a little foil packet only instead of the little bottle they showed in the listing. None the less, the oil works AMAZING!!! So much so, we went and purchased the oil separately. My daughters hair feels and looks like those on the TV commercials now. It has to be the oil. Don&#x27;t skip buying it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Comes with argan oil for your hair, a great carrying sleeve, even a glove! And it came super fast.</li>
    <li> It is a great product for the price. It did not leave my hair as I was hoping for like my previous flat irono but it will do.</li>
    <li> After reading some very terrific reviews, I decided to give in and purchase this straightener.  At the end of the day, it is nothing professional but just a regular product.  I am definitely going back to purchasing my Chi that I have always depended on.</li>
    <li> My lady LOVES these flat irons!!! Before these, she hated doing her own hair....her hair would never come out right....NOW I can&#x27;t keep her out of her head!!! She doesn&#x27;t even go to her beautician as much now!! She says she can get the same quality at home now!!! DEFINITELY a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I got this to replace my ancient Revlon after I noticed my hair was taking forever to straighten. I have very curly, shoulder length 3a/3b hair, and it takes me about five minutes to straighten all the curls out. My husband even commented how much softer and shinier my hair was after using this, and he never notices stuff like that. ;) Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I have found nothing wrong with this very affordable straightner. Best part about it- is that it does NOT catch stray hairs. That was a common problem I had in the past with other straigners- EVEN MY OLD CHI. Love the swivel cord. Only thing I say is look on the logo side- outside to see the tiny little red light that shines when it is on.... I couldnt find it to save my life the first week I had it. Finally I saw it very dimmly shinning. And it is VERY dim lol.</li>
    <li> It does a wonderful job on my thick, wavy hair! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was expecting the iron to do better than my generic one.  Unfortunately, there was not much difference.  It does get the job done though.</li>
    <li> I have never owned anything other than a Chi...this was 1/3 of the price of a Chi and it works just as well if not better!!!!</li>
    <li> After 2.5 months of not much use - I probably only use it once or twice a week- the ceramic plate has cracked on the side and two big chips have fallen off of it.  Before that I was mostly happy with the straightener although I&#x27;ve used better for my very frizzy, naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter says this works well although, it stated that it came with the Aragon oil. The package was there but it was completely empty. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gets hot and works on my thick wavy hair. Has the control dial which is nice. Definitely worth what I paid for it on here.</li>
    <li> Ive used this hair straightener twice already and i&#x27;m really satisfied. It straightens good and made my hair feel smooth and shiny. Its great, i love it! You wont be disappointed, trust me :)</li>
    <li> THIS IS A LONG REVIEW, BUT I SUGGEST READING BEFORE MAKING THIS PURCHASE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware that Blue Novelties sells FAULTY MERCHANDISE &amp; has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I am not one to write a negative review, I usually try to at least pick out the positives in an item and review on that. However, I am extremely dissatisfied with this straightener. I have had about 10 different flat irons throughout my life. The last one I owned was the Jilbere de Paris Porcelain 1\\&quot;. It lasted for 4 years and worked wonders for my long thick hair. It finally gave out and I started doing research to see which one I should purchase next. I seriously spent a very long time looking into tons of brands and reading all the customer reviews. Because in the end, the company will always talk highly of a product but the customer will be honest!!&lt;br /&gt;  There are quite a few reviews on this one and the majority were extremely positive but there were about 10% that said the product was a flat out waste. I decided on the HSI 1\\&quot; despite the negative reviews hoping I was going to be part of the 90% with an amazing straightener. I was SO excited when it came in the mail and it even came with an adorable red silk carrying case AND the hair oil sample.&lt;br /&gt;  I plugged it in right away to test it out. I let it sit for about 5 minutes before trying it thinking that would be long enough to heat up. I went through one strand and it did nothing, so I figured maybe I should turn up the heat. This repeated for the next 15 minutes. I had it turned on the highest it would go and let it heat up for 20 minutes! I used it on my whole head of hair. When I was finished I had wavy PUFFY hair!!! I could even wrap my hand around the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; plate and it didnt even burn at all, it felt like a luke warm bathtub!&lt;br /&gt;  I contacted Amazon and they made it super simple to return! They even had delivery pickup scheduled to get it from my house. (Unfortunately this review is about the product not Amazon!)I got an email from Blue Novelties asking about how I liked my purchase, I wasn&#x27;t going to say anything to them, but since they asked I replied about my experience. Instead of going through all the hassle of them checking it out, sending me a new one, the possibility of that one being crap also and blah blah blah, I just went ahead and ordered the Jilbere de Paris that I previously owned.&lt;br /&gt;  I told Blue Novelties this in the email I sent them along with what happened when I attempted to straighten my hair with their product. In response someone from customer service replied,&lt;br /&gt;  AND I QUOTE: \\&quot;mmmm. it doesn&#x27;t sound right. It might be a defective one, its very unusual but it could happen. would you like me to send a replacement asap?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT REPLIES TO A CUSTOMER AND SAYS \\&quot;mmmmmm\\&quot; AND THAT IT DOESNT SOUND RIGHT?! I even went back to look at the negative feedback associated with this purchase and almost every one states that it didn&#x27;t heat up and they had the SAME problems with the straightener as I did. So NO it is not \\&quot;very unusual\\&quot;. ALSO I specifically stated I already purchased a diff flat iron and didn&#x27;t want a replacement!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I am appalled at the service and product from this company all the way around. I will not be shopping with them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware that Blue Novelties sells FAULTY MERCHANDISE &amp; has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant about buying this flat iron. I saw that the listed price was close to $200 and it was \\&quot;on sale\\&quot; for $50 which made me think it was too good to be true. After reading dozens of reviews that said it was a good flat iron I went ahead and purchased it. Man, I sure do wish I didn&#x27;t!!! What a piece of junk! The only reason I was buying a new flat iron was because I had dropped mine and the ceramic plate broke. I have thick wavy in some parts, curly in other parts hip length hair. I love my hair, especially when I straighten it, which is pretty much every week. But this flat iron is junk. Not only will it not straighten my hair, it won&#x27;t even flatten it. It leaves it looking frizzy, dull, hard to brush through, don&#x27;t even think about trying to run your fingers through it, and it destroyed the ends of my hair as well. Please be advised that if you like your hair and are looking for a good product that this IS NOT the one to buy. This did nothing but waste my money and destroy my hair. I will be returning it ASAP!!!</li>
    <li> it gets nice and hot and so much bette than a chi and half the cost! My teenager loved it!</li>
    <li> First of all,&lt;br /&gt;the shipping was incredibly fast..I didn&#x27;t expect it to be waiting on my doorstep so quick.&lt;br /&gt;On to the product.&lt;br /&gt;When I used it this morning for a date with my best girlfriends, I didn&#x27;t expect for it to heat so quickly and smoothly. The iron slid down my hair in one nice glide and one glide was enough to straighten my hair perfectly along with a beautiful sheen, accompanied by the wonderful Argan oil that comes with the straightner. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair...it was so soft! The end result was nothing short of perfect. I&#x27;m highly satisfied with the quality of this product, and I will surely recommend it to all my girlies.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was excellent as well, the straightner came with this sweet red satin case for storing away, along with your other products.</li>
    <li> Works great on all hair types. My daughters love it and its easy gor them to use. I would recommend this straightener...I think its better than the chi.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase. It works well, and arrived swiftly. I would recommend it to others. It heats and cools quickly, and works better than other straighteners I&#x27;ve owned and used that cost nearly twice as much.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing all the thousands of positive reviews. I went into it not sure what to expect, since the negative reviews did seem to have merit. I guess my opinion of the product falls somewhere in between. I have wavy-ish, frizzy-ish, long red hair. Normally I just let it air dry naturally, but recently got bangs and wanted them to look sleek. I had an 80 Euro straightener from Europe that I recently gave to my sister so I was looking for a replacement. I bought this one at the same time as a Conair Infiniti straightener that I found for $15 to compare the two. I ended up keeping this one because it was just enough better than the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At high temperatures, this straightener is pretty great. My bangs get straight in no time, and stay that way for at least a day. There&#x27;s no frizz and my hair doesn&#x27;t ever get caught, which was a big must for me. However, it still takes ages to get the rest of it straight, and the wavier parts by my crown don&#x27;t get straight no matter what. And forget about using this at a lower temperature setting - nothing happens unless it&#x27;s more than 3/4 of the way to the maximum. But that being said, it was cheap and it works to straighten my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder about the product&#x27;s authenticity - the sticker warning attached to the outlet plug has some ungrammatical English - &amp;#34;If it does not turn on. Press firmly on reset button&amp;#34;. I would expect that a real $200 straightener would pay closer attention to its labels. Also, while the box has a picture of a small glass jar of Argan oil, what was actually contained in the box was a one-use sealed pouch. So that was a bit disappointing, although many of the reviewers said they&#x27;d found the same thing. So for $40 this was a good purchase, but I&#x27;m sure there are much better straighteners out there. This one hasn&#x27;t revolutionized my life or anything like the positive reviews made me think it would.</li>
    <li> this product does straighten my fine hair nicely, however it pulls hair out with ever use. I would not purchase this product again if I was given an oportunity</li>
    <li> The delivery was pretty fast. I am natural so I was a little worried about heat damage but with this flat iron it flat ironed my kinky curly hair pretty fast and evenly. Definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my daughter. She likes it alot.  She says it is better for her hair than previous flat irons.</li>
    <li> Its a good product works good,I had others before but this I do like it more its easy to use</li>
    <li> I know the original price of this product is almost 200 dollars because I saw in the webpage.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, but it has a scratch on iron pad, that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, good product!&lt;br /&gt;Hope it does not broken soon.</li>
    <li> Hair gets snagged on plates and pulled out. If not for that it&#x27;d be ok. I&#x27;d never pay $200 for it.</li>
    <li> Got it for someone as a gift it works perfect. Compact and it gets nice and hot! Came with a very nice pouch as well and overall, solid piece of hardware. Def recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to smooth out certain sections of my hair.  I have fine hair so I am still experimenting with the heat setting, and getting use to using a flat iron.  It appears to be a well made iron, works great, I recommend!</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations! Great customer service and awesome price for the quality. I was a little skeptical but it was definitely everything they said! Do be advised, there is NO auto shut off on this straightener. I was not aware of this when I bought it but it hasn&#x27;t affected the value of the product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Its great . I just wish it would get a lil more hotter but I love the results and everything that came along</li>
    <li> Great flatiron, great price!  I recommend this flatiron to anyone in the market for a new one and is not willing to pay the price for the high priced models.  I have naturally curly hair and this iron is able to make my hair stick straight and I don&#x27;t even have to put product in my hair to get it to work.  It has a fairly long cord and heats up quickly.  It comes with heat resistant gloves, which I haven&#x27;t used yet.  Not sure I really need them, but it&#x27;s nice to have if I decide I ever do.  It also comes with a small sample sized packet of hair oil. I&#x27;ve not opened that either, but I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil, so I have an idea of what it will do.  It also comes with a carrying bag, which I assume is heat resistant.  I honestly can&#x27;t remember if that&#x27;s what the product description says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a new flatiron, I don&#x27;t think this one would disappoint you.</li>
    <li> good for my curly hair and same quality or better of a CHI. I usethis one in a daily basis and I doesn&#x27;t burn my hair as much.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new flat iron after I let my expensive one at a hotel. I gave this one a try, and am very pleased! It heats up fast, the 1 inch size is perfect, it gets really hot (I have thick curly hair, and use the middle temperature!). Only down side is that is doesn&#x27;t turn off automatically. Because of this, you SHOULD buy the holder that comes separately to keep it out of reach if you do forget to turn it off. Great buy, GREAT price!</li>
    <li> I really love this. I have naturally thick, curly hair and it works great. Other flatirons I have tried leave my hair kind of stiff. This one leaves it so much more smoother,  moveable, and bouncy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a flat iron before but I really love the feel and quality of this iron.  I think it&#x27;s perfect!  I can&#x27;t wait to show my daughters :)  They&#x27;ll love it!  Thank you for your wonderful and fast customer service.  I enjoyed doing business with you!</li>
    <li> I have another expensive brand straightener but this one is so much better. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like the other one and straightens so much faster! This was a great buy!</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace my CHI flat iron that mysteriously stopped working one day. Very happy with this flat iron, It gets very hot and gets my hair very straight. I&#x27;ve had an issue with my hair getting caught under the plates and pulling with previous flat irons, but not with this one. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet.</li>
    <li> I love it!it makes my hair become softer and more straight,really good product!I would like to recommend to people who wants a straight hair!nice!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves it. Works great even on her thick wavy hair. I am going to purchase another one for my other daughter.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this straightener. I have fine, straight hair and while I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t take too much to straighten my hair, I feel that this does a great job leaving my hair looking very healthy and delightfully straight. My order didn&#x27;t come with the hair oil sample, but after contact with the company I had it in my hands within a week!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and plates are small enough to straighten short hair.</li>
    <li> The iron itself feels very high quality. My only complaint is the cord. If you&#x27;ve ever owned or used professional tools you know the power cord is very thick, but very flexible. The first thing I noticed was the power cord was like any cheap flatiron I could purchase at a big box store. Unfortunately this makes me question the quality of the areas that are not visible. Time will tell and for the price it is much better than flatirons of the same price at big box stores. As for straightening I can&#x27;t see a huge difference, but is slightly better. I haven&#x27;t used it much because of my new blowdryer allowing me to straighten while drying without hardly any frizz. Now that product I love!!!</li>
    <li> Compares to the Chi and is much less expensive! Received it very quickly, I really like it but remains to be seen how long it will last. Hopefully longer than my previous Chi purchases which would usually only last 6 months to a year. But for the price difference I would recommend it requardless even if it only lasts up to a year.</li>
    <li> Loved it(: and I have thick wavy hair. Gets the job done !</li>
    <li> My girl friend loves it plus her mom does hair and says it&#x27;s up there with the ones they use at work plus there way cheaper</li>
    <li> Love this hair straighter! Shipped fast and arrived within 4 days. The packaging was nice especially the travel pouch that it comes in. I don&#x27;t use oil in my hair so i actually threw the sample out. Also there was one glove in the box. I did not understand what for. So that was disposed of as well. The straighter itself is awesome as it heats fast and can straighten larger portions of my hair which shortens my getting ready time in the morning.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this iron, i prefer to use my old one (alizz 3D)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. My hair is pretty straight as it is. This adds some shine to it. Use it every so often. I think its pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with it and it is easy to use. I am ordering hair oil from the same company. Will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I liked the flat iron. It works good. The argan oil is excellent.  Good price and good item.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and a very good price.  Works better then some that cost over $100.  Love my HSI</li>
    <li> The price is totally worth it and the quality of hair straightener is fantastic, thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -Happy Customer</li>
    <li> Purchased based on reviews.  I find that it does an ok job straightening my very thick coarse hair, but it does pull and grab the hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my wife and a month later it stopped working. We tried to exchange for one that works but we have missed the return window by 10 days. We believe that this flat iron should be exchanged due to my wife only used it for a month!!! HORRIBLE product!!! DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it, nice price, great product and does the job! Also HUGE for me is it doesn&#x27;t snag or catch your hair!</li>
    <li> Very good iron for the price. We had a very old one that took forever to do my daughters hair. This one came with a glove so you don&#x27;t burn your hand and a nice case plus a sample of the oil. The iron is so nice that I haven&#x27;t had to do my daughters hair. She can now do if herself.</li>
    <li> I gave this as gift. She loved it and the fact that she can use it while traveling internationally.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I wanted a professional iron that would protect my hair without spending $100+ on an iron.  I have fine, thin hair, and this flat iron does a great job of smoothing my hair.  It heats up as fast as it says it does, it comes with a nice padded sleeve for travel/storage and a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this straightener.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The flat iron I ordered doesn&#x27;t heat as well as I expected, and it doesn&#x27;t turn itself off automatically after a given time (which is bad for someone like me who always forgets to turn it off!).  It&#x27;s fine, but I expected more, I guess, from a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving a 4-star rating is more for the company I bought it from than the product itself.  Shortly after my purchase they contacted me about writing a review.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily want to write a review since I didn&#x27;t have high praise for the product, so I politely declined and told them their price and shipping were fantastic, but the product itself left something to be desired, and left it at that.  I did not expect a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They immediately responded saying that I might have gotten a defective one and could they ship  me a replacement?  Uhm....sure!  I&#x27;m not sure whether I got a defective one or not, but seriously, what amazing customer service!  High praise for Blue Novelties, the company I ordered from.  It&#x27;s nice to see a company that stands behind their products, and even more, offers such above and beyond customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo, Blue Novelties!</li>
    <li> It heats up fast.  Has an automatic shut off and even has adjustable temperature!  Definitely well worth the money!  It will travel with me wherever i go!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is easy to use and does a great job. Many other comparable irons cost double so this one is beyond worth the money. Would recommend it to anyone who asked.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry, very fine, color-treated and permed so it has a tendency to get very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tourmaline ionic flat iron was demonstrated on my hair in a shopping mall last week. I liked how well it tamed my frizz and left my hair soft and shiny. I was all set to buy until I found out it cost $250.00!! I&#x27;m not willing to pay that kind of money for a flat iron so naturally I went straight to Amazon.com to find a comparable item for a better price. After reading the reviews of several models, I selected \\&quot;HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the item arrived super fast. It was nicely packaged and included an attractive carrying bag, a heat glove and a trial size bottle of Argan oil. The flat iron has a swivel cord and adjustable temperature control. The Argan oil smelled nice and really helped with my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HSI flat iron left my hair soft and silky smooth. My teenagers, who have owned at least 5 flat irons between them, say mine works better than any of the ones they have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price. The HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener gives excellent results and is a great bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> This straightener is worse than any Walmart brand I&#x27;ve ever used. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough. I bought a $7 straightener right after I got this, and it works SO much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for about a month now and I absolutely LOVE it! Not only does it heat quickly at 410 degrees, but it leaves my hair looking shiny and feeling soft. I also use it to curl my hair because it curls my hair better than my actual curling iron. It arrived in record time and came with a red pouch for storage,a glove, and argon oil. If you have any hesitations about purchasing this product, forget about your worries! You won&#x27;t regret it. 5 Stars this product is EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with these straighteners - they are narrow enough that I can get close into my roots (and avoid an inch long curly wave at my roots).  The argan oil sample that came with the straighteners is also very nice and seemed to make a difference to my hair - it felt smoothy and less tangled, and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair greasy.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; daughter live this product and their hair has never looked better. My wife looks 10 years younger :)</li>
    <li> My old flat iron that I had for over 7 years finally went to flat iron heaven.  So I began my search for a new one through the trusty ol&#x27; Amazon reviews.  This product was one of the first ones that popped up when I searched for highest rated, and, once again, was not let down by the Amazon community.  It feels heavy and durable, gets hot quick, and does the job!  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t had ANY problems.  I hope this one lasts as long as my last one did!</li>
    <li> I love how this straightner doesnt leave your hair dry. Its the best. I just bought it and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron works exactly as advertised. It works just as well as my last flat iron by Ion (from Sally Beauty Supply) - which I loved. I use Mizani Iron Curl after washing and before blow drying. The combination of the Mizani Iron Curl and the HSI Flat Iron makes my thick curly hair bone straight and smooth as silk. It also comes with a pretty carrying case and sample of argan oil too! Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a flat iron that works effectively the first time and every time.</li>
    <li> I sent the item to my daughter because of the wonderful reviews you had one the iron.  She has only had the item since April and it won&#x27;t work!!!!!!! I can&#x27;t return it because of the restrictions.  She has tried numerous times to turn it on and it won&#x27;t go on.&lt;br /&gt;I have had beauty items that have lasted for years!!!  It was a real disappointment with all the terrific reviews you had. My daughter doesn&#x27;t even use it every month!!  Thanks alot.</li>
    <li> This ionic flat iron is a great buy--retails for about 5 times the Amazon price &amp; really does the job!  Easy to hold &amp; the open &amp; close action is very smooth &amp; controllable.  Comes with a nice case &amp; heat glove as well as a small sample of argan oil.  Very impressed so far with the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener!</li>
    <li> I am sure there are better straighteners out there. After using the CHI straightener for 5 years I was excited to try something new, but this just worked the same or worse than the CHI! Do not get me wrong- it will straighten your hair better than most store bought straighteners just know there are better products out there.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit about my hair-&lt;br /&gt;Long, thick and curly!&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was not impressed</li>
    <li> Had my eye on this flatiron for a while. The great price made me transfer it from the wish list to the shopping cart. LOL.I added the HSI leave in, straighten, and curled my hair with this flat iron. My hair was left smooth, shiny, bouncy and soft looking. My hair eased through the plates without any snags. Received a satin pouch with a thermal lining inside, 5ml hsi leave in, and a glove. The swivel cord made using this product effortless. I&#x27;m very pleased. The side bonus of hsi made with argan oil made me a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking over reviews for different products when I ran across this product. The HSI styler so far has been great. The price was awesome so I had to give it a try. My hair had never been straighter and I have super thick hair. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair, quick-heating, and comes with a glove and case. I use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> Works better then my chi did. Heats up fast and does a great job taming my wild hair!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my first hair iron I have owned. I have naturally very straight, very fine, but very dense hair. My stylist recommended I try a straightening iron to get the type of curl I wanted, and for that purpose this iron works well. I haven&#x27;t yet used the argan oil or the glove, as I haven&#x27;t found the glove necessary (read: no burns yet), and I already own a bottle of argan oil. Overall, I like this product and I would definitely recommend based on the price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seller also emailed me repeatedly, before I even got around to using the iron to make sure I was fully satisfied with it. So I would say the customer service is also very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid buy.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for about a month and I really liked it, but I accidentally dropped it and the ceramic plate broke already! I was bummed because even my cheap straightener that I had for 2 years had dropped a few times and never broke.</li>
    <li> Honestly I thought I had ordered the CHI, my mistake since I was in a hurry but this item works just as good if not better than a chi. Low price and it was delivered a couple of days before I expected it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I read all reviews and they were great.&lt;br /&gt;When I received the iron it doesn&#x27;t curl, as it should.  Takes tons to heat up, unless I received a defective one :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would return but I think it&#x27;s too late : /</li>
    <li> Being someone with extremely thick and curly hair, not all flat irons work so well but this one was awesome!  It took a lot less time and did break your hair off like some others do.  It seriously, left my hair soft and shiny and no one would ever know I had extremely thick and extremely course, curly hair.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am NOT a &amp;#34;spend hours on your hair daily&amp;#34; kind of person. I have blonde, straight hair that lays limp unless it&#x27;s pulled back in an updo or straightened. I have tried MANY (cheap) straighteners to try to get a system down that I could tolerate and didn&#x27;t just frustrate me further, and this is the item that did it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heats up quickly, gets VERY hot if you want it (but is adjustable, too), and is a very versatile tool for both straightening and curling. I&amp;#34;m still no pro at doing my own hair, but this tool makes me feel like less of an idiot when it comes to simple styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would even go so far as to say I more than &amp;#34;tolerate&amp;#34; using this item... I actually enjoy it! (And that&#x27;s saying something for this no-fuss low-maintenance girl!)</li>
    <li> Awesome seller! Awesome product! Great price and very fast shipping! I was very satisfied with everything and if I ever need a hair straightener in the future, I would like to purchase again!</li>
    <li> All in all this purchase surprised me. I have used chi in the past and am impressed that it matches pretty closely in the same quality. The heat indicator is a dial, and doesn&#x27;t indicate how hot the iron is which is annoying. I have fine curly hair that has a tendency to frizz. It does an excellent job styling. And holding the style. It get hot. I mean REALLY hot. I have yet to do my hair on the hottest setting. I threw out the oil it came with, it made my hair too greasy. The satin heat proof bag is cute and make putting away the iron easy and safe.</li>
    <li> I was a CHI flat iron user. After replacing it twice, I decided to purchase another brand. I love the way HSI leaves my hair. My hair looks healthy and straight. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I love that I can have the look I want in less time than with my previous Iron.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is so awesome!  Heats up super quick and it leaves hair feeling soft and silky!  It is great when I don&#x27;t feel like keeping my naturally curly hair and straightening it out is so quick and easy!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I really like the flat iron. It heats up really fast and love that it gets as hot as it does. My hair is hard to curl but with the extra heat I can keep the curl for longer</li>
    <li> My new favorite toy. The HSI flat iron came packaged with a few sweet surprises. The seller packed in a sample of HSI Argan Oil, as well as bonus HSI Heat Resistant Glove that retails on its own on Amazon for $10. I had actually planned on purchasing this later. So I was pleasantly surprised to see it in my box. The flat iron itself comes with a heat resistant pouch for storage. The iron is amazing. AMAZING.  I have had both a Chi and a GHD and this far exceeded the quality of both. This boasts floating plates that have yet to snag my hair, and again, to my content, a longer swiveling 7 foot cord. The 1\\&quot; plates heat up from 140F to 410F and can be used to straighten, flip and curl your hair. The plates contain both ceramic and tourmaline making this a major selling point for anyone who has curly, frizzy hair. {Tourmaline in the plates increases negative ions which balance hair to drastically reduce static and frizz while ceramic disperses heat evenly for fast, safe styling sealing cuticles to lock in moisture and leave hair smooth and shiny.} It offers flash heating,  and once hot, the iron stays evenly heated until you turn it off. For me, this is a single pass iron, I had no need to go back and smooth over with a second pass. All the reviews on Amazon were right, this a superior product to any of the brand irons on the market. I highly suggest this iron, definitely get it while it&#x27;s on the big sale if you can! I don&#x27;t know how long it will be before it&#x27;s back at the $300 price point. Even if you buy it then, it&#x27;s worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To recap, you get a professional ceramic and tourmaline infused iron with swiveling 7 foot cord with floating plates that heat up from 140 to 410 degrees Farenheit for $40. For the time being. Remember this is a $300 iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am intensely happy with my purchase, and put my name behind them as outstanding quality products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, check out my beauty blog at southerngorgeous.blogspot.com!.com!</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron. Easy to use, with temperature gauges. Leaves hair smooth and flat. Not worth spending more than $50 or $60 on it, but for under that price this iron works very well.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener from Blue Novelties on Amazon.  I needed a new straightener because mine stopped working.  When I received the package I was surprised to find out that this item works internationally on 220 volts as well as here in the United States.  This information was not apparent in the item description.  However, this is important because we are taking a trip to Europe later this year and I really depend on my straightener to keep my hair from frizzing in the humidity.  I understood from friends that the standard 220 volts they have in Europe would burn up any hair dryer or other small appliance purchased here in the United States so I was prepared to buy another one when we arrived at our destination.  Now I don&#x27;t need to!  Along with my new straightener, I received a hand mitt to keep from burning my hand and a small bottle of argon oil.  The package also included a very nice quilted storage bag for the straightener.  I am very pleased with the quality of item received and with the fast shipping by Blue Novelties.  I will look to them next time I&#x27;m searching for a beauty item!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every pricey flat iron on the market. This one is by far my favorite. For the price, it is definitely worth a try!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product-it is truly the best flat iron I have purchased ever. Works very well. I have frizzy, and thick hair and this works so well on my hair to flatten it and make it smooth. Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair either.</li>
    <li> When my professional brand flat iron saw it&#x27;s last day after 4+ years of service I nearly cried, knowing how much I would have to spend to replace it.  But, since I buy nearly everything based on customer reviews I felt confident in buying this one even though it was significantly less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been completely satisfied with my purchase.  It heats up fast and does the job very well.  I have not noticed any difference between this one and my previous expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer!</li>
    <li> I have three daughters, we all have long hair and this is by far the best straightener! best value too! Recommend Highly!!!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with product have very tight frizzy relaxed hair,only issue was trying to register on products website that is totally fouled up.</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with the product, as well as the efficiency in which it was sent. Thank you! I&#x27;ve been wanting a hair straightener that could be used in other countries.. I HAVE a unit already, that is not usable for this purpose, without any extra plugs. I love how IT performs, so I was sure that this one would also be great, and it is.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling tool that works great!  I have tried many and this is the best one so far!!!  I am very happy with it and the price was right!</li>
    <li> This works great! I don&#x27;t have to spend extra time going over the same piece of hair multiple times because it straightens the first time around. worth every penny so far!</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener. My hair is a pain to straighten and this is the best working straightener I have used yet. My only complaint is that it does not automatically switch off like some do. I unfortunately forget to unplug it when I&#x27;m in a hurry and it has stayed on for up to 12 hours before I realize my mistake.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research about hair straighteners before deciding on this one, I am happy with my purchase.  The straightener heats up quickly to a high temperature.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that my hair does catch on the Irons from time to time.  That would be my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying I am a flat iron co-dependent!!! I went to visit my mom this summer and after she did so much for me and my girls, I could not say NO when she asked me if she could keep my CHI. I&#x27;ve had that CHI for 5 years, paid top $$$ for it and it was hard for me to say \\&quot;sure!\\&quot;. Browsing online for a new flat iron I came across this one and liked all the positive reviews but the price was even more attractive. Why not? I would give it a try and not spend a lot. First try...I was in love with it! I have ethnic caribbean background and my hair is little hard to handle, reason why I have spent money in the past buying expensive flat irons. One thing for sure, always use it with your favorite oil or serum. They send you a free sample of a good argan oil. Don&#x27;t ever think you will have to pay top money to own a professional flat iron, I just found out myself.</li>
    <li> I like the adjustment ability it saves me from burning my hair. Never had a variable heat flat iron before and I think this is my new favorite. And the price was awsome. That&#x27;s what see said.</li>
    <li> Total professional experience! Design prevents you from burning your scalp when straightening from roots to ends&lt;br /&gt;- wich is great!!! I&#x27;ve had professional flat irons before, but this one is definitely THE BEST!!! Strong, solid product with delicate touch that leaves your hair silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil smells great and protect ends from splitting.&lt;br /&gt;(I got a little sample, but I&#x27;m definitely giong to order a full size bottle)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend HSI Flat Iron to every girl and woman out there!&lt;br /&gt;MUST HAVE ITEM !!! CLICK THE LINK AND ORDER NOW ----&gt; (http://www.amazon.com/HSI-Styler-Ceramic-Tourmaline-Straightener/dp/B001MA0QY2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1346868543&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;HSI+The+Styler+Ceramic+Tourmaline+Ionic+Flat+Ir)&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE! BIG SAVINGS! (That&#x27;s one of the reasons I got it in a first place :) )&lt;br /&gt;-----&gt; Get it and look fabulous :D &lt;-----</li>
    <li> This item arrived exactly as expected and in a very reasonable time frame. I have already used the product a few times and it works wonderfully!! I used to have a chi before this one, and I actually think this straightener works better and is not as damaging to my hair, since I can control the heat setting.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long, curly hair and recently moved to an area where it is ALWAYS humid.  I have tried numerous flat irons (Babyliss, Rusk, Chi) and went to hair stylists to straighten my hair, but as soon as I walked outside it would curl back up.  I wasn&#x27;t expexting this flat iron to do much but the price seemed reasonable.  THIS IS THE ONLY FLAT IRON and serum I will be using. My hair stylist was so shocked by the results-completed by myself in approx. 30 min that she went and bought this flat iron to use on her clients!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Grea product at a great price. My old Chi broke and I wanted another good straightener (I use it everyday). The price and reviews on this one seemed good. I used it for the first time today and I love it. I like that is has multple heat setting options and the light turns green when it&#x27;s warmed up. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or make it static.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron....I was actually looking for a 1 1/2&amp;#34; or 2&amp;#34;, but the reviews were good and the price was right on this one.  So glad I made the choice, it is GREAT!  The only feature I wish was included is an automatic shutoff after a period of time with no use.</li>
    <li> First off, this has not and never will be a $300 &#x27;salon-quality&#x27; item. This is a $40 item. If you paid more for it, then you probably paid too much. Because honestly, this does almost exactly what my $30 Revlon straightener did when I was in middle school. No, it does not reduce frizz. No, it does not create shine. And contrary to popular belief, straightening is not \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; and cannot be, no matter HOW wonderful your flat iron is, because consistently applying heat to your hair can only cause damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a drugstore-quality iron, this is it. It will make your hair straight-ER - will it make it fully straight? It may or may not. I don&#x27;t have thick, curly, or even very wavy hair. In fact, after blow-drying, my hair is already mostly straight. I only usually need to run over it a few times with a flat iron to make it look presentable. But this was a disappointing item. The reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars, not three (because it is a very AVERAGE flat iron) is because of what I feel is false advertising. They market this item as if it&#x27;s used in salons (it&#x27;s not), that it&#x27;s a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; quality iron (it isn&#x27;t) and that you&#x27;re saving hundreds of dollars on it (you&#x27;re really buying a $40 item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a CHI that I found to be disappointing as well, and that was a $150 iron. So yes, for $40 this is a great buy. But if I were you, I&#x27;d save a few extra dollars up and put it towards an FHI Platform, a Hai Elite, an Amika, even a Corioliss. The only true PRO to this item is that there is a temperature control; it&#x27;s very important. Most hair types should only have a heat of 320-370 applied to them. Hair that is very thick or curly may be able to take a little more heat, but you should know the proper heat range for your hair. Ask your stylist. I would say, save the $40 and invest in a better product that will last longer and get the job done better.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi iron that I loved, but passed it on to my daughter when I got a new one with an adjustable temperature.  Never liked the second one.  I saw that the HSI had great reviews and the price was appealing, so I ordered one. It works very well - much better than my last Chi iron did.  It does, however, pull a little (but then so did the Chi).  I would definitely recommend it! I have thick coarse hair, and it straightens/curls much better than my Chi did.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Not only did I receive my package almost a week early ( and there was a holiday during the delivery time too) but this straightener is great!! I have REALLY THICK wavy hair and a lot of it lol so its hard to get my hair straight but this straightener does the trick! It heats up quickly and you can adjust it to any temp you want. This is definitely a great product for a wonderful price. Must Buy!!!</li>
    <li> I had never used a flat iron before so I had to practice a bit to get the hang of it.  This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used, but I like it.  I particularly like the idea of being able to control the level of heat.  I ordered another one and returned it because it didn&#x27;t have a heat control knob.  This flat iron does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I get better at it every day.  Lots of humidity in the air lately so having the HSI Ionic Flat Iron really helps!</li>
    <li> the best deal in the world... makes ur hair look like a million bucks! looked everywhere for this long course hair of mine.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this flat iron since I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand and it&#x27;s ALWAYS on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; (I even saw it on Groupon), but I&#x27;ve had it for a year with no problems. I have the 1 inch (no LCD screen) and I constantly use it, not only to straighten my hair but also curl it. The edges are rounded and since it&#x27;s only 1 inch, it&#x27;s really a great flat iron to also use for curling.</li>
    <li> I love love love it! The packaging is great. I love that they included the travel pouch and glove. The argan oil is a nice idea as well. The shipping was marvelous. Super fast and efficient. Over all I&#x27;m a very happy customer :D and before I forget, I have to say that it heats up fast as well.</li>
    <li> The HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron is just what I was looking for!  It works wonders on my hair, and with the adjustable temperature control, I do not feel like I am completely scorching it.  Not to mention, the price is right.  It is a wonderful product and it comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this straightner.  It works better than my chi!  It leaves my hair shiny and straight with just one or two runs down it.</li>
    <li> I have a number of hair straighteners on my ultra-thick, coarse naturally wavy hair. By the end of the day, my bangs always look like they are trying to bring back the 80&#x27;s. Not anymore. My HSI flat iron actually does the trick! It is easy to grip, heats up fast and gives me the straight hair I&#x27;ve never had. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It seems okay, but it is definitely not a professional one, so I felt tricked. It works as a regular one.</li>
    <li> With thick curly hair I have had many straighteners. I love how this straightener leaves my hair looking shiny but it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the trick. I defiantly got a defective one that doesn&#x27;t get to 410 degrees what so ever! Really wish I didn&#x27;t throw out the box and could have returned it!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Also use it to curl my hair:) for the price I would recommend it to anyone!  Love the oil too</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and with this iron it only takes me about 20 minutes to straighten it! I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it! Great price!</li>
    <li> I have very wavy almost curly thick hair and lots of it!!!&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron can tame my hair in minutes.  I&#x27;ve used flat irons for years and this is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut-off feature.  My last few flat irons would shut-off after they sat idol for too long.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I love the HSI Flat Iron and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great on my naturally curly hair...just have to turn it on the highest temperature setting. Would recommend this to anyone in the market for a new flat iron...and it&#x27;s a great price too.</li>
    <li> First of all the shipping was fast, so that was great.  The flat iron works great and looks likes a professional flat iron (great packaging, comes with a small bottle of oil or serum for the hair, a glove and very stylish cover).  It gets hot very quickly and now I set it at about half the temperature.  It&#x27;s easy and simple to use, it glides over my hair easily and leaves it very shiny and smooth.  I&#x27;m using it every day because I love the way my hair looks afterwards.  Very satisfied with this product and have already recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This flat iron gave me salon results at home! I am very happy with the heat and the design. The controls are on the inside, so I don&#x27;t change them with my hand while using it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works well on my super thick, frizzy hair. It leaves it it smooth and silky however it does need to be set on a higher setting than what is recommended for damaged hair since I have a lot of hair. It certainly works better than the iron that I had previously and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> it was ok but not nearly as good as other straighteners i have used. conair infinity pro is by far the best out there. shipping was great and received the product in a timely fashion but in the end i returned this product as i found it heavy in the hand and not hot enough for my (not so) curly hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter she has naturally wavy hair..EXCELLENT!!! does the job in no time and she has very thick hair! This was a great price and the seller shipped very quickly!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. My hair is just below shoulder length and fairly thick and frizzy.  Using my previous straightener I would have to stop half way through and let it heat back up. The HSI maintains the heat well. I have only had this strightener a week and so far i really like it. Even my co- workers noticed a difference in my hair.  The swivel cord is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product- especially for the price I paid for it. I had looked at the chi as well, but I&#x27;m trying to stay on a tighter budget. This straightener has really amazed me and people have complimented me on how my hair has looked great since I started using it over my old straightener. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The flat iron was defective. I don&#x27;t understand why this product has so many good reviews. They have to be fake that&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
    <li> A great straightener.  The perfect size and works really well! I use it for curls and to straighten.  It&#x27;s so much better than my old one.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse hair. This iron works well at the max temp, 410 degrees, however, the Babybliss had to step in at 465 degrees to really help my hair reach maximum potential.</li>
    <li> I am compleately satisfied with this product . I like how my hair looks after using it. I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This product was more then worth the buy. I have never shopped online before this was my first time doing so and I am extremely happy I did. This straighter is amazing and very cost affordable. My hair is straight within 30 mins when normally it takes 60 to 90 mins to do. I am very pleased. My advice buy one &amp; try it for yourself!!</li>
    <li> I was so surprised to see the price of it (it&#x27;s actually supposed to be three hundred dollars!) that I had to buy it right away, and I&#x27;m glad I did! It heats up very fast, and for someone with hard-to-straighten hair like me, it does the job with just enough heat as to not harm my hair. :) I had to put my old straightener up on the highest setting, but with this one, somewhere in the middle works! It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener! Everything came as promised, glove, packet of the oil to test out. And all came in a nifty packaging with a red silky bag. The iron itself is great. Heats up super fast and has been working like a charm. It curls your hair well too. You just twist the hair around the sides and voila! LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I purchased HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch, after having used old-fashioned curlers, electric curlers and a curling iron for the past 40 years. My daughter, whom I was visiting in Utah, decided that she needed to fix my hair for a party we were going to with her husband&#x27;s whole family. I thought that all those things did was straighten hair and my hair is already poker straight. But she convinced me that she would do a good job. She was so right! It took her, at the most, 5 minutes to fix my hair and make it look better than it had in the past 20 years. When I left to go home, I forgot to take my curling iron with me. So I went online to look for a Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron, because she told me that was the best kind to get and would give me the best results. I found one on Amazon&#x27;s Marketplace, Blue Novelties, for a ridiculously low price. I don&#x27;t know why it was so deeply discounted because it was obvious that it was a top-of-the-line product. It came with a velvet sleeve for travel and a special glove you could wear to keep from getting burned (I guess). I&#x27;ve never had to use it. It&#x27;s now so fast and easy to fix my hair that I don&#x27;t view it as the chore I used to. It gave my hair some bounce, some curl, and make it very shiny. I would recommend this item to everybody! If your current hair curler goes bad, get the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> great deal.&lt;br /&gt;good price.&lt;br /&gt;ive used 3 x already.&lt;br /&gt;1st time with argon oil and blow dry, took 2 hours, my hair is really curly and about an inch past my hsoulders, turned out really great, shiny healthy. real cute.&lt;br /&gt;2nd time, no argon oil, no blow dry. not that great.&lt;br /&gt;3rd time&#x3D;best. used african hair oil to moisterize and no blow dry but the flat iron did such a great job i got sooo many compliments aand after 6 days, my hair is still in great shape. the ends look good and the roots do too. i think the mosterizer i used locks in and keeps hair from frizzing so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;those just my tips for actually using it. if you have extra time to blow dry, do it but if not just make sure hair almost dry (i prefer air dry) and use good moisterizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as snags of hair, ive seen lot reviews talk about that. maybe when brand new didnt snag but after first use i definitely notices hair snags.&lt;br /&gt;doesnt bother me that much plus i might be rushing or handing my hair rough so i dont really mind that as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the size and width of it is great for handling. my last chi was not really as ergonomically fit. cord swivels out of way when necessary. easy to flip and rotate around if in rush and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gets really reallly hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty good deal for 40 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only thing bothered me was after bying this and reading so many great reviews my bff told me she bought one from walmart for 40 that got really hot and worked well, she was happy with it but it was way more girly and had special designs and stuff so maybe if you appreicate more designs something not so basic, check walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and comes with silky holder and little jar argon for free and glove that i havent used 1x but pretty good package overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would buy again. and would recommend</li>
    <li> I was frantically looking for a new flat iron once by CHI broke. I was so happy to try something new and am completely pleased with the HSI flat iron. I love that you can control the temperature and the pouch to store it in is really great. I have curly/wavy hair and after using it leaves my hair really sleek and shiny (with the argan oil). It&#x27;s definitely not a flimsy product, which is what I had trouble with in the past.  Love and would recommend~~!!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It has been amazing with my very thick hair.  I also use the HSI oil which really helps with dryness of flat ironing hair daily.  The 1 inch is smaller than I&#x27;ve used in the past so it take a bit more time to go through all my hair but does a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> My wife has wanted to replace her hair straightener for awhile now. The price AND the ratings on this item pushed me to order it for her. She has not been disappointed! In fact, with 3 women in the house they all admit it&#x27;s the best straightener they have ever used. And they don&#x27;t know how little I paid for it!!</li>
    <li> My hair is short and I was able to straighten my thick, curly, coarse hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the true test was on my sister&#x27;s hair, which is even thicker and coarser and much longer than mine.  Her hair was mostly straight.  Half way through the job, the straightener wasn&#x27;t enough.  I think next time I&#x27;ll have to turn the straightener off and then wait a while to let it cool down again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it definitely straightened my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> I am not a review writer but after I used this product I feel to write a review. This is really awesome. I have naturally curled hair and nobody can tell that after I straightened my hair with HSI!!!!!! My hair looks shiny soft. I loved it.But still I&#x27;m confused about how to register for 1 year warrenty.</li>
    <li> I have been using iron hair for the past 5 years. So I know when is the good one and the wrong one :)&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfect, it does the job, you don&#x27;t have to spend that much time and your hair stays as you want it to be. Of course you have to buy special products for that but that smth else :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to every HAIR TYPE!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works so quickly and is far better than the GoldenHot one I paid twice as much for. Well worth the money. They also included a free sample of their argan oil, which I prefer to my usual brand from my salon.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s no ghd but I am very happy with it for its price. Tugs a bit on your hair but does straighten it quickly and well. You can totally get away with a \\&quot;fast job\\&quot; on it.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! Before I got the hsi I used a friend&#x27;s chi and was instantly enamored.  But I didn&#x27;t want to spend $90 on a flat iron. I did some research and found the hsi with a ton of great ratings. For the price it was worth a try and i love it. It works just as well as the chi but half the cost.</li>
    <li> very happy, use it every day, and good professional ceramic hair straightener,&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much!!!! good price and good quality</li>
    <li> My middle school daughter loves it.  She straightens her bangs each morning before school.  Amazon also has a holder for it as an inexpensive add-on right now.</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI Flat Iron after my CHI broke. I have had issues with the last several CHI flat irons I&#x27;ve purchased, so I decided to purchase the HSI after reading the reviews. This flat iron does not disappoint! I have curly hair, and can get it completely straight in just 1 or 2 passes. It can be set up to 410 degrees, although I am able to get my hair straight at 380 degrees or less. If you are looking for a less expensive alternative to the CHI brand, look no further. GREAT styling tool!</li>
    <li> I formerly had the chi straightener which I loved but left behind accidentally in another state, so I had to buy another one.  I took a chance on this product and have been very happy.  It does a great job at being hot enough (adjustable heat setting)  to straighten my hair, or curl it too.  The price can&#x27;t be beat either!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughters love it. My daughter has very curly hair, hard to manage. Not anymore, this product is the best. She is happy with this product. Will buy two more next February 2013.Not telling anyone about this product until I buy two more then I will spread the Great news about it.</li>
    <li> In the beginning I was very happy with this flat iron, which I chosen based on the numerous glowing reviews.  I now wonder if all those reviewers just forgot to amend their reviews after this flat iron crapped out on them.  I used it on average 2-3 times a month and can&#x27;t complain about it&#x27;s performance.  Then after five months the plates only get mildly warm (I can wrap my fingers around them no problem).  I then started reading all the one star reviews and I realized I was not alone.  I wish I had given a second thought to buying a no name flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and this flat iron does wonders for straightening my hair.  It&#x27;s as straight as it gets when I go to the hairdresser. It&#x27;s my first HSI flat iron and I love it!</li>
    <li> love this iron!best purchase ever!... it heats up really fast nad it makes ur hair silky soft and smooth, it was worth the price i paid</li>
    <li> The high star rating fooled me into thinking this was a good deal...it pulls hair ALOT, it&#x27;s worth paying a hundred dollars for a real quality straightener than this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron that works great, especially for the price.  I had a much more expensive one that had an easier grip and left my hair softer, but I accidently melted that one on a vacation.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I had to finally retire my CHI of close to 7 years and while doing my research for professional flat irons, I came across the HSI. My thinking was \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;, worst case scenerio I&#x27;m only out $40 if things don&#x27;t work out.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is a very nice iron for the money.  If you don&#x27;t want to shell out the $100++ for other professional irons, this one works very well.  Is it as good?  That is a question I can not answer.  I can&#x27;t really compare it to my CHI, as the CHI was starting to lose its heat midway through the ironing process, so it would not be a fair contest.  I feel this one does not go through the hair as smoothly as the CHI, but, it by no means snags my hair like I have read in other reviews.  For the $40 investment, I think this iron is a great deal and serves it&#x27;s purpose very well.  This iron came quickly and the company that makes it appears to stand behind their product, so, I would most certainly purchase from them again and recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I love this iron, and I am so glad that I bought it!  Not only does it straighten your hair, but makes it shiny as well!  And I used it to wave my hair too!  Highly recommended, and great price too! I love it so much that I bought my sister one too, and she loves it as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JAN 23 Update-- So my sister&#x27;s flat Iron is great, and still working, mine, however, is not anymore!  I rarely used mine, and now I have the last few days it does not heat up. I am wondering if I can get in touch with the company to exchange it.  I hope so.</li>
    <li> This is a top notch flat iron for the best price. If you are questioning that it must not work that great for the low price... think again. I have had a lot of flat irons over the years and it is as good as the much higher priced competitors. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly and very thick and this flatiron got my hair very straight and the argon oil that cam with it gave my hair a nice shine. The heat protector glove worked really well because my hair holds heat, so the gloved protected my hand. when I used this flat iron my hair stayed straight all day and did not get frizzy at all. I would very much recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI styler as the price was a bargain that I could not afford to miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed as it came in its box wrapped in a silky red pouch, a glove so you don&#x27;t burn yourself and a mini bottle of oil. I had to purchase a plug adapter as the plug is euro. I was amazed at how quickly it straightened my hair and didn&#x27;t give off a burning smell as you would normally get with some straighteners. It has a temperature dial so you can adjust it to the suitability of how thick your hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt smooth and silky and I received many compliments. My hair is long and wavy and thick however it took me 10 minutes to do my whole head. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have a natural, curly, 4b afro. After using this flat iron - everyone thought I got a relaxer. BOOM</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself last year and my daughters were always trying to snatch it, so I got them each one this year. WE LOVE IT! I&#x27;d bought a few irons before this one, but I won&#x27;t need any but this one now...it works so nice!! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I definitely would!!</li>
    <li> It has never worked I cant even get it to turn on....so disappointed.  I had got this as a gift for my daughter and she never got to use it.</li>
    <li> Love the iron it heats up fast and does leave my hair with a shine and the Argan oil is fab!  I had to order some more!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Heats up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t fry off my hair.  I love it and so does my step daughter.  Believe me she uses it a lot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no problem so far with this product. It was easy to use and I love the quality. I recommend it to anyone with thick hair.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with the HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. Three of us use it, and it turns stubborn waves and very tight curls to wonderfully straight and shiny. There is no frizzing with the product. It works far better than our other iron straighteners. No regrets buying this one!</li>
    <li> I purchased my first HSI flat iron through Amazon back in November 2012.   I paid 39.99 back then and was and still am, extremely happy with my purchase.   If I could give this iron 10+++++ stars I definitely would!!!   My hair is very course and THICK.  I wash it two or three times a week and flat iron my entire head of hair in layers after washing and drying.    I RARELY need to touch up with the iron between washings and if I do, I just iron the top layer of my hair.  (more so in the summer months, but close to never at less humid times of the year)  I decided I should purchase a back up iron just in case my current one decided to fizzle out on me.   I would be lost without this thing!     When my new iron came a week ago, I thought I better test it out to make sure it works...and it does...Perfectly!   Just the same as the iron I bought 2 1/2 years ago!     You cannot beat the quality or the price of this iron!   I honestly have no idea why anyone would spend $100 or more on a flat iron when they can purchase this HSI iron for less then half the cost  with the same or better results!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever owned! I am so impressed with it and the price is absolutely amazing. The item arrived even sooner than expected as well. Super impressed and pleased. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was really excited because of the thousands of 5 star reviews this thing got. My hair is really curly and fine. After I straighten my hair, it looks great for 30 minutes and then it starts to curl again. I&#x27;ve heard that this straightener tames even the unruliest hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though I&#x27;m a college student on a budget, I splurged $40 on this two days ago and got it in the mail yesterday (my family has amazon prime). The argan oil/carrying pouch were a nice touch. The straightener, however, wasn&#x27;t that great. It looked used and the ceramic plates were chipped. I emailed HSI directly and told them about my situation. They told me to mail it directly to them for an exchange. First of all, they sent me a defective piece. And now they want me to pay to ship it back to them? No thanks. Returning it to amazon today. I know there are a ton of other reviews talking about the great customer service, but I&#x27;m just not feeling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the straightener is great, but I think I&#x27;ll be buying another brand because of this whole fiasco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just bought the Remington 1 inch one and it was only $15 (perfect for college students like me). It heats up very fast (it can go up to 410 degrees), is lightweight, and came in pristine condition. It gave me pin straight hair, which no straightener I have previously had could do. My hair was straight even after sleeping on it. I curled my hair with it too! Bottom line: There are many better, cheaper straighteners out there, so keep looking!</li>
    <li> After three AWFUL flat irons that caught my hair, were hard to handle or left multiple little burns on my hands, this HSI flat iron has been a wonderful change.  I researched many flat irons and was ready to spend over $100 if I could just find one that worked well. I have been very happy with this HSI model after working with it for two weeks.  It is easy to both use and put down, has not caught my hair and I have not been burned!  It works for straightening my bangs and getting rid of unwanted waves.  A great product.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to risk buying this flat iron. I have fine color treated hair and always worry about damage from blow drying and straightening my hair. Right away I felt this was a high quality flat iron (didn&#x27;t feel light weight or of cheap materials). I like that it has a textured finish and is easy to hold on to. It doesn&#x27;t catch or pull hairs as I&#x27;m straightening which is a big plus. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the Argan oil because I thought it might weigh down my hair, but it&#x27;s actually very light and makes my hair silky smooth. I love the way it makes my hair feel. All that, along with the included bag and glove, for such a reasonable price, makes me a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Cost me far less than my CHI &amp; heats up faster &amp; gets my hair as smooth as silk!</li>
    <li> I got this straightener for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Her hair is usually very frizzy and this cuts her styling time a lot. Her hair looks like silk.</li>
    <li> MY NIECE LOVES THIS BETTER THAN THE CHI PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron. It makes my hair super shiny and soft. What I like better in this one is the temperature adjustment which allow me to control the temperature and not burn my hair. I also like the oil it leaves my hair super soft. I saw a flat iron in my salon and it was $200!! I think a have a better deal buying this one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a CHI in the past, but would recommend the HSI...works as expected and I like the temp options, wide range for working on my 4 year olds hair or my own.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Does everything it should.  I have not traveled with it yet to a different voltage but believe it will be just fine</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good straighter.  I do feel like it catches my hair at times.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product....excellent service!!!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Heats up quickly, easy to use and way better results than my old flat iron.  I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron for a great price.  Smooths incredibly well on the first pass.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  My last flat iron burned my hair so I was kind of worried about using this one.  I&#x27;ve had no problems and it leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. I have three girls with long hair and it leaves their hair smooth and without frizz. Love the oil that came with it too! Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Works great I just need lessons on how to use! Good quality and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Arrived fast as specified.  Works great!</li>
    <li> this product freak me out。 i got this one month ago. It only works first time.  Second time, when I plug in and start to use, it comes out Spark. It really scare me. I bought lot of things from Amazon. Some have defects, some are very good. But I never give any commons. This one .....can it be much worse?</li>
    <li> I really like this new flat iron, it heats up quickly and does a great job.  I like the long cord and reset button on the plug.</li>
    <li> For the price this straightener works well. I have very thick hair and usually cheap flat irons don’t cut it. I typically use the InStyler which I loved but at the moment I didn’t want to spend $100 on one so I bought this as an alternative. I haven’t tried a Chi or other high dollar brand to see the difference but I would like to. I’m sure for those with thin to medium hair the product would work even better.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat irons that heat up very quickly. Love!</li>
    <li> This flat iron does an great job. And it heats up super fast. My hair is alot smoother than with my old one.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as my last straightner. But gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as described and works just like the full size for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Super fast Shipping..  Great Price.. The Wife is happy...Thank you</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I was excited to receive the item as it had many good reviews, along with some poor ones. However after the FIRST use, it no longer heated up to the appropriate temperature and now barely works. A waste of money and unable to exchange it.</li>
    <li> This flatiron lasted only 2 months!! I don&#x27;t even use it every day! The heating element went out and now it doesn&#x27;t get hot. Of course, it&#x27;s past the date of return/refund. SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a new hair straighter to replace my Revlon one I&#x27;d had for years. Came across this one and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot after reading all the reviews. I was not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON! It&#x27;s so much better than the Revlon one I had been using. I have very fine, thin dark hair and I worry that heat will cause more damage over time but I have more confidence now that I can use a very low heat setting with the HSI. I&#x27;ve been able to straighten and style my hair easily and it looks shiny and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the little red travel bag it comes in since I am constantly on the go. Very handy! Plus the argan oil sample is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a great upgrade for me! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Dropped it once on accident. Burned myself so instant reaction lol. And it cracked both sides of the straightener. I had it for a day. :(</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the hype is about, I was not impressed with this. Maybe I got a knockoff like other claimed?</li>
    <li> One of the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I love the way this flat iron smooths my hair and edges! I haven&#x27;t used it yet to curl but based on what I see so far, it will be smooth sailing. The product comes with an argan oil and a travel pouch which is also a plus. I will be using it more often as time goes by and we&#x27;ll see how nicely this product holds up, especially since it came highly recommended.   One thing I&#x27;d like to point out is that it does not have a automatic safety switch so there&#x27;s a safety concern if I forget to turn it off before I leave home.</li>
    <li> As a person with with extremely thick, coarse wavy hair, this is the only straightener that gets hot enough to actually straighten my hair. it&#x27;s really really hot though, so be careful. Also, all my previous straighteners had a two-prong outlet plug, but this has a grounded plug (3-prong) which I didn&#x27;t have any room to plug in next to my hair dryer. I had to get an adapter for my outlet. Just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it though. Definitely a great deal.</li>
    <li> It works really good.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron for straightening hair. I personally love using it to curl my hair. Great price and great iron.</li>
    <li> I initially liked this product because I did a lot of research to find a cheap straightener that works good AND doesn&#x27;t pull hair during use....and it this one followed through on those. Worked well for the price but plate cracked only after falling off sink one time....and then of course ripped hair out of our heads upon use due to the crack. Then it was dropped on floor again and the entire plate fell out and hangs on by wired only. So of course it had to be thrown out..and I only had it a few months :(</li>
    <li> Great flat iron with solid plates. Temperature control is nice feature but a little loose to turn. Has light that indicates when iron has reached target temperature. Came with case, glove and small one-use sample for argan oil (not travel size). Not an issue for me given that iron is such a good value.</li>
    <li> Nice to straight hair only.. Can&#x27;t be used for any curls. On description it says can get some curls but NOPE</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of smoothing out hair without frying the ends especially using the oil. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had to return it as it was not working.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron very much. I bought it for my daughter who has thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;The glove that comes with it is a wonderful idea. I used to burn my hands when&lt;br /&gt;using my old straightener that broke after 3 years of use. This flat iron is well&lt;br /&gt;made an i am happy I bought it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it..the best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased in years!!! I have not been let down yet by them! Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, this is about the best flat iron you can get. No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron worked great for straightening my natural hair at very low heat. I love the fact that I could adjust the heat settings since my hair is really thin, I need the lowest temperature possible. However, when my sister uses the flat iron for her extensions, she is able to adjust the heat as high as needed to get the right curl. I took this flat iron to London and it worked just fine with a converter. Overall, good product with an even greater price tag.</li>
    <li> I was very careful when selecting a flat iron. This one had everything I was looking for. It heats up quickly, glides through my hair smoothly and is easy to operate. The extra long cord was an added bonus. I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality. I owned a Chi. This is just as good for less than half the price. Must have!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener. I have naturally wavy hair that is very stubborn. This straightener has made me love my new hair cut!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product-it heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t lose heat as it&#x27;s being used, and glides on my hair without pulling it. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener. I have used the CHI for years and was used to it but read so many great reviews about this straightener that I decided to try it instead of the CHI. The glove is nice and the Argon oil is fabulous and smells great!!! I am glad that I tried it and have liked it very well. On top of that, I think that the company has GREAT customer service which is rare these days and I would do business with them again for that reason alone!!</li>
    <li> Product works as expected, simple to use, was able to straighten my shoulder-length hair in 15 minutes. Very happy to have it.</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons. They don&#x27;t take long to heat or straighten hair. I&#x27;m natural, and I needed something that could straighten my hair fast without a lot of heat. These flat irons are a 5 star. My hair stays straight for a week if not longer.</li>
    <li> good quality and awesome price! its a really good deal!! it also has gloves and other things in the box , it is a good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on and off for less than a year (purchased mid September, 2014) and it has completely stopped working. The heating element or the power supply or both are dead - no heat, no little LED light. While it worked, it was great: I really like the cord management, and the size is great for short to medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that I only spent $40 - but if I have to spend $40 once a year then I&#x27;d rather consider a better option.</li>
    <li> Works great but the style has burnt my face and hands. It is super hot which I like, I like the size but for some reason, I burnt myself alot with this iron. Had to change to another one.</li>
    <li> Works well. Would recommend it especially at its lower cost</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I have used and I love it! My sister picked it out for me, she said it would be a good one and she was right!</li>
    <li> Gets nice and hot- straightens my fairly thick wavy hair with no problem. Only thing is that the wand gets pretty hot which makes it hard to curl my hair. It would get 5 stars if it had some felt or something on that part.</li>
    <li> My Revlon straightener died after 5 years of minimal use and I purchased this HSI to replace it after reading the reviews. I am so glad I did! I liked my old Revlon well enough, but this one is really a huge step up. The rounded edges make it so easy to style my hair and add some curl and while I do need more than 1 pass (I have fine but VERY thick, curly hair), the results are well worth it! My hair comes out shiny and straight but unlike every other one I have tried, this flat iron leaves my hair with body. It does not make it flat/straight which I don&#x27;t prefer. I am sure you could get your hair flat/straight with this iron but I love the option of getting it just straight enough without taking all the body and volume out. Love it but my teen daughter keeps stealing it as she prefers it to her Chi iron. I only use it 1-2 times per month but when I do my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> Nice size for shorter or medium length hair.  Works well and came with a drawstring travel bag.  I&#x27;ve used this for a year or so now and it&#x27;s holding up beautifully.  Heavy duty and helps with shine.  I like that you can select the temp.</li>
    <li> I returned this two days after receiving it. It takes a long time to heat up, does not hold the heat in between sections, and it pulled my hair.</li>
    <li> Although I have only used this product for a short period of time, I already love the results I get from this ceramic hair straightener.  I have been looking for a good quality flat iron as a reasonable price.  This appears to be just what I was looking for.  Definitely meets my needs!!!  Make the purchase....you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have thick, coarse hair with strong cowlicks and this makes my hair smooth with no waves. My shipment was missing the trial size argan oil and there was no packing label in case it needed to be returned.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron about 5 months ago.  It worked well, it wasn&#x27;t the best flat iron I have ever used, but it was sufficient.  About a week ago, I was in a hotel and the flat iron blew a fuse and caused a power outage in my room.  Needless to say, it does not work anymore.  So, it was fine for the 5 months that I had it, but considering my last couple of flat irons have lasted for about two years each, it was disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It heats evenly, quickly and does the job!  I recommend it and the price is great for the great quality you receive</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! This is one of the best bargains on Amazon!!! This is a great straightener!  My daughter has one that she bought from her hair stylist paying $175. This is exactly the same quality iron BUT better...it came with a hot glove and a nice travel pouch!!! I use it daily! Very good buy! Get one today!!! This will make a great Christmas gift!!!!</li>
    <li> I like everything about this except the ON light indication is very elusive to me. It is small and I always have to turn it over a couple times to see it. Obviously doesn&#x27;t affect performance but it drives me nuts.</li>
    <li> This is what my CHI wishes it were.  I love the oil that comes with it too, my hair looks so smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> The product heats up easily and is easy to maneuver as I work it through my short, very thick hair. I have not used the glove as I have not found it nececcary. The straightener fits into the provided silk pouch without the cord. I have used the oil that comes with the set and it seems to be a quality product. All in all I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical that the product was sold well under market price.  However, I was very pleased with the quality of the HSI straightener and everything arrived as advertised.  Shipping was very timely and the product was well protected.</li>
    <li> I love my Flat Iron Hair. My hair is curly, long and a little dehydrated, but when I use this product my hair is straight, silky, shiny and I look spectacular. And the Argan Oil is 1.000 times better than the silicon, is the perfect complement to a luxurious finish. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron about 6 months ago and I have used it for the past 4. I have somewhat thin, fine hair that I have used GENUNINE ceramic flat irons on in the past and have been able to straighten my hair without destroying it. When I first began using the iron I could hear my hair breaking, but I figured my hair was getting stuck in the space between the part that heats up and the plastic portion, which has happened with other irons in the past because again, I have fine hair. So, I tried being more careful. It was still breaking. What I have discovered over time is that the iron is burning my hair and snapping it off. This happens no matter how low I set it. I am now going to Macy&#x27;s where I will spend over $100 on a new iron that I will use sparingly so that I can begin the healing process on my hair. There are lots of great reviews on here for this iron, but how long did they use it before the review was left? I&#x27;ve used it for 4 months and in the long run you will be sorry you didn&#x27;t spend the money. SPEND THE MONEY. This cheap knockoff will hurt your hair in the end.</li>
    <li> I have bought 3 of these. One for myself and my sister&#x27;s. High quality without the high price!!</li>
    <li> The Flat Iron came nicely packaged in a red silky sleeve with the glove and trial size Argan Oil.  I read reviews and made my purchase.  The temperature setting is on the inside of the handle which is a nice feature to have to adjust to your hair type.  There is also a little light that turns green when the flat iron is ready.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  I really like the results and performance.  My hair looked nice and stayed that way until I washed it. The inside of the iron does not have the comb like teeth and easy to pull through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The temperature button is small which is OK but it needs a red marking on it to show where I put me setting.  Difficult for an older person to read!  That is why I rated this product as a four star.&lt;br /&gt;It is also heavier than what I am use to but very happy with the end result.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron because of reviews and great price. Overall I&#x27;m disappointed. After a few months it started pulling my hair. Going back to Chi!</li>
    <li> It does a fine job, but I guess I was expecting it to be GREAT!  Seems like an ordinary hair straightener</li>
    <li> This is the first time I buy a flat iron.  I love this product! Is very easy now to straight my hair and it looks great. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My wife was looking for a new flat iron. She developed a list of features she wanted in a new flat iron. This iron was around $100 cheaper than all of the others with similar features. She gave it a shot, bought this one and loves it!</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron! I have very thick, long, curly hair. I blow dry it straight and then use the flat iron to smooth it out. I&#x27;ve always used a 2 inch iron and I was concerned when downsizing. It&#x27;s so much better! I am more easily able to get to the roots. And the best part... NO SNAGS!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this does not get hot enough to straighten my hair, I used it 2xs and gave it away</li>
    <li> I have classic short frizzy African American short/medium length hair and I depend on good hair dryers and flat irons if I want to straighten my hair. I&#x27;m not familiar with this brand but with sooooo many great reviews I had to try it! This iron is pretty fantastic I must say. One glide and my hair is stick straight I still can&#x27;t believe it! Not only that, but add some serum and my hair has great motion and feels really smooth. It takes no time to heat up and it is the easiest tool to use. I usually have no problem spending more $ if I will get more bang for my buck, so I was pleasantly surprised that such a good product came at such an equally good price! Overall I would absolutely recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend because a friend raved on how great this straightener worked for straightening and curls. Boy was she wrong. My gf stated that it pulls on your hair and feels like its burning it giving it a very frizzy look. Her walmart brand straightener works way better. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!!! I have never been able to get that beauty shop hair style (straight) until I purchased this!!! The price is excellent....I would definitely recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a straightener as a beginner, this one is a good one to get. It comes with a glove and a holder for the iron to prevent burns and nearby items melting. This product is good for its&#x27; value. It can reach high temperatures to straighten even stubborn hair, and it has a safety measure that needs to be taken; this product requires you to press down on the reset button before it turns on. I think this is a brilliant especially if you have forgetful roommates or children in the house. There is a light on the outside to indicate when the flatener is ready to be used or still heating up (green&#x3D;good to go, red&#x3D;still heating up).</li>
    <li> girlfriend loves this</li>
    <li> It does heat up quickly as advertised, I found the width to be pretty short for long hair. Returned it</li>
    <li> Works ok but heat temp doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough</li>
    <li> Brand new condition and super fast shipping. Got it months ago and no problems whatsoever. Only complaint is that it has a rough grip and with how often I use mine sometimes it rubs my skin off.</li>
    <li> I have had both better and worse flat irons than this HSI. The one I purchased had an issue with the temperature, I have very fine straight hair and I had to have it almost to highest to get results but then my hair would have this burnt smell. I stopped using it, it was a waste of money. The other issue I didn&#x27;t like was how hot the handle got even where the groves are.</li>
    <li> Good clamping. Just right amount of pressure to straighten hair nicely. Comfortable:  good grip, length of cord, temperature, etc. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 1/2 months now. I have straightish hair, but has a bend to it. Loved that it came with a small bottle of Argon oil. Only a small pea-size drop needed for my whole head of medium length hair. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product when I run out. Highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener, the oil is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I obviously cannot just say 5 stars...I was nagged 6 times to come back and review this thing.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE buy this straightener - the company is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Now AMAZON, please stop nagging me - or at least let me click 5 stars and move on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too fat - rounded to make a clean, straight curl. The surface touching the hair is to small - narrow. It does heat up fast.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! I haven&#x27;t bought a new straightener in over 5 years but once i saw the price for this one I couldn&#x27;t resist! I&#x27;m glad I bought it, my hair feels a lot healthier and less breakage. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Boy, this gets hot!  Salon quality iron. Great price. Arrived quickly and just as described. Nice bag with it. Though, the bag is too slim to fit the bulky cord.</li>
    <li> My initial purchase I was not that thrilled with. I am a cosmetologist and I guess I expected more... The iron just didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough. I was not going to leave a negative comment or even return it because I paid so little for it. I received an email from the company after I didn&#x27;t leave a comment at all making sure that I was happy with my purchase. I explained to them that I just didn&#x27;t feel the iron was heating to the degree it said. Without me asking they shipped me a step up, digital replacement that I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with. Kudos to their amazing customer service and being proactive!</li>
    <li> As a mother of three teenage girls, we&#x27;ve tried em all... Hands down this is our favorite. We actually ordered two more because we are afraid of not being able to find em if something happens to the one we have!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI Professional 1\\&quot; ceramic straightener after my last one, of ten years, broke. Since the last straightener lasted so long, used almost continuously everyday, I researched and talk to my stylist about what my next purchase should be. I have thick, fine, curly hair (Swiss/German ancestry), in other words if I don&#x27;t straighten my hair, it looks like I stuck my finger in a light socket, so I needed to find a straightener that would straighten my hair, without frying my hair. My stylist gave me a couple of options and HSI  was one of them. I went to the manufacturer website and looked into it a little more, and this seemed like the right product for me. After it swiftly arrived at my home, I had to test it out. I was very pleased at how sleek and pretty it looked, and also loved that not only did it come with a heat glove (no more burned hands from hot hair), but it also came with a beautiful heat pouch for traveling (no more having to wait while the straightener cools down before putting it away). The really only con I can find on this is the ON/OFF button and heat settings are on the inside of the straightener. It hasn&#x27;t caused any problems as of yet, but if there was something they might want to change that would be a consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I&#x27;m glad I did my research. Defiantly a must have for any girl.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, not great. Takes a couple tries to fully straighten hair. I&#x27;ve owned a Chi once before, and next time around I&#x27;ll invest in another one.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product I would have paid a lot more for this straightener but I am most pleased with the price. Great Product and amazing price! I highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;The HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER is fantastic, I love that I can adjust the temp and it straightens and curls with ease.</li>
    <li> I rarely do reviews but I am so impressed with this flat iron I had to share. I recently used it on my daughter&#x27;s think unprocessed hair and it came out beautiful. Her hair was straight, silky, and with a healthy shine. The free argon oil was an added bonus!  I could not believe that an iron so inexpensive worked so well. I have paid lots more for irons in the past but this one surpassed my expectations in value!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron, very happy with it. I do wish it had some sort of stand on either side to hold the iron on better however.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are very pleased with our purchase of the HSI Professional Flat iron. It heats up quickly, does not pull our hair and straighens our hair beautifully. Our hair has lots of body and curls. This flat iron does not dissappoint. It was affordable quality.</li>
    <li> At least 4 times per use I hear a loud pop and then need to reset the iron (I just push the red button on the cord and it will turn back on). This is more annoying than anything else. The outlet that I plug it into works with all of my other hair appliances (blow dryer, curling iron, bubble wand) and works with my old straightening iron. This make me believe that my HSI is defective in some way.</li>
    <li> I use the product everyday but I&#x27;ve had better straightener&#x27;s before. The product straightens the hair but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth or shiny. I think it actually leaves my hair very frizzy/dry. I&#x27;ve used over hair straightening products and I know the ceramic iron can leave my hair silky smooth especially since I have Asian hair. I haven&#x27;t used the product overseas yet so I didn&#x27;t test the dual voltage but if you are only using it domestically, I might consider doing more research and seeing if there are other ones.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! Much easier than using curlers and much faster. It heats up super fast and I can easily adjust the temperature. I can add a curl to my long super straight hair in 10 minutes or less and be ready to go out.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t use it because the current is so high and there is not  any  suitable adapter (i am in Singapore).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive flat irons and this one holds its own against them. Heats up quickly and makes straightening my hair super quick. It&#x27;s great for curling also. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  Adjustable temperature, easy to handle, and a great price.  Had a little bit of difficulty when I first plugged it in - it wouldn&#x27;t heat up but the directions say to just push the reset button on the plug for that initial use.  Other than that little hiccup, it&#x27;s a truly great buy.  And it has worked perfectly ever since.  Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> You are better off to save the money for a real salon straightener, but for 50$ I guess it works but I gave it to my friend and bought a high quality one..</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. I was skeptical due to the unbelievably low price, but it is definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I love it. I have very curly, thick, unruly hair and this flat iron gets hot enough to straighten it without damage! Fast and efficient shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I did A LOT of research before buying this hair straightener. A LOT! Like, hours, maybe even days. I knew I did NOT want to purchase the Chi, because even though I know it&#x27;s an excellent product, I&#x27;d have spend $100+ for it… and that didn&#x27;t interest me one bit. I wanted to buy a hair straightener that was more affordable but of equal quality &amp; performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, I went with the HSI Professional because it had better reviews, and even a video review which I found very helpful! I got it the first day within the date range Amazon stated. It came brand new, in nice packaging, and it came with a fancy red silky bag. So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it…. It is fantastic! I have VERY thick, long curly/wavy hair. Seriously…very thick, voluminous hair. This straightener did a job well done! I didn&#x27;t have to go over each piece a bunch of times, just 2, maybe 3. It exceeds 400 degrees which is necessary for my hair type. The ON/OFF button and temperature turn dial are located below the inner ceramic plates which I love because then I am not prone to adjust the settings by accident. The cord has a rotating base to avoid wire kinks/damage, another plus! Because my hair is so thick, I don&#x27;t have to wash it nearly as often as those with thinner hair. So if I use this straightener one day, I won&#x27;t have to do any touch ups any of the following days. With other straighteners, I&#x27;d have to re-do my hair the same day, and/or every day after. Needless to say, I am very happy with the HSI Pro Hair Straightener and even happier that I didn&#x27;t have to break my bank for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product! Go for it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Had an issue regarding the shipping but this product is pretty awesome! I&#x27;ve been used $$$ flat irons before, however the HSI professional crramic iron is as good as them.</li>
    <li> Works well in USA as well as other countries I have used it in: Peru, Netherlands, France, Malawi, Kenya and South Africa. No problems at all!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!  I was very pleased with this product-  doesn&#x27;t over-dry your hair with regular use.  Easy to handle as well.</li>
    <li> I have heavy, curly hair, and this straightens it quickly.  Very happy with my purchase.  I&#x27;ve wondered if purchasing a better quality flat iron would make a difference - it does.</li>
    <li> Like it don&#x27;t love it</li>
    <li> I like this iron so much that I now own 2! One for home and one to stay at my fiances house. Works great and consistently.</li>
    <li> Works great but sometimes pulls the hair.</li>
    <li> Works great! Arrived fast!!</li>
    <li> Daughter says it&#x27;s AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast and curls /straightens really well!  Did a much better job than the curling iron I purchased.</li>
    <li> Had never used a flat iron before but it was recommended by my hairdresser. This one is perfect &amp; a great price!  Seems good quality &amp; was much less than I had been prepared for!</li>
    <li> This is a good straightener for the price. I went from a Chi to this one. The only flaw is it pulls a little. But for my thin, already mostly straight hair it is fine. For the difference in price I would suggest this over the Chi if you don&#x27;t straighten often and don&#x27;t have thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom and she loved it. She claims that this iron cuts time by more than half when compared to CHI. Also she said that it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much as other leading brands. Truly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  It&#x27;s like a professional one!  It arrived on time with a few extras in the box (give and argan oil).  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This was a christmas girl for one of my daughters and she loves it.  I think it even came with a small sample of something I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
    <li> Have been using this straightener for a few months and for the price, it works great! Definitely gets the job done for my wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Did not straighten hair as well as other straighteners I have had. I ended up getting a different kind/brand since this did not do it for my hair.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I purchased this product. The reviews on it seemed really good. When it came it is very nicely packaged. However, once I tried using it, I was extremely disappointed with it. It didn&#x27;t seem to get that hot and when I used it, it would pull my hair. I tried it a couple different times thinking maybe it was me but it did it every time. I returned it and got my money back.</li>
    <li> Do not look for anymore, this is the best flat iron of the world. Leaves your hair soft and shiny. My hair is something &#x27;special&#x27; and this flat iron makes a miracle with it.</li>
    <li> Worked well, but quit working after 6 months.</li>
    <li> This purchase resulted as a second purchase. I had previously purchased the HSI flat iron several months ago for myself. It was my first flat iron purchase. When my daughter came to visit and asked if I had a flat iron, to her surprise, I did. She liked the HSI, so when her birthday came around, her husband informed me it was something she was asking for. As a result, I purchased a second one as as gift to her. My only negative, if you could call it one, is that the pouch, which I thing is beautiful and a great idea, I find to be somewhat small to put the iron in for traveling. The iron, or the cord fit fine all by themselves, but trying to get both of them in at the same time requires a little magic and time to achieve. I like the iron itself, as does my daughter. When it comes to traveling, I leave the pouch behind because of the time spent trying to get both the cord and flat iron in at the same time. It&#x27;s a shame, because the bag is beautiful and the concept is great. One of the reasons I selected this particular flat iron. The reason for not getting 5*&#x27;s. The glove is a real added bonus for me because I have a physical health condition where I have lost about 95% feeling in my hands. I can burn, or hurt myself without knowing it at the time. Thus, the glove helps from preventing me from unknowingly burning myself. My daughter says she is thrilled to have her own.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my youngest daughter after getting one for my oldest. Just received it today and it has the digital control which is fine but I&#x27;m concerned about how it will work due to the fact that the box had already been opened and the product was used and returned by another customer.</li>
    <li> The straightener works just fine so far, but it only heats up to 410 degrees Fahrenheit, which means it takes a lot longer than other flat irons to get your hair perfectly straight. Many other irons reach 450 degrees and now I know that makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new straightener.  I saw the amazing deal on this specific product and took a chance.  It is an excellent hair flat iron.  The product is sturdy, heats up very fast and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  The Argan oil that came with the product does a great job as well and does NOT leave my hair oily or feeling heavy.  I am extremely happy with this p[purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for myself but my daughter seems to use it more that me!  She prefers using this flat iron over the one that she has. She uses this one for curling her long hair and it works great!</li>
    <li> This straightener is so overrated. I don&#x27;t understand why its so highly rated. I mean it gets the job done but it has no features and its just so basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;Durable (dropped so many times &amp; still works)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;HEAVY&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make hair shine&lt;br /&gt;Gives hair dull/dry look&lt;br /&gt;Basic ( no features)&lt;br /&gt;The red light on my straightener NEVER EVER turned green (which its suppose to)&lt;br /&gt;The warranty/guarantee by HSI was never honored</li>
    <li> I Love this Flat Iron! It has Exceeded my expectations.  I got a Great deal, So Happy with this Product...</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality straightener!!! Excellent value!!! I was very pleased with my purchase!  It actually straightens my hair better than the Chi I had previously.  This should be on the top of your list to purchase for yourself if you are looking for a high end straightener with a low end price!!! This one cannot be beat!!!</li>
    <li> We have been very pleased with the quality of this product and are happy we purchased it for our daughter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton out there- this one heats up fast, high heat, and great for curling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second one I&#x27;ve owned (bc I lost the other) and consistently dependable for years!</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing. The first one didnt work at all. The second one sent worked BUT yanked the heck out of my hair! I could not clamp my hair to straighten because it pulled my hair. Hair kept getting caught into the grooves of the edges. So so disapointed! The first one didnt do that at all but it also didnt heat up. My co-worker loves this iron but I have just had bad luck with it. Good luck! Hit or miss forsure.</li>
    <li> Well there&#x27;s really nothing special about this flat iron. It&#x27;s just okay. It pulled my hair a little but it got the job done and my hair was flat for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with tons of great reviews and a very good price for all those reviews.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this back in November and it worked amazing for the first two months. I went to go use it the other day and one plate completely stopped working. I have reset it and tried a few more times hoping it would start working again but the plate is still dead. Huge waste of money and the company wont refund my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for me and one for my sister. We both love it. it works very well and my hair is very silky and straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She had seen something similar in a local mall for about 3x the cost. She is extremely happy with the gift!!</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with it. A little heavy. Doesn&#x27;t do anything different than my cheaper flat iron. I did like the argan oil well enough that I went out and bought some for my face!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for the flat iron and found them to be spot-on. This a great product and look forward to using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron.  It is very easy to use.  Works quickly.  However, the storage case is a little small. The on/off switch and temp control are in an awkward place.  The Argan Oil is excellent. Will buy more of that.</li>
    <li> They work so well.like that you can adjust the heat also the nice bag to store them in. Everyone I let try them love them and the price was awesome.</li>
    <li> My young teen has very thick hair with a slight wave. As she try&#x27;s many things to make it go away nothing helps. I broke down and got her this straightener for Christmas. It&#x27;s amazing how you spend a bit more for better quality and I do believe you get what you pay for. I myself have very fine thin hair and I will use it every now and then and it just takes minutes for both of. Happy daughter means happy mommy. :)</li>
    <li> My hair is normally very hard to curl,  yet this one works fine on my hair although i have to do itagain during the day.</li>
    <li> I just got this and used it for the first time. I have naturally medium length natural curly thick hair and it took me only 15 minutes to straighten it. It is a good straightener for the amount of money! I would recommend it to anyone. It also did not leave a smell of burned hair like my other straighter did.</li>
    <li> It does the job and has all the functions you need i.e. temp control, green light to let you know its ready. I like the free oil it came with and nice cover holder.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter when her Chi died.  I read the great reviews and the price was way less than a Chi, so I decided to try it.  My daughter called after the first time she used it to tell me it was the best straightener she has every used.  She said her hair was easier to straighten and felt smoother/silkier than it ever had with her Chi.  Daughter is happy and Mom is happy she saved money!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present.  One of my daughter&#x27;s already had this great flat iron. It does the job without having to run it through your hair many times.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We tried this after a failure attempt with a cheap product. It is working as expected and the price is much lesser compared to other places. No wonder why it is on top selling list.</li>
    <li> I have always hated my hair and can not style it.  I tend to just pull it into a ponytail.  It is very wavy (not a pretty wave), frizzy in the humidity (I have yet to use this in the summer months) and just unmanageable.  I have neuropathy and have limited feeling in my left hand and was nervous about trying a flat iron.  I read the reviews and watched a bunch of you-tube videos and thought why not?  It wasn&#x27;t a lot of money.  I had previously purchased the Perfector which I actually threw in the garbage.  I then tried the Instyler, which I&lt;br /&gt;have to admit is pretty good, but was just lacking something.  I really love the Tourmaline flat iron.  It is very easy to use and I am able to do my bangs with it.  My hair is straight and very shiny and I have actually gotten compliments on it (a first!).  If this was too break for some reason, I would have to get a new one pronto!!!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Works great! The heating element get hot quick and makes my hair feel nice. Would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it much because I always get pinched in the closing. I guess I just hold it wrong.</li>
    <li> I am a novice to hair straightening and bought to save on salon treatments for my daughters.  It is easy to use, quick to heat up, and does not appear to damage hair.  Great buy for the price</li>
    <li> Has a cheap feel and look. Knobs in between iron handles is inconvenient. No auto-off. Heat area is very short compared to our other ceramic flat iron. Bought it bc it seemed like a great deal, but don&#x27;t see how it was ever valued at the original list price here. Barely consider it worth the sale price.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd HSI I have ordered through Amazon. I keep one for my travel bag and the other for at home use. I love this product and have tried plenty of other hot flat irons but this seems to work best with my thin, colored and frizzy type hair without damaging it more.</li>
    <li> I was amazed the value that you get here.  I&#x27;ve spent over $100 for Hai and Chi straightening irons and this compares pretty well.  The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t handle as well as the more expensive straightening irons.  It may just be something to adjust to.  Overall very pleased.</li>
    <li> It works on my hair majority of the time. The heat suffice enough to straighten my hair. Heats up quickly. Great packaging and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Finally found a professional flat iron! Leaves my hair shiny and smooth with very little effort. Has a green indicator light when it&#x27;s ready to use which is a great help. Heats up quickly too. Comes with a satin pouch for storage/ travel. Excellent value and product! I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great value for a straightener and works great.. Does the job with one pass on hair which is a plus for long hair.  Would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I love the HSI flat iron that I purchased. My old flat iron was a cheap wet-dry one that worked fine, but left my hair pretty frizzy. I decided to upgrade to this one after researching online and seeing that people even preferred it to a CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is wavy and extremely fine, so when I have used a CHI in the past it made my hair too sleek -- even my mother said that it looked terrible. The HSI flat iron makes my hair smooth but keeps the volume somehow. I use a pretty low setting, a little lower than the halfway mark on the dial. I LOVE that there are adjustable heat settings, because my bangs can barely take any heat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair extremely shiny -- people have made comments asking what I did differently to my hair! I haven&#x27;t used the Argan Oil yet but I am excited to. Great buy, especially at the price!</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of a rookie when it comes to straightening my hair, but I&#x27;ve bought a returned two different ones before buying this one from Amazon.  The price, reviews, and end product are just what I wanted!  The controls are INSIDE (next to the ceramic plates) so I don&#x27;t accidentally change the temp or turn it off, which was an issue having with the other ones I purchased.  The ceramic plates don&#x27;t pull/snag my hair (another issue I was having before), and the plug swivels where it connects to the straightener so I don&#x27;t have to turn my wrist to some ungodly angle to get my hair in the back.  The cord is really long with a nice Velcro strap for traveling and it&#x27;s a great size.  I&#x27;ve already recommended this to my friend that was going to drop big $$ on a CHI.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and REALLY happy that I&#x27;m finally done with my hair straightener search :)</li>
    <li> It works well and is easy on my hair. I like how my hair looks with this device. One caution is that if you want one exclusively for travel, this one has a handy travel case but isn&#x27;t super light. The good part is that the barrel is longer than most of the travel ones (which can take FOREVER to straighten your hair).</li>
    <li> Great packaging and yes the flatiron is great!</li>
    <li> Great product! Amazing price!!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because I am Adrican American and have fine hair that has been growing in it&#x27;s natural state without chemicals for 4 years. My hair is hard to straighten, it doesn&#x27;t get straight enough, or stay straight, and reverts back to it&#x27;s natural state after a few minutes of it being straightened. So I tried this flat iron, some Argan oil, and a really good blow dryer (Conair Infinite Pro 3-in-1 Styler w/double teeth comb attachment). Besides having fine hair, my hair is not curly but extremely kinky. After using the argan oil as a leave-in conditioner, I relaxed the kinkiness with the blow dryer, used a straightening spray, and then used the flat iron on the highest setting. Any lower setting didn&#x27;t work. The flat iron was easy to use, it was comfortable in my hand and It got extremely hot. The only complaint was that sometimes it will turn off by itself. So you have to constantly watch to make sure it stays on. This review is being done with just only one use of the product since I just received it last week. With the highest setting, the flat iron gets my hair bone straight with the first pass through my hair. This has never been done with any other flat iron; and I&#x27;ve used many other flat irons over the years without any luck of getting my hair remotely straight. I was skeptical about purchasing it even though I read good reviews because I had not come across any reviews from people with my hair type. But I am pleasantly surprised with this product and would definitely recommend it to others. Another good thing is that the flat iron comes with a glove in case it gets too hot. Others have said they don&#x27;t need the glove, but using the highest setting requires use of the glove. I don&#x27;t see that as a bad thing considering the flat iron actually works on my hair. After searching and buying flat irons (I own 3) over the years, I have finally found THE one that works for me. This is why I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this dual voltage for a trip to England. It not only worked wonderfully with just an adapter, it was also a really nice straightener! I went with three other women, and we all loved using it! The quality is top notch and it was a great price. I would definitely recommended getting one for travel or even just getting one if you never leave the U.S.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron, would recommend.</li>
    <li> fast, smooth, wonderful!</li>
    <li> Works well I&#x27;m quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I am usually a natural (air dry, put in a ponytail) hair type person, so I was nervousness to by a hair iron. But since I shortened my hair it curls quite a bit around my face, I wanted to straitened that out. This iron works so well. It heats up so fast, has adjustable heat, and a digital display I can read! I (a complete novice) was able to straitened my waves quick without feeling like I was frying and damaging my hair into straw. Very nice.</li>
    <li> What a great product. really love that it has temperature control.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It gets my hair silky straight with so much volume it&#x27;s crazy! Please buy!! Worth every penny !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife . I  gave it 5 stars because she loves it and it works great</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron with a good price. Highly recommend. I gave it to My girlfriend  and she loves it. For $40 bucks,it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> i just wanna mention one tiny thing about this product.  It is first worth your money so if you go for it you will love it and won&#x27;t regret that as it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;1) Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;2) Quick straightener&lt;br /&gt;3) Great price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;1) Doesn&#x27;t cool down quickly, it takes really a long time to cool down so you have to be careful not to leave it where childeren are or on the matt etc</li>
    <li> It looked like the picture and the quality was good. The flat iron heated up very quickly and straightened pretty good.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done but pulls your hair out. It&#x27;s a little rougher than I expected. The heat on it is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to have a straightener to take to Italy with me that would work with the 220 voltage, and it was great. I used it all of the time and it worked so well, not like a cheap straightener you get at the drug store, but more closely like an expensive one. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product a few weeks now and it works very well, heats up to 410 like it says and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to get there. Fast delivery. Great product, packaging, cute pouch...so far I love it</li>
    <li> Love my new hair straightener. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do in just one pass. Leaves my hair looking and feeling smooth and straight. Definitely recommend this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. My hair is pretty damaged, so I was looking for something that could help smooth out my split ends while not damaging it further. This product is just that, and priced much more within my budget than some of the other high end products out there. It was shipped extremely quickly and very well packaged. The item also has a free manufacturer warranty for those who may be skeptical about the quality of a lesser known brand.</li>
    <li> Works great for a great price. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> This product is great.</li>
    <li> What a deal!  I was nervous, I have naturally curly hair so I need a great straightening iron.  This one worked great.  $40!  Deal!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different flat irons over the years and this one is the best by far!! You don&#x27;t have to turn the heat up as high as other ones and it still does as good of a job!! This one does better that the high $$$ flat irons out there!!</li>
    <li> it works well. Love that it comes with a carrying bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, well made. My wife and I just returned from Europe - the dual power feature works great. No need for a converter, just an adapter plug. My wife especially likes how quickly the iron heats up and the control she has of temperature. The LED lights are great and always tell you if you&#x27;re at the right temperature. The iron is smooth and gives great results. The auto-shutoff feature is great, especially if you sometimes forget to turn the iron off. Recommend without reservation.</li>
    <li> Pulled on my hair when I used it, not very smooth.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have tried using my daughters larger flat iron for a few years..no success lol this one works perfect and came w all kinds of extras. A pouch,heat glove and oil.</li>
    <li> Product is great. The only reason I&#x27;m not rating it 5 stars is that it says it comes with travel size argan oil but only came with a sample size. Other than that, I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great Product. I took it as a gift for my sister in law and she loved it. It is also 110-240 Volts, so it works worldwide.</li>
    <li> Great buy!!  Very cheap for a high quality item!!!  The same or better quality than my Chi that recently died.</li>
    <li> I have one already that I love. Bought this one as a graduation gift for my sister.  She loves it too.  First time she has ever had a quality straightener!</li>
    <li> Love because it did not burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love that the stick is versatile , you can curl and straightened.&lt;br /&gt;Like because it heated pretty quick.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this chic great little flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great little flat iron with dual voltage.  My hair is pretty frizzy and it makes it smooth and soft.  Heats up quickly and temperature can be controlled quickly.</li>
    <li> I am not a hair professional but can tell you that this iron heats up within a minute and keeps the heat throughout the time I style my hair. My granddaughter has naturally curly and thick hair and her hair comes out pretty slick too! GREAT value for the money because this one included a serum, a glove, and a heat resistant carrying pouch and costed less on Amazon than a cheap one at Walmart. Also, the pouch is phenomenal! I even use it to cover a very hot curling iron just after use and it doesn&#x27;t even scorch it! GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Best straighter ever! It leaves my very long hair super silky and straight. I use it to curl the ends too. The little bottle of oil is fantastic and when my bottle is empty I&#x27;ll order the big one. You will not be disappointed with this straighter!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  The iron does not get that hot and you have to go over the same section of hair multiple times to get it straight.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality and price of this product. It came just as described.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product therefore bought one for my friend.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly. Straightens the hair however, I find it difficult to get curls while styling my little one&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Freaking awrsome! I got a chi for almost 200 about 10 years ago from a salon. This replaced my chi and works faster.  It is also more ergonomic as far as the grip goes.</li>
    <li> I purchased it as a gift for my mom, and so far she has had no complaints and enjoys using it.</li>
    <li> I have used other flat irons that left my hair dull and damaged looking. With this one my hair is smooth, soft, shiny, and looks great!</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased the flat iron purchased.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. I plugged them in immediately to see if they worked. They immediately got hot and the iron works wonders. Thank you  oh and I love the aragan oil.</li>
    <li> The straightener does a great job on my very long hair and the plates don&#x27;t pull it, like I&#x27;ve experienced with others. It heats up quickly and the bonus storage sack is nice. I got this one on a great sale price and seems comparable to $75+ straighteners. Shipping was very prompt.</li>
    <li> Was so much better than I expected. Heats up super fast leaves my hair so shiny. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smooth and shiny. There is a learning curve.  Be sure to use glove.  Once you get the hang of it your hair will look it was styled by a pro.</li>
    <li> Would give 5 stars if half the price.  While this flat iron did not have any problems, it did not live up to the hype as hoped. It is a standard iron that you could purchase for under $20 at Ross, Burlingtons, Marshalls, etc. My very disappointed wife ended up picking up another iron at Walmart for $16, which heats up to 450F, and does an equal, if not better job.  In short, save your money and pick up one at your local super store.</li>
    <li> It is working great but wish it had an auto shut off.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a recent trip to Europe because it has a built in electrical converter. You will still need the electrical adaptor to plug in the flat iron. Worked perfectly on my trip.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! I have thick coarse hair, and this iron works FANTASTIC on my hair. I was shocked at how good it straighten my hair and how long my haired stayed pressed. Best $40 I&#x27;ve spent thus far.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and I loved the free items that came with my purchase, the travel pouch, glove and travel size Argan Oil.  Flat iron gets hot quickly which is great as I always seem to be in a rush.  My previous one took way longer to heat. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star review instead of 5 is because I wish it had a temperature readout instead of a simple turn dial. However, it still works great and I am overall quite happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had the same Chi flatiron for 10 years and was looking to replace it after it stopped working.  After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase the HSI flatiron and I am glad that I did.  It works well on my hard to straighten, wavy hair and I love the argan oil that was included.  I do have to use it on the highest heat setting but it does as good of a job as my Chi did for less than half of the price.  I just hope it lasts half as long as my Chi did.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but not a Chi for sure.</li>
    <li> Great product! love it!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Item was packaged well and is brand new. Easy to use and heats up quickly. Does not snag hair but would recommend brushing out hair before use. Pouch and Argan Oil is a nice plus!</li>
    <li> It stopped working!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever used! My hair has NEVER been so shiny, even my mom kept commenting on how shiny and healthy my hair looked.  I thought my cheap straightener was good enough, but since I want to grow out my hair, I&#x27;m looking for every way to make it healthier. This straightener heats up fast and is so smooth. Never snags a hair, unlike other flat irons. Highly, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Awesome price too!!</li>
    <li> very good for the money</li>
    <li> Replaced a flat iron that I had for several years that worked great. The reviews on that one stated that the product had changed and wasn&#x27;t the same quality.  I thought I would try this one.  Bad idea.  This one ripped my hair out every time the hair got near the edge of the iron.  By the time I was finished using it, I had a sink full of hair that had ripped out.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Leaves my hair silky and doesn&#x27;t have that burn smell, it&#x27;s  not so harsh to where my curls won&#x27;t revert back to its natural pattern. Love this product! Shipped and received before expected time frame also.</li>
    <li> wow...Love it...&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Gave this hair straightener to my sister as a birthday present because she kept borrowing mine. She loves it, and uses it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up fast, and gets the job done. It also comes in a pouch to store it in.</li>
    <li> I got this iron this week, I used today for first time and I loved it! My hair is really curly and difficult to get straight, but with this iron I got a very good result  even though I did it by myself. I highly recommend this product, also It comes with a little container of argan oil which is very good to put on the ends.</li>
    <li> Well, my wife loves it - and I loved the price - much less than other products it&#x27;s compared to. And same-day delivery from Amazon saved me from a forgot-birthday disaster.</li>
    <li> I am in my senior years and have wavy (well, maybe curly) baby fine thin hair. I swim 3-4 times a week and straight iron my hair daily, so it is essential that I get good but gentle results. This product is by far the best straight iron I have ever  had. It has a wide range of heat settings and glides through my fine hair extremely smoothly. I have absolutely nothing negative to say. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great service and great product.</li>
    <li> Is ok.... Does not heat the hair as faster as I would like and am used to.. But it does live hair most silky with the organ oil.</li>
    <li> It works miracles for my hair. i glides through it so smoothly and gracefully. I was skeptical in buying a straighter online, but i was not disappointed at all. I came with oil for my hair but it was dried out. I called and asked if they could send me another one but they haven&#x27;t. Other than that, that it my only complaint! My hair is super curly and in about 10-15 minutes, it super straight! i would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works great daughter lives it</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;It straightens the hair very nicely and fast.&lt;br /&gt;The straightener warms up very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s no words to explain about this flat iron..im in love..this is the best one i ever had out of ever flat iron i bought!!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST flat iron I have ever owned. I have very thick curly/wavy hair and it only took one pass through to completely straighten my hair, my other flat iron I had to go over it 2-3 times before my hair would be straight. It also does wonders curling my hair under or flipping it out. I haven&#x27;t experimented totally with curling it with the flat iron but I am sure it will do just fine! This is money well spent! :)</li>
    <li> Straightener is fine.havn&#x27;t tried argan oil yet</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this given the reviews, but was disappointed.  I had a Chi for the past 2 years that just broke, so the $200 Chi is my only frame of reference.  This HSI iron pulls at my hair strands every time and feels like strands of hair are being yanked out of my head.  I have to release the clamp slightly while running the iron down the length of my hair or it yanks it when it gets near the ends.  But this means the hair doesn&#x27;t get as straight and I have to go over it multiple times to get rid of the frizziness.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one where the plates are slightly uneven to cause the yanking.  The extras are great, especially the satin travel bag, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  Going to return.</li>
    <li> Very Bad purchase..it left my hair dry...And my hair gets caught in plates...do not buy it...not worth any money .</li>
    <li> It straightened my hair just fine.  However,  I feel like my hair gets caught in it and feels like the strands are being pulled.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron! A perfect flat iron at a perfect price! Do not hesitate to order!</li>
    <li> This is a great device and it was delivered promptly! Thanks!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered it for me as a surprise and I LOVE it! Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had! Great price too!</li>
    <li> I have really stubborn hair , and this iron works great for half the price! and it cam so quick!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this appliance was so low cost! This is very high quality - love the digital features, heats up very quickly, has auto-off/sleep, dual voltage.  It feels solid in the hand. Very easy to use. I had gotten this to use as a travel iron but I think it may be my regular iron now. I have had Sedu, T3 and a Babyliss Pro but I like this one best. You won&#x27;t find a better deal than this HSI.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron! Unlike my previous store-bought brand flat iron, it gets hot enough for my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few flat irons and this one seems to be the best so far.  Heats up fast, straightens even thick hair easily</li>
    <li> Love it, does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to do the curls as the video suggested, but for straightening its pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;good product</li>
    <li> I have kinky frizzy curly thick hair. It has always been a challenge to style. This flat iron smooths and straightens better than any other product I have purchased. The iron plastic flats do not burn my fingers and it heats fast. Great price.</li>
    <li> The Mrs. loves this gift I got her, says it&#x27;s professional quality and only has to pass it once instead of multiple times like some of the others. The included oil is a bit of a joke, I would call it a sample&#x27;s sample.</li>
    <li> I love this straightner. I bought it when my Chi finally gave out. My hair is very thick and hard to keep straight. I&#x27;ve had this straightner for three months now and it has done a wonderful job at keeping my hair straight! I was surprised bc it was so cheap! It&#x27;s just as good as my old one if not better! It even comes with a year warranty if it breaks. Very happy with this product  :)</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast! My hair looks super shiny!!</li>
    <li> Pulls hair, the irons do not touch unless you squeeze handles very hard, hair does not slide easily.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this flat iron!  I&#x27;ve bought others for way more $ and this one performs as well, if not better!  Straightens my hair smooth and shiny, heats up fast and holds the heat during use!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best flat iron I have ever used! Works great:) heats up to 450 degrees fast! One time through hair and it is straight.  I loved getting the great price I got on it! Have recommended it to many of my friends!</li>
    <li> My hair glides smoothly through the plates and it quickly does straightening.  I prefer the rounded plates for a less blunt, more finished look, but couldn&#x27;t find one,so settled for this due to great reviews.  The oil was missing from my shipment, so  no comment on that.  This could be better with auto-shut off.</li>
    <li> I am new to flat ironing and with this iron I was able to get the same results that my hair dresser got when she did my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as my $15 hair straightener. I hate that it doesn&#x27;t have the auto shut off as my $15 straightener hard. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever used. Definitely worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> Horrible, heavy, snags hair, dorent heat up well and even. Had to return it, it feels really cheap and even smells like burning plastic when it&#x27;s on!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter.  She loves it.  Wanted a Chi, but after reading reviews I found the HSI to no only be over half the price, but twice as nice!!</li>
    <li> I must say I found a great buy. I have 1/2 white 1/2 African american hair and  the flat iron has no trouble straightening my hair although the only down fall is that it seems to loose heat (not sure if it&#x27;s because I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s to my waist). There is a digital screen that shows the temperature (mine is always at 450) that turns green when is is at the right temperature then blue when it&#x27;s not. I just found that the flat iron looses it&#x27;s temperature often then I have to wait (not long mind you) for it to reach back to 450 degrees. I also like the fact it has an automatic shut off.</li>
    <li> The HSI professional flat iron replaced a flat iron my wife bought from a local store and had to return because it just didn&#x27;t do a good job. Since using this product she is very happy, it&#x27;s like going to the salon.</li>
    <li> Shopping online is a bit like gambling, there is a lot of risk involved and you never know for certain who will come out on top.&lt;br /&gt;Yet, It is safe to say that I hit the jackpot with this HSI straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Quick heat-up, glides across hair smooth and perfect width for fast, precise straightening AND curls.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, with the added bonus goods, how can you not go all in?&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this! Does not snag your hair like some. Heats up quickly and I like the location of the on/off switch.</li>
    <li> I have used it only few times but I am happy with the results. My hair looks shiny and soft after using this flat iron. I do not expect any problems with this flat iron but according to the policy sent together with the iron, in order to return or exchange the product I would need to pay $20 which is half the price I paid for this product. Since I have not attempt to return it I do not know if that condition would be effective in case of any malfunction but I definitely would not want to have to pay that. Otherwise, I think is a good product and it arrived on time. They also send a glove, a pouch and a small bottle of argan oil.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves this flat iron.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My only complaint is where the on/off switch and temp control was put. A bit hard to see and maneuver.</li>
    <li> WASTE of money....FAKE FLAT IRONS</li>
    <li> At 140degrees it does wonders for my feather light short hair so no need for higher temps for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best part about this product is it comes with a &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; bottle of argan oil.  That stuff right there is AMAZING and it smells sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I will order a big bottle of it because I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t last more than 4-6 sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I was disappointed with the product was the carrying sleeve.  You immediately could tell it&#x27;s not meant for quick storage while the iron is hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this flat iron today I&#x27;m in love...I am a hair stylist and I must say this is one of the best flat irons I have ever used even better than the babybliss so far so good I will post pics of a few of my clients very soon thank you atlas supply</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron.  Replaced one that I had for five years that just didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  This flat iron does just that.  My hair feels silky and smooth,  and I don&#x27;t get the burnt hair smell either.</li>
    <li> This is my second HSI flat iron.  I had my first one for over 2 years and dropped it and broke it. There was no question if i wanted to order another one.  I went straight to Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;! Very pleased with this iron!!</li>
    <li> Straightened my hair quickly. Careful of the setting as it can get really hot.  Cools down quickly and has a travel bag in case you need to pack up quickly after using. Good extra to have.</li>
    <li> For those of you who are like me and are afraid to use a flat iron in fear of harming oneself, rest assured that this flat iron is very safe and easy to use. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this flat iron.  It heats up quickly and gets the job done quickly.  You&#x27;ll be pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to love it! She even said she&#x27;d use it on my hang danger if I ever strayed ;0)</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for an upcoming European trip but decided to test it out in advance. It basically works but I don&#x27;t think it heats up nearly as high as my CHI or Sedu. It also does not have any kind of indicator light -- I couldn&#x27;t even tell at first if it was working. I guess it&#x27;s a good flat iron for the price but I&#x27;m not sure I trust it to work well enough during my trip. I haven&#x27;t decided yet whether to keep it or purchase something better. I&#x27;m leaning toward returning it.</li>
    <li> Simply the best and most affordable flat iron I have ever owned or used. A friend who is a hairstylist let me borrow her chi iron when my cheap $20 conair just wasn&#x27;t delivering the results I needed for my thick wavy hair. I used it for a while and really liked it, until I decided it was time to just invest in my own flat iron. I noticed this one on sale(deeply discounted for the original ticket price) and did the research and read reviews as I was kinda worried why the price had dropped so much. Most every review was positive so I figured why not. The box arrived promptly and contained not only the flat iron, but a small bottle of argan oil and a heat resistant glove to protect your fingers. I first noticed that this iron is built very sturdy and was a bit heavy. Not heavy enough that it was uncomfortable to use, but enough that it feels like a quality product. I ran a few drops of the argan oil through my hair as suggested and got to work. It ran through my thick hair very smoothly on a middle temperature setting and I only needed to run it through each section once, unlike some of my previous flat irons. For the price and included oil and glove this product really delivers great results. I&#x27;d never heard of hsi products prior to buying this, but will definately be a return customer.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have thick wavy hair and in no time at all I can have it straight and smooth. The price was great too!</li>
    <li> I really like it! It seems to get hot enough and leaves my hair looking silky and shiny! Works good to put curls in your hair for a wavy look!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I did a ton of research before deciding on this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It heats up fairly quickly, and straightening my hair doesn&#x27;t take long at all. On top of straightening, it also makes my hair look so soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener!  I wish the plates were a little longer, but it is perfect for short hair.  It straightens my hair perfectly and leaves it shiny and smooth instead of frizzy. It shipped a week earlier than it said it would which was a great surprise! The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it said it came with a small bottle of the argan oil and that was not in the package which I was really disappointed about.  It should have come with it because not only does it say on the listing that it comes with it, it&#x27; also printed on the straightener&#x27;s box.  Someone must have taken it out before shipping it. Besides that, I love the straightener itself!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price point. I was hesitant at first because the brand is unknown, but have been pleased for the past couple of years. The straightener heats up quickly, and is effective at straightening medium to very thick, wavy, European descent hair. My one star dock is that at times after five minutes of straight use, it loses full heat and needs to sit and collect full power again. Also, a downside that there is no automatic turn off. I&#x27;ve at times, at user error, have left it on all day. Upside is each time the straightener didn&#x27;t burn out and continued to work well. My hair stylist has asked about my results and what straightener I use! Highly recommend this over some of the other straighteners on the market that go for double+ the cost of this one. FYI - not sure if there&#x27;s a straightener out there that doesn&#x27;t heat damage hair, but after repeated use, this one does. Make sure to use a good conditioner and a heat styling pretreatment to help delay heat damage between cuts.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron based on other reviews and because of the price. The item came well packaged and was here within a week. The item can just as described, with the travel bag, glove, and tiny argan oil. The straightener looks professional and the range of heat temperatures is great for anyone. I love the travel bag because I take it with me everywhere. The iron works great and keeps my hair smooth all day. Great product! I&#x27;ve used my friend&#x27;s CHI before and I truly like this one better and the price is great. Would highly recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and works very well. I&#x27;ve never owned this brand but it does the job well! My frizzy hair is straight and lasts all day. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes because of all the positive reviews! But after one use, I had to return it because my hair would just slip out because there was a small gap even when fully clamped. Not sure if mine is defective or they are all like that. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome-deal we love the iron thanks for the great product. The straightener is working great. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the deal</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Great price for the quality.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time with Prime shipping. It was as described and works great. A bit of advice, plug it in and let it sit about 15 minutes before first use as the first time you use it, it takes a while to hit the max temp. After that first use it should only take maybe 5 minutes to hit max temp from then on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with the product and delivery!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very curly hair and I use a straightener every day. I have spent a ton of money over the years on them. This was absolutely the BEST purchase that I have made. I had to play with the temperature setting for a couple days to find the right one for me, but I would buy this again, without a doubt!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener!!!!</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional 1&amp;#34; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener seems to do the job fine, though the effects last about as long as they did with the others I&#x27;ve used. Like the companion product Argan Oil Leave-in Conditioner, the flat iron may be - in my humble opinion - a bit overpriced for the results, but it is faster than others I&#x27;ve used. Hair damage, in comparison to other utensils, has yet to be determined.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift and it works quite well. The machine has no issues either and I am glad I got it</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully every where I plugged it in in France.  Heats fast and to the proper temps. Very manageable to use and handle.  I suggest buying one.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron. Great quality for price. Works great. No complaints. I recomend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. No complaints; I even bought another one for my mom. Plus Amazon had a great price for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my wife&#x27;s old straightener. At first she said she wasn&#x27;t that impressed, mostly because the LED readout is in a weird place (her words), but after a few weeks I asked again and she said it works perfectly. She still thinks the LED is in a weird spot, but otherwise said this is the best straightener that she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, you get what you pay for. Spend the money on a better one.</li>
    <li> Got one for my wife, she loved it, but someone stole it from her at work, so we bought another one.  Never had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I love  this Flat iron. It only takes a minute or less to heat up. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I give it 3 starts because it does straighten the hair good BUT it also pulls hair and that causes split ends so I returned it. I guess for the price it&#x27;s good but I rather pay extra for something better</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this straightener!</li>
    <li> It is an average flat iron, no better or worse than the cheapy ones you can get in Wallmart. I got it because of all the good reviews that I don&#x27;t understand now after I tried it for a while. I don&#x27;t even have a difficult hair, long easy waves to control. I got now the Babyliss and what a huge difference!!! The HSI pulled your hair . It comes with an oil that it is very heavy but it was just a sample. The name started to fall apart, another sign of the bad quality of the product. All the letters ended on my hand LOL! It was returned without regret!!!</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter loves it!  It has reduced the amount of time to get ready in the morning.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this one. It was functioning perfectly for the 9 months or so I had it. For context, I was using it lightly (probably once every 1-2 weeks), generally gentle with it except a couple of trips in the suitcase.  Then I dropped it off a table, ONTO CARPET, and it broke off the corner of one of the ceramic plates. :( Really disappointed, it was a great product until then. It still works just fine, I am worried about using it with an exposed corner though -- at the very least, it might catch my hair, and at the worst, it could be a hazard. Owell. Might cave and buy it again, but I&#x27;ve had cheaper, lower-quality straighteners in the past that weren&#x27;t easily damaged in a light drop.  To its credit, it FEELS well-made in your hand, warms up quickly and evenly, came with a protective mitt and padded travel bag, and a sample size of an argan oil. I used it overseas with no voltage issues, and you are able to wrap your hair around the rounded sides to make curls (although they require a fair amount of product to stay curly, personally). I did appreciate the heat glove and the soft travel case.  EDIT 8/2015: The chipped plate has now come completely loose, and it keeps painfully catching my hair; the other plate now has a hairline crack running through it for whatever reason, I haven&#x27;t dropped it since. Too bad. I&#x27;m almost tempted to buy it again, but I couldn&#x27;t reward cheap production with a repeat sale. It was good while it lasted, but I&#x27;m going to look for a straightener that&#x27;s not disposable on a yearly basis...</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron and am very disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to do anything to my hair!  My hair is thin and my cheap discount store flat iron beats this one hands down! I have tried adjusting the dials and have found that sometimes if I plug and unplug it occasionally it will heat up a bit more.  Very disappointed. ***I purchased this thru Amazon and wasn&#x27;t able to make a return.  After writing this I found their website and they did an exchange.  The new one works well!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s flay iron broke and needed a new one. Found this one and thought it would be a great replacement. Shipping was fast and came as advertised. My wife loves this flat iron and has actually recommended it to her friend who purchased it and loves it as well. So far it has done what a flat iron should do for the last couple weeks. It heats up fast and cools done fast. Great product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I wanted it to do: smooth out my fringe so it stays straight all week. I used the temperature dial on halfway between low and medium and that seemed just right. I found the ideal place to put the iron after use was the top of the toilet tank as its porcelain and could not be damaged by any residual heat.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the glove is for, maybe if I used the iron a lot on high it&#x27;d be necessary but definitely not for the small job I needed it for. The fancy pouch also seems spurious. The argan oil free sample is nice light oil but has a powerful cheap perfume added - not the effect I want to carry around all day.</li>
    <li> It works great on my hair and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Good but not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener we&#x27;ve ever purchased.  My daughter has very long, very thick hair and this product makes her hair beautiful and shiny.</li>
    <li> The hinge on this straightener is super squeaky.  I am praying that mine isn&#x27;t going to break.  Hopefully they aren&#x27;t all this way.  It does straighten my hair just fine.  The packaging was great and it comes in a nice storage bag.  The glove it comes with is nice too.</li>
    <li> Spent a good hour trying to find the perfect hair straightener. (I&#x27;m a little picky) lol so glad I choose this one. It works great! Price is totally reasonable. Heats up really fast too! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I absolutely love this straightener.  The first day I used it everyone was asking me what shampoo I was using,leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> This straightening iron is superb!  It heats up quickly, and straightens even my very thick, very coarse hair with one pass.  I have been searching for a dual voltage iron which could perform as well as the single voltage irons, but have been disappointed time after time.  I am happy to report that this iron is top notch both in the US and all over Europe.  I love the heat protected bag for when I need to put the iron in my suitcase before it&#x27;s fully cooled.  The product arrived quickly and perfectly.  I am beyond pleased... I would give 100 stars, If I could!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have bought so many straighteners through the years and have never been happy except with my Chi brand one.  This one, however, is the closest I&#x27;ve come to the same smooth feel during use.  Feels durable and well built, as well.</li>
    <li> The temp heated up quickly and it was easy to hold but I returned this product, it didn&#x27;t have a smooth run over my hair during straightening.  It took many runs to get my hair straight.</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  Do not waste your money.  Item took forever to arrive from seller after 1 failed attempt and delivery never arrived.  Product is cheap in quality and does nothing for my hair.  The glove is cute for my wand curler (purchased elsewhere) and never used the oil. I will have to give this away.</li>
    <li> I do not like this straightener. It seems to pull/ break my hair off. I have tried it on several settings. It may work for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Works really well! It is just as effective at straightening as one that I paid three times as much for and shattered when I dropped it.  This is a high quality product and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Easy and move in you hair make it straight without any damage on it .love it</li>
    <li> Love these straighteners! Only need to use them rarely as i have thick afro hair, &amp; the results last for around 4 weeks!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Love all the extras it came with</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it. Makes my hair soft and gorgeous. Works well for making hair straight or curly. Great product. Got here faster than expected too!</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair, 3c and this does the trick.</li>
    <li> I received  my iron in 2 days after I ordered it and I highly recommend this flat iron, my hair is super curly, love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the flat iron for a few weeks and so far love it!  Great product and very affordable.</li>
    <li> I have tried to love this flat iron but I just cant...it doesn&#x27;t flat my hair with ease unless I put it on high temperature and have to go thru it so many times.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Does not pull on hair and has great range of heat settings. The argon oil included is fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> GOOD FLAT IRON FOR THE PRICE!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron. Heats quickly and good heat to get straight hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener because of the rave reviews and because it was on sale. It has been a disappointment simply because it&#x27;s not as hot as I expected it to be and leaves some of my hair still wavy. I have a Chi hair straightener that works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same flat iron for 6 years. I decided to buy a new one and spent a few days researching online. I decided on the HSI. When I first got it, I turned the heat all the way up and let it sit so it could fully heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural black hair that&#x27;s not relaxed. When I ran the flat iron through my hair, it didn&#x27;t straighten it at all!!! It took a bunch of passes to make it even manageable. My old flat iron took 1 pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NO idea how this flat iron has so many good reviews when it&#x27;s crap. I got caught up in the reviews that I didn&#x27;t stop to question why a flat iron that&#x27;s supposed to be $100+ is only $40. I know Amazon has good deals but sometimes there&#x27;s a reason for that. If you have slightly wavy hair, this flat iron will work for you. If you have any type of hair that&#x27;s hard to straighten, look else where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying upgraded version of my old flat iron that works great!! It&#x27;s the Conair Infiniti Pro and it works great on black hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottomline is I wasted $40 and I&#x27;m trying to warn other people who are seeing all of these 5 star reviews to reconsider this flat iron if they have difficult to straighten hair.</li>
    <li> The plates are very smooth and they never snag any hair when I pull through, which is great because that was my major issue with my last straightener. It heats up quickly. My last flat iron was horrible with metal plates. I tell you ceramic makes all the difference.  My hair is straight and soft when using this.  it even came with a travel bag and a heat resistance glove, however I have not used teh glove, it does not seem anything special, just a cloth glove, I dont see how it will resist heat. but anyway, I dont need that anyway and the flat iron is great!</li>
    <li> I have owned a cheap crummy straightener for years and decided it was time for an upgrade. This straightener kicks my old straightener&#x27;s butt hands down!! I never knew it could be so easy to straighten my hair. Love this product so much.</li>
    <li> This flatiron is amazing, it has my hair silky, and shiny,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, if your looking to upgrade your look&lt;br /&gt;and style.</li>
    <li> Best combo straightener I have ever owned. Very quick to use, I usually only have to take one swipe to straighten and two to curl. Love it! You get what you pay for and this is worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Great hot iron. Easy to use, leaves my hair shinny and smooth. Came with a carrying case and a protective heat glove.Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Work great. Heats up fast and comes with heat oils</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron through BeautyChange about a week ago. I think I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it as opposed to my other straightener. So far, it&#x27;s doing the job but I am a little concerned that it isn&#x27;t as hot as other flat irons I&#x27;ve used. Is that just me? My hair is wavy, medium thickness, so I set it closer to about 400. The straightener I replaced with this goes up to 450 I think, so maybe I&#x27;m just not used to this one yet? I&#x27;m going to give it a couple more days before I decide to return/exchange. Has anyone else encountered this issue with the temperature?</li>
    <li> It worked for a month then it bit the dust.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smooth as silk going thru hair</li>
    <li> I used to own a Chi iron and for various reasons had to give it up.  So when I was in the market for a new flat iron I was very skeptical about trying a new brand.  This iron exceeded my expectations!  It&#x27;s great, easy to use, heats up fast and makes my hair silky and smooth.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I loved my BFF&#x27;s so I had to purchase one. I love some of your other products also, Thank You :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Best one I have owned and what a bargain! Hair feels silky smoothe with shine. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! I was seconds away from buying a Royale, when I decided to search for HSI, a product I found out about when searching the top 10 flat irons to buy. I believe HSI was in the top 5. To my surprise, it was at a $39 price point instead of the $ 199 , I saw on the review. It was no question, I was buying it &amp; I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s a  light weight, one pass, easy to use dream !! The only thing (s) I can complain about is/  are the temp dial on the gen. one. I would much rather have the digital dial but not for the increase in price. Also, the color.....where&#x27;s the hot pink or orange?!? Minute things and nothing performance related.</li>
    <li> Chose this flat iron based on all the positive reviews. I actually hadn&#x27;t heard of it before. As soon as I felt those smooth plates I knew it would do a great job straightening as well as protecting, and that it did. I had silky smooth, shiny hair without that &amp;#34;burnt hair&amp;#34; smell. And it surprisingly stayed straight for days! My only complaint was that they actually sent me a sample size Argan Oil as opposed to the &amp;#34;Travel size&amp;#34; that was advertised. But other than that I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it heats fast and lasts as long as I need it on. It does leave my hair smoother than my Chi and a lot easier to manage than using an InStyler. Custumer service is also great!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast  and does not burn hands. Great product and price was reasonable. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Works great on my thick hair!</li>
    <li> Love this thing!! I have very full big curls and this straightener flattened my babies down with no problem!! I&#x27;ve had bad luck bin the past with burning my hair straightening it, but this one worked very well. The free glove is such a genius idea as I can&#x27;t remember how many times ice burned my fingers in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy. I hesitated to order this but needed a good one and decided to try it, My hair is almost white but also stubborn and thick,, Other straighteners burned it and with this I can set it exactly at the temperature I have found works best. I always had to use a special shampoo to get the yellowed parts out and that is so harsh on my hair. I am very pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> The best iron ever.  My hair is wild dry and really thick, really hard to style. Highly recommended. No regrets at all.</li>
    <li> It works great, I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for over a year now and it still works as strong as this first day I got it. love it and will probably buy another product from this company. Im in need of a new curling iron.</li>
    <li> I liked the product and found that using the oil sparingly is best. Good cost effective product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my upcoming trip to Europe, so the dual-voltage was the primary consideration. I selected this particular model based on the raving reviews it&#x27;s received, and now I can only wonder whether those people were reviewing the same product. On the positive side, it looks and feels sturdy and solid, it heats up quickly and it straightens and flattens hair. But those are the basics I&#x27;d expect from any flat iron. Now for the negatives: the control buttons and digital display are located on the inside, between the blades. So how are you to see them?? On top of that, the digital display faces the opposite direction of the buttons; in other words, it&#x27;s upside down. You have to flip the hot iron back and forth in order to see what the display says. I&#x27;ve emailed the seller to verify that it&#x27;s not a defect on my particular unit but haven&#x27;t heard back. I doubt it is. Somebody must have thought this dumb design was clever. But wait, when I tried adjusting the temperature on the digital display, it moves in increments of 20 degrees! Professional model with a digital display, for greater accuracy?? Wouldn&#x27;t you expect it to adjust by a single degree? Or is it just a useless &amp;#34;bell &amp; whistle&amp;#34; added to justify a higher price of the product? I hate going through the hassle of a return, but this is going back.</li>
    <li> This iron is so nice. Definitely a luxery iron. I&#x27;ve had some cheap ones and this is so different. Easy to use and looks like I went to salon. Love that!</li>
    <li> Gets hot really quickly! Light weight! I needed a new straightener that worked better and have been so happy with this one! Great product for a great deal</li>
    <li> Enjoying the flat iron.  Love the price and it shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it!  My hair is smooth and shiny after using it.  Highly recommend and you can&#x27;t beat the price for a high end straightner</li>
    <li> I researched for days before settling on this flat iron.  The comments from people stating that it was as good as their Chi flat iron is what convinced me to give this a try.  I have never had a good quality flat iron before, but I have tried a friend&#x27;s Chi and liked the quality.  This definitely has met all my expectations.  I have collarbone-length straight hair.  I needed to iron out the kinks and turn the ends under so they&#x27;re not going crazy.  I like that I can adjust the temperature and that it heats up within a minute to my desired temperature.  I&#x27;m tempted to buy a second because of the price for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, she&#x27;s really happy with it. She plans to take it with her during her trip to europe.</li>
    <li> The product, while it gets the job done, isn&#x27;t the best product I have used. I find that while I&#x27;m straightening my hair halfway through it loses heat and doesn&#x27;t do what I want it to do. My hair is quite dry and usually does whatever I want and styles easily but for some reason, even on the top heat setting it won&#x27;t even curl my hair under.</li>
    <li> Great product, my girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> I have a great experience with this flat iron. Flattens my hair without any problem and the best part is the price of it!!! Just $39. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. I used it to straighten my hair. And it was awesome due to the fact I did not have to run the flat iron over and over like other flat irons in the past. The only regret is I did not know about this flat iron sooner.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a Chi that I had that broke. I felt that it did not get as hot as my Chi had, so it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as well as I had liked. I also noticed that the plates were not as smooth so I could feel them scraping against my hair, not a great feeling. I actually ended up returning this because I was not satisfied and decided to go with the Chi instead.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great item. Works beautifully on my wavy hair. And I have a lot of it :). Received the product very well packaged and am very happy with this purchase. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the flat iron for about 3 months now.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. It snags your hair when you get to the ends&lt;br /&gt;2. You have to guess at the heat setting as there are not any numbers&lt;br /&gt;3. The flat iron gets very hot&lt;br /&gt;4. After using for a few weeks I noticed it was damaging my hair.  I turned the heat down but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to straighten as well.&lt;br /&gt;I really miss my Chi and can&#x27;t wait until this one stops working so I can get a another Chi.  I won&#x27;t compromise on quality ever again when it comes to my hair and something I use on it every day.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener ever</li>
    <li> This gets hot.  Like burn your hair off hot.  What?  Turn the heat down, you say?  (Slight chuckle).  Still hades-type hot.  Has made me swear off straighteners.  My hair has damaged spots that will be fixed only with a haircut now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m comparing the HSI flatiron to my costco metropolis flatiron and there is no comparison.  The HSI is like most other flatirons out there with a 1 yr warranty.  (The $62 metropolis had a whopping 10 yr warranty and heats quickly.  Unfortunately this model has been replaced by one that is $200).  Atlas Supply, however, quickly went above and beyond to replace the first HSI flatiron I received, which apparently was defective. (I had to have the temp on all the way up to do anything, a no no for bleached blonde hair).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the company, and for the price, I&#x27;m happy with this flatiron.</li>
    <li> Arrivef on time bad s promised</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully...heats fast.  I love the different settings.  Mine did not arrive with organ oil, however.  Not a huge deal because the product was what I expected and very  reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Heats up quickly. Easily creates straight, smooth hair. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new straight iron this is the one.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this straightener and I love it.  It heats up super fast and my hair is pretty thick so I use it on the highest setting and it works like a charm!  The money is worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought it for a present, my friend love it, she said is better than most popular brands. and is a really good price for it</li>
    <li> I got it two days after I ordered. I wasn&#x27;t home and I was scare it won&#x27;t get on time, but it did. I recommended it. The straightener is great, I love pink and its pink. The price isn&#x27;t too high and its really worth it the money.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what I wanted and shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I love the temperature settings. I borrowed a CHI and without it having a temperature control, it was much too hot for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product was easy to use. It heated up very quickly. Size of the flat iron is perfect. Would definitely recommend. With the CHI, I would have to keep going over the same strand of hair 3-5 times to straighten. I only had to go over twice with the HSI.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned or purchased. I have thick coarse hair and live in South Florida where it&#x27;s humid nearly year round. This straightener not only leaves my hair feeling and looking silkier and smooth, it has also cut my prep time down significantly. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It was difficult to ignore the rating and number of reviews for this flat iron. I needed something that was both tourmaline and ceramic to get maximum negative ions, but most flat irons were pretty expensive--not this one! It gets hot very quickly (under a minute)! The power switch and heat dial are between the handles; I love this feature because it stops me from accidentally changing the heat or switching it off while I&#x27;m using it. Just a caution to users: I ended up having to exchange it the first time because the kating was chipped off one of the plates despite very secure packaging. I was used to using a slight shorter lightweight flatiron, so this one has been giving me a workout because it&#x27;s a bit heavier. By the way, this flat iron is priced on Amazon.com at less than half the price on the manufacturer website--a bargain, indeed!</li>
    <li> Gets very hot. Includes a glove and argan oil. Digital temp display allows you to set temperature. Great value. Straightens very well.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using the ionic flat iron.  It was delivered on time and works properly.  Some of the special features like being able to set the temperature and the automatic turn off are an added plus for this product.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS NOT LIKE ANY OTHER STRAIGHTNER OUT THERE. IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE AND AFFORDABLE TOO. EVERYTIME I USE IT IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SMOOTH AND SHINY. I USED TO HAVE REALLY BAD HAIR AFTER USING AN IRON CURLER FOR ABOUT A YEAR WHICH I REALLY REGRET NOW BECAUSE IT MAKES MY HAIR VERY DEAD AND DRY. I REALLY HATED IT SO ABOUT A YEAR LATER I STOPPED USING IT. NOW I ONLY USE HSI  HAIR STRAIGHTNER ON MY HAIR AND IT IS WORKING PERFECTLY FINE SO FAR. WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR YOU, YOU WILL STICK WITH IT. I REALLY HAPPY THAT I FOUND THIS IRON.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  The product was excellent and I got it very quickly.  Do not hesitate to buy this.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I have wavy, sometimes frizzy hair and I was really impressed with how smooth and shiny it made my hair with a few passes on lower heat.</li>
    <li> I had long wanted a  more professional hair stylying experience at home between my visits to my hair professional.&lt;br /&gt;I found it.  I ordered this hair straightner and fell in  love with it the very first time!  I shared it with my professional and she wants one!  My husband loves my hair when I do it just as much as when he paid good money to have it done. :)</li>
    <li> This product is so so.  I typed in Chi to Amazon and this was the first thing that came up. I&#x27;m accustom to the requested product showing up so I didn&#x27;t pay attention. I ordered it. I did try it once and it is not comparable to Chi. I&#x27;m disappointed in the product and Amazon for their current listing practices. Now I&#x27;m out the money as well.</li>
    <li> Great price and happy with this purchase. Arrived quickly and well packaged. I feel it does not burn my hair like my chi does, however it does not seem to keep my hair straight or styled as long as my chi does, but I am still adjusting to it and learning the temperature choices etc. Overall good product and great price.</li>
    <li> Chose this rating because iron heats quickly, has choice of settings, and straightens beautifully. Easy to handle, comes with protective glove, and argan oil sample.</li>
    <li> Broken after the second use at the plug. Walmart can do better than this one!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have owned. This is my third flat iron and this one is the best. Keeps my hair straight all day!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, nicely made, I get great results from this flat iron. Shipped quickly and the travel bag and glove are handier than I expected.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. So much so we bought one for her cousin and my sister in law will be getting one, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this  as s gift and from day one didn&#x27;t work.  Unfortunately, my sister didn&#x27;t try it till later and now its been more than 90 days and it says I can not return it.  Its better to buy a Chi or spend more but it actually works.</li>
    <li> Excellent heat and heats up fast. Easy to use and heavy cord. I would recommend this straightener to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, leaves hair smooth and shiny as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t damage the hair. A great purchase and great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I had not issues with this order it works well at straightening my daughters hair, very happy with the purchase and the sample Argan oil was nice. Have not tried the oil yet.</li>
    <li> I already had a nice hot iron but my hair is very thick and course and it didn&#x27;t straighten it completely. I ordered this product because of the good reviews and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. It heats up super quick and works great!</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This straighter is horrible. It pulls on your hair and it really hurts. And it is not even effective. It takes forever to straighten and still does not do an adequate job! Please do not waste your money like I did. IT IS TORTUROUS TO STRAIGHTEN WITH THIS THING.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I love this item and for the price it&#x27;s one of the bests!</li>
    <li> Got this at walmart  and I love it</li>
    <li> I am black and have THICK curly hair. I did an asymetrical chop in October and when I read about this straightener I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but c&#x27;mon 30 bucks? You can&#x27;t beat that. I was originally looking up a ghd straightener and that was a bit out of the budget so I went with this one. I washed my hair with motions for natural textures heat styler shampoo and leave in conditioner. I was too lazy to blow dry my hair so I just brushed it out til my curls weren&#x27;t as tight (I know this is lazy but I did it cuz I&#x27;m the WORST when it comes to straightening my hair: takes too long and my arm hurts blah blah ya know the struggle lol). When I sectioned it out and got to straightening it worked! HSI did such a good job that the results were as good as if I used my friends ghd (I&#x27;ve used her ghd multiple times and I liked how it treated my hair but hers doesn&#x27;t have a heat dial like this hsi does yay!). The size is 1inch but I was afraid that it was too small and I&#x27;d be sittin FOREVER straightening my hair, but nope! It took the reg 2-2.5 hrs of straightening (I have really curly hair mind you AND i didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair cuz I am lazy lol so thats why it took forever). The next day to retouch my hair it only took about 30-45 mins and I was so happy! I was flippin my hair and gettin fancy with it! I did a few curls here and there lol but to end this LONG review I LOVE IT!!! BUY IT YOULL BE HAPPY! OH the free argan oil is a small foil pack, I thought I was getting a botlly lmaoo but its still a good deal!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron about 4 years ago and it still holds up to the task today. I have thick african american hair and this thing straightens my hair in one sweep on the worst of hair days. The best part is that I don&#x27;t have to crank it up to the highest heat setting. Doesn&#x27;t not seem to damage my hair and fry it as much as some of the cheaper gold plated flat irons do. It was super cheap when I purchased it and would gladly purchase it again if I need to.</li>
    <li> Very excited to use this flat iron.  Good weight, heats quickly and easy to use.  I am super impressed and glad that I followed the ratings of others to help me decide to buy it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have no complaints.  I would purchase this flat iron again if I needed another one or if I needed to purchase one for someone else.</li>
    <li> One of the best straighteners out there. I was a little weary at first (despite the thousands of reviews) because I have thick, frizzy, wavy hair and have been told time and again to get something higher quality than ceramic for my unruly hair. Well that&#x27;s simply not true. This straightener has done absolute wonders for me. Straightens so much better than my previous one (I had a CHI) and I don&#x27;t regret it at all. I absolutely love the argan oil that was included; I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of that stuff, because I&#x27;ve never had my hair so smooth. People have said that it tugs on hair... I think they need to learn how to straightener their hair then. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it doing that, and like I said, I have frizzy, wavy hair, and always had that problem with my CHI. Absolutely wonderful. Will definitely buy another one when this one wears out eventually.</li>
    <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy a flat iron when my Gold n&#x27; Hot one stopped working. She did wonders on my hair, but it worked a little too well, meaning that I was always worried about the iron damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I chose this one (After reading many reviews and watching them on youtube) I was very excited. I have only used it once, but it works very nice for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is not a super fancy iron but seems to be working pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw. I have relaxed hair. Very good for the roots.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  Burns my hair</li>
    <li> It was not what I wanted but it works wonderful I ordered the wrong brand but this works just as good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s definitely better than a flat iron from Walmart, butI have thick, coarse hair and feel like I have to go over it a few times on the highest setting. And I even think the highest setting is a lot cooler than it was when I first got it.</li>
    <li> Now if I can figure out how to use a flat iron we&#x27;ll be in business.  I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not very good at it and it takes me a while to get it done.  But the product does a great job.  I really like it!  It came on time packaged nicely and has worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I overheard my wife talking about how bad her straight iron was, so I surprised her with this based on other users feedback. She loves it. She says it heats up really quickly, the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled, and even comes with a storage sleeve to keep it in. Great value for the price compared to CHI or others.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! It heats fast and works really good on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great.  I would  definitely recommend it. The only thing I don&#x27;t  care for  (not I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product issue ) is that the nob to turn the flat iron on and off is on the inside of the flat iron and is a little difficult  to get to.</li>
    <li> I was originally going to go with a Chi, but I bought this flat iron mainly because of all the good reviews. This flat iron does not get hot. The size and thickness is good but does not do it&#x27;s main purpose! Very disappointed and will be returning.</li>
    <li> Love it! I straighten my hair in 15 mins.</li>
    <li> Love love love.&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say. Heats up quickly, does the job well with ease, mind you I live on the north east coast of South America. Humidity here is every women&#x27;s enemy. I did have a Keratine blowout done but still amazing results. Also got the bigger argan bottle from HSI. Don&#x27;t care too much for the smell of it. Seriously I really don&#x27;t care because my hair looks shiny, healthy and feels really soft. Just buy it already</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my HSI flatiron. It is an excellent quality, and it works very well on my hair.</li>
    <li> So far ..so good. Because I have an excellent hair stylist, I haven&#x27;t had to use the flat iron much. BUT when I do, it&#x27;s fine. It catches hair a bit and I don&#x27;t like that, but otherwise it&#x27;s great. I had a Chi prior to getting this one and loved my Chi. But after  reading so many great reviews about this flat iron, I figured I&#x27;d give it a go and I&#x27;m pleased and glad I did. It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper than the Chi also. I liked that most of all. Heat up quickly and nicely! Like the way it feels in the hand while straightening your hair. GREAT PRODUCT! Thinking about getting another one...just because.  Do wish it wouldn&#x27;t snag your hair though. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
    <li> I thought this was too good to be true. This is by far the best working straightener I have ever owned and I&#x27;ve had a million. It took me about 10 minutes to straighten my hair. I have medium length hair and it is super thick and curly. It worked so good. I am impressed by far. It also didn&#x27;t cringe or burn my hair. The chi I have makes my hair burn and I can smell it (who wants to smell burnt hair?!) but this little beauty straightened and didn&#x27;t burn! Better than a chi!</li>
    <li> ...both of my daughters are always stealing it and leaving it in their rooms rather than using their own. sigh...</li>
    <li> To me it works like any other regular iron hair straightener,I was hoping for an extra better result in my hair...</li>
    <li> Seems a bit awkward to handle in that handle is wide.  There is no automatic off feature which in my opinionn is a necessary feature for most gals.i did not realize this when I purchased this particular item. On /Off control is in a less than ideal location.</li>
    <li> This flat iron snags and pulls strands of hair in the plastic clips that hold the plates in place. Poor design. Boxed it up to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to use and the delivery was on point!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the greatest flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. You will not regret this purchase! Heats quickly, and is magical. Ive had it for two years now and it is still working. The only con is that I wish it had an auto shut off. If you leave it on in the morning, it will still be on when you get back from work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my significant other and she loves it. I don&#x27;t know if its because she&#x27;s been using cheaper models in the past, but I do know that one of her brands that broke was a &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34;.  Every since she received this one, she&#x27;s been washing her hair more and more just to use the flat iron. She really loves how it straightens her hair with one pass instead of several passes from other models. I would highly recommend the flat iron.</li>
    <li> The wife really loves it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I could trust this product at first but it really works and is worth the money. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! My hair couldn&#x27;t be happier :) everyone thinks I&#x27;m going to a professional salon everyday! I sure feel like it! ;) no question. Get this flat iron!!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because of the ratings it has received. I have had the straightener for almost a year, and it still works but it often shows that it is still heating (red light) when it has been heating for more than long enough switching from red to green lights constantly. It also doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to at lower settings so I have to periodically increase the heat more and more. I will not be buying a HSI straightener for my next purchase because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to hold the heat.</li>
    <li> I have used a Chi for years and I was ready for a change.  This flat iron is as good if not better for my hair.  I love the way it is designed.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with my purchase!!! Great price too!!!!</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase with this product...&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone who desires to flat iron their hair.</li>
    <li> Good product. It doesn&#x27;t seem as good as my chi but at a fraction of the cost, I am happy.  Addendum:  It is almost one year to the date and this flat iron is broken!!!! I got several years out of my Chis. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product so far. - heats up quickly!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, received the flatiron the next day!!! Highly recommend buying from this seller. the flatiron was the best purchase yet, it is much better then flatirons bought in retailstores. It heats up quickly, does not burn hair or head. Very easy to use, you can even create beautiful beach waves, love the argan oil it came with, makes my hair look healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is my second HSI flat iron. I bought my first one via Amazon about 3 years ago. The only reason I had to replace it was because I dropped it on the tile floor for the umpteenth time and knocked the ceramic plates out. I was so satisfied with this product and company, I bought it again. The price point is great and it works well with my thick curly hair. If I hadn&#x27;t broken my first one I&#x27;m sure it would have lasted many more years. Highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I like it! it does what it&#x27;s promoted!!</li>
    <li> My HSI flatiron is everything I expected.  It is easy to use, heats up quickly and hair looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 2 months now. My hair is thin with a slight wave/curl and doesn&#x27;t typically take a lot of effort to straighten but so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron heats quickly, my hair glides through with no pulling like irons I&#x27;ve owned in the past and doesn&#x27;t require many passes through to make my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron doesn&#x27;t open as wide as others and I wish it had an automatic shut-off but that&#x27;s all minor.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that it comes with a sample argon oil, glove, and a heat pouch. I will review later if anything changes,but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. .</li>
    <li> Great flatiron.  I bought this one because my CHI, which I loved and had for five years died.  I didn&#x27;t quite have the budget for the CHI, or I would have bought another one.  So, I decided to go with the HIS on account of the good reviews I read online.  It&#x27;s a great product.  No regrets here.</li>
    <li> You know that feeling when you use your iron for the first time and you know is the one? Well maybe that&#x27;s just me but the first time I tried my previous iron I knew I was going to give it away soon even when I just had got it. And I did. It was horrible! When I used my HSI for the first time I was so happy :)</li>
    <li> for the price I really wasn&#x27;t expecting this straightener to be as great as it is! I&#x27;ve always used Remington straighteners in the past and was looking for one that would allow me to curl my hair as well. I can use this one tool and have straight hair one day and curly the next. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I did some heavy research for a travel size flat iron.  Found this HSI professional with almost a perfect score from customers.I read  the questions and answers and decided to buy it.  Once I received it I tried it and found that it tugged on my hair as i pulled my hair through it.  I was going to return it but decided to try it again.  Again when i pulled my hair through it tugged and seemed to pull on my hair.  I was going to contact Amazon that night.  I received an email  during the day from the seller asking if I had received my HSI Professional 1 Ceramic and if I was happy with it.  I explained the problem that I was having. CS said it sounded like I had a defected one.  Would I like a replacement?  I said yes. That was on a Tuesday and I had the replacement that Friday of the same week. Of course I had to try it that night.  I must say the replacement works so much better than the original one.  Very pleased with HSI CS and the flat iron.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. Price was super affordable. This was a great find.</li>
    <li> Good product !!! I tried different brands but definitely this is the best.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  I ordered one for my daughter.  After seeing how well it works, I ordered one for myself!</li>
    <li> Great straight iron for coarse, wavy hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works better than a Chi.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have dark blond, thin/medium hair. I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for a few weeks and I hate it. Within an hour of straightening my hair is poofy and frizzy. Never ordering from this brand again.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter. She has used ceramic flat irons over 10 years. I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her how inexpensive it was. I know she&#x27;s spent over 100.00 each for flat irons that couldn&#x27;t do what this one does.(curl hair) She loves it!</li>
    <li> Love it, works great!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! Better than expected. As soon as I got it I tried it, WOW its wonderful :) You will not be disappointed. It also arrived in ONLY 2 days :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been disappointed with flat irons - taking way too long to work. I just don&#x27;t have the time nor the patience. For the price this one is terrific! Heats up quickly, does it&#x27;s job quickly, and now I never go out without using it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as advertised.  It works fantastic and was a great deal.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It works great on my super thick hair! Heats up fast and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I wish that I would have found it long before I wasted a lot of money on my Chi. The only thing that I don&#x27;t LOVE about it is that the controls are on the inside and the indicator light is on the outside (rather than some flat irons have controls and indicator light on the side so that you don&#x27;t have to move it to adjust if it&#x27;s on).</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron. Easy to use. Quick heat up&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair smooth and shiny no frizz</li>
    <li> Bought this straightner after seeing so many positive reviews on it. Many reviews were saying that it was way better than the Chi-- I had to Chi for about 4 years it finally broke which is why I purchased this one. It doesn&#x27;t even come close to how a Chi works. It took forever to heat up at least 6-7 minutes. There&#x27;s a red indicator light that turns green when the straightener is at the heat temperature you wish however the green light kept going off after  2 seconds of using the straightener. It wasn&#x27;t maintaining the temperature. I had read reviews before purchasing it that it pulled at people&#x27;s hair ... I too noticed that my hair was getting caught and torn. So frustrating and disappointing because I was really expecting it to work well because of the amount of positive reviews.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! A great value.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this Hair Straightener and it was impossible to beat the price.</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron! I&#x27;ve had a chi flat iron for 9 years that recently broke, so I decided to replace it with the HSI iron. It is so much better than my former chi at a better price point! I love the swivel cord and temperature control. I also used the argon oil prior to flat ironing and my hair looked like it does when I leave the salon.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I really like it.  My hair looks great.  It came with a glove to protect your hand and a travel bag.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $200 to replace my Chi, and after reading all the reviews here, I gave the HSI a try.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  Every bit as effective as the Chi, at a fraction of the price.  In fact, I like the HSI better because you can control the temperature and the swivel cord is better quality than the Chi.  As a bonus, it comes with a travel bag, a travel size sample of argon oil, and a glove to protect from burns.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron - heats quickly and makes my hair look fabulous.  Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> This is a good iron.  My only complaint is that it does tug at the hair a little bit.</li>
    <li> Great, simple, reasonably priced straightener!  The only thing I wish it had was a light that showed when it was on/heated to the selected temp.  It works well and the glove and argan oil are an added bonus!  I would recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> The flat iron works amazingly. I&#x27;m super happy with it!! I got flat iron on time and it was well packed. And the company have been in contact with me with I love. Great buy, I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
    <li> this is by far the best flat iron  I have owned, only suggestion for manufacturer would be to put the on/off &amp; heat setting on outsixe of product rather on inside, other than that works great</li>
    <li> my mom has called me three times since Mother&#x27;s Day on how much she loves this flat iron. she has very curly thick springy curls and she&#x27;s says &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t need to ask anyone to straighten my hair for me it&#x27;s so fast and quick I can straighten my own hair! &amp;#34; love making my mom happy!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, works great and looks great!</li>
    <li> Great iron - love it!!!  thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Great iron - does not snap hair and the controllable hear setting is great.  Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Really like the iron.  It leaves hair very straight, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Good hair straightener. Heats up fast, good quality, long cord, and at a good price. Would recommend and buy again myself!</li>
    <li> I wanted a new flat iron in the hopes that I could achieve a salon look. However, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune. Though the reviews for this item were good, I was skeptical since the price is just so reasonable! I took the risk and am so glad I did! I have mixed African American and Asian hair. It is thick and coarse. The argan oil and flat iron worked beautifully and my results were salon worthy! I&#x27;m so very pleased and cannot recommend this HSI iron enough!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  No need for a wand and a curling iron...just use this straightner to do it all! Great value. Best straightner I&#x27;ve ever used! Fast shipping,  too!</li>
    <li> These straighteners are just brilliant they are so easy to use great value they kook good too,  i will be taking them on hols and anywhere else i might just need them . Fantastic buy so pleased</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Love it and the accessories. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine, wavy  hair.  Tried  working with my natural texture to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I was on  a girls only vacation,  watched my  friend use her flat iron,  and  thought  hmmmmm.&lt;br /&gt;BUT she has  thick hair! What  to do?  Got online and read the reviews, ordered this flat iron and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;My  husband gives compliments on my hair all the time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, competitive price and quality product.  My daughter loves this product and it has been easy to use and is perfect.</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist and I ordered this HSI FLAT IRON for work, not for personal use). I must say very very pleased for many years I have always used CHI however, within the last few years the chi tools have not  lived up to much anymore. I made a choice to order this based on the reviews....and word of mouth not only I am I super happy with it the red little case it comes with is nice too. this iron is 20 times better then a chi. I did one side of my clients hair with the chi  the other with my new HSI flat iron.....I want everyone to know a BIG DIFERANCE I MEAN IT((MY CHI IS ONLY 2 MONTHS OLD))  , I cut  my time in half . its hot on a professional level.my client even noticed. and co- workers. NOTE don&#x27;t waste your time and money on a chi. HSI IS THE NEW THING........ HOPE THIS HELPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s ....for some people that say this iron is not that grate. it is the iron is not magic even if its close :) if your hair is not keep well or takin care of. examples:: conditioner other hair care products most important IF ANYONE FLAT IRONS THERE HAIR ALOT PLEASE USE  ((((( HEAT PROTECTENT)))))))this is key</li>
    <li> Hands down the best straightener I have ever used..heats up fast stays hot and works amazing for beach curls too better than a chi and cheaper</li>
    <li> a high end iron for a low low price.  i have expensive irons but this one works the same. you just can&#x27;t beat the price.  even if you have others it&#x27;s worth having this one too.</li>
    <li> Poor quality electric component completed came apart!  Return policy stinks expired quickly so i am out of money as this is now trash.  I would think product warranty would go beyond 60 days.  We use this a max of 10 minutes a day and gently so only reason would fall apart is very poor quality.  Do not waste yr money.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron especially for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry looking.  Just wish the plate was slightly larger but other than that very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got to say I was a little disappointed in this product after reading all the raving 5 star reviews.  I bought this as a quick replacement for my T3 flatiron (which died on me after 5 years).  It seemed to work almost as well at first, but I&#x27;ve noticed this product has done more damage to my hair in the past few months than my T3 (and previously my Sedu) have done in 8+ years.  The first thing I noticed was that the plates are NOT evenly heated.  In fact, although the green &amp;#34;ready to use&amp;#34; light is lit when I first turn it on, I am able to comfortably keep my finger on the edges of the plate even while the heat dial is set to 380 degrees!  It takes multiple run-throughs to get each section straight &amp; even when using a heat protectant cream my hair still looks &amp; feels extremely dry when I finish straightening it.  Additionally, the plates do not glide smoothly, they sometimes tear my hair when I run it through.  If you&#x27;re looking for a quality straightener to use on a regular basis, I strongly recommend investing a little more money in a higher quality straightener (I wish I had saved my $40 I spent on this &amp; put it toward the new GHD eclipse I purchased to replace this straightener).</li>
    <li> Does the job at a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thoroughly pleased with this product and the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased this and LOVES it</li>
    <li> This is perfect, received quickly &amp; product is just as advertised. I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I love it!!  Excellent value and great flatiron.</li>
    <li> This is a great price and a great product.  I was replacing my 5 year old Chi that finally broke (the switch went out and I had it repaired but it didn&#x27;t last long)  The HSI flat iron straightens just as well as the Chi at a fraction of the cost.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s heavier than the Chi but nothing I can&#x27;t deal with.  The product was delivered quickly and just as advertised.  [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 B001MA0QY2]]</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. I went from a Babyliss Professional to the HSI - couldn&#x27;t be happier! Jay as good if not better and at an awesome price! :)</li>
    <li> I have long thick curly hair...usually when I flat iron my hair it takes about 2 hours now I&#x27;m it&#x27;s pin straight and it takes me 45 min to an hour.  I Definetly recommend!!</li>
    <li> ilove the product.. ive bought this because of good review here in amazon.. and it was right. its wonderful, kinda heavy but the ceramic used in the hair it makes it more shinny!! love the product</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because it had such great reviews and many people said it was better than the CHI.  This straightener did not work for me, granted I have thick hair but it took me 45 min to straighten my hair in the morning and it wasn&#x27;t even fully straight just less curly.  Eventually I just stopped straightening my hair and bought another straightener.  I do not recommend this product if you have long or thick hair.</li>
    <li> Received the product within the time frame given.  Very happy with my purchase.  Straightens my hair perfect and gives it the sleek and shine that other flat irons I have used in the past would not.</li>
    <li> Its all been said before in the reviews. Heats up quickly and does a really good job. It arrived quickly and was as described except that there was no bottle of Agadir Argan oil but 2 sample sizes of the Agadir leave in product. Not a big issue.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly and accurately. Product included everything it said it would and was also in the condition that it was advertised as.</li>
    <li> Love it love it.  Got here at super warp speed!! Best order ever!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in love with it but I am not disappointed either.  I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair often so I&#x27;m not a flat iron savvy.  It is better than the flat irons they sell at Wal-Mart/Target for about the same price. It does compare to Chi for a lot less so I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This item received great reviews when I was in the market for a new hair straightener. I cant say this product is terrible because I am sure it would work just fine on not-so-thick, and course hair. I unfortunately have that type of hair, and for me personally, this straightener didn&#x27;t get the job done. I would recommend this product to those with already softer hair, but if you have course or challengingly curly hair, I am not sure this is a strong enough product.</li>
    <li> Not like the ones at the beauty shop. Keeps going form red to green, and back. Does not get hot enough. I am sending it back.I bought one from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply that was less and works a lot better. How do they pay to do reviews?</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a good straightner, but turned out the opposite. Not worth buying because it doesnt strightnen your hair perfectly. it also doesnt heat up to 450.</li>
    <li> I love This productor&lt;br /&gt;I toold All friend&lt;br /&gt;Eu usei e meu cabelo ficou maravilhoso&lt;br /&gt;Recomendo a todas minhas amigas</li>
    <li> I am a hair dresser and have used expensive flat irons in the past. I ordered the HSI flat iron and love it! I use it on medium heat and have to use the glove that comes with it to so my fingers don&#x27;t get hot. My hair has lots of luster and shine, this product competes with the most expensive irons at 1/3 of the cost.  It also come with a bag that&#x27;s great for traveling.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly, very happy with the flat iron</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for well over a year and it continues to be a rockstar. Great for creating loose curls too.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter for her birthday.  She and her older sister love it and it has made the mornings much better.  They can staighten their hair so much faster and it looks beautiful!</li>
    <li> Like the straightener but wish the on/off switch was not in the middle of the iron.  would be better if it was on the side.  delivery was in a HUGE box, unneccessary for such a small item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to order this straightener for some time now but didn&#x27;t do it and then my old one bit the dust so I finally got this one. It&#x27;s great. I usually only straighten my bangs on a daily basis.  I haven&#x27;t used it to straighten all my hair yet, but I&#x27;m anxious to do so.  I really like this straightener so far.  It&#x27;s way more professional than my last one!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loves it. It made a significant difference from the straightener that she was using before. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this on a &amp;#34;super Sale&amp;#34; price. Not sure that I&#x27;ve ever seen it sell for the &amp;#34;retail price&amp;#34; listed but the bottom line is, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. I was weary because of mixed reviews but I have counted on this straightener to deliver every time I have used it for two years without a problem. I have noticed that the light on it goes from red to green all the time and back and forth but I have not noticed a problem using it on red (once I know i&#x27;ve heated it long enough). That might be a glitch. I have recommended this straightener to many and have not heard any negative feedback.</li>
    <li> I love have the pouch and the glove for this flat iron. Works so much better than my old one with the ability to control the temp</li>
    <li> Best flat iron around for the price! Works really good that I&#x27;m going to order one for my daughter. She is gonna love it!</li>
    <li> I am new at hair straightening but  as I practice I find this product very user friendly. Many heat setting and all the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> I like the HSI because it smooth your hair in an easy way and quickly.Also, you can choose the temperature and that&#x27;s good when your hair still wet. I put the oil sample they provided wot the items for more protection.</li>
    <li> I bought a straightener and it is far better than any Chi or Babyliss that I have owned. My SIL bought one for Christmas and it must have been a dud. It doesn&#x27;t work 😕</li>
    <li> This flat iron does not heat up to the full 440 degrees.  The iron pulls my hair when trying to straighten.  It normally takes me 15 minutes to iron my hair but with this iron it takes almost an hour.  Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This is my first quality straightener and wow, what a difference! Two months later it is still going strong.  Unlike many others, you can adjust the temperature setting.  Comes with a nice bag too.  Does not pull or snag hair.  Overall, great buy!</li>
    <li> My wife had a fancy brand of straightener but it began to malfunction after 7 years so we were in the market for a replacement.  I wasn&#x27;t about to spend over $100 again, so I did a quick search on Amazon and this product came up at an amazing price.  I was hesitant because it was priced so low (especially from the regularly priced amount).  The reviews were highly positive so I decided to take the plunge.  My wife immediately fell in love and has only said great things about the straightener.  She says it warms up quickly and does a fantastic job at straightening her hair.  Only time will tell if it lasts longer than her last one, but at such a low price I will be fine replacing it (if needed) in a few years.  Also, it comes with so many extras...the oil was a big hit for my wife.</li>
    <li> I loved it works super good makes my hair straight pin straight doesn&#x27;t burn it either excellent !!!! Yayyyy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it works good ! And cheap</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the speed of delivery and the overall product. This was a gift and my wife has been very pleased with the product so far.</li>
    <li> I bought my gf this on 02/5/15 and the straightner  just quit working all of a sudden ABSOLUTELY nothing happened to it just quit working only lasted for 2 months I feel like I seriously got ripped off not to mention my gf keeps telling me why I bought her a cheap product...</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product so far because I am able to straighten my hair quickly (it is sometimes wavy) and it holds for a couple days.  I do not have any obvious complaints thus far and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is great my hair is wavy and this iron makes it straight and gives it a nice shine and feels good to touch thank u</li>
    <li> Horrible!  I don&#x27;t know if the one I got was a fake or something, but it wouldn&#x27;t heat up enough, and it PULLED my hair out!  Felt really cheap too. Total piece of crap.  I returned it and bought the HAI classic, much happier with that one!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first purchased this flat iron but the skepticism is now gone.  I absolutely can not believe how great this flat iron works and be so cheap!  It gets extremely hot very quickly. The cute little travel bag is a great accessory.  While traveling, I am able to flat iron my hair and put the hot iron in the travel bag and put back in my suit case.  I am an african american woman with natural hair. I normally get my hair done at the salon and could never get my hair to shine and flow like my stylist.  Well that is no longer my issue.  The flat iron makes my hair extremely straight with a very high shine.  I haven&#x27;t used the argon oil that comes with the flat iron because It seems pretty thick and I don&#x27;t want it to weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s the real deal...doesn&#x27;t work half as well as my last one...disappointed overall.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fantastic!  Great quality. Nice packaging, and heats up very quickly.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love how fast this thing heats up!  I have really thick hair, so it takes a lot to straighten my hair.  This flat iron really doe the job, and I love it!  I would definitely recommend this to a friend--especially for the great price it is going for.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have bought in amazon! its been almost a year since I purchased this Straight hair flat iron and it has done wonders to my hair! I will be purchasing again in the near future!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend as a gift, she says it is the best straightener she&#x27;s had. &amp;#34;heats up super fast&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have searched the world to find a flat iron that actually gets hair straight in one run through and gets hot enough but doesnt fry hair and leave hair stiff. I gave this a try because of good reviews and I MUST SAY IT WAS WELL WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS THE BEST FLAT IRON YET! gets super hot super fast and gets hair super straight. I put this to the test just to see how good it was straightening and I left my flexi rods in my hair overnight my hair was curled very tight and with one run through my hair was BONE STRAIGHT NO LIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! left my hair bouncy as well. its also easy to curl with one swift VOILA! Im tempted to buy another one to always have for future references!!! MUST HAVE LADIES</li>
    <li> I have used the flatiron 3 times. It&#x27;s my first time owning a flatiron and I found it easy to use. My hair is normally wavy but will stay straight all day after using the flatiron. The sample oil that came with it is a very nice product. I don&#x27;t have any experience with other oils to compare it to, but I feel like I get better results with the flat iron when using the oil. For the price this flatiron is a steal and I took the chance on it after reading all the other positive reviews. I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product and a great price!I would recommend to anyone looking for a new straighter. Gives you shine while leaving your hair feeling healthy. Fast shipping and packaged nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done.</li>
    <li> I have been flat ironing my hair for over 10 years and this is the ONLY iron that has EVER BURNT my hair. even the old metal tongs circa 1950 left my hair softer and healthier than this nightmare tool. Even with heat protectant ( I tried 2 diff kinds) and balm, this fried my hair and left it feeling like straw no matter how low the heat setting went.&lt;br /&gt;My old Maxius with it&#x27;s peeling plates and heavy, clunky design does 100% better. ot to mention that this irons storage pouch is not big enough, so you have to cramp, shove an jiggle the iron into it, forget the glove. and the free oil it a tiny pouch too small to cover my thick shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;I could forgive the design feature issues if this worked, but it DOESN&#x27;T! Save your mane ladies, buy something else!&lt;br /&gt;(technically, my hair isn&#x27;t \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; as the plates temp hovers under the burning temp required, but my hair is brittle and over processed in ways I have never EVER experienced and never want to again. I had to go to the salon and have inches hacked off and spend a day soaking in coconut oil to get the life back. But then, stupidly, tried again after the week of recoup time on a much lower temp with pro strength heat protectant and got the same awful result. Never again!)</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! It came with everything promised, was delivered on time and the glove it comes with is amazing! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I first received the flat iron, but after a couple uses it stopped heating correctly.  I sent it back and got a refund, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth trying again.  This item has really good reviews, so I may have just got one that had a defect, but BECAREFUL!</li>
    <li> I really liked the product. It works great on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair. She&#x27;s biracial and has long,  course hair. She was so excited at how her hair turned out...and she didn&#x27;t use any product on it!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener i have owned, even over my Chi!  I have had this now going a 3  years! It lets you choose your heat setting which is a plus! I live in the South and when i use this straightener along with a heat protective spray, my hair stays straight ALL DAY long. It does get SUPER hot and warms up pretty quick.  I cant say enough good things about this product. Worth every penny spent.  If anything ever happens to mine, I will use the same seller and get the same one. They have a lifetime customer and user of this product :) My hair dresser even switch over her salon to use this brand! My sister-in-law, daughter and my mother even bought one!</li>
    <li> My new favorite toy!!!  Works great!  Fantastic results!!  And the oil they send with it made my hair is so soft and silky that I could not stop running my fingers through my hair like I had just been to the salon</li>
    <li> very good product I am very satisfy with this Iron flat, this product is very high quality and meet my expectations, thank you</li>
    <li> This is just what i was looking for! It makes my hair nice and straight and with the argan oil really smooth! And it is a bargain! Can&#x27;t find anyting similar.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves it. She says its very easy to operate. It straightens her hair with easy. Great price compared to other flat irons viewed.</li>
    <li> Feels much sturdier than other flat irons I&#x27;ve had, heats up quickly too. I like the traveling case and that the cord can wrap up. I also don&#x27;t snag my hair like other flat irons have.</li>
    <li> I have used this flat iron a couple times and it gets the job done, I have a mixture of biracial hair and it works good with creating straight ends and curls as well.</li>
    <li> My flat iron needed to be replaced and I asked my hairdresser what she recommended.  She is using the HSI professional ceramic flat ion.  She raved about the quality and what a reasonable price she had found it to be.  Of course, she uses hers many times every day, so I thought it was worth a try.  I am so happy that I bought this iron....I have the digital display version and love it.  It heats up so quickly and really does a great job on my older, naturally frizzy hair.  Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> This is an update on my review. I have adjusted the heat on the flat iron, and the lower heat works good for me. My texture is curly and fine. I did not have to use the gloves and it still flat ironed my hair nicely. I now give this a 5 star rating. The key to soft hair is more argan oil with each use.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron.  Its great got a great feel and works really well on my stubborn frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good iron for the price. The settings are versatile and heats up nicely and does a nice job of straightening without frizz.</li>
    <li> My hair has never look this fabulous. I will continue to buy upgrades of HSI Flat Iron straightener. Very reliable!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. Easy to use and really made my hair shiny after using it. Never had any problem and with very elegant pouch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it. Does the job and really affordable.</li>
    <li> This straightener works just as well as the $20 one I bought at Sally Beauty. Nothing special about it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still believe that it straightens just like a $20 one. BUT it doesn&#x27;t do the same amount of damage on your hair. My hair is so much softener and healthier since I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats extremely quickly and produces fantastic results. The ceramic/tourmaline plates create smooth, shiny hair in very little time.</li>
    <li> This flat iron Heats up fast - it is easy to use -and it  cools down quickly. This is the first time I have used this brand but will use again if needed.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Chi, but I bought this based on the Amazon reviews and the price.  I have been using it for a few months now, and I love it.  It works as well as a Chi, and it&#x27;s much more affordable.  If you get this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  UPDATE:  It is almost 3 years later, and this flat iron is still going strong.  A few months ago, I thought I&#x27;d try a Chi--figuring that if the HSI worked that well, a Chi must be even better, right?  Wrong!  I used the Chi a few times and then sent it back.  It simply did not flatten my hair as well, and it didn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the HSI.  I love that the HSI has an adjustable temperature; the Chi I purchased for considerably more money did not.  This is seriously the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are misleading others. BUT, DONT buy this product., my Lala Ali  2-in-1 wand and flat iron(walmart) gives me better results. I have fine hair, it straightened but i wasn&#x27;t impressed. Whenever a company knows that the product sucks, they throw in distraction items. Hence, the argan oil, pouch and glove. Feels supppper cheap, btw. Professional , my (rear end) !!</li>
    <li> This is the high quality and priceless product to carry out and protect your hair. I love it. I sugested to everyone need because is affordable and beautiful</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift so unsure about using it, but the price was great and it was shipped very fast. Product looks great in the box and comes with a storage case and sample of argan oil which is nice.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Received exactly as described. Iron works great! Love the adjustable temperature feature. The hot oil sample was fabulous.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron; and all I can say is,\\&quot;my hair has been completely transformed!\\&quot; I have thin, fine, but frizzy hair, along with a steadily increasing number of greys.  I wash my hair every day just to give it some body. After washing, I use the HSI Argon Oil leave in treatment on damp hair (just a drop--AMAZING!).  Then I dry my hair and use the flat iron on a low setting; and in less than 5 minutes my hair has body, shine, with no evidence of frizz!  And after a few months, I have not noticed  any damage whatsoever.  I would highly recommend this combo...not only is the iron as good or better than CHI or any of the more  expensive irons, it is more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Loved it when I first bought it. But now 2 years down the road I already need a new one. Doesn&#x27;t heat as well as it did when I first bought it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and happy with the product.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this iron in January 2013.  It has worked fine. Suddenly the plates are sticking out and it pulls my hair.  Although it has a 1 year warranty, you have to send a check for $20, then pay to ship it there.  For that, I&#x27;ll just go buy a different one.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, and worked amazingly well.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a similar CHI product for a number of years but the HSI product was just as good, if not better, than the CHI and for a significantly lower price.  I would definitely purchase the HSI product in the future and recommend the same to my friends.</li>
    <li> so far is good, the quality is ok. but for my hair I like it for now.</li>
    <li> I wanted some straighteners to use on holiday in the US.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product which arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;I will use on subsequent trips!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> After extensive research on an affordable but good flat iron, I came across the HSI and was NOT disappointed. The iron itself is lightweight and has a good grip on the outside. Although it comes with the gloves, I actually haven&#x27;t needed to use it yet but certaintly great to have. The HSI gets my hair super, silky straight. I have very thick, course relaxed ethnic hair. However, it does get my new growth very straight as well. This iron also gets very hot and I actually keep it on medium temp to avoid frying out my locks. The Argan Oil is a great addition as well. The sample pack is small but any other good hair oil will do just fine. I prefer either olive oil, Argan or Moroccan Oil for my hair. Argan and Moroccan is more light as Olive is heavy but you only need a little bit. The seller also described the item very well and the pictures are exactly what I got. All in all, this was a great buy and I&#x27;m very happy with my new flat iron! :)</li>
    <li> This had (and still has) such great reviews but I can&#x27;t say that I was impressed.  First of all, when I received the box, the argan oil sample had leaked all over and also stained the thermal pouch that was included.  So before I even used it I had to clean up a huge mess.  I contacted the company to let them know - they apologized and said they would send another sample of the oil and another thermal pouch and I never received either of these things.  Not too big of a deal as all I really cared about was a good flat iron.  The flat iron itself worked ok but would not keep its heat very well.  I don&#x27;t have thick hair and wouldn&#x27;t leave the flat iron in my hair for long periods of time but the temperature could just never keep up so it was always cooling down to the point that it didn&#x27;t work very well at actually straightening and I would have to wait for it to heat back up again.  Then just recently, one of the heating plates just completely came disconnected at one end so even though it would heat up, my hair would always get stuck in it.  I am a stay at home mom of 3 so I don&#x27;t even do my hair that often, so needless to say this flat iron didn&#x27;t even get heavily used and still fell apart.  Now I am back to shopping for something different and won&#x27;t be buying one of these again.  I am glad other people have had a good experience with theirs - I must have just had a dud.  Sorry I can&#x27;t give it a better recommendation.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It is by far the best one that I have ever purchased. I saw several reviews stating that this flat iron didn&#x27;t heat up fast enough. However,  to me, it heated up very quickly. It is easy to grip and goes through my hair with ease. I have thick, long, wavy hair so finding this flat iron was a blessing. What a great price too!</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron.  It warms up quickly and really works well.  I only wish it had an auto shut off button, but aside from that, it&#x27;s a great product.  What&#x27;s even better is, the company shipping it, Blue Novalties, is a company you can trust.</li>
    <li> Good Product, my wife likes it so far, came in well packaged and as promised!</li>
    <li> THIS IRON IS NOT AS GOOD AS I WAS HOPING...DOES NOT STRAIGHTEN AS WELL AS OTHERS I HAVE USED BEFORE</li>
    <li> This iron is worth well over the price I paid. I had one much more expensive and it was not even close to as nice. Very satisfied with my decision to buy this. Works awesome with my fine hair, doesn&#x27;t fry it like my last, more expensive iron.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My only complaint is that I did not receive the free travel sized oil as promised on the package. However loved the flat iron</li>
    <li> Good product, although the temperature has to be set towards the highest setting for my medium length African-American relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this because there were so many good reviews.  It&#x27;s impressive when you open it, but when I used it for the first time I was disappointed.  It feels cheap...I don&#x27;t know how else to say it.  It also snags my hair which only adds to the cheap feel.  It gets hot but my hair doesn&#x27;t straighten that well with it.  I only have slightly wavy hair so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  I really had a better time straightening my hair with my cheap Conair flat iron from Walmart.  I will continue to use this because I don&#x27;t want to lose the money, but I have to heavily rely on my curling iron.  I would suggest further research before buying this product.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal iron! Truly professional and at a great price! My hair is smooth and soft and I get compliments all the time when I use it. &amp;#34;It looks like you just got a blow out at the salon!&amp;#34; :) I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent professional flat iron. It straightens and curls perfectly. One caution if left alone too long it will auto shut off</li>
    <li> This iron has worked very well.  It has a nice travel bag and the oil was a happy bonus.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I am new to flat irons.  This one is simple and easy to use.  I have high-lighted blonde, fine hair.  I set the heat on the lowest setting like you are supposed to with my type of hair but it was not warm enough.  I set it somewhere between Low and Medium.  I think this HSI is very easy for someone to use who has never used one.  I received the pouch, glove and Argon oil with my order.  I would definitely recommend this flat iron and the company that sent it to me.</li>
    <li> Absuteky love how smooth it is! Works very well and love automatic off timer</li>
    <li> it heats up good and it straightens my hair perfect when its at the heat level that I want,  the only problem was that as I&#x27;m straightening my hair its starts to cool off and it doesn&#x27;t straighten it as well anymore. I have to wait until it heats up again to start straightening my hair. its sooo annoying.!!!!</li>
    <li> This product worked so well! Far better job than the others I have used in the past and am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Better than store bought</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price! Takes me 15-20 mins to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I had a professional flat iron that ran me $200 prior to purchasing the HSI.  The HSI has beyond exceeded my expectations and for the price, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair with a slight natural wave -- this iron works great!  Gets hot enough that I can straighten large sections at a time and be done quickly.  Got my daughter the same one as she has similar hair and she loves it as well.  Great iron!</li>
    <li> Love this iron!  After going through many flat irons I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  My hair took less time to straighten and was very smooth.  Was delivered quickly too!</li>
    <li> I love this it heats up so fast but doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell burnt . Good price for a good straightener</li>
    <li> Great product, love that it came with a  case and glove. I have been looking for a good flatiron that will not break the bank. so excited.</li>
    <li> Great product. Liked the package and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. The one I had ended up with a short in it and would no longer heat up. I shopped on Amazon to find a good replacement and found it in this straightener. It comes with a handy pouch for when you have to pack it up still hot. That&#x27;s nice. And mine came with a sample of Argon oil. Also nice. Makes my wavy hair silky smooth and it is so easy to use. There is a dial for heat control and a light that turns from red to green to let you know it&#x27;s ready to use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Fiance and she loves it. I bought it because it has a ton of great reviews and according to her its way better than the pink zebra one that she had.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews and what a disappointment,does not get nearly as hot as it should,did not  make hair all that straight....piece of crap,these reviews are very misleading....will keep as back up but hopefully will never be stuck having to use it....</li>
    <li> Naturally I have pretty straight hair so I don&#x27;t know how it would work for women with extremely curly hair but for me it&#x27;s works so nicely! I&#x27;ve had for over a month now and it does next to no damage to my hair which is nice and it genuinely keeps my hair straight. Also, I can curl my hair with it if I want and that works wonderfully as well. :)</li>
    <li> I have only had a chance to use the straightener once but I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far.  I have curly, thick hair and it took me a lot less time with this straightener versus other brands I&#x27;ve used.  Great value, as well!</li>
    <li> This hair straightner is worth the price works better then ones I have paid over 100.00 for. Definatly would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for thin hair like me. If you have got thick and real THICK HAIR DON&#x27;T GET IT!!! The bad part I find with this iron is, it is so heavy and it heats too slow. When I&#x27;m really late for any function or even office, I have to wait for it or leave it...please heat up fast!! I gave only 3 star for that reason. Except for that, it does works nice!</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I bought this for my wife, she wanted a Chi and i bought this by mistake, but she absolutely LOVES it!!!!! It was a great buy and i received two thumbs up!!!!</li>
    <li> My last flat iron was a CHI and I liked it a lot so I was holding back on buying a new one because of the price. I found good reviews of this HSI flat iron and decided to give it a try. I really, really like the results and how hot is gets. It has a digital screen that tells me how hot it is and it heats up in less than a minute! I am a busy Mom and do not have time to wait so this is a great feature.  Overall, I am very pleased. Hopefully it lasts, we will see.</li>
    <li> I placed my order on July 16 and received it on July 18, which was amazing! I used it about two times but now it won&#x27;t turn on! I&#x27;ve tried to hit the reset button and everything but nothing works. Pretty upset because I got rid of my old flat iron and now I&#x27;m on my way to work with crazy, frizzy hair. I guess you get what you pay for but I thought I would at least get some more use out of it. At this point, it was just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> looks nice and small. It is easy to use with four buttoms  I like this one better than the one I use before.</li>
    <li> I have major curly hair and frizz, I love this straighter it gets the job done</li>
    <li> The best!!! Super happy with my iron!</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons, they come with a beautiful bag, digital on and off window it blinks when the tempertaure is ready.  It does get really hot!  You also get a hot glove to help while styling!! I love these and hope they do not break anytime soon!!!!</li>
    <li> I like how fast it heats up. It also stays hot while being used. What I don&#x27;t like is that it pulls on the hair, it isn&#x27;t always a smooth motion. Overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> After 12-13 years of consistent use, my Chi straightening iron died (rip!) I was going to order the same one, but with all of the high reviews and the price of the HSI I decided to give it a try. Excellent product. My hair looks great, heats up very fast (maybe like 5 seconds slower than the chi, but still very quickly!), gets really hot, and does the job! Love it - would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift but was pleased that it arrived within 2 days of purchase and was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> My package came quickly and I and just as other reviewers stated this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  As a person of color with fairly coarse hair at times, I use the flat iron on close to it&#x27;s highest settings.  Not only did the iron heat up quickly, but it took almost no time to flat iron my hair 10 minutes tops.  I love that I have a case to put it in as well.  This was a wonderful buying experience and not only would I not hesitate to buy this product or suggest it to family and friends, but I will make sure to refer them to this seller as well.</li>
    <li> As good as any other $20 flat iron.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian my hair type is: Thick, long, curly kinky hair. The hair around my crown down to my parting line tends to be a tad bit courser than the rest. If I don&#x27;t use conditioner my hair is almost impossible to straighten. This product benefited me in the following ways plus some more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Came 1day before predicted date!&lt;br /&gt;*Works wonders also and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair!&lt;br /&gt;*The price is a total steal! But it truly is one of those &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; type of deals. Though it works wonders for most hair/most people just as good as a top dollar flat iron it&#x27;s older generation of flat iron compared to what you see today with modernized flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;* The on and off is a slideable switch on the inside by the plates as so is the temperature dial. And a design flaw for the most because the dial is small and could be made bigger.&lt;br /&gt;*The &amp;#34;heating up&amp;#34; light(red) &amp; &amp;#34;ready to use&amp;#34; light(green) work fine.&lt;br /&gt;*The end of the cord to plug into the wall is like one you&#x27;d see on your hair dryer. I call it a mini breaker switch.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s all black, of course. The travel sleeve is soft and is red. In great condition!&lt;br /&gt;*The glove is literally a black, light duty garden glove.&lt;br /&gt;*And the hair oil is a sample size. Yes, it SMALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the flaws described in the overview, it&#x27;s overall a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and so far it has performed as well if not better than the last $180 GHD I was using...hopes it continues.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my first iron flat and I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;so quick, easy and safe.&lt;br /&gt;can bring it also abroad when I travel.</li>
    <li> girlfriend loves it.  says it&#x27;s the best thing she&#x27;s ever owned.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product and the price is right from this seller. She has dropped one and cracked it and lost one so this is the 3rd I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Shipped and arrived immediately! Iron works wonderful! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this one. I have naturally VERY curly hair that is dry and starting to thin. I wanted to be sure to get a flat iron that was easy and convenient to use and of good quality, but at a reasonable price and would do the job of straightening my hair without burning it up or drying it out further. I&#x27;ll have to say I am well pleased with my choice. I just love my new HSI ceramic tourmaline professional flat iron!!! The adjustable temperature control up to 410 F, the on/off switch, and the red to green ready light are a real help, not to mention that the plates glide quickly and easily through my hair. At first I was intimidated at the very thought of using a flat iron, but NO MORE!!! This iron makes the process quick, easy, and painless!!! Lol! I use my HSI flat iron now A LOT with no previous flat iron fears (burning my hair, not getting desired results, etc....) intimidating me. It&#x27;s a breeze! Couldn&#x27;t be easier! Fantastic results! HSI has made me practically a pro at straightening my hair quickly and easily in no time at all!!! And everyone that has seen it is shocked that I can get it that straight at home by myself. It&#x27;s great to have the option now.....curly or straight with no harsh chemicals involved, just my HSI flat iron and a little time. WELL PLEASED and would recommend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I love this wand. I use it on my hair very often. All of my friends own one of these wands so I just had to get me one too.</li>
    <li> I noticed this product from an email.  It seemed like a great price and I was looking for a travel iron so I ordered it.  The HSI is so much better than my CHI.  I finally get salon quality styling so it&#x27;s the only iron I use.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! I have very thick hair so it takes a lot to straighten my hair.  This product works fast and gets really hot without burning my hair like I have experienced with others in the past. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome flat iron!!</li>
    <li> Very nice packaging,  I have  one issue with this product, that being that the dial to control temps is in an awkward position between the two plates on the handles and it is difficult to figure out where you have placed the temp because there is no dot or mark on the dial to indicate.</li>
    <li> In love with this flat iron ,,, very high temprature , it tames my frizzy hair ,, leaving it soft and shiny my only complain is that it sometimes buckle with my hair from the upper part though it&#x27;s still worth purchasing</li>
    <li> This arrived fast, and works great, I would buy from this seller again, and recommend the product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great item! I use it all the time. Even better customer service.</li>
    <li> i got the package today morning.&lt;br /&gt;package came earlier so happy but&lt;br /&gt;when i open the box.im so disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s obvious used!!&lt;br /&gt; hologram sticker put only one side(open too easy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and dust bag had some stians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;last the iron...it shows many signs of being used!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i&#x27;ll return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these, one in May 2015 and one in August 2015. The first one fell off the bathroom counter in August. I guess it hit the floor just right (or wrong) because it wouldn&#x27;t come back on after that. Other than that, this iron is fantastic and way more affordable than many comparable, but more expensive, irons. It heats up in seconds and does a wonderful job of straightening my hair. It is so efficient that it takes me very little time to straighten my whole head of hair! I definitely recommend this straightening iron.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife and daughter to use in an upcoming Euro trip. Have only tested it at home so far. Works as advertised and quality looks decent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite hair straightener, but it is good value for the price. The biggest issue I have is my hair breaking; with my Chi, I never had this issue. It&#x27;s gotten better as I have learned how to better use it to avoid breakage, but it was something I noticed the first couple times I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it gets hot really quickly and stays hot!</li>
    <li> I have had way too many flat irons, and this is the only one that has given me the results I desired. I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair before use. I braid it to stretch out my curls a bit and have at it. Super smooth with only one pass, and I don&#x27;t have to crank it up to the highest heat setting to get it to work like with other flat irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great product! Light turns green when it has reached set heat but light will turn between red and green while in use but it still works normally. I&#x27;m assuming this happens because some heat is lost while you&#x27;re straitening with it.</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter and she loves it.  Smoothes her thick hair so well and gives it a beautiful shine.  Plus it was an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is definately a good deal and an awesome product. It is smooth and heats up very quickly</li>
    <li> This is my second HSI flat iron and I love them. The first one I dropped on tile and the ceramic broke, so I was sad, but also glad that these are affordable, so I was able to jump on Amazon and order a replacement and have it here in 2 days. This heats up great. I use it for my to straighten my hair and curl my hair. I also have thicker hair and works great.</li>
    <li> this is a very good flat iron..it may be the best I have ever owned its leaves my hair shiny and smooth and it lasts for a long time. my hair is very curly and I have trouble getting it very straight but these made it very straight almost like I had a perm :) remember to use a heat protectant tho because I didn&#x27;t use one at first so I got a little bit of heat damage and it was hard to get my curly pattern back but with a protectant its perfectly fine! I would definitely recommend these and the packaging is very nice as well. they came with a silky red bag to store them in...I love these</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Heats up fast and stays heated. Doesn&#x27;t time out so make sure to turn it off. I found no use for the glove and haven&#x27;t tried the oil.</li>
    <li> Had to buy based on all of the positive reviews. Not disappointed for sure. Great product!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is perfect.  Heats up quickly and works really well.  Comes with a nice carrying case.  Comparable to the $100 flat iron I had before.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works wonders on my naturally curly hair! It heats up quick and glides smoothly on my hair. I would recommend</li>
    <li> Works like a charm straightening my hair and leaving it frizz free.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron. It gets nice and hot and does a fantastic job on my hair. I have very thin hair but if I just do the ends the flat iron does a great job!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> awesome, amazing straighener! heats up fast, works great! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Has to be, this thing is garbage...i&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and i went and bought a ghd yesterday and it&#x27;s much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how it compares to sub $50 straightners, but if you value time and money, save it and get a reputable brand.</li>
    <li> This product got to me quickly and without any issue. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality, especially for the price. It works without burning my hair to ashes. I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> The blades are disconnecting from the black plastic. I have a cheap $20 straightner that has worked better than this. This isn&#x27;t a straightner I would recommend for curling. Strickly for straightening.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought. Far surpasses the CHI.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a christmas present for my room mate and she loved it, it also comes with this oil that makes your hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! i was very skeptical but well worth the money!! it smooths the hair leaving it silky and it gets hot quick and curls wonderfully!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like butter. I love it and wish my cheap self would have got one sooner. Be good to your hair and wallet with this gem.</li>
    <li> Amazing Flat Iron!! Straightens and curls with ease! Dropped in bathroom floor once, and ceramic shattered, not very durable compared to other competitor companies.</li>
    <li> Ends do not touch evenly, there is a gap between them and to close the gap you have to push hard on the hot spot. Because of this I returned it.</li>
    <li> Awesome Hair straightener!  Love it!  Better than a CHI! I would highly recommend this product!  Great value and wonderful quality!</li>
    <li> Im very happy that i bought this item. My hair looks so cool and it doesn&#x27;t dry it like other hair straightener I really like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading all the good reviews &amp; I&#x27;m really bummed with the results. I have long,thick,wavy hair and my hair was very staticky after I finished with this straightener. It doesn&#x27;t look smooth even with product. Also when I got to the bottom of my hair I had to lift &amp; clamp about 3 times to finish the section;otherwise it pulled out my hair. Also it automatically turned off while I was straightening my hair. I returned it today &amp; am now on the hunt 4 another one. At least the return postage was pre paid.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Returned as soon as I got it. Somebody is way overpricing the original price in order to draw some buyers.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned and it was a great price. My hair is very fine but very curly but with 2 strokes it was super straight !! Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, awesome price, and love how soft it makes hair!!! I like this better than the CHI I had before purchasing this!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Not only was the price reasonable, the product is amazing!! I recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Great procuct. Iron gets extremely hot and irons hair better than the expensive flat irons I was using. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener. Its pretty good for the price and it makes quick work of my bushy hair. The only thing I would change would be that I wish that it had an automatic shut off after so long. But other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> HS! Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Iconic flat iron.  I purchased this item for myself.  High quality.  This iron does a great job.  It stays HOT while in use.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I wish there was a retractable cord.  It&#x27;s not a Chi, but it doesn&#x27;t have a Chi price either!  Get one you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> The metal plates tug on stray hairs when im sliding the straightener down my hair. Thats annoying. I guess its a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; kind of product. I really didn&#x27;t want to spend plus $80 for a hair styling tool so now im stuck with a mediocre hair straightener. It does the job.</li>
    <li> I only wish this iron had an automatic shut off..otherwise works perfectly, like salon...highest setting is very hot.....that is about all there is to say....</li>
    <li> I was inspired to buy this flat iron, despite not ever hearing of the brand before, because of the rave reviews it received! This far I have not been disappointed. It heats up fast and straightens my hair in no time!</li>
    <li> I purchased two one for me and my daughter.  I am mixed and my hair never took to flat irons well until now. It does the job fast and my hair is shiny.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. It heats up quickly (~1min) with a red light that turns green when it&#x27;s ready (none of that blinking light &amp;#34;is blinking ready or not ready?&amp;#34; ). It&#x27;s easy to hold, no temp dials in the way!  I don&#x27;t use the heat glove, but I can see how someone may want to use it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well! Gets hot very fast. Lightweight. Great value for the price. Comes with a glove and a tiny product sample.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightner. Heats up very quickly. The swivel cord makes it very easy to use. I have not had any trouble with my hair getting stuck or pulled out at all! What a great value</li>
    <li> The flat iron is too bulky. And the switch is in an awkward place. Also the light to see that you have it turned on is hard to see. I would not buy this flat iron again. It works for now, but I&#x27;d rather have a more slender model that is a little longer and not so awkward</li>
    <li> Did not like this flat iron. Upon 1st use it consistently snagged my hair!  I was looking to replace my Chi but I&#x27;m good!</li>
    <li> It is a nice gift. Customer highly satisfied. Very well packaged. Good-looking and functional!. I wish they would include some cream and/or spray which would go with the treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener and it&#x27;s price. Bought it awhile ago and it&#x27;s still going great. Was surprised considering I use it all the time and I have dropped it several times. It  straightens very nicely</li>
    <li> Works great so far and my wife loves it. Ceramic plates are smooth and glide well. Shipper (blue novelties) was also excellent, and shipped promptly and as described. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace my flat iron but didn&#x27;t want to pay too much. Came across this one and loved the reviews. I ordered it and it works wonders. I love it</li>
    <li> If my hair didn&#x27;t get caught in the little nooks and crannies and pull my hair, I would have given it five stars. This flat iron does the job and I like the look and feel of the iron, but I just lose too much hair when I flat iron. My hair gets caught between the tip of the iron and the plates and pulls my hair. Yes, it hurts and that doesn&#x27;t help with starting my mornings on the right foot.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it&#x27;s very easy to use, and I like the LCD screen to show the temp. If I take too long to iron my hair, the iron turns off and by the time I notice it&#x27;s turned off, I have to re-iron that piece again. But, I would be complaining if my house burnt down because the iron didn&#x27;t automatically shut off. So, I&#x27;m glad it has an automatic shut off for safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this flat iron because the price was great and it had so many good reviews. I also received the iron fairly quickly. I am happy with my purchase. Thank you HSI!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. So far it has been working fine. it&#x27;s got enough heat to straighten your hair and it does not damage your hair at all.</li>
    <li> Even with The Chi I was not getting results as good and as quickly as this one, which I got on the first try!</li>
    <li> Really like it! This flat iron does a great job. You only have to go over your hair one time with this iron.</li>
    <li> i only wish the iron was bigger because I have thick hair, but its hot and was a great price!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair that is prone to frizziness.  First of all, let me say that after the countless 5 star reviews I gave this a shot after using a Chi for 6+ years.  This flat iron has totally damaged my hair; it snags and pulls.  My hair is super uneven now! I use plenty of leave-in heat protector, so I know it is from this flat iron.  Not to mention I can never get my hair totally straight and if I do, within an hour or so it is a frizzy mess. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I could give this a negative star I would.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail today, I bought it because I have very thick, wavy, unmanageable hair that I just cant stand :( After running this through my hair, my hair is straight, and manageable :) I highly recommend this to anyone who has trouble with their hair. Just be careful though because it IS HOT! And its easy to get your hair stuck in the plates. Aside from that, its a wonderful product. I can hardly wait to get the bottle of Argon! :)</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron for the price. Heats up fast, gets very hot, and  does not pull on your hair. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good flat iron since I went natural in 2008. I bought a little cheap walmart brand flat iron and it worked OK but was not great. I only straighten my hair about 3 times a year and my hair never got as straight as I wanted it. With his flat iron my hair looks as if I just got a fresh perm. My hair is smooth, shiny, and manageable and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price! This was a great buy!</li>
    <li> I truely recommend it. Its really handy. My hairs are until my shoulders. It takes me less than 5 mins to straight them with tjis handy iron. I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this less than 7 months ago for my girlfriend and it has already broke with only minimal use. Very disappointing to know that something she was so excited about now doesn&#x27;t work. The problem is that when plugged in only one side of the iron heats up leaving it impossible to straighten hair. Wish the company would replace the broken iron, however it seems impossible to contact them.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick! Have only used a couple of times, thought my heat protecter spray didn&#x27;t do the job anymore, notice the iron has a scratch down the side. Will be returning for a replacement as I believe it is the best flat iron I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned, but to be fair, I&#x27;ve only ever used the cheap ones ranging from $10-$20. But this one beats those at least. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this once i read all the reviews. First off it said it qualified for prime shipping. It didnt. No big deal, i was still excited. Got it a couple days ago and used it for the first time today. I need 450 degrees for my hair type. I set the temp wait for it to heat and.... EVERY TIME i run it through my hair it instantly goes down to 430 degrees and i have to turn it back up and wait. It was so annoying and frustrating. It worked well when it was at full temp but i wasted soooo much time waiting for it to reheat! Oh and it comes with a heat glove but no where does it say what to go with it? I must me new to heat gloves. Anyway, i will probably be returning this. Im so dissapointed :(</li>
    <li> Gets hot fast works great. Cools off decently fast. Straightens fast and doesn&#x27;t burn. My wife loves it. ya ya</li>
    <li> I never knew my hair could get so straight without a relaxer! The HSI flat iron turns my head of tight springy coils into light-weight, bouncy silk. It&#x27;s a well-made product that&#x27;ll most likely last for years. I love the storing pouch that comes with it, and although I do not use the heat protector glove, it&#x27;s definitely nice to have the option. I didn&#x27;t really like the argan oil sample because the heat protectant I use is so much better, but the sample was still a great gesture. With all that is included, and considering I didn&#x27;t have to shell out $100+, I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> 49 $ is too much for this flat iron I feel sorry for those who had to pay the full price. This is not a professional tool.</li>
    <li> Good and solid product. It does its job pretty well and leaves the hair smooth and soft. It&#x27;s nice that it can work outside the US with just an adapter and without the need of a converter. It was worth it to buy it at the very discounted price I found here; not sure if I would have spent the whole listing price for it.</li>
    <li> I received this...anxious to test it...plugged it in and waited for it to heat up.  Started through the hair and it pulled the hair instead of gliding smoothly.  Nothing was in the hair and it was dry.  I squeezed the plates together without any hair between them and saw that they stuck together.&lt;br /&gt;Nearly impossible to contact the seller/company.  An earlier review said she called the company and they sent a replacement no questions asked...I could not find a phone number to call.  Found an email link after extensive searching on their site (no \\&quot;Contact Us\\&quot; option). No response to first 2 emails.  The 3rd email did get a reply... \\&quot;ship it back to us and we will send you a new one...\\&quot; I am having to pay for the shipping back to the seller so will be out more money. If the replacement doesn&#x27;t work I am guessing I will have to pay again to ship the item back again.&lt;br /&gt;I will repost after I receive the replacement to provide additional objective feedback...not happy with experience so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Received replacement product. It is different from the original product I received. The replacement looks used as their are scratches on the body and an oily-sticky substance coming from the housing where the wire goes into the straightener. Not happy that I had to pay to return the faulty product that they initially sent. If I return this item then I will have paid more to ship their faulty products back to them than it cost for the product itself...ridiculous that the customer service was so bad.</li>
    <li> The straightener is really nice and I got a great deal on it.  I only have 2 complaints. 1) the straightener&#x27;s plug is polarized, so you can only plug it in one way.  I have a bathroom with one outlet so I can&#x27;t plug in more than the straightener at a time. 2) when the straightener is off, but plugged in it flashes a blue light.  I understand if the iron was hot doing this, but just off? If I ever forget to unplug it, it can be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the temperature setting is great and it heats really quickly. It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Cost a little more than I normally would spend, but this my first flat iron and it is incredible, professional quality, doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair, my hair has looked amazing since I started using this, Suggestion:  To protect hair, us a heat protectant spray first as these irons do get very hot a they are supposed to. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and gets the job done but I have very thick, course hair and it pulls my hair when I run it thru the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I personally prefer the CHI iron.</li>
    <li> It was really thin and didn&#x27;t seem to work well.  It kept catching my hair on the sides of the plates.  I would not rec this one.</li>
    <li> Not compared to a chi, it takes a lot longer then a minute to heat up &amp; took a few minutes to actually turn on, even after following the instructions. I&#x27;m glad I could return it. Save your $ and get a chi</li>
    <li> I loved the flat iron when I first got it, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well anymore. Mine takes at least 5-7 minutes to fully heat up, and it doesn&#x27;t stay heated for long. When I first got my flat iron, it did all the things it said it should do, it heated up very fast, flat ironed my hair very fast, and even left my hair very shiny, after about a month of everyday use, it stopped working as well, even though I clean it often, it still doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair very well. I would not recommend if you are looking for a flat iron that heats up very fast, and is for everyday use. I don&#x27;t know if I overused it or something, but mine doesn&#x27;t work well at all anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of the great price and the wonderful reviews it got.  My daughter has Very thick, very curly hair.  I was anxious to see how this flat iron would do on her hair.  I felt it did a very good job.  I like the bag that comes with it.  It is a quality product.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and unruly and this iron works well on it. Easy to use as well because of the swivel cord. I will recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Superior, fast straightening, automatic shut-off is great, but still blinks a blue light when off...occasionally grabs&lt;br /&gt; hair, but that may be user error. I&#x27;m always in a hurry. Would recommend for purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well, came with everything listed. Seems pretty durable. I have medium length (to my shoulders) fairly thick naturally wavy hair, and after sectioning off hair it works wonderfully, even without sectioning it still works good, just have to run it through more times. Doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hair either, Very smooth plates. Hair is straight, smooth, and shiny afterwards.</li>
    <li> When i plugged it in i felt that it was getting warm but then suddenly it just stopped working. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything but it still doesnt work.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife she loves it. She can keep away from it she&#x27;s addicted to it a very good item I recommend it to almonds to give to the wife or girlfriend</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with this flat iron. Great for short hair or if I want to make curls! I would highly recommend this buyer and this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and well packaged. Seems to be working well. Heats up really fast and numbers on side to tell the temperature is nice .When turned off it blinks blue which can be annoying, especially at night, as it needs to be unplugged.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fabulous.  Heats quickly and the best part is that it is dual voltage.  This is the flat iron that I take whenever I travel and I will actually buy another one to use at home since it works so well.  It is easy to use and easy to switch to 220v when needed.</li>
    <li> It feels like sometimes it is going to snag my hair but never does. But it does straighten okay but if you turn it up too high it will burn your hair. I would recommend a straighter with ion technology. and or titanium plates.</li>
    <li> Sraightens black hair amazingly, I wish I could curl as well, but if I hold the ends under it gives me a loose body</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great. it glides over the hair nicely and has little snagging, and it is small and convenient to pack. I am an African American female with long curly hair to my mid back and this flat iron performed wonders.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and my expectations were exceeded</li>
    <li> Great product, nice and compact..good for traveling, much better than the one I had.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. The best one I have had so far and I have had many. Great for curling too.</li>
    <li> Initially I was skeptical about purchasing such an inexpensive hair straightener for my very thick, wavy, long and unruly hair. In the past, I&#x27;ve learned that inexpensive &#x3D; cheap, and cheap just doesn&#x27;t cut it with my mane. Even in the salon, it usually takes a solid half hour or more for a professional to straighten my hair with an iron. However, after reading the reviews I decided to go for it, I mean, it was cheap and I was frizzing out. The iron itself is not cheap in any way; it&#x27;s heavy, with all the bells and whistles of my last hair iron (RIP dear Dennipep). The cord is extra long which helps with long hair, and the reset button and switches are top quality. I bought my last hair iron in Australia, and it was amazing; heated up super hot because of the voltage differences (240w- ftw!), lasted for 4 years, and took a beating while travelling. I have owned CHI&#x27;s in the past, and thought they did a great job for a while, but then generally sucked after about a year. For that money, I expect the product to last. When I use the HSI my hair becomes smooth, flat and without frizz. It isn&#x27;t as flat or smooth as when I used the Dennipep, but I can understand the HSI isn&#x27;t designed to heat up with 240w, so it is to be expected. It is exactly what I was looking for in a hair iron, and I am satisfied with the product. I only give 4 stars out of 5 because I&#x27;ve tasted the sweet, sweet heat of a 240w hair iron, and nothing North American can really compare.</li>
    <li> It works well on my hair with the right product, it will be straight in no time. Not bad at all</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome flat iron. I really enjoy it. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m drying my hair plus there&#x27;s a temp setting on it. The only down side is it does not automatically shut off after so long.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this flat iron because it wasn&#x27;t hot enough to straighten my fine hair even at the highest temp setting.</li>
    <li> I have had only two flat irons before owning this one, and they were $15 junk irons from a big box store. Whenever I went to my hairstylist and he straightened my hair, it always looked 100x better than what I did at home. He recommended a professional straightener, so I bought this one. After the first use, my hair looked like he straightened it, and it was so easy!&lt;br /&gt;I have really thin, delicate hair. This didn&#x27;t pull out my hair or fry it, or leave any press marks or crimps while I used it. I would recommend this iron to anyone!</li>
    <li> I had a flat iron that I loved for the past 4 years and it died on me.  After reading the reviews on this one, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try, since the price was so good.  I am not disappointed.  It&#x27;s a great flat iron and works really well.</li>
    <li> After realizing my $20.00 conair flat iron was the reason my hair wouldn&#x27;t grow past a certain length (dug?) I decided to buy an expensive one.  Well, it&#x27;s alright. It heats up fast, but did pull my hair, even though I used small sections to straighten.  I didn&#x27;t see anything super shiny or soft about my hair but depending on the product I use in my hair before straightening will make a difference.  Ie: argon oil, heat protector etc. (mine came with the argon oil packet) The one thing I did notice was that my hair stayed straight until I washed it. I may have had to touch up a couple of areas in the morning, but it was much better than the old conair. Overall it&#x27;s an okay flat iron.  I will keep it because having naturally wavy hair, allows me to go a few days wavy and a few days straight.  I&#x27;m not going to be straightening my hair every day.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  Just as described.  Has adjustable heating, which I love. Like the fact it comes with a full 5 fingered glove.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift. The recipient like it. Sorry, but I don&#x27;t know anything else about this brand, or product.</li>
    <li> i have very coarse, frizzy, thick, wavy hair and with one or two passes the hsi leaves my hair smooth and straight! i also love how fast it heats up!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT flatiron for the price.The plates get really HOT quickly and the iron fits comfortably in my hand. The cord swivels with the iron and doesn&#x27;t tangle up. The thermal glove is nice to have but its almost unnecessary because the handle only gets warm- not hot. Great product and great packaging!</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.  Could stand to be a little hotter, but for the price, it does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Bought it solely based on the reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Heats up fast, leaves my hair straight and shiny with about zero effort. I have recommended to several people and would buy it 10 times over.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  Heats up quickly and straightens my natural hair.  I also love the temperature control option and the bag that comes with it  Works wonders for traveling.  I would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a great working flat iron and don&#x27;t want to spend CHI prices</li>
    <li> Best iron ever!!! And ive used them all! Great value and great product!!!</li>
    <li> FABULOUS PRODUCT!  I dreaded purchasing a new iron because I was used to my old one (until I dropped it and broke it).  This product is a fantastic value.  I love the temperature setting as well.  I am so pleased with the smooth and silky results!  Also has a beautiful storage pouch, complimentary smoothing oil and a glove.  Love the pouch so it can be stored safely and I like the velcro loop for wrapping the cord.  Every detail is perfect.  I am one fussy customer who would give the product ten stars!</li>
    <li> Overall ok. I was replacing an old iron that pulled my hair. This one still does a little but much better than the other one. I love the oil that came with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flatiron to take on a trip to central Europe (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary) since it is rated up to 240V.  It worked perfectly and I am very pleased with the purchase.  The built-in circuit breaker is a big plus for peace of mind; it tripped one time and I just reset it and carried on.  The travel bag is quite handy - fits the iron plus the cord, though the breaker/plug does stick out.  I tried it on both slightly damp and dry hair.  Gave great results each time.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron! Heats instantly and leaves hair smooth as silk!</li>
    <li> Awesome straightening iron, great for curling as well! My first one lasted 2 years and then the temperature controls started acting up, but since it&#x27;s such a reasonable price and very effective on my super thick, curly/wavy hair, I bought another one. The argan oil that comes included with it is really nice as well, better than the other argan oils I have used on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from BeautyChange, and they had excellent customer service. I had an issue with the straightener and they quickly fixed it which I really appreciated.</li>
    <li> Works perfect love it!</li>
    <li> Been needing a flat iron that can curl my hair as well. I love this product as well as the price. It was a grate buy.</li>
    <li> fast shaping hair, but not main well</li>
    <li> Definitely not as good as the Chi. It gets really hot, but seems to burn my hair. I would recommend plurging and purchasing the Chi instead, but I was on a tight budget.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Heats quickly and straightens hair nicely.  The argan oil works great and recommend it for use.  Makes hair smooth and silky.  Will continue using both products.  Shipped quickly and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. Easy to use and no issues. Leaves my very thick hair straight and soft!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well and great value!</li>
    <li> I was referred to this product by a friend after she told me about the great price and that she loved it. I am very happy with this straightener. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny and takes away frizz. It heats up super fast and I love that you can change the heat setting. My old straighteners were either not hot enough or way too hot so this one has a great adjustment dial. It&#x27;s a great deal for its price - I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend near $100 or more for the renowned Chi and this is a wonderful alternative if not equal quality. Totally recommend this to all!</li>
    <li> Very good product worth every penny !</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works so much better than my previous flat iron.</li>
    <li> I struggle to get my hair straight because of how thick it is so it&#x27;s nice to find a straightener that does the trick.  Now I don&#x27;t have to put so much time and effort into falling short of my hair being straight using other straighteners.</li>
    <li> Fabulous straightener especially for the price. Super easy to do beach wave curls and love that I don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron to achieve it!</li>
    <li> On time delivery..product as expected</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, exactly what I was looking for in a salon grade flat iron!</li>
    <li> Works just like my chi and ghd that I have owned. Love it! Plus all the little bonuses were great!!</li>
    <li> This straightener is horrible, I went against my better judgment and bought it, it barely gets hot it&#x27;s a BIG waste of money!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! Hair comes out straight and silky smooth!!! I would surely recommended this flat iron to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Dose it&#x27;s job I have curly and a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. Expected it to work just as it is, but did not perform well with out Argan oil being added to my hair. After applying argan oil to each strand of hair that was to be flat ironed, it came out smoth and straight. However I had to part my hair into very small portions in order for it to work. It does get hot really fast and does last for days!</li>
    <li> Received my flat iron very quickly and it works perfectly.  It comes with a nice cover that I use for travel which is a nice bonus.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Ok I bought those on the back of reviews raving about it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these is they snag my hair when I am gliding/sliding it through my sections.  And I hate that cos it hurts.  I had GHD&#x27;s before this and swore by them but them broke, so this was my replacement.  I don&#x27;t know why they snag but I wish they didn&#x27;t.  Other than that  they are a good paid of straighteners.</li>
    <li> We have been using HSI for a while and this one was brought to be given as a gift. The package arrived on time and everything was as expected. I am happy!</li>
    <li> Fantastic straightener! Love it!</li>
    <li> After having this a few months- it was great to begin with. Now it doesnt get very hot. I assume this is a knock off product....</li>
    <li> It works well and build quality is amazing. Product was delivered on time .cheers!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! The quality is amazing. I have owned other flat irons that were much more than this, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot. Wow I was blown away by this. Thank you so much for selling such a terrific product!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: We have received a new replacement flat iron! We were contacted and told our original one was defective and that seems to be the case because the new one works great! So pleased to have everything quickly resolved and to have a great flat iron now.   Amazon products are normally famous for being great with customer service but this is a huge exception, we purchased this flat iron on May 29th and it&#x27;s currently June 2nd and the iron will not turn on. It&#x27;s been used 4 TIMES!! I specifically bought this iron because of many high reviews and while it was a good iron while it worked, it&#x27;s unbefreakingleavable that a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; product would last 4 gentle uses then the seller would refuse to exchange it for a working unit.  And yes, I went through their instructions on how to possibly fix it. There is a sticker on it that says &amp;#34;If it does not rurn on, press firmly on reset button&amp;#34;. Their spelling mistake not mine. There&#x27;s of course a chance it&#x27;ll work marvelously for years for other people but all that matters to us right now is we paid half a hundred dollars to get a straightener that does not work after 4 uses. Just disgusted.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to see this $200 flat iron on sale for $40. Once I received it and tried it, I knew why.  I have had other high priced brands -- GHD, Chi, etc. and this one is more of a $40 iron, not high end.  Issues: the heat adjustment dial is hard to get to as it is on the inside toward where the the top and bottom of iron are very close together, the dial just shows the highest and lowest temp so you need to guess what temp you are setting at in between, the iron did not seem to get very hot so is ineffective for thicker hair, the on/ready button is on the bottom of the iron which is odd.  Even at $40, I returned it as is was not worth that price.</li>
    <li> not sure if it was the light humidity in the air or the iron, but my hair never did stay straight. Before I was finished straightening, it was already going back to as if I hadn&#x27;t even straightened. I&#x27;ve had more luck in the past with other irons, so...</li>
    <li> Love it! It straightens so well.:)</li>
    <li> My best hair Iron. I feel safe using this. Love it!</li>
    <li> It heats quick and maintains the temperature very well during styling. easy to handle.</li>
    <li> It works great. I Love to be able to change the temperature and not be guessing how hot it is. It came in the mail with a glove, carry case, and a sample of oil.</li>
    <li> it works so well and tames my frizzies.  easy to use and heats quickly.  travel case is nice for packing.</li>
    <li> I have a Chi straightener that I love.  It did not work well on the transformer when I traveled. So, when I heard we were moving to Europe, I decided to look for a straightener that I could travel back and forth with.  This straightener works on both 110v and 220v making it ideal for my travels.  I simply need to use a plug converter (not a transformer) for each country I visit. It works great! Love the variable temperature.  Sometimes I need only a little straightening and sometimes a lot.  This gives me the option of giving my hair a break from the intense heat when I don&#x27;t need it. At under $40 it was a great deal compared with the 90EUR price of straighteners in Brussels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update - my original purchase is still working great! My daughter-in-law just purchased one for her visit overseas and I have purchased another one to keep at our cabin in Georgia for guests to use. The price is great for a very versatile product. I use it to straighten, my daughter-in-law uses it to de-frizz and curl her long hair.</li>
    <li> Heats up between 15-30 seconds, straightens hair fast, leaves hair looking silky and smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> It was a great price, the shipping was fast and was packaged appropriately. I plan on buying one for my sister for the holidays. Very easy to use and gets the job done great.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron!  It leaves my hair straight for days and makes it shiny.  It is easy to use, and the quality of the iron is very good.  I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> lovely product! thank you very much, I needed this.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had read such good reviews... I have had it for about 2 months and keep trying to get it to work and it just doesn&#x27;t heat up! No matter how long I leave it plugged in or at what temperature it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair... I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> so, after my herstyler flat iron, shatterd into a 8 pieces, i finally bought a new one, and i figure i could get one of same or better quality for alot less than the origianal $120 i paid for initially, and low and behold, i find this for damn near a third of the price, does the same thing, and even came with a glove and bag...so WINNING!!</li>
    <li> My grand-daughter loved it.....such speedy delivery too</li>
    <li> It is the best iron straightener my wife has ever used also the delivery was on time. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for good straightner....</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product.  Didn&#x27;t seen to work right.  Thought it would be a good value bc of the price, but not so.  Didn&#x27;t work on my hair at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good price for a great flat iron.Great follow-up via email. I would for sure buy from this shop again! Follow on review-Now it&#x27;s Christmas time and my daughter has been using my flat iron and loving it. So, I ordered a second one for her! This is a great seller and a great flat iron!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, reasonable price</li>
    <li> I bought this trying to upgrade from the cheap straightener I&#x27;ve had for years. I was really excited for it, based on the reviews here. I gave it a chance and used it quite a few times because I really wanted to love it. But the bottom line is, it&#x27;s just not that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job but it&#x27;s definitely not a &amp;#34;one-pass&amp;#34; straightener. You have to use very tiny sections of hair and go over them a few times, and even then some parts of my hair would just not straighten. My hair is pretty thin and wavy, not unmanageable, but I do have a lot of hair. Using this product would take me at least 20-30 minutes. This was on the maximum temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My $20 Wet2Straight straightener from Walmart works a lot better for me and takes 5-10 minutes max.</li>
    <li> Great product...great price!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! It actually straightens my hair. It does exactly what it is supposed to do! Nice for a change:)</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron, but not my first styling tool.  I like that you can control the temperature of the iron, and it does a great job of straightening my very curly hair.  The bonus glove and aragan oil are great too.  Easy to use, quick and I have great looking hair!</li>
    <li> So I do hair &amp; have used MANY different flat irons. This was great for the price &amp; work just as we&#x27;ll if not better then my $$$$ ones. Deff something I&#x27;d recommend to other. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have thin, fine, straight hair and this just makes it even better for silkiness and for curling the ends in or out. Couldn&#x27;t be happier and I highly suggest it.</li>
    <li> Works just as expected. And I can even curl my hair 😆</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price. Good to go now thanks to this new purchase!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT GIVES ANY BRAND-NAME FLAT IRON &amp;#34;A RUN FOR IT&#x27;S MONEY!&amp;#34; THE EXTRA ITEMS THAT ARE INCLUDED ARE #1 QUALITY AND THE ENTIRE PACKAGING IS EXCELLENT! MY HAIR IS SMOOTH AND NONDAMAGED AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Works well, had been using it for last 3 years. I purchased this for my sister.</li>
    <li> Have been using this tool for a couple of weeks now. It is a great styling tool, heats up and cools down quickly. I needed an adjustable temperature as my hair is thin and the single temperature irons were causing breakage. The only change I would suggest is that they show notches for specific temperatures on the dial as right now I&#x27;m just guessing at what the temperature is that I&#x27;m using.</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME Love it!!!! The PROFESSIONAL iron arrived on time in a nice box included; glove, argan oil and a very sexy travel bag. The only problem for me was the sleep timer. While I was in the middle of straighten my hair the iron shut off  I didn&#x27;t realize this til my hair wasn&#x27;t straight anymore because it was off.I just turned it back on it heats up quickly...  well worth the $price. Hope this help</li>
    <li> So far so good. Not as hot as others I have owned but that&#x27;s probably a good thing for my hair. Unfortunately, I dropped (and broke) the bottle of oil before I was able to use it so I don&#x27;t have a review for that.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price. Not the best I have ever used, but I do like it. I would purchase this item again. :)</li>
    <li> Product works well, however the item looks as if it&#x27;s been used. Came when expected. Not fast, but didn&#x27;t take forever either. My sister LOVES it and tries to steal it from me, every opportunity she gets, lol.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!  Very comparable to a Chi and way cheaper.  I love that my hair feels straight afterword rather than feathery or frizzy like other straighteners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Seriously what are all of these people talking about? I am guessing they may have never had a really awesome flat iron. I purchased this item when my Chi fell in the toilet based on the great reviews and since I was trying to save money. This is a fine flat iron, but definitely not a great one (like the Chi). Net-net, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It is not all that great. Love the argan oil, but it takes forever to straighten my hair. I dont know if it is just not hot enough or what. Now I think of straightening my hair as an annoying, time consuming process. I miss my revlon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many different flat irons through out the years, but this one is the best, by far.  It heats up really quickly and gets my hair nice and straight.  Having a quality flat iron makes straightening hair so much easier.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve only been using this flat iron for a few days, so I can&#x27;t really vouche for how durable this product is or its longevity, but I can say that it makes my hair beautiful.  I really like that you can adjust the temperature setting.</li>
    <li> Everything came just as expected. The flat irons were a gift for my mom and she was impressed. I would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Heats up quickly and leaves hair very smooth with one pass. No snagging or pulling at all. This is a wonderful piece at a great price. Fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> I bought the expensive Sutra from the kiosk at the mall because I was impressed with how much better of a job it did than my Chi. I have crazy thick, frizzy hair. Then I enrolled in cosmetology school and needed a flat iron for floor use. I bought the HSI due to its low price and excellent reviews. I swear it&#x27;s identical to my Sutra. I&#x27;m a little ill that I spent so much on the Sutra.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used much, but the few times I have I really like it. It makes my hair nice and shiny. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It really is a great product. Straightens my curly hair with ease.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron to work really good on my bi-racial child&#x27;s hair and we have tried a few but based on previous reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Would highly recommend. Loved the extra&#x27;s it came with. Shipping was fast too. Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> --&amp;#62; I ordered this for my wife and she&#x27;s been using this for awhile .. I just asked her for feedback and she said it&#x27;s a great flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. It functions as well as my Chi straightener that I had for years but at a third of the price. Love, love, love it!!</li>
    <li> My hair is curly, thick, and extremely long!  The fact that this hair straightener made my hair look epic is all I can ask for!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic!!  My girlfriend had a problem with her hair making it impossible to wear curlers for a while.With the flat iron, her hair is far more beautiful and natural and the compliments unending.  Suggest you get the HSI liquid hair treatment at the same time</li>
    <li> The iron itself works great and leaves my hair straight and shiny in just a couple pass overs. I give it 4 stars though because I don&#x27;t like the cord or the little bag it came in. The cord is a bit thick. So even though it has a swivel, it gets twisted and knotted easily anyway. And I was happy that this came with a bag at first because I could use it for travel, but it is so small that the cord won&#x27;t fit in it, just the iron. The cord is that I want wrapped up most!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have 4b hair and I only have to pass over my hair one time. Glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It&#x27;s small, light weight, and a great price. It glides down my hair smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take long to straighten my hair. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron and my daughters love it too, as a matter of fact they love itso much i have to ask to borrow it when i need to use it so I&#x27;m considering getting one each for my 3 girls as an X mas gift. We have thick hair and this bad boy gets the job done in no time nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Lovely flat iron, it is exceptional an I am very picky  when I comes to my hair as  I have delicate and moody bi-racial hair. I was a lovely product shipped promptly from the company. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love our new straightener, the way it works, very good quality, gets hot fast and doesn&#x27;t take long to work.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a higher quality flat iron for our teenage daughter, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the kind of money you usually spend on high quality. So we were thrilled to find this flat iron at such a great price. So far, it has not disappointed!! Love the variable heat setting and the fact it doesn&#x27;t fry my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for something that felt like butter on my hair.  This one had reviews like it was the best one out there and really great, but I feel like it works just the same as the $15 one I got from wal-mart years ago.  It grabs my hair occasionally and doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off like my old one either. It still works, I was just hoping for something better so that I wouldn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t like it as much as the Chi she had before. She said it is heavier and doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
    <li> Love it finally a hair straightner with great fast results&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks great like I just went to the salon&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a great shine&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel oversears.  It works great and comes with a travel pouch.  One less thing to use an adapter for.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money, I&#x27;m very pleased with performance of this flat iron. With this product my hair stays straight, with my flat iron I purchased over the counter it didn&#x27;t perform as well. I would highly recommend this flat iron! Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a gift but my daughter (18) says that the product is great and uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> Works really well with just one pass on my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my 5 year old Chi straightener and after one use, it&#x27;s going back. It heated up very quickly, but pulled at my hair the entire time I used it. I used it on three or four sections with the same bad result every time. I&#x27;m going back to my Chi.</li>
    <li> Works Great. Love it !</li>
    <li> This flat iron does the job! I have short, course and curly hair and I can straighten it ou with this iron. It heats up quickly and gets very hot although I choose not to turn it the hottest setting.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough. It&#x27;s a cheap price for a reason! Spend a little more money and get a better product!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I have owned a chi, and think this one is better! It was a great buy and I am completely happy with it</li>
    <li> This Flat iron is amazing. One swipe is all you need. I will never use my Chi again. Silky soft straight hair with one swipe.</li>
    <li> quick shipping and a product I am totally satisfied with.  Had borrowed a friends Chi and this works for me as well if not better than the Chi.  My hair is very fine and  I am very satisfied with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Fast, prompt delivery....flat iron was exactly as described</li>
    <li> Really nice flat iron. It came quickly and with no problems</li>
    <li> The flat iron arrived very quickly in perfect condition. It works better than my Sedu iron which was much more expensive. I like that it is a bit smaller too as it is easier to pack for travel - while it does even a better job than my larger iron did. The travel sleeve it comes with is very nice. The only negative is that the controls are inside which makes it a bit awkward to maneuver. The &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; sized oil was one little packet- was nice to include but was expecting a small bottle. All in all I recommend the HSI flat iron and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because it was the &amp;#34;#1 best seller on Amazon.&amp;#34; I live in Mississippi and it&#x27;s humid here from March to November so I have to have a straightener. I&#x27;ve used the CHI brand before and love it, but this straightener works just as well. The CHIs do have cuter colors and designs on the barrel but those are the only things that it has that this one doesn&#x27;t. This straightener doesn&#x27;t pull or break your hair, you don&#x27;t have to go over it several times to get it to work, and it costs less than half of what the more expensive brands do.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter, and she likes it. Can&#x27;t really offer any more comments as I&#x27;m not the one using it.</li>
    <li> The gift was received well!</li>
    <li> Gave to daughter, she loves it. Makes her hair shine.</li>
    <li> Used Chi irons for years and they would always die on me.  This one is a fraction of the price and works just as well if not better.  I have enough hair for 5 people, thick and coarse, and this flat iron gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener, I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and a half and it works better than my old one. Great product for the price! Also, I LOVE that it comes with a bag and the cord is very long! I&#x27;m always ripping my straighteners out of the wall when I do my hair.</li>
    <li> The ceramic on this iron has already broke for normal daily use. I have never moved it from my vanity. I have had it less than 2 months- very irritated!</li>
    <li> If you have natural afro hair...then this will look like any other flat iron product you have used.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;If you have chemical processed hair or a different texture besides afro,&lt;br /&gt;then your hair may be silky straight.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how great this is.  I&#x27;ve used Chi for years and was convinced that if I tried to buy a less expensive product I&#x27;d be disappointed.  But a friend recommended this, and I am amazed--for half the price this things is just as good if not better than my Chi!  In fact, I like the feel of it better--the part you hold in your hand when you use it has texture--grooves--so it&#x27;s easier to handle without slipping.  Hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in it, you don&#x27;t feel like you have to &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; to get a good effect...I LOVE THIS.</li>
    <li> At first the straightener worked fine, but after about a week it slides and you have to hold it tight in order for your hair not to escape. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Very nice straightener...just started using one for the first time in my life and nothing can be better than this ...</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for christmas presents this year and no longer need them because both daughters went with short hair and now am unable to return them because of the return policy.  They seem like they would work very nicely !</li>
    <li> It is a great flat iron for a great price. It works quickly and effectively, yet seems gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Straightens my hair perfectly! Buy this product because you wont regret. Works just as great as a chi (:</li>
    <li> Excellent iron would recommend it to anyone. The pouch works nicely to protect things while the iron is hot.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I have not heard any bad things about it from the person i gave it too.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted and more. Was here on time. Best flat iron I have ever had .</li>
    <li> This is every bit as good as my CHI, but half the price</li>
    <li> 1 year later, still works great, wife has no complaints, and I didn&#x27;t pay for a fancy one. Thanks for a dependable product, that keeps getting the job done, and makes me look like a smart guy buying hair styling products!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron it make my hair feel silkly smooth and it looks heathier</li>
    <li> This product really works! I have thick hair and hard to manage, but I got very good results.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get really hot, but I am naturally so that&#x27;s a good thing. I wear protective styles, so I think it still works really good.</li>
    <li> Me &#x3D; white girl with a fro. Seriously though, my hair is super thick and I have a LOT of it. I will never have to worry about balding. When I get my hair done, other clients always say, \\&quot;Will you give me some?\\&quot; I would gladly but I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m stuck with it. I have spent days looking for straighteners. I have compared and researched on many different web sites. I am an Amazon fanatic so I figured I would try the HSI straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am THRILLED with the straightener. My hair looks good and I get compliments. It is also amazing at curling. It&#x27;s super easy to make curls. I haven&#x27;t had to re straighten my hair in a week. My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily so I&#x27;m lucky in that sense. The curls have stayed for at least 3 days. I haven&#x27;t counted. I always use an oil sheen/heat protector before I began straightening to make my hair even straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also heats up in under a minute. The price is definitely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener comes highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener has given me major split ends. I tried everything... changing the heat settings, running it slower/faster through my hair, using different shampoo, heat-protection spray, argan oil... nothing works. I&#x27;m returning this product. Maybe it works on some hair types, but it&#x27;s definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half black and half white, with hair typical of that mix. If I turn this iron all the way up and straighten small sections at a time, it&#x27;ll get the job done nicely. It&#x27;s not bad. BUT, if your hair is like mine, you can do much better than this. I had a &amp;#34;one n only&amp;#34; flat iron that gave me two wonderful years before the plates started to burn out, and thought this &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; iron would be an inexpensive upgrade. I&#x27;m going to hold onto this for now, but next time I have $60 to spare, I&#x27;m getting a clone of my previous iron and giving this one to a Caucasian friend who can get more use out of it. Btw, IF YOU&#x27;RE FULLY BLACK, DO NOT GET THIS. You need an iron that goes up to 450 degrees. Doing my [black] sister&#x27;s hair with this flat iron is no different from running a comb through it, except the comb actually serves a purpose. POSITIVES: The packaging is super nice, includes a silk sleeve to keep the iron in; works well for touching up hair that is already straight-ish but needs some extra polishing.</li>
    <li> My hair is super thin and I tried 2 different flat iron before and never worked out really well. The problem was the temperature that was either too high ir too low. What I loved about this one is the temperature control, that way I could find a perfect temperature for my hair not to be frizzy and with that fake apearence. I would recommend this product, I loved it.</li>
    <li> Does just what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> She said that this flat iron works better than any other she&#x27;s ever had, including one that cost 3X as much.  It was a such a great deal that we ordered one for my nieces to share as well and they love it.</li>
    <li> I recently got a really bad haircut....amazing how you can tell someone no layers and you come out with layers in the back -- right where your worst cowlicks are!  This is my first hot iron and I&#x27;m using it to try to flatten the gaps in the back caused by the cowlicks.  It has saved me a lot of frustration!  Fortunately, my hair grows extremely fast so I&#x27;m not sure how long I will use it, but so far, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this straightener.  It heats quickly and doesn&#x27;t catch or pull your hair like many others. It does get very hot on the highest setting so keep the included glove near to avoid burns.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener! Sleek looking, and feeling, easy to hold and use, gets very hot.. Works great!!!!! Plus the pouch and glove are very nice extras!! 😀</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; price! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase! It&#x27;s a must buy for sure and way better than any Chi I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Product is okay considering the price. The glove provided is not much helpful. Heats well.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;As you can see I purchased another one  too.&lt;br /&gt;One for my daughter and one for my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;They both love them.&lt;br /&gt;I would  recommend this product  to anyone.</li>
    <li> I will admit, the first day I used it, it worked awesome.  Next day it would only get luke warm.  Bummer, I was really looking forward to this straightener since it was on sale</li>
    <li> I have natural A.A. Hair.  Sometimes I want it stright, but not bone straight, kind of like a Yaki look. My other flat iron, never really gave me that smooth look I was looking for and took way longer.  Just to have itback to frizz in about and hour or two.  his flat iron for the price did what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> This straightener worked great at first but the results diminished after about a month of daily use. I have thick, long, wavy, somewhat dry hair. This may work better for different hair types. After about six months it stopped working altogether. After several tries w the reset button over about a week it started working again but isn&#x27;t very impressive.</li>
    <li> Do not notice any difference between this product and my  cheapie from local discount store.</li>
    <li> Lived up to all my expectations per the reviews I had read!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my granddaughter. She loves loves loves this and how smooth.and shiny it makes her hair The word &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; in the name is very accurate..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product could get such high reviews :\&lt;br /&gt;The product itself seemed of very high quality. I liked how it came with a protective glove and a sample hair oil&lt;br /&gt;but the ceramic tourmaline ionic iron was ripping my hair! It didn&#x27;t feel smooth at all, and one bunch of hair took 4 times for it finally straighten and even that wasn&#x27;t completely satisfying :\&lt;br /&gt;I gave this away for my white elephant gift.</li>
    <li> I use this flat iron a lot and love it! Super easy to keep clean and heats up quickly. I love that it came with a travel case!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. My old one had the controls on the outside top and I was always hitting the on/off button when using it. How annoying! This one has the controls on the inside and that&#x27;s working great. It gets my hair straight the first time I go over it with the flat iron, and my hair is very shiny after I&#x27;m done. If they could make one improvement it would be to have an auto turn off but I still give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My main problem was that as I was using it, I could hear it breaking my hair.  It snagged and broke so much of my hair that now I have little hairs sticking out all over the place.  It was not like this before I used this flat iron.  Right on the package insert, it said it would not snag/break my hair!  I got this one to replace my Rusk straightener (it&#x27;s just old) and I am so thankful that I didn&#x27;t throw my trusty Rusk away.  I am back to using it now and am happy again.  The HSI straightener was cheap on Amazon and I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> works as expected great price for quality product would recommend to a friend for sure free conditioner was a nice touch</li>
    <li> The price is good and easy to use, I like it.just it took a little longer for me to get it, maybe that is because I live in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to learn how to use this iron effectively, but now that I have gotten better at the different techniques, I am finding that I love it. If you aren&#x27;t a professional, but are willing to dink around with it, I think you will love it to. It makes my hair shiny and smooth. It produces flat, even locks, or wavy, bohemian curls. It flips hair in, or out. It does all this in record fast time. Oh, and it takes 35 seconds to heat up.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!!! The best part is the guarantee of satisfaction from their customers &amp; their honest desire to make them happy.</li>
    <li> In less than four months of use it is broken. The power supply (the little box that plugs into the wall outlet) made a loud pop sound (while in use) and produced a horrible smell and the plastic and has cracked around the seam of the power supply. I have owned countless products with a similar style power supply, and I have NEVER had one self destruct like this. This is a safety and fire hazard.  Oh, and BTW, do you wonder why are the reviews so good on this item? Let me tell you. Blue Novelties, the seller, sends out emails asking for reviews, it has a link to this product next to &amp;#34;leave a 5 star review&amp;#34; ...but if you want to leave a negative review they link to another Amazon listing of the same product, search for it, you will see the hundreds of 1 star reviews.  I have contacted them through Amazon and directly as a response to their email and have not received a response.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;UPDATE&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; I am leaving my product rating at 1 start, but the seller, Blue Novelties, stood behind the product and for that I will give them a good seller review. It was not a fast response or replacement, but they did replace it - and they upgraded it for free to the elite version, which seems to be a much higher quality. I would still advise you to avoid this model based on my experience, but the higher-end HSI stuff is better and Blue Novelties made things right in the end.</li>
    <li> It was a gift my daughter requested. I purchased it for her for her birthday which happens to be on Christmas!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how well this flat iron works. I bought it because I got it for a really great price, kept it for month without trying it. When my old flat iron went out on me, I decided to give this one a try. It works very well and does a wonderful job straightening my hair. Very satisfied and would recommend thid product.</li>
    <li> The sellar was great to deal with, it shipped and arrived quickly too. However, considering all the great reviews the flat iron got, I expected a lot more.  It catches and breaks my hair and doesn&#x27;t heat as quickly as advertised.  I would never buy this flat iron again.</li>
    <li> Really great flat iron especially for the price!  This is my 2nd one!  Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this product. I use it on her hair since she is mixed and has very curly dry hair due to her dad and it works great! I use it daily unless she wants her hair left natural.</li>
    <li> Awesome product...I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  I have a 2 and a half inch jilbere iron that has always been so so...&lt;br /&gt;This one is no comparison and leave the other in the dark ages.  I have hair like a horse tail so I have to set it on high (430 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;and there is never any smoke or odd smell.  Works awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> Product as described. I needed this straightener to use it on my vacation to Dubai and Thailand, and it worked great. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I actually use this flat iron to curl my hair and it holds my hair better than a curling iron. It also comes with argan oil which smells super great and helps hold my curls even longer!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, heats up fast, broad range of temps, doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair.  I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and wanted a product that decreased the look of frizz and split ends, this does the trick.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!!</li>
    <li> It has been used only a few times, but it responds quickly. It does the job in a comfortable way.</li>
    <li> My FHI fell to its unfortunate death on the tile floor in my bathroom.  I loved that thing and I was planning on getting another one, but searching on Amazon, I discovered this flat iron.  I&#x27;m pleased to say that this flat iron works just as well as my FHI (and CHI before that).  Another plus is the low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have 4a/b relaxed hair and this thing gets my hair bone-straight</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! After all the good reviews I saw on this, I had to get it. Plus, I had been looking for a new one for a long time, and this looked like the best one for me, and I&#x27;m so glad I got it. If you&#x27;re looking for a flat iron, I highly suggest giving this one a chance. Don&#x27;t let those few bad reviews stop you! It shipped fast, and was in perfect condition when it got here, it came with a glove for protection and a free sample of their argon oil (by the way, I highly recommend buying a bottle, it works wonders) and all those manuals and such. I used to straighten my hair everyday, so I&#x27;ve had quite a few straighteners in the past, and this by far is my favorite. Overall, I am very, very pleased with it, and would defiantly recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner to use in Europe so that I would not have to use a converter since straightners overheat them and burn out. I only had to use an adapter with this to fit in the plug in Europe. I used it in the U.S. on high heat and in Europe on medium heat and it worked wonderfully on my hair. I have naturally frizzy, wavy hair. I was very pleased with the results. Used in Holland, France, Switzerland, and Italy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice flat iron. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the the switch is inside near the plates.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I always feel it is pulling my hair - it doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly compared to my old flat iron - a Kiyoseki I bought many years ago.</li>
    <li> I like it!  I found it easy to use, light, the cord swivels, and my curly hair transform into straight hair.</li>
    <li> No it was not as described its good for people with fine hair maybe but not for what I have</li>
    <li> It works very well and without that smell that my last flat iron had.  The oil keeps my hair free of frizzies so I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I loved it until it stopped working after just over a year.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would love it more than my Chi, but this iron is fantastic. It straightens but still leaves body.</li>
    <li> The sleek design will pack nicely in my trip to the UK. I chose this iron because I needed to be able to use it both in the states and in the UK. It does it all!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, lightweight, heats up quickly; but watch videos online and practice to get the best results. A little pricey, but good quality.</li>
    <li> This has no auto-shutoff and no light to even indicate it&#x27;s on.  The product works but this is dangerous for the average consumer.  There is also no temp indicator or latch to keep it closed, but this is secondary to the safety issue.  DON&#x27;T buy this unless you are comfortable with a product that can reach over 400 degrees and has no &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; indicator.  Seller told me that this is for hair dressers who might want a product that will never turn off, but most people who use this at home would want something that shuts off if you forget.  Especially since there is nothing to indicate it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> I got this b/c I wanted something that would work in Europe. It worked great! Despite what the ad says of only going up to 230v, it does go up to 240v (and even says so on the actual straighter) which is what you need for Europe. All I needed was a plug adapter, and it straightened my hair wonderfully!</li>
    <li> im so beyond happy with this flat iron. my hair stays straight for hours. i definitely recommend this to women who straightens their hair on a daily basis</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Just like any other iron. Takes too long to get heated</li>
    <li> Love this straighter makes my hair soft and heats up in seconds no waiting. Also does not pull my hair like other straighteners i have used in the past.</li>
    <li> To begin let me explain my awful experience finding a decent straightener that makes this one so great. First, I purchased the instyler, expecting by the price and things I have heard about it that it would be amazing. It was not. It took ages and wouldn&#x27;t get close to my head. It was mediocre, especially for over a hundred bucks. I returned that, and went to my local walmart to get a chi! I always hear chis are AMAZING. Nope. My hair is evil. It is the definition of thick, frizzy, wavy, curly hair. I am lucky when I can brush it. I&#x27;m like a chia pet or something. The chi stood no chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there is this beautiful piece of equipment. It came to my door today at the perfect time, my hair was at it&#x27;s worse. I took a shower last night, didn&#x27;t blow dry, tie up, or even attempt to style it. So this morning I had nothing short of a blonde afro. I went to work throwing a head band on it, making creases and even worse curls by the time I got home. Doing nothing else, I took the HSI and straightened my hair.&lt;br /&gt;IT ACTUALLY WORKED!&lt;br /&gt;There was no pain or pulling, no awful smell or smoke, just smooth hair. My hair at the moment is shiny, silky, and straight as it&#x27;s ever been. Plus, it came with a gorgeous little pouch and heat resistant glove to help style that are so helpful! Also, I hate the heat, and if it is warm out I usually won&#x27;t straighten my hair because being so hot for THAT long just makes me sweat and my hair more frizzy. No problem here because when I timed how long it took, it was only EIGHT minutes! Other straighteners in the past usually took me thirty. I was shocked. It truly only takes a single pass. I recommend this to anyone it surpasses straightening tools much more experience. A true bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-easy red to green indication for when it is fully heated&lt;br /&gt;-helpful styling glove&lt;br /&gt;-carrying pouch&lt;br /&gt;-makes hair shiny and soft to the touch&lt;br /&gt;-calms even the craziest frizz&lt;br /&gt;-super fast heat up&lt;br /&gt;-cuts the time you have to straighten to a third of the time&lt;br /&gt;-long, swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;-reaches the roots with ease&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing, it really is the best I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Now like I said, I got this today, hopefully it holds up for a while and I don&#x27;t have to change my mind. If something happens, I will definitely update it)/&gt;-cuts the time you have to straighten to a third of the time&lt;br /&gt;-long, swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;-reaches the roots with ease&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing, it really is the best I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Now like I said, I got this today, hopefully it holds up for a while and I don&#x27;t have to change my mind. If something happens, I will definitely update it)</li>
    <li> Wonderful tool! I have thick, wavy hair that usually takes three passes, and this flat iron does it in one. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I hoped it would. The frizz comes back sooner then the other brand of straightener I use.</li>
    <li> Great item, love it and would buy this item again and again.Have to get it if you need it. Luv it</li>
    <li> Very good!! My hair is silly and bone straight!</li>
    <li> So I read the reviews and decided to purchase this flat iron as my old one was starting to get a bit worn.  It came super fast which was awesome!  It looks very impressive and I love the digital display!  But when it comes down to the actual straightening, it did pretty horribly.  Maybe it&#x27;s my particular hair type or something but I had to go over each section numerous times for it to actually straighten.  It also didn&#x27;t seem to stay straight very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my l&#x27;auberge tourmaline one.  That one may not be quite as fancy but it sure does work!</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron. ☺ My daughter was &amp;#34;hinting&amp;#34; that it was nice too. Might have to get her one too!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery, the flat iron was packed well, and exactly as described.  I really like the iron and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Flat iron met product description and works perfectly. I have pretty thin hair so I love that the temp on this iron can be adjusted really low.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenage daughter who has very thick long wavy hair&lt;br /&gt;and it works great. just a great find.</li>
    <li> Nice hair straighter, love it, and for the price is really worth it.</li>
    <li> Wish it had auto shut off. Heats up super fast easy to use. The on off switch is hard to see</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. I&#x27;ve used 3 others, including a $145 ISA. Compared to the others this is much more effective. I have very thick and coarse hair. If I do nothing I look like I&#x27;m straight out of an 80&#x27;s hair band. It&#x27;s not cute. Like Julia Roberts but her finger in a light socket kinda bad. So flat ironing is a must for me. This one makes my hair look so healthy, shiny, straight, but still full of body and bounce. I don&#x27;t even have to use heat-protection oil every time. I get a small section of hair (because my hair is thick) and start at the scalp. I then gently slide it down to the end of my hair. I do this 2 or 3 times each section just to ensure no frizzies. It takes me about 20 minutes to finish my entire head and then I finish it off with a large curling iron to add extra bounce since my hair is layered. Other flat irons I have used have left my hair frizzy and fried looking. Sometimes the other ones just slid over my hair, not gripping it, and it heats it into a weird kinky mess. Never with my HSI. I will never get a different brand. On a side note - the buttons are inside the handle to keep them out of the way.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t take long to straighten hair with it&#x27;s good heat settings and seems very durable. Easy to work with and a good price for the quality. HIGHLY encouraged buy.</li>
    <li> This straightener is perfect... It works very well and don&#x27;t damage my hair... The glove come together the straightener is wonderful idea for protect my hand when I am using the straightener. I am just in love for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its pretty sturdy, nice design, variable temperature and its nice to hold. I like it better than my chi that it replaced. Hope it lasts as long as the chi too.</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt at using a flat iron for my curly hair. It was a long process since I first had to blow-dry my hair and then use the iron on small sections of hair, but in the end it came out nicely. Definitely not as nice as when it&#x27;s done professionally though. All in all, it&#x27;s good to have in the arsenal but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it too much since it took me more than an hour. Hopefully with practice I can do it more quickly.</li>
    <li> i have very thick hair, thought it wouldn&#x27;t straighten good, but is excellent. would recommend this product to anyone. thank you!</li>
    <li> I need this for long time ago, the HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER helps a lot</li>
    <li> Great iron and packaging was awesome also..</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and seems gentle on the hair.  I like the fact that you can adjust the temperature and you can use it to curl the hair as well.  I agree with other positive reviews.  Seems to be as good as a more expensive iron.  My hair stylist says that a 1 inch flat iron is all you ever need no matter how long, short, thin or thick your hair is. I was going to buy a Sultra but after searching online for the best rated flat irons and with so many reviews here on Amazon, I felt that I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;m glad I found this one for much less $.</li>
    <li> Love this - heats up super fast, doesn&#x27;t fry my hair because you can adjust the temperature setting yourself. 100% worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to use in Europe.  I love that it automatically switches internally to the correct voltage.  My hair is very thick and frizzy and this flat iron did a decent job of smoothing it out.  It is fairly compact and light weight.  It&#x27;s going overseas on many trips with me.  So convenient.</li>
    <li> I give it a one star. I previously had an ECO flat iron which made my hair look pretty nice.  Then wear and tear and purchased this one.  Tried it out, doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair decent, just dry and gets caught on the blades.  Here&#x27;s hoping for a refund.  Sorry but it wasn&#x27;t worth the $50.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the straightener and especially pleased with the small vial of oil that was&lt;br /&gt;sent along with it  Miracle oil, if you ask me.  I hope to purchase the oil individually once I&lt;br /&gt;have income.  Prompt shipment, too.  Good all round.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe.  It was a good as my CHI if not better!  I am very pleased with it and it was half the price of a CHI!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Heat&#x27;s up super quickly and straightens my thick/coarse hair like a dream. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this item. So glad I chose this brand over more expensive CHI products.</li>
    <li> I love the HSI Professional 1 ceramic flat iron.  It heats up quickly and has a variable temperature dial which is great!  My old flat iron was an on/off cheap model.  This product is well worth the price.  And it was received quickly.  Would definitely recommend this product and seller to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Great price for a high quality flat iron. My major concern was the international voltage. Worked perfectly with a plug adapter in Australia!  It will next be going to Tanzania, France, and Iceland!</li>
    <li> my cheap conair straightener from target works better</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her straightener! We have only had the product for a short time but it seems to perform well.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever owned!!  I will warn that the highest temp is extremely hot and was not appropriate for my hair.  Most hair appliances I have to have the highest heat due to the thickness of my hair, but this works so awesome I only need low-med heat.  it does wonders for my curly thick hair!</li>
    <li> Great! Just don&#x27;t use it on maximum heat if you have thin hair, despite the tourmaline-ionic-ceramic technology, or maybe I just needed argan oil or jojoba oil or any protective coating on my hair. Works great in 110 v or 220 v, my in-laws each want one now (they have thick, crazy hair. If I were them, I would try to embrace the curls but they want to use this iron after every shower-- they&#x27;ve been using mine and haven&#x27;t noticed any damage to their hair from frequent usage, which is great). I prefer not to use the glove, but it&#x27;s a good addition. The satin-red storage sack is nice.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> It works well, but the Royale Classic has a better floating pad that makes better curls.  Other than that I am very happy with the product and the shipper.</li>
    <li> This is the best flatiron I have used. I have tried different brands over the last 2 years and by far this one is the best. Doesnt burn my hair. Only need one pass and my hair is soft and shiny like silk. Wish i would&#x27;ve found this sooner. I will never use any other flatiron but this one. Going to order another one so when i travel i have an extra one. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product, and I REALLY appreciate the heat glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Digital display with LED colors -- informative and easy to read&lt;br /&gt;- Plates glide through hair easily&lt;br /&gt;- Plates are good width for curling ends of your hair slightly&lt;br /&gt;- Heat glove included&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable temperature&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up VERY quickly&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;Sleep&amp;#34; timer turns iron off after specified time&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with travel bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  None so far!</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the dual voltage for European outlets. Worked perfectly in Paris! Was compact enough to travel with, yet with all the power and skills of a high class straightener!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple weeks now and have somewhat coarse wavy hair. This flat iron does an exceptional job for a fraction of the cost of others. I would definitely recommend for almost anybody!</li>
    <li> Price is right. Worked great.</li>
    <li> Delighted with product and great price.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a while ...now it doesn&#x27;t heat up like it used and so it doesn&#x27;t straighten as well.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice flat iron with temp settings and an on off switch. Helps with frizzy hair.  Quick shipping. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to review “Two Soldiers” by Anders Roslund &amp; Borge Hellstrom. “Two Soldiers” is a book about two fatherless teenage boys living the street life and are on the rise to becoming the kingpins of a Swedish suburb called Raby. They began as childhood friends and slowly began their rise to power by forming their own union of crime. Their syndicate was the Raby Warriors. The other side was Officer José Pereira who has been in Law enforcement for twenty years and is head the Organized Crime and Gang Section in Raby. Both these groups were from opposite sides of the spectrum but there collision course is inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Raby Warriors stage a prison escape which includes a murder, deceit, violence and taking a warden hostage.  DCI Ewert Grens and Jose Pereira have Leon and Gabriel right in their sights. There is a showdown and of course one side has to win. My favorite mentions about this book were the suspense element and the bits of action and violence that were littered throughout the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, it was a lengthy read but did enough to keep my interest. The writing was choppy at times and dragged on a bit but overall it was a descent read. I recommend my readers to check out “Two Soldiers” if suspense and moderate violence is your interest.  Overall: 4-5 Stars.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was dead set on getting a Chi, which was priced at over $100 dollars, but after reading reviews on all the straighteners and hearing about Chis breaking, we got this one.  She says it is better than the Chi.  Makes her hair look beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flatiron. So glad I decided to purchase it! It&#x27;s perfect, heats quickly, great size and works well for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I read so many feedback and research before I bought this items. because I bought some straighter before . unfortunately, they are gone to trash. this is definitely a must-have.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair that is slightly wavy. This straightener helps my hair lay like I want it to. it heats up so fast and I have not noticed any strange smell like other reviews have said. I&#x27;ve always uses cheap straighteners, but wish I would&#x27;ve bought this sooner. I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> The plug did not fit. I did not end up using it in China. I have to change the plug later.</li>
    <li> This did work well, until yesterday!  I was straightening my hair and all of a sudden it popped, the lights went out in the bathroom and the straightener started sparking!  I only ever heated it to 350 degrees max-but the popping noise and sparks really scared me and now obviously the product doesn&#x27;t work.  I purchased this in March, based on other reviews and because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on an expensive straightener - I will be contacting the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Premium product! Great, on-time delivery!!!</li>
    <li> The best Profesdional ceramic flat iron I have ever used . I have kinky natural hair and wanted a flat iron that would straighten my hair. This is it!!!! It comes with a small bottle of argon oil. This iron is so awesome it only takes 15 minuets to  have silky bouncy hair. A must have.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything could have an effect on my super-curly hair, but this does. It&#x27;s the right width and temperature to do the job without splitting ends.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I never write a review, NEVER, good nor bad. But I have to say that I am in love with this iron. It did live up to my expectations. I m not lying if I say that I was very skeptical at first. I have always used ghd and I was happy with it until it broke recently. I did some research on Amazin and I found this iron with all these awesome ratings and reviews. I gave it a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did. 5stars for the product 5 more stars for their customer service as they were very responsive. I am very happy customer!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair feels really nice after I use the straightner.  The little bottle of oil was just what I needed to help the condition of my hair.  I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet because I don&#x27;t need too.</li>
    <li> This cheap flat iron did not work on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t tame your frizz like my other flat iron (Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ion Flat Iron 1¼ purchased thru Folica close to 4 years ago - best iron ever will probably purchase another one soon) ) it fries your hair. I decided to get this because I read some of the reviews and thought if everyone is raving about it then it must be good, NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!! People be honest so that your reviews can help others. My Solia flat iron is dying well I did use constantly for 4 yrs. and some and I just wanted to try something new in the market, it was a mistake so after some reviews  I had to waited and decided to take a great deal through QVC and purchase a CHI, however, I will invest on another Solia soon.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this iron.</li>
    <li> Replaced an outdated one. So happy with this.</li>
    <li> Love This straightener. A great value!!!</li>
    <li> I have always thought that all hair straightners were the same until i decided to spend a little more for one and see for myself if there was a difference.  I can tell you that I immediately noticed a difference in my hair.  It was so smooth, shinny and just had a general overal appearance of health that was so much better than using a cheap straightner.  I am really glad that i purchased this one as it can do so many things with your hair other than just straighten it.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it.  Performs as stated.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product to really work with my type of hair- thin very curly, frizzy, and unruly hair. I found this and is very happy with it. I have been using it daily with HSI Argan Oil and it just amazing how my hair looks healthy, sleek, and straight! Also the price is really affordable.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, and love that there&#x27;s a temp gage to adjust to where my hair needs it to be. Speedy delivery. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Good and elegant product. Straightens nicely and is easy to handle and operate.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for a great price.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair very well at all. After an hr it was wavy. I have thick hair and live in La and my Paul Mitchell straightener always kept my hair straight throughout the day. Oh well I should have known to stick with what has always worked!</li>
    <li> This straightener was similar to the cheap ones you can find in WalMart or Fred Meyer&#x27;s. It pulled my hair and didn&#x27;t close tightly so I had to keep running it over the strands again and again. It also doesn&#x27;t have a temp gauge so you know where high and low are but everything in between is guesswork.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I just had to with this straightening iron! I&#x27;ve tried just about every straightening iron out there- Sedu, CHI, etc., and this one is by far my favorite. Don&#x27;t let the inexpensive price fool you, this thing is great! I have very long and wavy hair, and this iron straightens my hair in a half hour or less. With other irons, it can take well over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently took a trip to Europe, and was told by multiple people not to bother bringing a straightening iron, whether it&#x27;s dual voltage or not, because it would fry. I disregarded their advice and brought my HSI anyways. If anything, I would have just bought a new HSI once I returned home. Turns out, everyone was wrong! This straightener held up perfectly for almost a month abroad. I never had a problem with it overheating or anything of the sort. Now I am back home, still happily using it with no problems whatsoever. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly recommend this straightener to anyone looking for something inexpensive that actually works! It is also the perfect iron to bring abroad. Note: you do not need a converter for this to work. Since it is dual voltage, all you need is an adapter, which are very inexpensive on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what it says it is!! Traveled over seas and it worked great! Just plug into your adapter and you&#x27;re ready to go. Can&#x27;t recommend enough! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a GOOD straightener for an inexpensive price and this was definetly the perfect choice. It came quick, and it works great. Totally worth buying!</li>
    <li> I love how straight my hair is!</li>
    <li> Beautiful product. ....excellent functionality</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend. She said it was awesome. That&#x27;s all I know.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the reviews and it seemed online like a great product. Was super excited to get it and when it arrived I was even more excited. Came in a really nice box with a travel sized argon oil and bag that was nice. Plugged it in and turned it on, so far so good, had it set on a lower setting the first time because I wasn&#x27;t sure how hot it actually get, went to run it through a 1 in part of hair and it did nothing, I mean NOTHING. Thinking k set it too low I turned it all the way up and gave it a few minutes. Again took a piece of 1 inch hair and ran it through, again NOTHING. Took ATLEAST 10 passes to get it semi straight on the highest setting. Only will keep it at a touch up straightener. Still contemplating returning it though. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl, and she just love it !!!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I shopped a lot locally, couldn&#x27;t find one I liked for the right price. This one works great, reasonably priced. Shipped on time. Only downfall is it doesn&#x27;t have auto turn off, and the light that it is on is very small.  I just make a habit of unplugging it every time now.</li>
    <li> Good but not Extraordinary! It&#x27;s better than Revlon one I have and I like case plus Argon oil that you get as bonus. However, I do not find it&#x27;s performance satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping very nice product</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! It works wonders for my mix hair. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and with perfect packaging. This is the best flat iron I have ever owned. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this HSI straighter. I had one that worked by constantly pulled my hair out.  This one is smooth, heats fast and works very well.  The only reason for 4 not 5 stars is that it does not turn off automatically like my previous one did.  You can&#x27;t beat this straighter for the price!</li>
    <li> The product was beautifully packaged in a red pouch and red box, ideal for gifting, and included a tiny bottle of argan oil that I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try yet. Love that it works on dual voltage so hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to use it when travelling to places where only 220v works. I have slightly curly thin dry hair and the iron always glides smoothly over it and results in a slight shine but it isn&#x27;t completely perfect, I have to repeat 2-3 times over a section of hair to get it to properly straighten (I use it at a temperature slightly less than 400F). So, in short, for about 40 bucks, the iron works great but it still didn&#x27;t give me that sleek straight salon look specially at the ends of the hair. But maybe it&#x27;s not the iron&#x27;s fault, I&#x27;m probably not using it with the right hair products (I use a Tresemme heat protectant spray before ironing and sometimes their shine spray after I&#x27;m done).</li>
    <li> I am very please with the quality of this Flat Iron, it works well on my fine hair and the pouch is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t tear hair, and the temperature setting is a useful feature. Comes with a travel bag and the free argan oil is nice bonus.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price!</li>
    <li> I have had this straight iron for about a month now. I have really enjoyed it. I researched a lot online and felt like this would be the best bang for my buck. It has been. I have long very thick and coarse hair. This works great on the hottest setting for me. I only need to use one pass. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the plates seem to bump through my hair. Maybe it&#x27;s just me damaged hair, but it seems like the plates aren&#x27;t as smooth as I expected them to be. I really liked the added bonuses of the travel sleeve and the argan oil. I never use the glove so that I could do without. Overal, this was a great buy!</li>
    <li> works great, and international!</li>
    <li> Love it. Leaves hair super smooth and soft. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> bought it for my daughter, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The temperature is hard to gauge. The red dot showing it hasn&#x27;t got to temperature yet turns on every five minutes or so and it seems like some days it is hotter than others set to the same point. Overall works well. I think I got one a bit defective but not enough to bother with a return. I would much prefer to have a more accurate way to gauge temperature. Over all nice for the price. Packaging is pretty. I liked the red bag it came in. Very cool.</li>
    <li> Straight iron caught on fire. Had this item less then a year (bought it for my daughters last Christmas) as you can see in the pictures it caught fire and sparked and almost caught our house on fire! Tried to return item and unable to!</li>
    <li> I love the hsi flat iron it is the best I have ever used .I had a chi and I dropped it and it cracked so I read all the reviews on Amazon and took a chance and I am so glad I did. I love the iron !My hair is curly and coarse and I used it at its worst and it came out beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone and the price is the icing on the cake love love love!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think these flatirons would work with my hair I&#x27;m Africa American and I have been going natural for 6 months. So my hair is half natural half relaxed. My last flatirons was hanas, which was amazing. . . and they borke on me. These flatirons came on time and straighten my hair out so good. I&#x27;m so impressed and would recommend them to any and everyone!!</li>
    <li> Straightener cane fast and was everything I expected! !</li>
    <li> It does not work as well as the flat iron I was attempting to replace. It does not get as hot as the one I bought at the big box store.  The plates are not long enough either.  I like the glove that came with it, and I like the temperature control; however, I ended up putting it in my craft room to use for straightening ribbon.  It works much better there than on my hair (which is thick, long, and has a tendency to frizz).</li>
    <li> Best hair iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have really fine hair so I use it at a low heat setting, the damage has been minimal. The glove is a great addition and the HSI oil is just amazing! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love that I can change the temperature on the wand. Small enough to do any style but the hair always comes out smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> Very happy with my product! Heats up fasten and easily straightens my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Works well and glides smoothly over my thick curly hair, does not rip hair like some other flat irons. I do have to crank up the heat but that&#x27;s probably due to my type of hair</li>
    <li> Her old iron only works with 120vac. This iron is stated to auto adjust from 120vac 60Hz to 240vac 50Hz. Having this iron will allow no need for an inverter while traveling in Europe. Wife does not like control on inside of clamps, but I believe it Is a good idea, and that she will grow to appreciate it. It would be nice if the iron had a close and lock closed switch/tab/latch. I took a cable tie made it to fit slightly loose, and use that to hold bars together, works okay. Seems like a very nice straightener, excellent build quality.</li>
    <li> I read great reviews which led me to purchase this particular flat iron along with the price. I was very disappointed in performance of flat iron though. It does not straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Sedu and loved it.  Because of the price and reviews, when the Sedu broke I bought this HSI iron.  The locations of the on/off switch and the temp control dial are awkward...inside the handle...so it&#x27;s hard to see if you want to make a change.  The edges seem to catch and pull my hair sometimes.  I&#x27;ll use it, but when it dies I&#x27;ll be returning to the sedu.</li>
    <li> Used to have a CHI. It broke and I get this to replace it. Works about the same at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Tanzania is on Type G adapters and this worked perfectly there. I&#x27;m excited to bring it with my on a European cruise. It&#x27;s so nice to have a tool that works abroad! In my opinion, it is comparable any of the &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brand straighteners, such as Chi.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this. It seemed a bit indulgent, since I never spend more than $20 on styling products. I was super disappointed that it snags my hair with every stroke. I would return it, but I already threw away the box. Maybe it would work better on thicker hair :-/</li>
    <li> Is not what it claims to be. Shortly after flat ironing my hair it doesn&#x27;t stay straight</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this straightener after reading some great reviews and having friend&#x27;s recommendation.  however, for some reason it is not doing the job right for me. Hair straightening is not that effective &amp; doesn&#x27;t stay straight all day.. Very confused as to why this is not working for me.</li>
    <li> Love this iron.  It is one of the best ones I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I received the straightener quickly. Product as described. I love that it had temperature adjustment. I&#x27;m happy with it and it a works great!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this straightening iron. It heats up incredibly quickly. When you look at it from side view and close it without much pressure there are no gaps between the plates. It works like I had hoped. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time at my niece&#x27;s house and knew I had to have one.  It was the best flat iron I had ever used.  I could not wait to use mine when I ordered it online.  It did not disappoint.  I love it!</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product. It heats up quickly and works very well. The oil that came with it is also great.</li>
    <li> Got here quickly and does wonders to my often frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> wish i bought a flat iron with a wider plate -- its alright, nothing special!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful flat iron for a fraction of the price of most! love it! the argon oil that came with it is great too!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It makes my silky and smooth.  I would recommend it anybody.  Loved the extras included.  The glove is the best- especially when I am doing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I have own a couple of different brands over the years with the latest being the CHI.  This is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with my HSI Flat Iron! I noticed the difference from my old, other brand right away. My hair is silky straight! Looks like I just left the salon and I got compliments on my hair right away. Lovin&#x27; it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week never having used a flat iron before.  The heating time is very short and it retains the temperature very well. Easy to use, the cord won&#x27;t tangle and slides very easily over my hair. I like the oil that came with it too, leaves hair shiny! So far very pleased with the purchase and would reccommend.</li>
    <li> I have gone through so many hair straightens through my life. When I found the HSI I fell in love with reviews and didn&#x27;t hesitate to order it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it I didn&#x27;t hesitate to straighten my hair. I have a full head of extensions sewen in with my real hair here in there to blend more. Not only did this wonderful hair straighten blend my hair VERY well with my extensions it also made my extensions look brand knew after running it through them. I love this hair straightener so much!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten CHI and other high end straighteners all my life. This one works SO MUCH BETTER! Takes less time to fix my hair and get it looking great! Love that this has different heat settings. Does not take long to heat up either. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better this flat iron works compared to the regular kind I used to use. I&#x27;ve been so frustrated with my hair for a long time but now it looks great!</li>
    <li> I used to have a flat iron similar to the look of this iron but I am 10x more happy with this flat iron. It does not leave my hair extremely wood board straight and I like that. It works quickly and heats up quickly too.</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic!  I was scared to order it, because I had never heard of HSI, the price seemed too good to be true, and I previously owned a CHI, which was a very nice straightener.  I received my HSI straightener 3 days after ordering and am so impressed.  It does a terrific job making my hair beautifully smooth (my hair is typically frizzy/curly) and it didn&#x27;t take as long as my CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t lock closed.  This isn&#x27;t a huge problem because it comes with a nice lined bag, but I would prefer if it stayed closed.  Not really a big deal</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all to curl my daughters hair. I bought this so she would have her own but it is too thick. My other straightener works much better.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! It heats up quickly and keeps my wavy hair straight all day. I would  recommend it. The only down fall is the on/off button is on the inside which makes it a little awkward, but all in all it&#x27;s a great purchase.</li>
    <li> The item is sturdy, reliable, well-made, &amp; works impeccably. It is strong, yet does not destroy my hair, &amp; easy to use. It works fast, &amp; I am confident that this item will last.</li>
    <li> WOW this works great, my only complaint I wish it was a little bigger. Makes great straight hair and lasts for days!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent! It&#x27;s a great straightener, leaves the hair shining and smooth! I love it! So far, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
    <li> My beloved flat iron of two years was dropped on the floor recently and needed to be replaced. I was so pleased to find one of similar quality (I had paid over $100 for my old one, different brand) for a lot less. The product I received was exactly as described and shipped quickly. I like it even better than my old one! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve had 4 other flat irons and was only satisfied with one of them.  My 12 year old daughter kept taking it, so I decided to purchase a new flat iron for myself.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to try this one out.  We absolutely love it. It gets hot quickly and does a great job of straightening my curly hair.  My daughter now keeps taking this one!</li>
    <li> bought this looking at other reviews. I must say I am very happy with the ease it straightens and for the time it saves!! Totally worth the price and the deal on amazon..</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  First let me say I NEVER write reviews. I just had to share my success story. I&#x27;ve tried many flat irons and was about to give up. My latest was the Chi. EVERY one I used killed the ends of my hair, making it dry and break off. I read great reviews about the oil that this came with so I purchased a bottle but to be fair the first time I used the flat iron I didn&#x27;t use the oil. My hair is soft and silky. My hair is naturally frizzy and must be straightened to be any where near presentable. I used to keep it permed all the time so straightening it is all new to me. I always flip it with the straightener to add curl and the curved edge makes a really pretty curl, unlike the Chi. By far one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
    <li> I have African-American hair, and I bought this flat iron based on the reviews alone. After the first use, I have to say that everyone was correct! This flat iron is great! It created curls on the ends of my hair with a flick of the wrist! The curls were even nicer than what my curling iron can do. My hair was nice and bouncy and shiny. Best flat iron/hair styler ever and at a great price! Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Updated review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this HSI Ceramic Flat Iron almost 2 years ago and it keeps working as brand new. I use the heat glove that came with it. It helps me to prevent any burnt. I purchased it on &amp;#34;Black Friday&amp;#34; for $39 (original price said it was $89). When I came back to the item a few weeks later, I saw the price was $39. Basically, It wasn&#x27;t on special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an average size and weight and the ergonomic design makes it easy to hold. It leaves my hair soft and smooth. It takes me about 45 to do all my hair. I really recommend it because it&#x27;s affordable and it does the work.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener for my wife. She has long, thick, curly hair. Although she has never used a hair straightener before, she can straighten her hair easily and fast with this device. In general, she is more than satisfied with it. Amazon also did a great job, it arrived well packed and very fast.</li>
    <li> I tried many straighteners, but very few worked for me. This one works very well, I am more than satisfied with it. I don&#x27;t even take thin sections of hair (I have a lot of hair and little patience)and it does a great job very quickly, love it!</li>
    <li> Firstly, the packaging is very professional. I love how it looks! It gives you a very smooth finish because of the ceramic plates. I received this in top quality condition and I have to go through two sets of shipments to receive my goods.  Really love it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend, who has hair that tends to be a bit fussy on humid days. Her previous flat iron was hard to close and use, and made her arms tired to the point that I heard complaints coming from the bathroom every time she used it. The madness had to stop, and the HSI flat iron came to the rescue! This flat iron far exceeds the previous one in performance, being easy to grasp, clamp, and pull. The temperature is also easy to adjust with the clearly-labeled dial and the light that comes on lets you know when the iron is on, so there is no confusion about whether or not the iron is on. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and has made my girlfriend happy, which means I am a happy guy as well!</li>
    <li> When I decided to purchase another set of flat irons, my first instinct was to get CHIs because of all the hooplah!  These flat irons are equivalent or better, as I have tried CHI brand before.  Not to mention the price difference.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I will do an update if my feeling about this product changes.</li>
    <li> Love it I have very thin hair and with the flat iron the static electricity is controled, would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this flat iron by mistake because I thought I was ordering another brand. I was going to return it but decided to read the reviews  first. When I saw the high marks on this product, I decided to try it, and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> With minimal use, the plates are wearing. (I&#x27;ve had it for 1.5 months and haven&#x27;t used it every day) It almost looks like they have scratches on the edges which is impossible as there is nothing in my hair that would cause that while straightening. The reason i examined it after some use was because as i was straightening my hair it sounded like the hair was breaking.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll go back to the CHI products.  I had one for about 8 years, and my daughter took it to college so I tried this one.  Bad choice.</li>
    <li> I had used the same $200 flat iron for 7 years when it finally died. I came on amazon expecting to spend hundreds of dollars for a replacement however at the top of the page was this flat iron and it had great reviews and was a top seller but I was still worried it wouldn&#x27;t work great but figured I could give it a shot for $40 and I was not disappointed! It was delivered a day early, was packaged great and the flat iron has a nice heavy feel. It doesn&#x27;t heat fully instantly but pretty quickly and made my very think curly hair instantly straight. The part I was most impressed by was the straight lasted two days instead of two hours. Also something different about it was the plug was the kind a hair dryer would have, meaning it has a reset button. This beat my old expensive flat iron easy.</li>
    <li> These ceramic stylers are a great improvment on my old stylers, my hair slides through the plates a lot easier and the finished result is better and easier to achieve. Excellent product</li>
    <li> Daughter birthday present and she says it works great!  Purchased after speaking with my hair professional and reading  reviews.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 12 year old daughter who has ridiculously thick, long hair.  She had tried a cheaper hair straightener that pulled her hair and burned her hands.  She&#x27;s only used this one a few times but she&#x27;s very happy with it.  It doesn&#x27;t pull and it straightens quickly...good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I thought I had it all with my Rusk flat iron. After years of use, I found that they no longer made that model.&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the other flat irons. After some researching, I decided to go with the HSI. It is definitely better than what I had before...a true professional!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener...however, after I had it for one month, the straightener fell to the ground and one of the plates shattered. I still think, overall, if you are very careful with it, it is much better than a CHI...and you cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> I received my HSI &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; flat iron and was highly disappointed! The cheap plastic cord it comes with is similar to that of a dollar store toy. Pretty sure it&#x27;s not going to hold up very long. I read so many great reviews about this product, and that&#x27;s why I purchased. Some were even comparing it to a Chi.. Do not be deceived! While it does straighten your hair, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to make steam, which is what my hair needs because it is fairly thick. I straighten to thin it out, but this flat iron does not fit the bill by far. When it&#x27;s &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; the light will turn from red to green, but mine constantly blinks both red and green, like it&#x27;s never ready, no matter how long you leave it on. I purchased this to replace my $30 no-name straightener thinking it was professional, but have since switched back to the old one. Save your money.. The only thing I do like about it is it&#x27;s thin and makes cute curls at the bottom of your hair if you roll it up. That&#x27;s about the only plus though.</li>
    <li> I was thinking that because of the price i was going to be surprised and I did but in a good way!  This flat iron works....and my hair is not easy to handle! It does the job!</li>
    <li> The product was excellent.  Love the controls to change temperature and the on-off switch.  Reasonably prices - meaning it didn&#x27;t cost me over $50 - and does the same job as those costing hundreds.  Seller was awesome, and shipping was FAST!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve converted from having a $20 straightener that I&#x27;ve had since I was in my young teens to buying this straightener. I was a little sketched out because I didn&#x27;t know the brand very well, but after reading the amazing reviews on how great, and it being the #1 best seller, I went for it and bought it.  I got it in two days and I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think about purchasing it earlier! It makes your hair look amazing and for under $60 it&#x27;s definitely worth your money. it comes with a little red pouch for storage and a heat protective glove which I haven&#x27;t needed yet but whateves! It heats up within minutes so you can get it done quickly. And the little bottle of argon oil it comes with makes your hair really soft. Totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I admit this is only my second straightener, but I love this one. It straightened my hair in half the time it would normally take and it stayed smooth! Amazing! The price was also great.</li>
    <li> It came early!!! Also came in a nice pouch with a glove and oil!!! Awesome product leaves my really curly hair like if I did a keratin treatment!! Love it</li>
    <li> I came across this as being advertised on facebook on sale. I needed a new one anyway so I figured why not. I already had a Chi and this is by far better! Lesstime  spent on my hair now and it was a great price! Was delivered within days :-)</li>
    <li> Never had to use one we adopted a little girl and her hair is curly, my older daughter straightened her hair and it looked beautiful&lt;br /&gt; So I seen the add and decided to try it. It is fantastic great choice.</li>
    <li> I found this straighter due to the outstanding reviews of my fellow amazon reviewers.  I had to see what all the hype was about. I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for about a month and I love it.  Doesn&#x27;t damage hair and works very fast and efficiently.  Replace your old, outdated straighter with this and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I choose this because of the price and it was a great bargain. Takes no time to heat up and I feel as though it gives my hair a smooth finish. Wish I had ordered another for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this for the price. It&#x27;s really hot and it gets my hair super flat. It&#x27;s a great deal. The only think I don&#x27;t love is it doesn&#x27;t have a switch to keep it closed like some of my other flatirons do and it&#x27;s on off is on the inside so it&#x27;s slightly harder to get to or see than I would normally like.</li>
    <li> This product is a very solid professional-style flat iron.  heats up faster and warmer, not flimsy, very solid and a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Love the product and how my hair looked when done. Shipped a little slow but no problems at all and I love the straightener.</li>
    <li> I previously had chi which I loved, but was having a hard time finding one in my budget that did have silicon strips. This was less than 1/2 the price and has better features. Love the temp control.</li>
    <li> I researched and read all the reviews before purchasing this item. I felt that the good definitely outweighed the negative but I was definitely incorrect. This flat iron claims to have a &#x27;high heat setting&#x27; and if this is the case, mine is a dud. While I know that it&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing for steam to escape your hair while using a flat iron it is common for me. This did not happen. I would wait for the green light to come on and by the time I was done running it through a 1&amp;#34; SECTION of my hair, all heat was gone. My hair is thick and medium-long (just past shoulders). I tried using this product with the provided hair treatment and with my own. I had poor results both times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had better results with my 10 year old Wigo Flat Iron from Ulta and my GVP Flat Iron from Sally.</li>
    <li> All the reviews are right this straighter is the best I have used and my hair looks just as it does when I leave the salon and they use the chi. It even came with a glove so I dont burn my fingers anymore!</li>
    <li> I couldve bought a 5 dollar straightener and been just as unhappy with it as I was this one. It came partially broken to begin with, and the &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; plates pull my hair with every stroke. Worst straightener ever.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, and have been straightening it for years. It heats up quickly, and does the job in just a pass or two. The swivel  cord really does work.</li>
    <li> i would like that was more large like  1/2 inch  but all find the price was the best good item</li>
    <li> The HSI is a great straightener. It makes your hair unbelievably soft and smooth, and straightens those unmanageable spots too. I love the fact that it can also curl and flip your hair as well, and has a wide range of settings, from low to very very hot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a high-end straightener like some of the other girls, so I don&#x27;t have those to compare the HSI to. But I have spent this kind of money on straighteners in the past, and none of them have ever performed like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, relatively straight hair. My problem is that my hair can be fairly frizzy and looks \\&quot;weightless\\&quot;, if you can imagine. The difference that a good quality straightener can make--my hair becomes glossy and looks/feels much healthier. The frizziness is noticeably reduced and my hair seems to have more texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the straightener itself, it heats up very fast. The size is perfect for me and I have hair that falls just at my shoulders (hair in the back is at the base of my neck, hair in the front is slightly longer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you&#x27;re getting a professional straightener (I say professional because it gives me the same results that my hair dresser&#x27;s straightener does), for a very very good price. I would definitely recommend this one. Plus it seems like if you do get a broken one by fluke, their customer service is great.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!  I was a little worried because the price was so much lower than the other big name brands. But the reviews we all o good I thought I would try it.  It does a great job on my hair.  Easy grip, smooth plates, and it gets very hot!  The glove is an extra bonus because my hair gets too hot to touch when on high.</li>
    <li> Best iron I&#x27;ve had! My hair is super curly and it used to take me over an hour to straighten it. Now I&#x27;ve got it down to about a half an hour and it is way smoother than I&#x27;ve ever had it! It makes very pretty soft curls too. For the price I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more, I would pay more for this quality but luckily I didn&#x27;t have to! :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron and really did not want to spend a lot. I saw this had great reviews and thought it was worth the buy. I am very happy with this purchase, it did a great job straitening my hair.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this flat iron after reading all the reviews.  It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair to my expectations and made my hair feel like straw.  I guess I will be going back to the hot comb.  I also used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (finer than my hair) which didn&#x27;t straighten her hair well and made it feel coarse.</li>
    <li> I just got this straightener. It&#x27;s my first flat iron purchase, so I thought I&#x27;d start with something like this that isn&#x27;t too expensive. It heats up quickly and the extra accessories are nice (glove, oil, nice red satin carrying pouch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once (and in a hurry) but I don&#x27;t have my straightening technique down yet, so I will have to try again. Seems like a good purchase though.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a flat iron that would be effective without draining my pocketbook. But it had to be a quality product because I have tried many $20 flat irons that were almost useless. This product fit the bill! Not only does it work great, but it also comes with a carrying pouch which will be perfect for travel. It takes very little time to heat up and seems to be quite sturdy.</li>
    <li> I think this product definitely lived up to and exceeded its expectations and was exactly what I was looking to buy!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair straightener. I&#x27;ve had mine for a year now and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for a different one. Heats up quickly, and straightens beautifully.</li>
    <li> Bc every-time I use it when the hot iron is laid flat it&#x27;s green but when I pick it up to straighten my hair the light turns red</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! I have thick hair and i wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but after reading the other reviews i thought I&#x27;d give it a try and am very pleased. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I love the way this works - I use it on my bangs and for some reason they stay much smoother than they ever did with a curling iron!  And a very big added perk - I don&#x27;t burn my forehead!</li>
    <li> great product for the money spent&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has very frizzy hair and this made her very Happy Christmas Morning.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product.  She tried one at Costco first and was not impressed.  She used yours and has no complaints,  It does not damage her hair,  And is easy to use.  Good quality item,  All I can say is if my wife&#x27;s happy,  I&#x27;m happy!  Thanks!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Works so well and heats in seconds. it&#x27;s the best one I ever had or used.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and my daughter in law loves it as it gives her the results she wants just like when she leaves the hairdressers.  The ones you can buy in the department store just don&#x27;t give you the professional results.  I have one happy daughter in law because of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI ceramic straightener as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is always complaining about how hard it is to get her hair straight. She has bought a couple of the more popular, high end ceramic irons with marginal success. We had a Christmas party to go to so I let her have the HSI iron as an early gift and I must say, she loves it! I&#x27;m not an expert on what makes one iron work better than another but she said the HSI was much more gentle on her hair and left if soft and straight! So thank you, because if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my new flat iron!! I bought it bc it was a good deal and had good reviews. I was amazed when I got it that it was much better then the Chi I had used in the past!! This flat iron is the best I&#x27;ve owned! It&#x27;s an awesome deal and the flat iron is WONDERFUL!! Highly recommend!!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this one several weeks ago and i love it. It&#x27;s not like those plastic flat iron, it has high quality. Make sure your hair is dry before you use it. And put some anti frizz oil on it(there is a small bottle of oil come with this product in the box). And then you will find out your hair is not only straight but shining, smoothy, and especially natural. And it has a glove in the box either. I really love this flat iron and i will recommend it to my friend.</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on Black Friday (around $40), and I would have gladly paid more after using this straightener. It works quickly (and great with the Argon Oil), and has left my hair soft and undamaged (Though I only straighten about once a week). Some of my straighteners have been to harsh in the past, and eventually short-circuited, but thus far I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron on a lightning deal so I got a great price for it.  I was pleasantly surprised with the nice pouch it came to store it.  It is lightweight and very easy to use.  I have curly hair and it straigtened very quickly.  I def will recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I have really difficult hair (the front is straight and the back is wavy and the middle is all kinds of crazy) and living in south Louisiana doesn&#x27;t help with the humidity and all that. I have found that only my Paul Mitchel flat iron will keep my hair really straight and prevent frizzing, but it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair. I have only had my HSI for a few days, and I&#x27;ve only used it to curl my hair, but so far I love it!! The curls stay all day without using hairspray and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz. I&#x27;ve also used the sample argan oil that comes with the flat iron and I&#x27;m not as crazy about it as some of the other reviewers. I don&#x27;t find it does much for my hair. I&#x27;ve tried using a small amount and a larger amount and I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the HSI argan oil vs other silky oils like biosilk. The only negative to my HSI flat iron is that it doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly through my hair as my Paul Mitchel does. Overall, I LOVE my new HSI, and it was money well spent.</li>
    <li> My Chi- just died on my and got this works great and i think it gets way hotter than my CHI which i love. Came with everything listed and super nice. Even got one for my MIL for Christmas. Totally recommend getting it if your looking for a good straightener :)</li>
    <li> I love this and it straightens my curly wavy hair great. Gets pretty hot so be careful! The included oil sample is magic!</li>
    <li> top notch stuff&lt;br /&gt;great for my nappy head lol&lt;br /&gt;it straightened it to perfection not hard n wrinkly last all day</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading all of the great reviews. I think that no matter what straightener you get you&#x27;re going to have to replace it after awhile. I think they just loose their heat. This works great though, made my hair super straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! Makes my hair super straight and leaves it feeling soft, not dried out :) I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I had not heard of this brand of straightener and took a chance! - I was not disapointed.  The straightener has variable heat settings and can get really hot, which is what I need for my long very thick hair.  The price was attractive, but this straightener is every bit as good or better than the expensive ones!</li>
    <li> I must admit I was a bit skeptical at trying this new product. My hair is so thick, I often find it difficult to find products that work successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at an even greater price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in 2011 after my $150 hair straightener bit the dust. This works so well at a fraction of the cost. It has lasted a long time and gets my super thick/long hair pin straight. With other straighteners, it took me about 1.5 hours to straighten my hair, however, this straightener reduces that time down to 40 minutes. When this one breaks, I will most definitely get it again.</li>
    <li> The straightener was even better than I anticipated. Down side is my daughter keeps taking it from me! May have to get another one! My hair feels like I just got out of the salon.</li>
    <li> I Love this iron! It&#x27;s very high quality and I would recommend it highly. I have been in the Cosmetology business for many years &amp; this iron performs.</li>
    <li> I figured how could I go wrong with a professional hair straightener for a fraction of its suggested retail? Can&#x27;t beat it, and with free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime, fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and this flat iron gets pretty hot the only bad thing I would say it that the side I the plates aren&#x27;t ceramic and they kinda snag the hair</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas gift for a good friend who is also a hairstylist she Liked how it got her hair really straight.She says \\&quot;It tames wild/crazy hairs\\&quot; Unlike her other ones that she has to go over and over to get them straight.</li>
    <li> My wife is in cosmetology school and the one they gave her took forever to get hot and supposibly its was a profesdional one they said so I did research on some straightners and found that this was better than chi so I gave it a try and bought it for my wife she says it works ten times better than the one she has and she always uses it great price would buy it again</li>
    <li> I wish I had spent the extra money on a brand I was familiar with. I have fine, naturally wavy hair, which is usually pretty easy to straighten. However, with the HSI, I spend more time on my hair than I did with my Chi but my hair doesn&#x27;t look near as smooth and healthy. This flat iron also takes awhile to heat up and does not reach a high temperature, compaired to other professional stylers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Well even it the thing didn&#x27;t work well, which it does, the presentation is outstanding.  Heat fast and evenly and love the glove which I have always needed but never had.  I would recommend this item and it would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> I have used this iron a few times and so far I am very pleased with it. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like other ones have.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on the chi and hsi. I decided to take a chance with the hsi..you cant beat the price. I received the straightener right away. I bought to use on my daughters hair which is very curly and thick. The hsi straightened it with no problem. I am very pleased with it. I even went to work the next day talking about it.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy, medium length  hair.  After I started using this flat iron, several co-workers asked me if I had my hair done - it looked so good!  I love this flat iron!  Makes straightening so much easier and faster.</li>
    <li> Starightens  fast doesn&#x27;t get tangeled in my curly thick hair,  It is  hands down the best straightener I have used</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron a few weeks ago based on reviews I read online. The person who cuts my hair advised me to buy one made by Hot Tools but I chose this one.  I&#x27;m not completely sure if I&#x27;m 100% sold on it yet, however.  So the jury is still out as far as being able to review it completely.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the Argon oil the company sent me to use in conjunction with it!&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was very easy to deal with too, so that&#x27;s always a plus!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I travel to Africa most of the year for my job and needed something that wouldn&#x27;t overheat in the 220V outlets here.  This was a complete waste of money as it barely heated up and would not straighten my hair for anything (I have pretty naturally straight hair anyway).  The ceramic is completely cheap and snagged my hair badly with ever pass. It pulled out several pieces of my hair and hurt pretty badly. I returned it and bough a world-wide straightener and curler from Sally&#x27;s - don&#x27;t remember the name brand, sorry - but that cheaper one worked way better than this.  The $200 price tag is a joke. This thing isn&#x27;t worth $20 at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron, after reading the excellent reviews, for my daughter. She previously had a Chi &amp; a Paul Mitchell. She loved the Paul Mitchell &amp; wore it out. She wanted another Paul Mitchell, but they were so expensive, I was looking for another alternative. The HSI had variable heat settings, which was important. Also the HSI flat iron was at a fantastic price!! So I took a chance &amp; ordered it for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely LOVES it!!!!! She says it straightens her hair &amp; regardless of the weather, it stays straight!! She loves it every bit as much as she did the Paul Mitchell!!! I could have bought 3 HSI for the price of one Paul Mitchell!!&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more? We&#x27;ll just have to see if it last as long as the Paul Mitchell did...........</li>
    <li> ceramic plates were cracked when opened, used it anyways and when heated the plates broke off where the cracks where. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be a sturdy flat iron or was packed defectived.</li>
    <li> This straightner works just like the one my hair dresser uses. It is great at making curls and the free glove helps me from getting burned fingers. A definite plus! I like the heat adjustment and the light to show it is ready.</li>
    <li> This feels real good in my hand. Was looking at a wider model (3 inch), but this works just as well. Glad I did get this model, its easier to get the short lengths. Looks to be very good quality for a very good price.</li>
    <li> Comapred with my other hair iron products, this product works excellent in straightening my hair. And using this product with its professional Argan Oil helps my hair stay healthy and straight.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance and she loves it!  Great quality product!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a professional flat iron.</li>
    <li> She loves it, she&#x27;s moving from a 8 year old generic hair straightener to something a little more modern and heavy duty. She said she loves the many different heat settings and is working on finding the right balance.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner so I can start doing curls with straigtner, so far so good I am still mastering the technique. Defiantly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Flat Iron for a recent trip to Italy because it was dual voltage.  It worked perfectly, and to my surprise, it worked as well on my hair as my much more expensive flat iron that I use at home.</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron does work and probably works great for someone else.  I have very thick curly hair (multi-racial) that I have managed to tame for the most part over the last 10 years.  This flat iron gets it straight but not bone straight and not without frizz.  The heating surface is small and my hair is really long so it&#x27;s a bit of a pain to go through all the trouble of flat iron it with this thing and still needing to follow up with something else.  for quick touch-ups it&#x27;s great.  It heats up fast and is good for traveling.</li>
    <li> I hit a home run with this one.  Considered getting the Chi, but talked to a couple stylists who said the HSI is just as good if not better.  Couldn&#x27;t beat the price for the holidays, and it was shipped in plenty of time.  The wife can&#x27;t talk enough about how she&#x27;s enjoying it.  A hair serum or oil is a must though so your hair doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. The best iron I have ever owned. Highly recommend it for those with wavy hair like mine.</li>
    <li> bought this for my teen daughter for Christmas&amp;#62; She loves it for what it does for her hair. And I loved the price. looks like its a keeper</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, won&#x27;t straighten well, not hot, pulls hair when you try to use it.  I would not recommend this</li>
    <li> This product works great. Love the fact that you can #1 decide the temp to use and also that you can set it to turn off. I&#x27;m so happy with that part!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it!  She says it works great and she&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> There are 2 of us, so the larger plug-in doesn&#x27;t allow me to have the straightener and blow dryer plugged in at the same time.  The straightener itself works great and heats up quickly, so it&#x27;s not too big of an issue.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very satusfied</li>
    <li> This might be one of the worst online products I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.  Where do I begin?  All of the switches (4), i.e., on/off, temp control, etc are un-readable unless you have a magnifying glass...making it nearly impossible to decipher which is which.  The blue LED light blinks when the flat iron is turned off, making for a bright blue blinking 24/7....thought it was a police car outside in the middle of the night!  Ridiculous.  And on top of it all, it does not open wide enough or get hot enough.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron. Exactly what I was looking for and at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> These flat irons are amazing. They really get the job done quick. Just one pass and that&#x27;s it . Also I love how you can control the temperature!!! Need to buy more as gifts .</li>
    <li> Love it! Straightens with ease</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron because my Chi broke after 10 years and I needed a replacement.  I don&#x27;t straighten my hair as often as I used to so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 again.  I chose this HSI because of the awesome reviews, and it is good, but not as good as my chi.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as smooth on my hair, tugs a tiny bit but it works for what I need it to do.  I am happy with the purchase because I didn&#x27;t spend too much.  It also heats up WAY faster than my 10 year old chi.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago for $50 and was expecting it to be a terrific flat iron based on the reviews. I have been using straighteners for years and this is the only one that has burned off a chunk of my hair. Also one of the plates broke so now its not even safe to use. I think i will stick with the cheaper store bought straighteners from now on.</li>
    <li> pulled my hair off and too bulky feeling in my hand</li>
    <li> Read a bunch of reviews that said this was just as good as a chi. No. Not even close. You get what you pay for I guess</li>
    <li> Smooth and easy to handle due to swivel cord. However it doesn&#x27;t heat up fast or high enough! Gentle on hair though, no burning.</li>
    <li> My original review is below, unedited, but i now have to go back on this. I&#x27;ve had three of these. The first was perfect for several years until the cord wore through and the iron arced. I replaced it with another one which I did not like because it was inexplicably different, then ordered a new second gen one. I&#x27;ve had the damn thing for maybe six months, and the internal electronics have come unsoldered and the iron doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I think I&#x27;m done with this brand. Every single one I&#x27;ve ordered has been different from the last, with no indication in the listing that this would be the case. This one now failing is an indication of exactly how crap the build quality is.  OLD REVIEW, NO LONGER APPLICABLE: I&#x27;ve had a few hair straighteners in my life, but the only one comparable to this was a high-end salon model that cost well over two times what this one does. It heats up fast, works well, has a long cord that swivels, and is all-around a dependable buy. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Heats up quickly. Very sturdy. Comes with a travel bag and a small bottle of argan oil.</li>
    <li> I brought it for my daughter and she has natural hair it doesn&#x27;t straighten it flat and smooth enough for me and she always says mom it pulled my hair and I&#x27;ve done hair for years and know how to use a flat iron very well I can curl my whole head with one, she doesn&#x27;t even have very thick or course hair her hair has a beautiful curl pattern to it and still it just doesn&#x27;t get the job done and I also use a marrocon heat protector spray and frizz control and again the hair is still frizzy not happy at all with this product but for those of you that spoke so well about it I&#x27;m glad it works for you. I will be returning it ASAP!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month so far.  You can tell its heavy duty and salon quality.  I only need one pass though with the iron.  It works great with the HSI Argan Oil.  The only negative is it doesn&#x27;t have a self shut off.  You just have to remember to turn it off each time you use it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron  with dual voltage  to take to London.  This fits the bill perfectly! It performs like my  expensive older Chi.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter because of good reviews and good price. We are very pleased with it. Super value!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this item. The two times I used it it worked well to straighten my hair. The third time was definitely not a charm. It wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I checked all the power at the outlet with other electric items and the power worked fine but the flat iron wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I returned for a refund. A professional flat iron would last a long time, so I think the name using the word professional is not accurate.</li>
    <li> Love it! This straightener is easy to use and glides with ease. The included glove is also a nice added extra.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  I read the reviews and was excited to get a great straightener for such a low cost but it wasn&#x27;t worth the $30.  Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I ordered these flat irons, they have revived my hair.  My hair was brittle, frizzy, kinky, stubborn, and won&#x27;t not hold a curl to save it&#x27;s life, not anymore.  My hair now since using the flat irons is soft, straight and even hold curls now.  I am still in shock at how straight my hair became with one swipe and also stayed soft and manageable for more than one day.  I would highly recommend the HSI flat iron.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron , it&#x27;s highly recommended. These is my second time that I bought this product because my first one I dropped it on the floor and I break it.</li>
    <li> Horrible. My hair is curly/wavy, not coarse, yet this flat iron did next to nothing as far as straightening - if anything it added frizz. Very dissatisfied, cheap product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve guessed by now, having viewed my name, that this product was purchased for my wife and not for my own use. :) I bought it as a replacement for an inferior brand/model that she previously owned which did not last beyond several months. My wife has been using it now on a daily basis for nearly two months and is very pleased with it, both in terms of its performance and apparent build quality. She noted this morning that it heats quickly and is easier to use than her previous flat iron which matters a great deal when she&#x27;s in a hurry to get out the door in the morning and wants to look her best in meetings throughout the day. Her advice is to avoid the cheapo irons that currently flood the market and pick up this HSI Professional model, which indeed has proven to be a salon-quality product and worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightening iron for my fiance and she&#x27;s been really happy with it.  There&#x27;s another popular brand that brick and mortar stores sell that she raved about, but cost quite a bit more.  When I got her this one she was really happy with it.  The adjustable temp is nice, and the plates have a good coating on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish there was an auto off feature when she forgets to shut it off..</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It makes straighteningg my very coarse, naturally. Curly hair much easier.  I am able to get done very quickly with less heat damage to my hair. It heats up very quickly and I really like the digital readout of the temperature. I like this flat iron much better than my Chi. It comes with a nice red. satin travel bag.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this straightener does a fantastic job on my hair! Was very impressed by it. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased a new flat iron in many years, so mine was pretty old.  The HSI had many positive reviews and was a fraction of the price of other tourmaline flat irons so I decided to give it a chance.  I have not been disappointed!  Heats up quickly and leaves my hair so soft!!  I also really like the insulated travel bag.  Thanks Blue Novelties for a great product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I Have thick, wavy, frizzy hair and after i used this it left my hair super straight and no frizz .i was a bit hesitant on buying a straightner online only because i didnt know how well it would work on my hair, but once i got this product and tested it myself i was very satisfied. im also in love with the sample sized argan oil, i would purchase once i finish the bottle :)</li>
    <li> Well I bought it because supposedly it&#x27;s dual voltage so when I used it abroad &amp;#34;Middle East&amp;#34; it didnt heat up that much and did nothing to my hair basically. I would return it. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this in April 2014.  Hard to use, hard to set temp.  Started acting up within a month.  Cut itself off constantly while I was using it.  By Dec. it was shot.  Won&#x27;t come on most of the time and when it does, it shuts off while I&#x27;m using it!  Junk!  Do Not buy!</li>
    <li> its just what i needed to help my fine thin hair on a night on the town.  Takes the frizz out and easy to use and set the temps just right for any hair</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had our flat iron for a few weeks now, and we are very happy with it.  It heats up quickly, and flattens hair very effectively.  The plates are also easy to clean, so if you have hair products that you use before straightening, you can wipe any excess off of there.  It arrived just when we expected it, as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter.  She like it so well I bought one for my granddaughter. They love them. Very happy they were happy with them.</li>
    <li> I have had this flatiron four a couple of months now. It works great and is a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener and I&#x27;m glad. I didn&#x27;t have to spend a whole lot of money on it.</li>
    <li> it works well . my hair looked shiny. silky but few days later my hair looked more damaged. but I still use it just not as much.</li>
    <li> I needed a new flat iron and this one was reasonably priced and good quality. It doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off,  but its easy to use the GFI button on the plug to switch it on and off without unplugging the unit from the wall. It warms up quickly and holds the right temperature setting.</li>
    <li> Ladies....seriously. I was shopping around for a Chi and happened to come across this. I figured based on the reviews, I would give it a try, hell...it&#x27;s cheap enough right? Let me tell you, this straightener is fantastic, there&#x27;s no going back after this. I have really thick Italian curly/wavy hair and this is by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever tried. I only have to straighten my hair once and it stays &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; :) Heats up fast. Get one while they&#x27;re still cheap lol</li>
    <li> Bought for gift and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so I assume they really like the product. Thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener, you can choose the temperature you want. I have very curly hair and so I set the temperature pretty high and it imediately straightens my hair on the first round. With different straighteners, I have had to go over the same hair several times and still end up with a wave in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this iron. Its&#x27; the first tourmaline ionic iron I&#x27;ve used. Prior to the HSI, I used a CHI. My hair seems to be less frizzy and less frayed ends. An excellent feature is the temperature adjustment button, allowing you to control the right amount of heat needed. Works great and it ready to use quickly.</li>
    <li> Good product for a great price.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are very happy with our new straightener. We have very curly hair and this straightener works very well. I love how quickly it heats up and as a mom with a forgetful daughter, I love that it turns itself off after a time as well. I would highly recommend this straightener!</li>
    <li> I bought it based on all the good reviews and it was the right choice for me. It&#x27;s easy to use and the results are very good. For this price it&#x27;s the best deal.</li>
    <li> Awesome thanks love it!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The description of the product was short compared to what it is capable of doing.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this iron. It heats up quickly, love the temp options and it&#x27;s truly works better than a CHI- which is what I originally wanted and would&#x27;ve paid a lot more for! Ladies get this straightener you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; recommend it to anyone.  I bought 2!!  One for me &amp; one as a gift.</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron. Great price but on occasion snags hair.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Straightens my curly hair quickly or makes soft curls without the frizz.  Ready to use in seconds.</li>
    <li> i have been ironing my hair since i was 16, 10 years ago. its a great quality product, i think better than the chi and its very easy to curl your hair using this iron as well (look up tutorials on you tube)&lt;br /&gt;2nd time buying this iron, the first one lasted about a year. will buy again, great price</li>
    <li> TEMP LOWERS AND HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT GOES UP AGAIN</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  The very best one I have ever owned</li>
    <li> After buying this product 2 years ago, based on the excellent reviews, I decided to finally type my own review. I have very coarse/thick hair (Asian descent) and I generally need a very high temperature hair straightener to get the results I want. This straightener boasts a 410 degree max temp that is &amp;#34;suitable for all hair types.&amp;#34; However, it requires me to go over my hair at least twice to get the desired results, due to the loss of heat. It takes some time to warm up and then loses heat quickly when applied to hair. I also have a Remington digital hair straightener which I use on a daily basis and would highly recommend over HSI. Don&#x27;t let the amazing reviews fool you. Unless you have thin hair that is easily manipulated with heat, I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Doesnt really retain the heat well. After I straightened a couple of strands, the straightener needs time again to heat up</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she is very happy with it!</li>
    <li> It works as good as you&#x27;d expect, I think it may be a little overpriced though since I&#x27;ve bought $20 straighteners at Walmart that have done just as good. It doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair though when I use it, which I&#x27;m very happy about since the last few straighteners I&#x27;ve bought tend to yank my hair, this one doesn&#x27;t. I like it, I think it&#x27;ll last me a few years it looks pretty high quality.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!  I have coarse hair and this straightening iron makes my hair very smooth and straight with little effort.</li>
    <li> I bought the item for my daugther, before the purchase , I saw the observations about it, and based in those recommendations, I decided to make the purchase. I recieved it in a very good time respecting the delivered day, and the item is what we were expecting, good quality and the use is very simple and very reasonable price.  I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Excellent item. Iron produces heat quickly and performs as described. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener at first. But I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It turns on and gets warm but doesn&#x27;t even straighten my already-mostly-straight hair. It&#x27;s very frustrating especially since I can&#x27;t even return it now because it&#x27;s been too long.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this HSI flat iron works wonders on my hair.  It straightens beautifully and leaves a sheen to my hair.  I love that I can adjust the temperature setting.  I was skeptical because I was replacing a Chi flat iron that I paid $200 for.  I get the same professional results at a fraction of the price.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Straightens in one swipe.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed that this iron had gotten so many good reviews and was so cheap. Unfortunately, upon using a few times, I was really disappointed. I can admit that if you have never used a high end flat iron before, this would seem of high quality. It certainly is better than the $20 ones you find at the drug store. I just can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too heavy, too bulky to get all the kinks out, and does not glide well - uncomfortably pulling your hair and leaving it looking fried. It takes way too long and too much effort to achieve poor results. I got this iron after my higher end iron died and didn&#x27;t want to spend another $150 to replace it. Well, I ended up buying the iron I should have in the first place, just wasting more time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the frustration and spend the money for a decent iron.</li>
    <li> I have NO idea how this straightener has so many good reviews. 2 years ago I purchased 2 one for myself and one as a Christmas gift.  I have reasonably straight hair to begin with and just wanted something to smooth my hair and make it sleek. This product does not deliver. I end up using my $19 drugstore straighter that&#x27;s approximately 10 years old and gives much better results. I have no idea how anyone can compare this with a Chi, and I can&#x27;t imagine trying to use this on curly or ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this after having a Chi for years because I needed a flat iron with more heat. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and I love it! Heats up quickly and leaves hair smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from the US and I was waiting until after I traveled to Europe to review this straightener - I had no problems with the voltage conversion. Such a great straightener!! Keeps my hair straight &amp; shiny all day! Heats up quickly, and the case comes in handy. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this specific straightener based off the very positive reviews: re: bang for your buck. I am actually not all that excited about it. It is not as hot as the reviews suggest, and with very thin hair I am surprised that I have to turn it all the way up, have to separate my hair a lot in chucks, and still have to go over my hair more than a few times to get it straight. I also realized I underestimated the size of my last straightener and prefer wider than 1inch. It&#x27;s fine. Would not buy again, however.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, cheap, good to use, and with good hair effect!</li>
    <li> AMAZING....... Enough said!</li>
    <li> Ordered it on Friday and received it on a Saturday !!! Very professional looking can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> Wish it had an automatic shut off.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I thought it would, but it works ok.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron. The plates aren&#x27;t as smooth as I am used to but it straighetns well and I do not have to run my hair over and over again with the iron. I wish it came in with wider plates (maybe it does and I missed that). May try another iron next time. Although this works for me, I am not in love with it.</li>
    <li> Professional quality at a very reasonable price!  Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!  I bought it for the price.  I will keep it for the product.  This is every bit as good as the expensive Chi my sister owns.  It heats fast and does wonderful things to my hair!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a professional iron. There is no ceramic slip to this iron whatsoever. Very curious how it gets such great reviews.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron, can&#x27;t beat the price either!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m still getting use to using it, but it is very nice....</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife as a gift, looked at tons of reviews and compared prices. In the end this seemed to be the only option, it&#x27;s cheaper and ranks higher on most reviews than other more pricy ones. Defiantly a good purchase, and the wife loved it!</li>
    <li> Met all expectations and seems to work great.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron! Heats up in a second and has a nice flawless glide through my thick coarse hair! Very reasonable price! Fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener, I have had mine for 3 years now. It never burns or dries out my hair. Just leaves it silky smooth.  My daughter has a number of ceramic straighteners and none of them do the great job this one does. She has long very think hair and I have long very fine hair and it works great on both of us.  I&#x27;m finally tired of her stealing my straightener all the time I bought another one for her and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price.  Love, love love it!</li>
    <li> Still learning how to use it, but happy with the product. Great price, but I did not get it in 2 days. Ordered on Monday, got here Thursday, as did everything else in my order from that day. Not sure what happened with 2 day Prime shipping...</li>
    <li> I would give it a 5.. It does great on my hair and my kids. We all have thick hair. Warms up fast. Easy to use. Cord swivels. Nice case for it. The only issue is it trips off all the time. I have to keep pressing the reset button. I have tried literally EVERY plug-in in the house. So I&#x27;m not so happy with that. Other than that, great flat iron.</li>
    <li> So far I am enjoying this flat iron.  Arrived in very nice packaging with a red fabric bag for storage.  This is my first straightening iron and it is easy to use and does a nice job quickly without damaging the hair.</li>
    <li> I have course curly hair that&#x27;s 3a 3b 3c and 4a type. I wasn&#x27;t too happy with this. After I straitened it, it was fluffy and was curled at parts. it u have hair like mine. this is not for u. But I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars because it works great on wavy type hair. So I&#x27;m giving this to my sister. And I&#x27;m gonna buy a new one of my old straightener. I recommend the Remington static straightener, it&#x27;s $20 and makes my hair perfectly straight and soft!</li>
    <li> Very good product...can&#x27;t believe I got it at such a low price</li>
    <li> this straighten is great for medium hair (thickness &amp; length)! It glides through hair and leaves it very shiny. The oil sample and pouch that come with it are also very helpful. It was a great price and is a great straightener!</li>
    <li> Thank you seller and Amazon for such a smooth and speedy transaction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best iron I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve been flat ironing my own hair for over 12 years and I feel confident writing this review knowing that flat ironing is a learned skill and not everyone is doing it correct, hence complaining about snagged hair and taking too long to iron etc..I have long, frizzy and wavy hair, yet it&#x27;s thin.  Stubborn at the roots for sure..I&#x27;ve always had to go over and over with other irons.  NOT WITH THIS HSI!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This HSI:&lt;br /&gt;Did not snag or tug at my hair&lt;br /&gt;No burnt smell&lt;br /&gt;Ironed quickly and efficiently&lt;br /&gt;Not ONE of my hairs was ripped out in the plates&lt;br /&gt;Took away frizz and worked on my stubborn hair quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light went from red to green when it was heated up for use, very quickly.  Came with a little trial Argan oil and glove.&lt;br /&gt;Also has storage pouch. You can adjust the temperature dial as well.  I LOVE that the cord is longer than any iron I&#x27;ve ever owned..Hot Tools, Corioliss and Chi to name a few.  Well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my photo the bottom of my hair looks not as straight as it should be..because it hasn&#x27;t been cut in almost a year (shameful I know lol) so I don&#x27;t blame that on the iron!</li>
    <li> Love it straightens my hair really good doesn&#x27;t take me long at all came early love the product. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it works just as good as a chi</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It is inexpensive and does the job an expensive flat iron would do for have the cost.</li>
    <li> so glad I found this on amazon; i&#x27;ve been using the GHD flat iron for the past 3yrs until it finally died on me last week; attempted to buy a CHI and promptly returned it b/c it felt like a cheap drug store flat iron not to mention to fact the price; was feeling guilty about buying a flat iron when i rarely use it and am planning on getting a digital perm later this year and then i saw the rave reviews on this, loved the price and decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing!  as good if not better than my GHD-- better in that it is technologically more advanced 3 years later w its LCD and temperature control; will definitely recommended to everyone and will plan to get it again when i need another one-- hopefully not for another 3-4yrs</li>
    <li> Glove was very useful and machine works really good. Hair goes shiny in medium temperature in single attempt.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Really makes a difference compared to my old one that I purchased at a department store.  Shipping was right on time.</li>
    <li> Product looks good, but felt headache after using this.</li>
    <li> Great product, came very fast A++</li>
    <li> Tames my super thick curly mane!!</li>
    <li> I like that it really smooth&#x27;s the hair and I don&#x27;t have to get the iron real hot for the end results to come out perfect....if it only didn&#x27;t snag my hair!  is there someway to get a replacement.  As far as the HSI oil, I am totally in love with it.  In fact, I stopped using the products that I had.  It does not weigh the hair down, gives it a lot of shine...totally fabulous.</li>
    <li> I have used Chi and Sedu straighteners my whole life. They both lasted a while, but when my Sedu died, I had a hard time trying to find a new straightener that fit my teacher budget... I saw the reviews for this straightener and really thought it was too good to be true. How can a straightener that is so inexpensive actually be comparable to my past (more costly) straighteners?!&lt;br /&gt;So I bought it, and I. LOVE. IT. This straightener heats up super quickly, my hair stays straight (no frizzes all day), and the rounded edges let me curl my hair super easily if I want! I really did doubt this inexpensive option, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try! It never snags my hair, and it literally takes one swipe down my hair to leave my naturally curly hair straight!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice flat iron package for the price. It is a good replacement for my Chi that finally died. It takes me a little longer but my hair comes out just as nice. I appreciate being able to get a quality product for a nice price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener based on other users reviews.  I had to replace my $200 her styler.  I was very disappointed in the herstyler, barely 4 months old and the plates are cracked and broken in several spots. I bought this one and am ecstatic! It works twice as good as the herstyler that I paid about 4 times as much! It also leaves my hair looking so much smoother than the herstyler.  I am so glad I checked the reviews and bought it. I&#x27;m kinda glad the other one broke because this one makes my hair look so much better. I&#x27;m not even going to fight with getting the warranty on the herstyler that I have to pay yet another $20. Some warranty! I also love the led display.  The herstyler had a dial inside, very hard to adjust the heat and hard to tell what the actual temp it was on. Love this product!  Highly recommended for a lot less money!</li>
    <li> I have been using a GHD for the past 5 years and have been very pleased.  It was just time to get a new flat iron.  I read all the reviews on this flat iron and I thought why not.  First of all I was displeased with how long it takes the flat iron to warm up.  I use the highest heat setting due to the thickness of my hair.  The first pass is always great and then the ceramic plates cool off and are ineffective.  The straightener doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly enough to keep up with my hair.  Needless to say I can only straighten the bangs and front aspect of my hair or else I&#x27;d be spending hours straightening my hair.  I am not pleased with this product and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Works so good. Awesome value. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The temp setting is great, and the different colored lights to show if it&#x27;s on or off is great too.</li>
    <li> It is good just 410F though lower compared to what I bought before which is 420F,but the good thing is  its dual  volts which I can use it for traveling. No complains..</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting but it gets the job done. Just takes a few extra times to go through my hair since its thick.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my daughter &amp; loved it so much I bought another for myself!!</li>
    <li> I owned my first HSI for about two years with no drop in quality and would presumably have kept it forever if I hadn&#x27;t been an idiot and dropped it on a tile floor, causing one of the plates to crack and separate from the rest of the iron. Of course, that&#x27;s my fault, not HSI&#x27;s, so when I went on Amazon and saw that it was still available at the same (ABSURDLY CHEAP) price, I snapped up another one immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron is fantastic - I&#x27;ve owned a ton of flat irons, and this is the best deal you can possibly get. I have a TON of thick, wavy hair and this (set to the highest heat setting) gets the job done in a pleasantly short amount of time, even if I don&#x27;t blow-dry my hair first. It&#x27;s also the first iron I&#x27;ve ever used to create those Lauren Conrad beach waves, and while I now use a curling iron for that style, this works in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this is a powerful, affordable flat iron and I cannot recommend it enough. I hope I don&#x27;t drop this one!</li>
    <li> This straightener holds up to it&#x27;s outstanding reviews.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter.  She selected it and said it does just what it was supposed to do. She&#x27;s really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had my hair straightened by a friend a month ago and purchased this a few weeks later.  It arrived quite quick and I finally had the opportunity to try it out.  I&#x27;ve never straightened by hair before myself, but it was easy to do with this one.  The included glove was great - it helped me to be slightly less afraid of getting burned!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to improving my technique and am very glad to have purchased this HSI straightener!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in March and almost immediately it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, had to hit re-set every time of use, then last time I tried to use it last week, it started sparking and made a loud popping noise and smelled like it almost caught on fire. I only used it on average twice a week and when I tried to return it, it was past the month deadline. Very poor product and poor product support.</li>
    <li> Had my last flat iron for 15 years and I used it at least three times a week. Was going to get another one of the same brand but the price got me shopping around first. Saw this one and all the glowing reviews it had. Thought I would give it a try since the price point was within my budget. I  have naturally curly hair and live at the beach. Doing without a flat iron is NOT an option. Used it yesterday for the first time. My hair was silky and straight and shiny.  So far I have been very very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Aweson flat iron better than CHI and Babyliss I&#x27;m so happy this flat Iron is good for Enviro trataiment I&#x27;m recommended</li>
    <li> Works as expected,  replacing similar model that died after 8 years of loyal service.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I&#x27;m returning the flat iron. The plates do not touch completely and you must apply a ridiculous amount of pressure to make the iron work properly. The plates aren&#x27;t long enough either.  I was replacing a CHI that was left while on vacation, it&#x27;s worked well for years, about 10 or more, so I&#x27;m going back to that.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Iron heats up flat and straighten out long thick hair on one pass thru.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Not my kapak reconstructor. That&#x27;s for sure. But I can&#x27;t help that just have to get us ed to it.</li>
    <li> I do like the iron, a lot. I think my expectations were heightened with the plethora of high reviews, but the iron is Fantabulous. I notice a small reduced time it takes than with my previous iron. Happy customer. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. Leaves my hair beautiful, just the way I like it. It heats up super fast so it&#x27;s ready at a moment&#x27;s notice. I like the heat glove that comes with it. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> The iron works perfectly, which heats up very quickly and gives a smooth finish on my hair. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is the best! I have bought this multiple times (as gifts) and recommended to everyone in the market for a new flat iron. The price is SPOT ON - can&#x27;t believe you can get such a quality for this price! I typically use the flat iron to curl my hair (like curling ribbons, but the flat iron is like the pair of scissors in this scenario) and other flat irons would catch my hair where the plates met the body of the device. This one doesn&#x27;t at all! It glides smoothly through my hair and leaves it shiny and lustrous! Would recommend that you get this one to anyone looking for something new - can&#x27;t beat the price/quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I have thick Asian hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best! I bought it a few years ago and it still works perfectly. I&#x27;m now buying another one for my mom. The supplier is very efficient and cares about customers if you&#x27;re not satisfied. Very good price for the quality and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron specifically for a trip abroad because of the dual voltage capability. When it arrived, I thought I had been sent the wrong model because I didn&#x27;t see a voltage switch as I had on appliances bought in the past. However, upon reading the instructions I learned it worked on both 110 and 220. All I needed to bring was an adapter plug. And I like the iron so much that I am using it now at home all the time. An excellent value.</li>
    <li> Works but not all it is raved out to be.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Gets really hot, reslly fast. Auto off feature is nice too. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mostly satisfied with this purchase.  I feel like I was sent the better model than what I ordered since I don&#x27;t recall paying for the digital model so I appreciate that.  However, my hair gets stuck at the ends of the plates which is the exact reason why I needed a new flat iron.  My previous flat iron has lasted well over 10 years but I decided it was time to find something that my hair didn&#x27;t constantly snag in and that would provide a little shine.  Neither of which is being met by this iron, unfortunately.  Other than that, I really can&#x27;t complain about anything else.</li>
    <li> I would like to just say that I was expecting the worst with this flatiron, in the past I&#x27;ve had negative results my hair is natural and course. So when it arrived I was completely satisfied after trying it out. Now usually it takes me 4hrs to finish but I finish in no time it was nice and sleek silky. Like I said I&#x27;m really satisfied with my product..</li>
    <li> Excelent product!! I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> Takes a while to heat but does a great job</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and it&#x27;s not all what the reviews cracked it up to be. If I didn&#x27;t have such a busy work schedule and about to get married I would attempt to return this. It takes awhile to get my hair actually straight and definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to salon professional quality.</li>
    <li> Had a croc2 for 4 years and loved it. Worked faster and more efficiently than this one, though this is pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> I love my new straightener.  My favorite features are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-digital temperature control&lt;br /&gt;-automatic shut off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great if multiple people are going to use it because you can actually choose how hot you want it.  And if you are forgetful, you don&#x27;t have to worry about if you unplugged it or not.  It works great too.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. My hair stayed straight as well as curled. The Argan oil is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I really liked this one. Ive stopped using them but this one was quality.</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought this item ONLY because of the the number of positive reviews it had on amazon. I am very happy with my purchase, especially for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and leaves my hair smooth,  I usually don&#x27;t even need anything extra to control or style further.</li>
    <li> This flat iron might have the best reviews but it is horrible!!!!!!  It takes forever to get your hair straight and it pulls on your hair .  This product deserves less than 1 star!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this flat iron. It has an evenly distributed heat. Her last flat iron had hot spots that would fry her hair and cause it to break.  Happy Wife, Happy Life. Thanks for caring about quality.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a replacement flat iron and came across this one.  The reviews were good and the price was right, so I gave it a try.  Wow!  Love it!  It is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.  Easy to use, heats up super fast and my hair just glides through.  So glad I took a chance on this one!</li>
    <li> i almost never write reviews but i hope this will SAVE SOMEONE THE TIME AND TROUBLE OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT. You would think from all the rave reviews that this flat iron would be perfect, but no its far from it. I was optimistic even after opening it and realizing how cheaply made it was but the second i ran it through my hair it was obviously no good. This thing pulls my hair like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced!! It even makes an awful sound as it runs through my hair, not to mention it really doesn&#x27;t straighten that well at all. I even tried doing a significantly small amount of hair at a time but no good. Its true what they say, you get what you pay for. I went out the next day and bought a Babyliss titanium flat iron and its beyond perfect.</li>
    <li> my sister straighten all my bridesmaids  hair came out fabulous would definitely recommend this 2ne1 who has hair that needs straightening.</li>
    <li> First time I used it,it wasn&#x27;t that great, after using it a bit its not that bad, gets super hot so be careful</li>
    <li> I went from a straightener that I had used for the better part of 7 years before it stopped powering on. So, I really didn&#x27;t know much about what was on the market for hair straighteners since then. I was expecting to pay around $100 for a decent one when my old one broke. I ended up purchasing this product based on the sheer number of good reviews it had and it&#x27;s great price in comparison to many others on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  During my first use, I noticed that my hair kept getting caught in the plastic casing of the straightener near the ceramic plates. This lessened the more I used it, but it was still annoying and would pull out strands of my hair at times.  Also, during normal use, the plates kept catching on my hair as I would straighten it, leaving creases.&lt;br /&gt;  I played with the temperature settings the first few attempts at using it out of fear of burning my hair, but, eventually, I noticed that it still wouldn&#x27;t keep my hair straight for the duration of my day. Even at it&#x27;s hottest temperature, my hair would end up growing and frizzing awkwardly.  I would just end up putting it in a ponytail by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning this product after a few weeks and purchasing another brand.</li>
    <li> Works very quickly and is great!!</li>
    <li> I recently cut off about 12 inches of my hair and needed to find a smaller flat iron since my current 1.5&amp;#34; plates seemed to be too big for the job. This has a ton of great reviews, I have no idea why. It seemed to heat up just fine but constantly pulled at my hair. I tried holding it differently, squeezing the plates less/more, nothing helped the pulling. I got this last night and will be sending it back today. Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Knowing we were moving to a 220V world, I got this for my wife. Apparently, this one is good because the ceramic part is round at the edges, which makes for good styling if you want. Since it&#x27;s 100-240v, it can go anywhere in the world, so no more burnt out hair devices.</li>
    <li> Hey I have already purchased this product for my cousin and I also wanted one ... When I ordered it said there is a sample argan oil included. But when I opened the box I didn&#x27;t find the oil since I was really looking to try your brand argan oil... So was bit disappointed with that.... Why is that not included ...</li>
    <li> I chuckled when I received the flat iron.  Included was a glove and a twisty thing to keep the cord neat.  On my previous flat iron I always used it with a glove and I used a rubber band to hold the cord in place!  The HSI iron is easy to use and does a great job.  My only two negative comments are that the flat iron is heavy and it is difficult to see and use the adjustment nob for the heat setting.  But these are small problems because the sides stay cool and the iron is easy to use.  I love this HSI flat iron!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this HSI Professional Flat iron ~</li>
    <li> Really, really like this flat iron. The price is perfect and the results are amazing. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is there is some slight pulling when running it through your hair. I&#x27;ve never had that problem with a Chi brand which is HSI&#x27;s closest competitor. I do use it daily for touch ups and the pulling no longer bothers me.</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener so far. The first time I used it, my hair, which is curly/frizzy, had dried naturally after a shower so it was very wavy. I straightened it and it looked just as smooth as when I blow dry my hair before straightening. It gets hot very quickly and works very well. I had been using a cheap straightener before getting this one, and you can definitely tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom and she is in love with it. Good quality for a great price! I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron and love the argan oil!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a Chi like product....this is not it.  I have used lots of different straighteners in my day because I have thick, coarse, curly hair.  The one straightener I&#x27;ve had that works great is the Chi.  Unfortunately in the past 4 years I have had 2 Chi straighteners die on me.  So I was looking for a different product that worked as well and lasted longer than 2 years.  This straightener does not glide as smoothly through my hair and required several more passes to get my hair straight.  And it still didn&#x27;t do as good a job as the Chi straightener does.  You get what you pay for....if your hair doesn&#x27;t need that extra something to get straight...this straightener will probably work great for you....but if your hair is stubborn and doesn&#x27;t like to be straight....it will probably frustrate you like it did me.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to get a less expensive flat iron, as I&#x27;ve tried many before that did not pan out.  This one; however, worked great, like any flat iron three times the price.  I&#x27;d recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works well without drying out my thin colored hair.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE FLAT IRON HAIR.IT WORK VERY GOOD i HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMENDED  IT  TO ALL MY FRIENDS</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got this iron as a gift AFTER the return period ended. With my luck the product was defective (it happens, no big deal) and the seller was extremely helpful and rushed me a new one. My girlfriend loves this iron and highly recommends it. I highly recommend this seller for this and any such item they offer! Great product and Great service!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as other flat irons have.  No body. Not much shine.  Would not by this brand again</li>
    <li> Works great on my medium short hair. Gives me the body I want with a little curl. Would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this after reading all the amazing reviews, but unfortunately mine did not heat up.  I tried multiple outlets and tried resetting it using the red button, but it still did not heat up.  Will be replacing or returning.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic - so easy to use any hair looks like I&#x27;ve been to the hairdresser :)</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI flat iron as a replacement to one I&#x27;d had for years.  It wasn&#x27;t until I started using the HSI flat iron that I realized how inferior my old iron was.  I use to wait for the old iron to heat up and then had to be careful not to pinch my fingers and there was no option for doing curls.  All that is in the past now that I have the HSI flat iron.  This is a quality item that heats up in a flash and is easy to use. I like being able to control the temperature settings, allowing me to use the least amount of heat to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought this specifically to use in Europe and it worked amazingly well! Just be sure to remember your adapter for the outlets.  I would highly recommend to anyone traveling overseas.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the iron and the cost.</li>
    <li> I am super happy with my purchase of this flat iron.  I had been using a cheap $20 hair straightener from Marshalls when I when to visit my parents for a week. While there I used my mothers CHI straightener so that I didn&#x27;t have to pack mine.  I loved it.  I found I got such better results with it.  So I decided to order myself a CHI.  I love amazon, so this was of course the first place I looked, and I immediately came across the HSI PRO.  I read several reviews and decided to order it based mostly on the overwhelming number of 5 star reviews.  I have not been disappointed! Works just like the CHI for 1/3 of the price (I paid $38).  The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was the weight of it.  I could tell immediately the difference between this one and the cheap $20 one I&#x27;d been using.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but I love it and would definitely recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> Nice product, but too heavy. I need a lighter version. I gave it to my daughter &amp; she loved it.</li>
    <li> Curls &amp; straightens fabulously!! Love the craftsmanship of the plates. It protects the hair &amp; glides through hair smoothly. Fantastic price.... This iron is better than previous flat irons bought for $150! Thank you!! : )</li>
    <li> I started looking for a new straightener because my old one smelled like burned hair every time I turned it on. After seeing amazing reviews for this straightener, I researched it for a few days and decided to go ahead and buy it, confident that I had made the right decision. I found out the hard way that every negative review about this product was right! As soon as I turned it on for the first time, it smelled like something was burning. It takes an eternity to heat up, and once it does, the light changes from green back to red constantly, even if it&#x27;s just sitting there. The plates are not of good quality, and my hair catches in the plastic next to the plates and pulls out when I use it. I was really disappointed in this straightener as soon as I opened it up, and I&#x27;ve tried to give it a chance by using it for several months, but honestly this purchase was a mistake. I do not know how this is the #1 straightener on Amazon, unless those of use who have given negative reviews somehow all received a defective product.</li>
    <li> I love the straightener. It is awesome!  I had a problem with the first one and the company replaced it for me with absolutely no hassle. I will definitely buy from them again!!!</li>
    <li> This straight iron snags my hair when I come to the ends and pulls it, causing more split ends. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the second HSI flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased, and I only needed to purchase this one because I dropped the first one and loosened the ceramic plates. While I thought I was just replacing the old one, I got an unexpected upgrade for the same price as the old one: digital temperature dial, instead of the manual one, and easy on/off buttons. This dual-voltage (works abroad with simple adapters) flat iron heats up quickly and leaves hair perfectly straight and shiny. I have loose curly hair, medium coarseness, and this flat iron straightens it perfectly. I have very long hair and a lot of it, it all gets straightened in about 20 minutes. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought this a couple of weeks ago for my daughter who is a newly licensed cosmetologist. She tried it once and hasn&#x27;t touched it since- she said it doesn&#x27;t work well AND it pulls hair. I read so many positive reviews before purchasing, so I guess it is a matter of personal expectations. It is a great price, but maybe not professional quality. I&#x27;m still debating on whether or not to return it- if she isn&#x27;t satisfied with it and not going to use it , ( not even for personal use), then it may be worth the trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  This flat iron is an excellent purchase.  It is a great product for a nice price.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Product works great! The price for this item was very reasonable and it works just as good as the high priced flat irons!!!</li>
    <li> Bought the straightener for my daughter&#x27;s trip to Europe. Had heard stories of other products shorting out.  This one worked well and came at a good price.  No complaints</li>
    <li> It has worked as promised!  Very reliable.</li>
    <li> Works great my wife loves it</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this flat iron. Great price!</li>
    <li> I have tried a ton of flat irons before and ma not a very good hair dresser for my own hair but this iron makes it so easy. iI has just the perfect size for hair (thick and wavy), you can adjust heat to your likeness, it also comes with a nice glove that saves you from excess heat, and a sample of argan oil which is my favorite... I love this one and am going to keep it for a very long time.. Very durable and really classy looking as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent, fast service and a perfect product.</li>
    <li> A++Very happy with my flat iron!</li>
    <li> The product works very well.  It is a pleasure to use it and the direction booklet was quick and easy to get started.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever seen! My hair is thick and long and this product made my hair gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This was a gift, but I own the same model and love it.</li>
    <li> I have flat iron which I paid $150.00 doesn&#x27;t do anything to my thick curly hair but this HSI which I only paid $35.00 does all the magic and now I have a best hair everyday:)</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 3 months and it works great. Great price, love the travel bag, and the oil is great too!</li>
    <li> This product is really good manufactured , easy to use , with very reasonable price ,less than 50$ , really my wife asked me to buy her one from Braun ,  but I searched about another one because of the high price for Braun , found HSI with great review ,  I recommand this for all</li>
    <li> So far I love this flat iron works better then my previous one, less time straightening.</li>
    <li> I like this item, it just takes me a long time to dry my hair so I can use it.</li>
    <li> I expected the item to have a higher-quality feel and performance based on the rave reviews I read.  But, it works fine.  I didn&#x27;t have the time to try a lot of them, so for the price this seems like a decent deal.  As I said, I&#x27;m not wowed, but its okay.  It seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> Ordered this flat iron to use on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair. I needed something that would not damage her hair, but yet smooth it out. This iron works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love the hair straightener. Wonderful product and thanks for the Argan oil sample</li>
    <li> It is great, not just the price, it works as a professional!!! I loved and I recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I would prefer the Herstyler or flat irons.  I thought that if I pay a few more dollars that I would get a better product. I was wrong! These don&#x27;t get as hot and are simply not better than the Herstyler which I broke after a few good drops on hard floor. Tried something new because of the other reviews and now regret it!</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this flat iron. I had the Sephora Tourmaline Flat Iron and thought it was good enough. But then I used this and saw a big difference! Heats up in a flash, and really minimizes frizz as well. So happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE! I have never wrote a review in my life but feel as if I had to express how much I am loving this flat iron. Far exceeds my expectations. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Not a day to day user. Works good when I do use it. I have wavy, shoulder lenth, thin hair, so it only takes me about 10-15 min to straighten or style.</li>
    <li> This feels cheap. It seems to work okay though.</li>
    <li> This iron is the best flat iron I have ever purchased. My hair is left silky straight after every use, and does not feel stripped  at all!  This iron is an investment you&#x27;ll be happy you made.</li>
    <li> Took it to South  with me to use for the summer and it worked great.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot for the price.. can&#x27;t really give it a 5 star review as I haven&#x27;t used it enough to honestly categorize it as that.</li>
    <li> Nice iron.  Excellent quality and highly recommend this.  It allows you to select the temperature!</li>
    <li> fantastic product love it!! works great and got here super fast!</li>
    <li> I have owned a flat iron for years but never seemed to get my hair as smooth as the salon. This iron is wonderful,  light weight with salon results.</li>
    <li> Works very well, and has great value.</li>
    <li> Purchased item and took it to daughter in Costa Rica as a gift. She loves it!</li>
    <li> It does not have a smooth glide over your hair; leaves it frizzy. It takes multiple times before actually working. I would not recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> Love the automatic turn off, size and 420 degrees output. Works great for my thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> I was afraid even to try to use a flat iron while traveling (I could just imagine my hair burning up). This flat iron worked beautifully with an adapter when I was traveling in Israel. The order also arrived quickly, so I had no last-minute worries about whether or not I would have it in time.</li>
    <li> Happy with it. Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> shipping was fast. Product works like a dream to tame the chaos that is my hair!</li>
    <li> Great product and I love the fact that it is dual voltage as I live overseas and travel back to the States regularly.  It shipped quickly and reached me in Australia in a little over a week.</li>
    <li> This straightener is awesome! Naturally my hair is frizzy and curly and the HSI straightener works perfectly, leaving my hair silky smooth! It also plays as a good curling iron for beachy waves. After about twenty minutes it will turn off, but I like this feature because I have been known to sometimes forget to turn it off.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well.  I&#x27;m used to my old one that opens slightly more but this works just fine, just need some time to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that there was a bit more static electricity in my hair during and after using the straightener.  Other than that, the build quality is great and feels nice in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a test/reset plug so I cannot plug it into my wall outlet at the same time as my blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! I have very thick hair, and I sometimes have trouble with thinner hair straighteners, as they don&#x27;t seem to pack the punch that I need to style my hair. But this one does. I honestly feel so beautiful when I use this, because my hair is shiny and looks professionally styled. I even curl my hair with this straightener, which is incredibly easy in comparison to other straighteners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re debating between this product and the CHI straighteners, get this one. It&#x27;s cheaper, it&#x27;s higher quality, and the company takes great care in their customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the little travel bag this came with too, and the argan oil sample is lovely!</li>
    <li> I am not very good with my hair, it works great!</li>
    <li> I was so worried about not having a flat iron that would work on our trip to Africa.  This iron converted to 220 volts and worked like a charm.  I would highly recommend this to anyone traveling to another country.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! After washing and blow drying my hair I used this flat iron and my hair was so bouncy ALL DAY LONG! I got so many comments on my hair and it dos not smell burnt at all like it did with my old flat iron. I also used the Aegean oil before blow drying and before flat ironing and my hair was just perfect all day! Love this iron!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  I would buy again or for a gift!</li>
    <li> This one is little bulky than I the one I had used earlier.Still getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Everything was as advertised and my girlfriend absolutely loves the straightener.  This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I like that this unit has smaller plates and seems to handle well. I have very fine, straight hair, but this flat iron does the job of smoothing the fly aways and styling.</li>
    <li> This over heats. I am returning it! It&#x27;s an awful product.</li>
    <li> Needed a travel flat iron, and at this price it seemed I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Turns out I like it better than my CHI that was 3x the price, so after returning from europe/asia this is the only flat iron I have used.</li>
    <li> Love, love this flat iron. And using the HSI argon oil with it makes my hair amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I have difficulty straightening my own hair but the size and weight combined with the fact that it works quickly make it so much easier. I still struggle a bit with the back of my own hair but with this I can do it.  I couldn&#x27;t do  it at all with other stylers.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. The plates glide through my hair and leave it silky smooth. It is lightweight and easy to hold. It heats up within seconds and the heat is evenly distributed throughout the plates. The price of this straightener is unbelievable for how great the quality of this product is.</li>
    <li> I have really thick wavy hair ...I had a really expensive, nice CHI straightener ( paid $150 for it). Had it a few years and I dropped it &amp; broke it. Out of desperation I ordered this straightener ( because it had good reviews &amp; I didn&#x27;t have $$$ to buy another CHI at moment). I&#x27;m PLEASANTLY surprised at how good this one is!! I live in Tennessee - super hot/humid this time of year &amp; I NEED this. Highly recommend - can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> My sister had this straightener and I borrowed it for many months before i moved out, but I loved it so much that I went and bought the exact same one. Has high heat settings so it works for my thick wavy-ish hair. It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair!!! Huge plus for me ! I&#x27;m pretty sure my sister got her hsi straightener at a mall kiosk for over $100 so I thought this was an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this flat iron for a few months now and love it.  It&#x27;s very consistent with it&#x27;s heating and does a great job everytime.  The size is great for traveling too!</li>
    <li> Worked very well with an adapter while in Paris and London. Heated quickly, and worked efficiently on my thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great straightener, heats up fast and works great on my hard to straighten hair. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very good quality.  Arrived on time and in excellent shape.  Kudos to Blue Novelties.</li>
    <li> My herstyler flat iron broke so I bought this to replace it although I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be as good as that one especially because it gets 50 degrees hotter than this one. But surprisingly I think this hsi iron is way better thany old one. The only con would be the first couple times I used it it smelled but it&#x27;s gone away now and that&#x27;s usually the case with ceramic irons anyways.</li>
    <li> Worked great while in Europe!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Bought it for my wife and she is very happy with the quality. I recommend using this company and product.</li>
    <li> Excellent iron, and priced right. I have been using it for 3 years daily, and my hair is in great shape and the product is holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed with this item. It&#x27;s as good as a other big name brand flat iron I had in the passed.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter, she LOVES it.  It came with a glove and a bottle of oil; also delivery sure was fast, I was afraid it would not make it in time for her birthday but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair with body and a shiny texture.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Smells good too, although as other reviewers say, it doesn&#x27;t lather much at all due to lack of sulfates I suppose.  It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s a good product so I recommend it if you can swing it.</li>
    <li> Great straightener but I didn&#x27;t get my argon oil :(</li>
    <li> This is a great tool that works just as well as my other $100 straightener. My ONLY complaint is that the handle gets hot however they include a glove to help with that. I purchased this to use on a trip to the UK later this year, so time will tell if the dual voltage works as promised. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> My daughters love it!  Said it makes their hair feel soft and shiny and is quicker than other straighteners.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife. She was looking for a new straightener and this was a great price for the value. She has only used it a couple of times, because she is waiting to cut her hair, but overall the times she has used it, it seems to work great.</li>
    <li> Love this straighter! Only complaint is that it says the outside doesn&#x27;t get hot but it does.</li>
    <li> They work wonderful and they came on time, I love everything about them.</li>
    <li> Great Iron, paid $38 on Amazon and it&#x27;s much better than the much pricier CHI I had.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, and ended up using it myself. It works better than my $100 straightener.</li>
    <li> item was exactly as described</li>
    <li> Very good value.  I was about to spend the money on a Chi, then saw all of the awesome reviews for this product.  Once I saw the price it was an easy decision.  I&#x27;ve only had it for two weeks...so far so good!</li>
    <li> Heats up ridiculously quick and holds the heat well. I use this iron daily for my bangs, and it has worked well when I do decide to straighten my whole head of hair. Very happy with this purchase, and I hope that it lasts for several years.</li>
    <li> Comes with a great traveling case, gets super hot and flattens hair razor straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron specifically to bring to England and Ireland because I heard bad things about trying to use a voltage converter on flat irons. It works perfectly (I&#x27;m in England now).  It heats up well and works as well as my Sedu that I use at home.  I am using the UK adapter with it that is the #1 Amazon seller, I think it&#x27;s $5.99 or $6.99.  If you need a flat iron for Europe, this is a nice, inexpensive one that works well.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on a recent trip to London.  I used it with an adapter and had no problems.  It heats up fast and gets really hot.  Did a good job straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after all the good reviews but its not that great. It does the job but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth like the expensive ones. Might be worth spending the extra money if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
    <li> After years of having damaged hair and using 2 sub-par flat irons to get the job done I finally bit the bullet and splurged on a professional iron. Doing research on HSI VS. CHI I decided to go with the HSI because it seemed to get just as rave reviews but for half of the price. I had used CHI once before and was very impressed but still went with the HSI for the price value. No regrets. Heats up super fast and straightens my hair without any tangles/snags or other issues like add static friction or frizziness. I spray my brush with a straightening heat protector product (Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray), brush through my hair, part it then straighten with the iron. The spray protects my hair and also works with the iron to add a very nice shine and not damage any of the moisture in my hair. The only complaint I have about this flat iron is that there is no timer or automatic shut-off function for it- this would be very helpful as it heats up to very high temps and there have been a few times I&#x27;ve left and forgotten to turn it off because my last flat iron had that feature. Other than that, I love this product and hope it lasts me for a while.</li>
    <li> It drags over the hair, creating way more friction than I anticipated for such a high-rated item. Very disappointed. Good thing it was only $40.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure if I even wanted to give this product 3 stars and was considering giving it only 2. I did not like the way the heat was controlled and did not glide smoothly over my hair. I preferred the chi that I used to have.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter! She has curly frizzy hair and this straightens fast and smooth! Would recommend to anyone looking!</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular, decent straightener for the price. Occasionally snags hair. Fell in love with the argan oil that came with it, though. My hair is super healthy looking now; even my beautician commented on how healthy it looks.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughters.  They both love it and use it frequently.  I see masses of curls on which ever one decides she wants them for the day.</li>
    <li> I actually like the Remington that I purchased better than this one.  Hair does not glide well and it tends to pull.  I should really send this one back.  I wish I would not have purchased.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law wanted this flat iron as a Christmas gift and she told me that she really loved it.</li>
    <li> I was sure we could find a flat iron that performed to our expectations without having to pay $$$.  We&#x27;ve only had this machine for a couple of weeks but so far I love it!  I have one daughter with a head full of long, thick, hair with a lot of natural body.  A flat iron purchased at a box store didn&#x27;t do a thing for it.  She can achieve the same results our stylist gets her in a short amount of time.  I also have a pre-teen with much finer hair and I love that I can adjust the temp and not risk damaging her fine (but curly) hair.  We are VERY pleased and I see myself buying a second one to keep all three heads happy!</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for. Works great heats up quickly and does an amazing job with my hard to manage hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter received it as a gift for Christmas and she loves it. She said it works better than any others she&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> my daughter liked it, I boughted for her. Quick to iron. It looks sturdy and easy to handle. Thanks for your service. I recommended it for those who wants to straightens their hair .</li>
    <li> Great straightener!!  I have thick corse hair that took forever to straighten unt I bought this one!  It has cut my time in half!  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! It makes my hair feel so smooth, it looks shiny, and it does a great job straightening my hair in a short amount of time. I have thick wavy hair so this is fantastic! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> When holds heat it&#x27;s amazing!!! However, mine does not keep constant heat . Really sucks bc it would be amazing</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price and performance, ironically with first use I put the temp to the max 420 &amp; it was too hot my tightly coiled black hair, which was surprising because previous flat irons didn&#x27;t even get it straight unless I used it on the max! Great product for black hair!</li>
    <li> This straightener works very well.  I have used  other units and found this to work quicker with less damage to hair. Unit heats quickly. Vendor was prompt with excellent packaging</li>
    <li> Flat iron works great! Way better than the ones you get for the same price at Target or Walmart! I don&#x27;t know much about the difference between  professional iron versus a standard one but this one definitely does a better job than the previous one I owned, similar to the one my hair stylist uses.</li>
    <li> This straightener was on sale for $30 or $40 and it was well worth that price. However, I do not think it is worth the list price of $200.  It does a good job straightening my hair but sometimes my hair gets caught under the plate and pulls, which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Works great, light weight. Only negative is that it does not have auto shut-off. Also be careful not to drop.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s the job done! Great straightener. Would buy again and have recommended to friends. Heats up fast. No automatic shut off though.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this HSI flat iron.  She has thick hair and finds this HSI Pro easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the flat iron. I am a male with long hair and it really got the job done. Furthermore, the females who do my hair were also pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because it had so many good reviews. Maybe the one she got was defective. The issue is that the ceramic pads did not line up horizontal to one another. The farthest end (tip) connected first and you need to squeeze it tight to get them to lie flat together. But if you squeeze a little bit the hair gets pinched at the end. She does have fine hair. perhaps this isn&#x27;t an issue for people with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with my new hair straightener.  It does exactly what it is suppose to-- straighten my hair.  It leaves my hair shiny with no split ends.</li>
    <li> Bought this straigtner from Amazon because I could not find the CHI I had before. I bought this one because is was highly rated and a best seller and same price as my CHI. Took forever to be delivered arrived on the 15th instead of the 11th and when you don&#x27;t have a back up straightner it feels like forever. I went and purchased a cheap one at Walmart til it arrived and even that one works better than the HSI! The packaging is nice and I like the glove but have never needed one. The ceramic pulls hair and makes it staticy. Was very dissapointed and am sending it back and will order a CHI from a different site.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant on ordering this straightener based on the reviews and being I have always used high end straightener. BUT I was greatly surprised. This straightener works better than my CHI did and is less damaging. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE  this flat iron, I love it so much I had to buy it twice....I have very thick hair and this flat iron leaves straight and soft.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas because she wanted a straightening iron and I wanted to get her a decent one at a decent price. I have NO experience with these products because I do not straighten my hair, however it seems to work very well. Heats up quickly and straightens well. The temperature control is not all that easy to use because it is on the inside of the tool. Also, it only shows the highest and lowest temps with no marks or numbers in between. But I just put it somewhere in the middle and it seems to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it was well priced and well rated and it seems like it was a good purchase. I&#x27;d certainly recommend it to people who are willing to spend over $100 on a product like this. I paid about $40 for this one and it looks like that price is often available on this product.</li>
    <li> Did not come with Argan oil as advertised, only came with glove. Light keeps going to red after it has turned green. Maybe this has something to do with why it doesn&#x27;t get very hot. Wish I had not given credence to the good reviews.</li>
    <li> This tool is more gentle on the hair than other straighteners I&#x27;ve used, and even at lower heat, works very well. My hair feels silky without any additional product.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a CHI and FHI; both burned out in under a year. I&#x27;ve had my HSI for almost two years and it still works like a charm! I love the smooth edges which allow me to straighten and curl simultaneously. It even works wonders on my sister&#x27;s course hair. I definitely recommend this flatiron!</li>
    <li> love it it staightens my hair with no problem whats so ever heats up fast u wont have to go to shop again</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my teen daughter, whose first hair iron broke, and she absolutely LOVES this one! Great quality and service! We are very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought it during Black Friday and it was amazing! But, now it&#x27;s April and it can barely hold heat. Was good while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It does everything very well.  Love the adjustable heat for my fine thin hair!</li>
    <li> smooth surface to straighten hair, doesn&#x27;t grab or pull hair, heats up quickly and makes my hair very straight!  My husband purchased this as a gift for me based on it&#x27;s fantastic reviews and he made a fantastic choice!</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  purchased to use for travel.  I have a Chi and this is as good.</li>
    <li> Very Good quality and good lower price than found in stores.  Works very good on smoothing out long hair with natural curl.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, love the straightener. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is second one I have bought.  This one for my wife who has been using my daughters since her old iron quit working, not this one by the way.  They both love this flat iron.  See old review below so nothing has changed since Christmas 2013.  A great purchase.  I bought this for my 13 year old daughter as Christmas present and she loves it!!  Would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love the flat irons. They came on time and they work perfectly. They heat up fast and glides through easily. I live that the flat irons came with free argon oil and also a glove to protect from the heat.. The packaging was perfect as well.</li>
    <li> I had been considering purchasing one of these for a couple years and when I researched them this model was one of the best.  And now I know why.  It is terrific and I got it super quick and for a good price.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with the first product I received, the plates were not very smooth, but they sent me a new one in days. That&#x27;s great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;My replacement is the Elite model and it heats up quickly and the plates are nice and smooth, which is perfect for my needs right now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old for Christmas; she wanted a new straightener and wanted something &amp;#34;expensive.&amp;#34;  I bought this and she loves it!!  She is able to get her hair done quickly and easily.  Would recommend this to someone who straightens their hair just about every day like she does.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters who are 14 and 16 with really long hair. They love this iron so much more than their old one and their hair looks much better too.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! Began my search under the impression I was going to purchase a Chi but after reading reviews, decided to give this one a try. Glad I did!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is wonderful.  I love that it is ceramic and has 3 functions.  The iron is very easy to use and I will be ordering one for my sister for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flat iron.  Shipping was quick and the packaging was very secure.</li>
    <li> I am not really happy with this flat iron.  I tried using it a handful of times and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to even straighten my thick and curly hair.  I had to go back to my old flat iron since this one doesn&#x27;t work for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> works just as good as a flat iron which costs 3 times as much!</li>
    <li> Was VERY skeptical in buying one of these things when it was only 40 bucks ... seems like the only way to get a good one of these according to her is to pay 100 plus bucks on a good one ... well after looking at what this things has side by side with the other ones out there this one seemed to have all the bells and whistles that the more expensive ones had so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;She has a basic 30 dollar flat iron from like target and has for a while and said this thing is WAY better and is Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;So hopefully it last a long time ... if so this thing is a STEAL at 40 bucks for what you get in return .</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener.  I have been using it for about one month and its a really nice tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Long cord so you dont have to be right next to the outlet&lt;br /&gt;-rounded edges make for perfect curls at the end&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable temperature variation&lt;br /&gt;-Heat pouch to stuff the iron in when done and traveling.  Also good for protecting the iron.&lt;br /&gt;-Clear light to show heating and ready&lt;br /&gt;-The setup ensures that my hair doesnt get stuck under the plates or anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None</li>
    <li> This is my second HSI purchase, i love the product totally :) It came on time as well :)</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I don&#x27;t always keep up on the new beauty products that come out.  I was having trouble with split ends on my bangs and, after reading the reviews that mentioned how this flat iron helped with split ends, thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Greatly surprised and very happy that it solved my problem.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very smooth transaction. Product arrived quicky and was exactly as described. I am so haapy with this product. It straightens my hair quicky and holds all day. My hair feels silky smooth with the argon oil that came with it.</li>
    <li> This is the second HSI flatiron I have owned and I love it.  It is lightweight, heats to a good temperature and travels easily.  I especially like the pouch that came with this one as sometimes when leaving a hotel, it is still a bit hot and I used to have to wrap it in a washcloth.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  Not only does this heat up quick but it works as a faster pace than my old one.  My hair is straight in almost half the time.  Love this.  So glad I decided on this one.</li>
    <li> Love it. It heats up in about 5 seconds ands sleek and powerful!</li>
    <li> This flat iron does the job very well. The price was great. It arrived quickly too. I used the packet of argan oil on my last trip. Came in handy.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent flattening iron.  It is well made and has worked better than any other that I have used. I would recommend this specific iron if looking for one.  Amazingly priced too!</li>
    <li> Wanted to get my mom something nice for Christmas, and she said this worked well for her. Can&#x27;t complain with that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair flat iron. I have used it a handful of times and definately notice the difference in quality from my prior cheaper flat iron.</li>
    <li> My hair is shiny and I like this flat iron. I would recommend it. Doesn&#x27;t burn and has perfect temperature for the hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron. And on top of everything it was sent really fast, just when I really needed it..</li>
    <li> Seller was great. I give the HSI flat iron 4 stars.  I bought this as a replacement for my Solia flat iron that finally gave out after 3 years of daily use. The HSI is good but I think my Solia was a lot better. (Of course I did pay almost 3x as much for the Solia.) It heats up quickly and does a good job at straightening my hair. The reason for the 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide through my hair as smoothly as my Solia.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes of a professional grade flat iron but feel a bit disappointed. It never really gets hot and I&#x27;m constantly fighting with it to straighten my hair. I have to go over the same piece 4 or more times before it actually works and I have the thing set to the highest setting. Also, it&#x27;s heavy in comparison to other flat irons. All in all, it&#x27;s usable but I wish I had gone with a different flat iron.</li>
    <li> Love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife for xmas,  she says it works great ,  has good temperature , and is easy to use</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!  It makes my hair much smoother and shinier.  I had an instyler before this and it stopped working properly in less than a year.  I think you get the same kind of results from this flat iron, if not better, and it costs much less.  It also takes less time to get my hair done. I would recommend  the HSI Professional flat iron to anyone looking for a great hair styling tool.</li>
    <li> The ceramic iron was delivered quickly. It was boxed as shown - unfortunately for me, somehow I ended up buing this iron rather than the hot tools iron I meant to buy. Not one for shipping back, I decided to go with it and see how it worked. It is OK. Not as good as the ones used in salons, but not bad either. It does this thing with lighting up to green when hot enough, but quickly changes back to red while styling.... might be in the (thrown away) instructions, but I didn&#x27;t look. I think for the price it is fine, but next time I will pay a bit more and get a hot tools one or CHI.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I should have purchased this in a bigger size because it makes my fine hair freez and feel a little too much like straw on the ends..however this item isn&#x27;t the worst hot iron I&#x27;ve used..I also liked how it came on time and was exceptionally delivered well.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and my daughter had to have one too! Better than my CHI!!! Highly recommend. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this flat iron. It was a little different to get used to, but by a couple of days I got the hang of it and it was wonderful for my hair. I love how it just does what you want it to do as you pull your hair through it. I also love that my hair maintains it&#x27;s look throughout the day. You do have to be careful about how hot it is and not to burn your fingers. I would recommend this hot iron to anyone!</li>
    <li> I loved this flat iron!!! I took it home when I went for a visit and my mom tried it and loved it as well.  I ended up giving her mine and ordering myself another one.  It does a terrific job and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair damaged.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for my travel to Europe.  The iron gets hot enough for my hair and does not pull or catch hair in the irons. The long cord makes it nice to use where the plugs are closer to the floor in my bedroom.  I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter to replace a different brand that stopped working.  She said she is able to do her hair much more quickly with this which is good because she is always running late in the morning!</li>
    <li> I was trying to get away with not buying an expensive hair iron and I got what I paid for.  My last iron cost about $80 and when I started using it, it was so hot I could barely touch my hair.  Probably not healthy, but one swipe worked miracles.  3 years later it&#x27;s not as hot and not working well, so I ordered this one.  This one is just not hot enough.  It would take me forever to iron my hair straight.  Bummer, have to return it.</li>
    <li> this it the best flat iron i have every had work fast and easy make you hair look like a million bucks</li>
    <li> My 14 year old straightens her hair weekly and has raved about this flat iron over the ones her friends have. This was a solid buy,</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be great, I think its ok. I mean, I havent made my hair often but the few times I got it done I could noticed it wasnt as I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It&#x27;s easy to handle and produces great styling results. Heats up quickly and can be used as a curler or a straightener.</li>
    <li> Great product bought one for me and one for my mother back in Europe, she uses it perfectly .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have thin brittle hair.  I go through flat irons faster than I probably should have to.  This is a SOLID flat iron.  Good quality.  My hair loves it.  Runs through smoothly.  Great grip.  Feels good in my hand.  It straightened my hair very quickly.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought a Chi flat iron from Costco maybe 5 years ago and the cord shorted out.  I was looking for a replacement and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.  I like that this one has the adjustable heat but I set it near the high end and haven&#x27;t touched it since.  I have lots of fine hair that tends to frizz.  This iron seems to not pull through my hair as easily as the Chi but it definitely gets the job done.  I usually use this when my hair is dry but tried with damp hair the other day and it was pretty amazing.  I would purchase again but hope it will last a few good years.  No problems with the cord or anything else.  Oh, the heat safe bag it comes with is great.  I used to iron in the morning and head off to work while the iron cooled and then put away when I got home.  No need with the little bag and I should have bought the heat safe bag years ago.  4 stars due to the pull through the hair not being as smooth as the Chi.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this straighten because I accidentally dropped the first one and it broke. I am very careful with my straighteners as they are very important to me but just today mine fell off the counter (onto carpet) because the twisty cord always makes it turn on its side (and today slip off) and the plates broke again on this one! I&#x27;m not saying straighteners should be completely fall proof but my chi has accidentally fallen too and I&#x27;ve had it longer and it&#x27;s still going strong. They need to either fix the twisting cord (It is so twisted and I can never seem to untwist it) or somehow make the plates a little more durable. I&#x27;ve wasted $80 on this stupid straightener!!! I&#x27;m going back to Chi because their product lasts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but think you should know what you are buying.  First let me say I  expect electronic products to last longer than one year.  I look for quality and usually pay for it.  The reviews on this product were very high when I purchased this.  But short after one year with 4 xs a week usage the  product began to short out. You constantly have to flip the  RFi button for it to remain on.  It seemed to be shorting out.  I would recommend if you want a throw away product, produced in China  buy it , otherwise consider better quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Flat Iron on November 11, 2013  and expected to have a working tool for at least a few years. I have only used it limited times since November (maybe 5 times as my hair stylist advises staying away from the flat iron). My return window closed on January 31, 2014. I am very disappointed and will not be purchasing this product or any product from this company again.</li>
    <li> Not as fantastic as the reviews indicate; I find it doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly, and it takes a few extra passes to get the desired result. Thankfully, I got a really good deal on it, I would have been mad if I&#x27;d paid full price.  I bought a travel size Herstyler straightener for just a little less (also a great deal), which worked much better--had I not accidentally broken it, I&#x27;d still be using that one.</li>
    <li> So I had a cheap straightener that I bought in a strip mall drug store/beauty supply store when I was in college. It worked great. Straightened my longish, fine wavy hair including my tempermental cowlick and all those frustrating baby hairs around your face and could handle the humidity of Virginia. 12 years later it just didn&#x27;t work one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I read up and decided that THIS was going to be a major upgrade. Au contraire, mes amis. This takes way longer to straighten and my hair stays straight for a few hours. I have no kink or even curl to fight. I live in calm, cool weather. This puppy sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using it to kink in some beach waves (what SHOULD be a perk to a one inch iron!) and that was a COMPLETE fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second star for the fact that it does straighten it in the first place. Minus three stars for generally sucking otherwise.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, came with all the advertised freebies. Have had no issues with it. Its very quick to heat up - maybe wait 30 seconds to 1minute until that red indicator light turns green, and I would use this time to get my hair ready to straighten. The heat adjustment is great, haven&#x27;t smelled &amp;#34;burning hair&amp;#34; with this product. Its definitely a great contender with the GHD that I used to have.  The cloth bag is very useful - you can put your hot straightener straight into the bag.  I would recommend this to everyone. Sometimes hair gets caught somewhere, but I think that&#x27;s just me and my (lack of) skills in straightening.</li>
    <li> Create Flat Iron. It  gets super hot and straightens my hair nicely. I recommended this iron.</li>
    <li> Impressed! My hair never smells burnt with this straightener and that makes me smile! The price is just an added bonus! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, price, and service.</li>
    <li> Loved my new straightener.  My hair is considered fine but I have a lot of hair.  My complaint was that I always looked like a had &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34;.  This straightener leaves my hair very smooth. My daughter uses this one also.  She has thick and much more coarse hair and she thinks it is the best unit we have had.  I would recommend this product for almost any hair type.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve had at this price. I haven&#x27;t had a chi to compare it to but ice had other $40 straighteners and this one is superior! Even comes with the carrying bag. Love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Straightens hair perfectly. Best straighter that I have purchased in a long time. Reasonably priced product. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> Love it! Works like a pro. Not buying cheapo ones from the drugs store anymore. Heats up quickly and works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron. My old one would pull hair out, but these plates are so seamless and smooth that I have not yank one hair out yet! And the adjustable heat allows me to set the right temp, rather than frying my hair on the high heat setting that my old iron did. Plus for the cost, this work just as good as the $170 iron I was borrowing from a friend for a while.</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect when I ordered this, but I have naturally wavy hair that just does not do what I want it to do!  The iron works beautifully to shape my hair the way I want it to go, and the effect seems to last.  Perfect.  Plus - Service from the seller, Blue Novelties, was perfect.  It arrived sooner than I had expected, in perfect condition.  I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have very little to compare it to.....</li>
    <li> I use this along with the argon ail and it is amazing.  I can straighten my hair in 5 minutes with this iron and I have long hair.  The best flat iron I have purchased to date.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and works great. I replaced an old flat iron that I&#x27;d had for years and am impressed at how effective the HSI one is! I have, thick, wavy hair, but this does a good job of smoothing it down as long as I make sure to get every bit of my hair in there.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Wish it got hotter.</li>
    <li> im professional hair stylist and i absolutely love this iron. its not so heavy, very comfortable for hand and i can regulate temperature on this iron , its important because different people have different hairs. I will recommend this stuff to my friend for sure</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!  Love love love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! It glides smoothly down my hair, heats up fast, and gets my hair straight. I love that it lights up to let you know when it&#x27;s hot enough. It&#x27;s a great value for the price, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the awesome reviews on it and am very impressed! It heats up quickly and has a great design that makes it wasy to grip. It really does an amazing job straightening my hair and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it becoming frizzy later.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  This ceramic iron comes with a lovely carry case to protect it when in suitcase or storing, love that it comes with a hand protection glove to avoid burning myself, the unit is easy to use, easy to change temperatures, and glides on the hair.  Lovely.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s b&#x27;day and she opened it today and the bottle of oil was empty and it&#x27;s soaked in the carrying case. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Probably he best flat iron i have ever had and the hottest&lt;br /&gt;i literally have zero complaints about this prodcut</li>
    <li> I ended up coughing up the additional $$ for a Paul Mitchell after returning this. Nothing on the seller - seller was great. I just tried to obtain something cheaper and find that it pulled my hair. I don&#x27;t need to split off any more considering I flat iron my hair every day. I do not have this issue with the two Paul Mitchell ones I have. I would have loved to save some $$ but in this case I needed to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/9/14 Update&lt;br /&gt;The seller contacted me and am really impressed on how much they wanted to rectify the situation. Unfortunately I have already purchased the Paul Mitchell replacement. Again, seller was great, and continues to be great. It was simply the product that did not perform to my expectations or satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Great product would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and does a great job straightening my hair.  Easy to use and the bonus oil and pouch are a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Works well just not amazed by it. Comparable to my old one that cost about the same as this one.&lt;br /&gt;However I do love the free sample of oil.</li>
    <li> great deal for a really nice straightener! nice carrying pouch and it comes with some argan oil too. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this product has hit a homerun for us!</li>
    <li> Aloha...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased 3 HSI professional irons and would highly recommend this product &amp; seller! Outstanding service, fast delivery, professionally packaged &amp; great product @ an affordable price! It&#x27;s nice to know that there are still reputable companies out there that actually deliver on their promise/claims! THANKS HSI FOR BEING ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES!&lt;br /&gt;Mahalo&lt;br /&gt;JY</li>
    <li> Great product!  Fiance loves it.  Travel case is great.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and just right.  Price was perfect for this item.</li>
    <li> Great service--the flat iron arrived very promptly. I have only used it once, and I&#x27;ve been pleased, although it doesn&#x27;t seem as smooth as my Chi iron. I bought this for a trip I&#x27;m taking to Europe in a couple of weeks, so I&#x27;m hoping that I don&#x27;t have any problems with the voltage--I&#x27;ve already lost two flatirons due to voltage problems while traveling abroad.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  The iron heats up quickly and leaves hair straight and smooth. It comes with a useful storage bag.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt recommend it for thick curly/wavy hair. The effect also doesnt last too long.</li>
    <li> I love this iron, my hair is very curly and with this iron my hair is beautiful all the time...</li>
    <li> Having been blessed/cursed with wavy hair all my life this isn&#x27;t my first flat iron but this will definitely be the last time I buy an HSI product. I was looking to replace my faithful Solia flat iron that I have had for 5 years and which in the last few months had been needing higher temps on it to get the desired result (385F). Looking at the great reviews on this flat iron and considerably lower price I decided to go with HSI. I just got it in the mail today and decided to try it. My true test of a flat iron is how quickly it is able to flatten out my hair when its dry and give a great finish, however since I had washed my hair i decided to go the more traditional route of using it on towel and blow dryer dried  but still moist hair (usually the best results and the quickest). I turned it to 385 F (an estimation since the dial has only two reference point 140F and 400F) let it heat up until the indicator turned green and started using it. By the time my hand had started cramping 5 minutes later i had only done the front 2 inches of my shoulder length hair. I switched over to my Solia which did the rest of my hair as easily as it always has and am returning this one immediately. This is the fastest I have EVER returned anything on Amazon. So don&#x27;t waste your time and money because what you save on money for the iron you&#x27;ll shell out in buying wrist splints and Ibuprofen for the cramping</li>
    <li> The problems I had with this flat iron are all in the design. The way the heating element is set into the iron make the corners prone to trapping and snagging hair, at least fine hair like mine. Additionally, the location of the temperature knob is such that once the iron is hot it is difficult to change the setting while keeping your fingers clear of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Travel Sized Argon oil&amp;#34; is actually just a small single use sample bag, not what is pictured. The &amp;#34;free glove&amp;#34; is a joke.</li>
    <li> I have very curly thick hair. I have tried about 4 different brands of hair irons and a hair comb iron. This is the first hair iron to smooth my curls out with ease. I tried it on the lowest heat setting first and then worked my way up and found it works best at the highest setting on my hair. I was hoping it would after reading some reviews. Feels good that I wouldn&#x27;t spend much time TRYING to straighten my hair anymore...</li>
    <li> I dont know why this was rated so high on Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t get nearing hot enough and after I straighten my hair it looks very frizzy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about getting this straightener because of all the great reviews, but didnt find it to be that great. It may just be that my hair is far to gone lol. I was expecting it to really make it super straight an shiny but that&#x27;s not the case it does the same job my 10 yr old cheap straightener did. It does heat up quick an I like the goodies it came with :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was going on an overseas trip and it was cheaper than buying a converter to use with my regular flat iron.  I have very curly thick hair so I need a good flat iron to straighten it out.  For purposes of the trip, it worked great but I would not want to use it for every day.  This is good for someone whose hair is not extremely curly and thick.  Good for the price and I liked that it worked overseas without a converter and I can use it in the US if I need to.  Overall a good product depending on what you need it for.</li>
    <li> I love how quickly and easily I can straighten my hair with this hair straightener.  I have naturally curly hair, so it has taken me quite a while in the past to be able to get my hair actually straight.  This straightener does the job quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best straighteners I have owned. It gets hot very fast and does a wonderful job with keeping my hair smooth. It came with a nice sleeve to store it in when traveling, which has also been useful. It did take some time to play around with the temperature dial in order to find the right setting for my hair, but the results have been excellent. It is easy to hold, and therefore easy to use - no tangling cord or burning your hands just from holding it. This is a great straightener for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have a straightener that I paid over $100 for and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second purchase of this iron. I needed a replacement since my klutzy butt dropped my old one and cracked the plates. Enough about that, let&#x27;s talk about the iron. This is a wonderful iron, in my opinion it&#x27;s better than  a chi. I&#x27;m currently transitioning to natural and this iron leaves my hair shiny and bouncy, when i want to have straight styles.  The flat iron comes with a heat glove and a little bottle of argon oil. The price is awesome so if anyone wanted to try this iron as a secondary styling tool or if you are looking to replace one I would definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> i got what i paid for. it does it&#x27;s job. I may purchase another one depending on how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this product because I had never heard of the brand, but after reading all the reviews, the majority of them were good so I decided to try it. I am so glad I bought it. I wish I would have gotten it sooner. It works so great. I like to use the flat irons to curl my hair but never could I find one that actually held the curl. This one, I must say, gets the job done. I am totally satisfied with this product and would strongly recommend it to anyone  in need of a good flat iron but not wanting to spend an outrageous amount of money.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  My very curly hair has been tamed.  People do not recognize me with my hair under control! Have recommended this flat iron to my friends.  Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job straightening my daughters very curly hair!  The previous one we had did not work nearly as good as this.  Its a great price for the high professional quality!!</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this one when my sedu broke. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot and there were so many good reviews I figured why not. I can&#x27;t believe how well this flat iron works. It hold up against my sedu which cost 3 times more. The argan oil that comes with it is amazing too. I already ordered the full size bottles. It curls very well too. My hair is pretty hard to please and I was able to get stick straight hair with one pass of this iron. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is just as good as any other expensive iron Ive bougt before. Fast shipping, good product, good price. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I have ever used and heats up in seconds.</li>
    <li> Bought this flat iron for a trip to Ireland in June. It worked great. All I needed to use was an adapter for that country.</li>
    <li> I was very anxious to receive this flat iron.I have very curly, frizzy hair. The iron works extremely well on getting my hair straight. I am glad I ordered it and at such an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this off of my husbands amazon account. I have previously owned \\&quot;big name\\&quot; brands such as CHI. When it recently came time to purchase another flat iron, I thought that was the way to go if I wanted good results. I searched on Amazon at other user&#x27;s reviews for different straighteners and this one came up with many consistent positive reviews. I am pleased to say they were absolutely all true. It heats up quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave ends looking \\&quot;frazzled.\\&quot; I am VERY impressed with this flat iron and so glad I didn&#x27;t pay big bucks for just another brand name.</li>
    <li> Great price, great quality, please, please buy !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This iron is for my daughter, who has tried several of her friends&#x27; irons.  She loves this one and now her friends want to get rid of theirs!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great! I have course, wavy hair and I typically need to use close to the highest heat setting in order to go through my hair with one swipe. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out or damage it. I like that it came with the glove and argan oil. I&#x27;ve also had good experiences &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; my hair with this iron. No complaints! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this iron! Good purchase!</li>
    <li> nice product I have very long hair and it works great&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> More than met my expectations.  Works as well as irons that cost much more.  The free glove is a bonus!</li>
    <li> Have a larger flat iron that I find too big to use. This one is just the right size and is very easy to travel with. Could not ask for a better deal. Works so well with my new hair cut!!!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works well on my wavy hair and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Great value for a fantastic product. I have long thick hair so I know right away when a flat iron is good. HSI does the job beautifully and evenly. It requires lots of time to complete my whole hair but once it is done it looks as if it was done by a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I have to also mention the great customer service. I had a problem with the delIvery but they solved it right away. THANKS!</li>
    <li> i got this product after i read about it, i thought it would be good but it SUCKED, i had to do my hair at least 3 times, the same way it took me with my 2 years old hair straightener, and it DOES NOT have the automatic shut down when left on, i left it for 4 hours thinking that it would be off when i come back, i was surprised it was steaming hot almost burned my self.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. It heats up quick to the temperature desired. It&#x27;s ergonomic design makes it safe and easy to use without getting burned. The travel bag and Argan oil is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this flat iron just to travel with, but I like using it so much that it has become my everyday flat iron and my old one will travel.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with it thus far. Nice packaging and comes as described! I will update my review when I wash my hair and actually see what its really capable of.</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron. I really liked the way you can make curls as well as straighten you hair with this flat iron. I only gave it 4stars because I would have liked it better if it was 11/4 or 11/2 in. I like the extra surface area. I also would like it a little hotter. 425 would be perfect for me.</li>
    <li> The supplier was amazing and I would order from them again. However this product is not that great. It requires many repeats over a piece of hair to get it straight (increases risk of burning hair) and it never got my hair nice and smooth. I don&#x27;t have super crazy hair but somewhat frizzy ringlets and that was too much for this straightener :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom, who has crazy thick wavy hair.  She LOVES it!  She says it is the best straightener she has ever used!  Even better than her Chi!  I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great straightener but the only issue I have with it is the inconvenience of where the temp dial and on/off buttons are located! Still would highly recommend it though!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this straightener. She specifically likes the different colors which make it easy to tell at a glance when the straightener is ready to use. The heat is consistent and even and the staightener seems very well built. We are quite pleased with our purchase and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This ceramic flat iron works so well and so fast. I love it! It was a great price also!</li>
    <li> Great product and good price.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. It is just what i needed to keep my hair beautiful! I have not used all of the free products that came with my order but i look forward to it.</li>
    <li> Impressive results!  This product left my daughter&#x27;s hair much straighter than our previous 2 products.  It also felt silky smooth.  I was warned by my stylist that you shouldn&#x27;t go above 340 even though the iron goes to 400, so we will follow her advice.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> This snags your hair. I hate it. I threw away the packaging....otherwise I would have retuned it</li>
    <li> I am glad I got this. It was a lot cheaper than I thought. Good deal! My friend is so happy!</li>
    <li> Based on all the positive reviews, I was very excited to purchase this flatiron.  I was extremely disappointed, and will either be returning it or throwing it away.  I currently have a Sedu, and my hair glides through that very smoothly.  With the HCI, it doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair smoothly at all -- instead it tugs, pulls, and even kind of \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; to my hair as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this flatiron, it&#x27;s a waste of money. Save for a Sedu or a Chi.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of straightening my hair without frying it, even on the hottest setting.  Have been using a much more expensive flat iron and have had my hair incinerated twice, once with the original flat iron and again with its replacement.  Pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron works so well and is such high quality!! Love it!! It also came with an unbeatable price. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for a great price. Works very well. Both my girls love this. We have used the CHI brand in the past and this product is comparable to that for a better price.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi for years that I unfortunately blew out during a trip to Europe (my bad...I really shouldn&#x27;t have been using it), so my main attraction to this flat iron was that it has dual voltage capabilities. I still miss my Chi but this definitely does the job!</li>
    <li> Ordered this flat iron standard shipping and received it in just a couple of days, which was great! Works really well- exactly as advertised. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of my new flat iron. It heats up really quickly and does a great job on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend buying from this seller!</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had and it makes my hair silky smooth. It works so well!!!</li>
    <li> Worked well for international travel.  Prompt delivery and great price.</li>
    <li> The most essential part of the iron, the ceramic, is actually chipped in a corner that could only have been that way prior to it&#x27;s shipping. There is no feasible way that this could have happened in any way from shipping or storage. This is an obvious manufacturing flaw that should have been trashed as the damage to hair and fire hazards is significant with exposed heating elements...</li>
    <li> I loved this item so much!!! It get hot really fast and keep my hair straight for 3 days! Best straighter yet!!!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, substantial design. A welcome change to many flat irons.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what u ordered. straightener works great and so much bettet then the one I previously had. Came with a handy carrying case too.</li>
    <li> It works great and it was delivered quickly. Very very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought a similar version several years ago.  It was still going strong until an airline broke it recently. So I immediately ordered another one. It arrived quick and on time.  I didn&#x27;t need the glove as my fingers are used to the heat, but is still nice to have. It also heats up super fast, which I love.</li>
    <li> My sisters $20 Walmart brand Iron works better then this does. I would not waste my money on this. I ended up giving it away to my Aunt who wanted one for her guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> I am flabbergasted at the fact that this is so highly rated. I have to wait about 10 mins for it to get to the full temperature setting. It says it gets up to 410 degrees and that&#x27;s a huge lie. It says you can curl your hair with it.... Um if ud like to set the world record for loosest curls. I straightened my hair with it and it felt like the longer I used it the cooler the flat iron got. Like it couldn&#x27;t take being used for 20 minutes. I rated it 2 stars because it does, to some degree, straighten your hair. You just need patience. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT THOUGH! it&#x27;s a waste of your money. Oh and don&#x27;t buy any of the Chi&#x27;s on Amazon neither they&#x27;re all fake!! To be honest I feel like this flat iron is probably fake too.</li>
    <li> I have a very happy daughter. This was exactly what she wanted. The price was right and the packaging for shipment  was perfect.</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter.......she threw the box and paperwork away not thinking this item would not work. It did not heat up enough to straighten her hair (she has been straightening her hair for 2years). Would return it if I could.</li>
    <li> Works great with my thick hair. First time I am using hair straightener. You can also curl the hair at the edges.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very happy with her HSI Professional flat iron.  She has been using my Chi for the past 3 years and I was a little concerned about changing product brands on her, but she not only loves having her own, she loves THIS one!</li>
    <li> This product does not work for me, it makes my hair frizz. Also, the on and off button and heat control dial are placed in a very hard to reach position. It is on the inside of the panels and one has to be extremely careful to reach it without burning oneself. Also, hard to tell when temperature is reached. There are better products out there.</li>
    <li> My sister had a CHI that she bought a long time ago and I had really wanted one, but didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price. I saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I have to say, I LOVE this hair straightener. I use it 97% of the time to make loose waves/curls in my hair rather than to straighten it. It really allows me a lot of control, does not burn my skin if I accidentally touch the side of my face with it and adds a lot of volume to my hair (I initially &amp;#34;curl under&amp;#34; near the roots and then &amp;#34;curl outward&amp;#34;  from my eye level down). I also appreciate that it has a temperature gauge and an on/off button. Some of my old straighteners just had to be unplugged if I wanted to turn it off. I get a lot of compliments on my hair after I style it with this baby. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get it. I use it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in it.  My hair stays smooth.  Comes with pouch.  Gets really hot but doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the money.  I have thick, curly, african-american hair (tex-laxed) and it straightens my hair really well.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It works very well. I absolutely Love the glove that came with it. Great price! I bought one for me and one for my sister.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great- it doesn&#x27;t only straighten your hair but it produces awesome curls-big or small depending on how you do it. Got it for my Birthday and I love it!! Definitely would recommend...my other one(not this brand) was awful!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife primarily because the reviews were good and we could use it internationally.  It didn&#x27;t get used long.  Her hair stags on the plates and it pulls it out.  Ouch.  I would return it, but we are past the 30 day window.  Now I have to buy something else for our trip.  I have purchased one of these before for my daughter, and the plates on that one shattered when it was dropped.  So, I have purchased two and had zero luck.  I&#x27;m not sure why this has good reviews.  Usually the reviews are quite reliable.  My recommendation, try #2.</li>
    <li> It works great! I&#x27;m not very good with doing my hair and without any effort it&#x27;s straight and looks professional!</li>
    <li> This is the first negative review I&#x27;ve ever written. So disappointed in this iron. It pulls out a strand of my hair with each pass. When it arrived, it looked as if it had been used before - there were small scrapes on the plastic around the ceramic plates and even the plates themselves had several small nicks in them. Now that I think about it, I was probably shipped an iron that someone else had used and returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that my iron was so faulty, especially after so many other people had given glowing reviews, but there are also MANY people posting negative reviews like mine. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron.  It works exactly  the way it says.  Makes my hair silky and my hair is usually. frizzy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second straightener I&#x27;ve purchased. It comes with a glove which until you have it you don&#x27;t realize how handy having a glove is. The straightener has adjustable temperature and is the right width that works well for medium to long hair.</li>
    <li> Love the fast heat up, the even heat and the one pass through my hair to make it look great!!</li>
    <li> This defective hunk of junk wouldn&#x27;t even turn on - right out of the box! When I inspected it further, I even noticed that one of the plates had a 1/8th gap from the frame, and you could see the heating elements inside!! Thank GOD it didn&#x27;t turn on! I might not have noticed that gap until after my hair would have gotten caught in it, and singed to a crisp. I can&#x27;t understand all these great reviews. Something&#x27;s fishy, here. Maybe they&#x27;re selling a mix of genuine and counterfeit products. There is NO WAY possible this iron would have passed code - not with that gap like that. Wow. Buyer Beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, I also ordered their 4-pc travel kit - and while the little dryer did a great job, the mini-travel flat iron was TERRIBLE, sizzling my hair like I laid it on a bar-be-que. And the clipless twirler didn&#x27;t do anything at all. This product is JUNK.</li>
    <li> love the hot hair iron.  I must have about six different hot hair iron and I am outstanded by how it holds and makes my hair feel smooth and shine.  Would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Heats fast and makes hair soft and shiny without any pulling. Excellent for long medium thickness hair. Makes getting ready in the morning a Snap!</li>
    <li> Returned.  It was too large and cumbersome for my small hands to manipulate.  That&#x27;s not to say that it isn&#x27;t a flat iron and I was sorry that I had to return it without even trying it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present and she loves it . I like the way it makes here hair look so bonus .</li>
    <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I decided to buy this flat iron. I was going to go with a more expensive one but decided against it after reading all of the great reviews. Even if it was only $40, I wish that I would have bought the more expensive one. This one works ok, but nothing like how the reviews says it will. So I will still be purchasing a more expensive one. In this instance, I believe you do get what you pay for. This one is definitely not worth $199. The flat iron that I bought 8 years ago works just as well as this one. Don’t get me wrong, it does straighten your hair, but if you are looking for the finish of a salon you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair is medium length and thick. Not curly, just wavy. It takes about two hours for me to straighten my hair. I wish I could return it and get a two inch iron that goes up to at least 430 degrees because 410 ain&#x27;t cuttin&#x27; it. Now I have to buy another one because it takes too much time.</li>
    <li> It is just not very comfortable holding it, seems awkward. The heat is fine; but not too much better than cheaper ones I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I had it for roughly 3 weeks weeks. It worked fine until it just stopped working completely and I had to send it back for a refund since there were no more from whoever I purchased it from. I think maybe I just got a bad model. I have just recently started shopping online and now I am nervous about getting products this way.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this straightening iron - from the storage pouch (soft cushy satin) to the results (soft shiny hair). It is very well made, easy to handle and has a long cord to name a few things. Two thumbs up here 👍👍</li>
    <li> I have been flat ironing my hair for about 9 years now. I have owned a Chi, as well as a few other higher quality flat irons from Ulta and Sally&#x27;s. This is, by far, the best one i&#x27;ve ever had. My sister had one and i borrowed it, fell in love, looked up the price to buy my own expecting to pay $350 because the results were that good. My hair is naturally curly, prone to frizz out, and very sensitive to humidity. Not when I use this guy! It really is the best and I will never over pay for a straightener again.</li>
    <li> Congratulations for his excellent attention,&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful for his attention and punctuality for the product of ragalo towards a relative</li>
    <li> Hsi is professional so I m gappy about the quality and the price. Works good ;) waiting for other producta to come ;)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Works just as well if not better than my Chi for less than 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> very happy with product and transaction</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair so pretty much anything works on my hair , but my daughters are mixed with a very course hair texture. This really smooths out their hair on the 450 degree setting and they love it for special occasions. I prefer their curly natural hair but they are happy they have other options now.</li>
    <li> I was not really impressed with this straightener, but I also have harder-to-manage hair. Medium length, wavy, and on the coarser side. I am going to keep it, but I have been just as impressed, if not more so, with Remington brand straighteners from Target/Wal-Mart. Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Hi bought this straightener for my college age daughter.  She has long curly/wavy hair which is incredibly hard to tame. most of the time she keeps it up in a ponytail.  This straightener works quickly. She just blow dries and sections the hair and runs the straightener through.  It only takes about 30 minutes, previously it was and hour long process.&lt;br /&gt;The price was fantastic about $100 less then a chai.  The warranty is also pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to a Chi. Flat iron heats quickly and includes an &amp;#34;on and off&amp;#34; switch for safety. Well-packaged and includes sample hair product and glove.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best item i purchased on amazon. i speak highly of this flat iron and recommend to all my friends. i have received so many compliments. people think i great my hair professionally done. when i say i did it myself they are shocked</li>
    <li> I got this straightener a few months back and absolutely love it. Price was even better. Would get it again.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my wife, as she attempted a new look. The product is exactly as advertised, and does a good job. We also received the product in a timely manner. Would Recommend.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She wanted a smaller one to use when she travels.  She loves this one and says it works better than her larger iron.</li>
    <li> I have spent alot of money previously for flat iron straighteners that weren&#x27;t as good or was as good as the HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Flatt Iron.  Ordering was easy, shipping was fast, and this is a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron a few months ago and it works even better than my old CHI.  It&#x27;s the best value I could find for a straightener around.</li>
    <li> I waited a few months after my purchase to make sure this straightener was up to scratch.  After reading reviews, it looked like people started having problems after the first month.  I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 months and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I think the problem was with others was with the cord.  I just leave some slack where it connects to the straightener and then start binding around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For straightening, I think it does a great job!  Especially at the price tag.  My hair is very frizzy and thick (I know that term is debatable - for reference, when I braid my hair you can put a ruler to it and it&#x27;s about 1.5 inches across and fits into a circle I make with my thumb and middle finger).  My hair dries naturally curly/wavy and I&#x27;ve been able to straighten it nicely without creases or having to do more than 1 or 2 passes.  I use it whenever I wash and dry my hair - about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars:  So the iron has an electronic temperature reader that turns green when it&#x27;s at the set temperature.  I just don&#x27;t think it does a great job at STAYING at the temperature you set it too.  Mind it&#x27;s not too far off the mark, only wavering +/- 5-7 degrees or so, but it just drives me nuts to see it turn blue (warming color) the second I pick it up for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it: holds up, travels well and gets the job done quickly.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a wonderful product.  Works great and my daughter couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Would recommend to those looking for a good quality flat iron.</li>
    <li> If you are on the fence, buy this, it&#x27;s an AMAZING deal for a great straightener.  I thought the price was too good to be true after researching it, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s a great straightener, it gets very hot, works very well, and is the perfect size</li>
    <li> Just received it and all seems to be in order and working fine like a normal hair straightener. But a bit disappointed about the appearance. To me it looks kind of cheap and not professional. It gives the impression of a &#x27;toy&#x27; hair straightener with the material that it is made of. So I am asking myself if this is a fake and the real HSI Professional looks more professional? And it feels so light.. anyone else have this or is it just me? I mean.. given the original price, I thought it would look impressive.. but it just looks cheap just like the discounted price.. maybe thats the real price after all.</li>
    <li> wife uses once per week and was not heating properly little over month, which was pass the return/exchange date.  Now after 4-5 month is it dead.  Now she atleast knows what not to buy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars for Blue Novelties for excellent service, communication, and replacing the defective unit after reading my review. Time will tell how long the second one run.</li>
    <li> This is the first straightener that I&#x27;ve used traveling that hasn&#x27;t quit on me because of the voltage differences.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get real hot so it took 4x as long to straighten my hair as my usual iron.&lt;br /&gt;Also, beware- it completely tore my hair up leaving me split/ cut ends.</li>
    <li> I am not someone who regularly styles or irons my hair, but this iron works great. As a new bee, it is very easy to handle &amp; use.&lt;br /&gt;Brings great shine to my hair, heats &amp; cools fast. Overall very happy with the product &amp; the seller</li>
    <li> I love this product. The high temp has not damaged my fine hair and i dont have to make as many passes over the same section to get my hair smooth. My hair also stays smooth even in Louisiana Humidity capital of the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She was so excited that I finally found a straightener that straightens without burning her hair. It is much faster to do her hair and with the different heat levels, it even works well on my young grand daughters hair. Very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this straightner.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair straightener  my hair is straight with very little effort. It has a shine and the straightener is not smoking hot. Thanks</li>
    <li> Iron is working great so far. The iron leaves your hair very shiny and the iron is very light weight.</li>
    <li> This is a well thought out product. I did not use it yet but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the device.</li>
    <li> My hair is very coarse.  I was worried about spending this much on an online product, but it &#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve purchased for myself in a long time.  Definitely have been recommending this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping . Product in good condition. Very good product for my hair, no frizz.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas, She loves it and has recommended this product to her friends.  On my end, we received the product with no problems.</li>
    <li> I base my purchases off the most recent and average ratings, so I was skeptical at first. This was meant as a gift, so I didn&#x27;t care much for the argon oil the &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; is a sample and at first i thought i didn&#x27;t receive it, that&#x27;s how small it is. Also the box isn&#x27;t very appealing the design looks cheap, but for the price I paid, I am satisfied. Other than that it is a perfect item in my eyes, my girlfriend loves it, it&#x27;s a lot better than her previous Walmart straightener, and her hair never gets snagged like stated in other reviews. In hindsight I do regret not getting the digital display, but that&#x27;s not a necessity. I would absolutely recommend this straightener to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI professional flat iron as a gift for my younger cousin.  She is very happy with the straightener and thrilled with the high heat the iron provides.  Based on her feedback, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my new straightener. I did a lot of research and almost had my stylist order me an expensive straightener. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t. This one works wonderfully. Straightens well and curls my hair easily too. Heats up quickly. I like the long cord too.</li>
    <li> WOW. After reading all the reviews, I was not at all disappointed with this product (and this is me being a skeptic and a heckler).  My hair is always smooth and shiny after using it, the included argan oil is EXCELLENT (just bought an additional bottle) and the iron doesnt take too long to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++++</li>
    <li> I was hoping for good things based on all the positive reviews for this iron.  I bought it for travel abroad as my other travel straightener is getting old.  I decided to try it out before I left and was surprised by the result.  It does not seem to do a good job, either of straightening or keeping it straight after.  I thought it might be because I had not set the dial right.  It only has a marking for highest heat setting of 410.  Even setting it all the way to the top did not help (and is not even that good for my hair).  I decided to test it by using the HSI on one side of my hair and my standard (110V only) Babyliss on the other side and the HSI was not even close.  I am very disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a three star because I do like the rounded edges to help it flip and curl at the end. Otherwise it would have been a 2 star.</li>
    <li> gets nice and hot and also do what it should do.. I am happy with the buy id do it again if I needed to</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best ceramic flat irons I have purchased for this price hands down!! My daughter and I are both natural and paired with the HSI argon oil, Our hair is left silky smooth and completely polished.</li>
    <li> I bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She says that it is great, easy to use and does a good job. She said just as great as a Chi.</li>
    <li> met all expectations. very satisfied. easy to use and like the adjustable temperature feature. would recommend to anyone who wants a reasonably priced straightener.</li>
    <li> I dig this straightener for my long, thick hair.  Every time I use it, I feel as though I left the salon.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. Excellent product with a great price. I would buy it again and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> It works beautifully! It gets super hot so I use the glove to touch my hair while ironing. I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girls for Christmas and so far so good. They seem to really like them &amp; are very happy with their performance, this iron doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hard on their hair as ones they&#x27;ve had before. Have bought cheaper ones in the past &amp; decided to go for something that seemed to have better quality &amp; might last longer. I would recommend these as a good buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron at the suggestion of a friend.  I had a Bablyss iron for 8 years that had just quit working.  I was not dissappointed at all!  I received my iron in less than a week and it works wonderful!</li>
    <li> This straightener is awesome it heats up very quickly and is very hot! Love the light that tells you when it&#x27;s hot! Great deal!</li>
    <li> I replaced my previous iron because it was not getting hot enough, then stopped working. Spent some time reading reviews and purchased this iron for less than $40. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and used it several times. What a difference. It has a good weight and design, heats up very quickly and has a light indicator to let you know it&#x27;s reached it&#x27;s temperature setting. Effective for my hair at lower temps. I&#x27;d say the one drawback I see is the location of the on/off switch and temp dial are on the inside--making is slighting harder to get to but a more sleek design and less able to accidentally change temp settings, so no star subtracted. Great buy!</li>
    <li> A must have for girls with &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; hair like mine... It gets really hot very quickly and does an amazing job!</li>
    <li> The iron is doing great stuff&#x27;s and wonderers with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it a month ago due to the significant amount of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it myself and I like and love it. I definitely recommend others to get it.</li>
    <li> My hair is not permed and these irons work perfect being able to control the temperature setting. They straighten my hair to where it looks like a perm and it lasts. They are sent with a nice protective bag for traveling or so they will not get damaged. Very good product and will buy again. Shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> After viewing You Tube and reviewing the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot;, I decided to buy this flat iron. It was a big disappointment, the iron didn&#x27;t work the way everybody described, the Argan oil came empty and spilled all over the packaging etc...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with kinky hair.</li>
    <li> I picked this iron out for myself for mother&#x27;s day ;-) I&#x27;ve been using the same flat iron for about 10-12 years. It was an expensive one, but it was time for a new one. I chose this one based on the price and reviews because I couldn&#x27;t afford one of those really expensive ones that I won&#x27;t name. I&#x27;ve been VERY happy with it. It heats up very fast, has temp controls and works amazingly. I definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;ve only had it for a little over a month though, so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s long term use, but so far, it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this flat iron after reading reviews here on Amazon. I decided to buy this and try it myself. My hair is normal and fairly straight. It was quick to heat up to the max 410 degrees and the LED turned green once heated. I noticed that as I began to straighten my hair it felt as if the heat started to drop. I&#x27;d look at the LED and it was at Red again. My outlets were just fine and the cord on the straightener was intact. The plates are not as smooth when doing your hair. It felt like it was tugging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got my money back for this purchase. Amazon does have great Customer Service :)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love it works great. &amp;#34; fast service great product just as  described  love the look I get when I use it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who straightens her wavy hair every day. She&#x27;s gone through 3 CHI flat irons, and most recently I bought her a very expensive GHD flat iron. She hated the GHD, saying it didnt get hot enough to properly straighten her hair, so we returned it. We saw this highly rated one on Amazon, and decided to try it. I&#x27;m so glad we did. She LOVES this flat iron. Her hair is smooth and shiny and super healthy looking after she straightens it with this flat iron. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one! Definitely buy it, it&#x27;s so worth it!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I just got a keratin treatment done on my thick, frizzy, curly hair at a salon and I wanted to be able to keep up the look at home. First time I used it, my hair came out silky smooth straight.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned...even at the medium setting it gets very hot and steams a bit when you iron your hair...but once I use it my hair actually stayed stick straight and soft for a few days in between washes. Very happy with it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago after my CHI iron died. I like that this iron has adjustable heat. It has held up well. I liked it enough to recommend to my mother.</li>
    <li> Used it once and then the below plate stopped working, the upper plates still works. The products has excellent if it was more durable</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product were astounding to begin with. So I had high expectations. I was not disappointed. I love my new flatiron. Its dual current and works like a dream. I have no complaints and my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> This hot iron does not get hot enough to do the job.  I would look elsewhere for a straightener.  Disappointing Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, it has the adjustable heat settings, and fits comfortable in my hand ( I have RA).</li>
    <li> Works fine, loving it! Got this a couple weeks ago, haven&#x27;t gotten to try it out alot but so far it&#x27;s seeing no problems.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as ordered and shipped quickly.  No issues whatsoever.  I ordered this due to the age of my other flat iron and the desire to switch over to professional tools especially when it comes to heat.  This helps with my damaged hair, and the free sample of the Argan Oil was also very nice!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this did not work for my daughter. She has always used my one that I purchased from a 5 star salon and her hair has stayed in excellent condition. She moved out to college and this was one of her Christmas gifts. It did not slide through her hair like my straightener and after a month she went to the salon as her hair was in terrible condition with a lot of breakage. She had to have deep conditioning and I purchased her one from the salon.</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it about 3 times a week and I haven&#x27;t had any problems, I love that it comes with a carrying case too</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron. Had no difficulty using it in China. Fairly light weight. Easy to pack. Has a temperature gauge, which is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> This iron has heat settings yet it still fried my hair, I would recommend the Paul Mitchell ISO Iron instead.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift and she loves it... but the seller really manipulates the price unreasonably. When I first viewed this item it was $40something so I added to wish list. A couple days later the price jumped all the way to $100?!?! I waited another week to see if it would drop and it did but now it was $50something. I went ahead and got it. Looking at the price after it jumped back up to $60.</li>
    <li> This product is mediocre at best. I bought it because it was rated #1 on Amazon. I am not sure how it climbed to #1, but this product is average at best. The first iron that was shipped to me, snagged hair like crazy. Another was shipped out to replace it. This second one did not pull out my hair as much, but if you didnt run the iron just right it would snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this iron to replace my Hot Tools flat iron. I found out the hard way that it wasnt dual voltage, like the HSI. With the HSI flat iron I have to have the temperature higher than my old one and must run it through most sections more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are inside, not on the side like many others. The temperature knob only has one temp listed 410, you have to guess what temp you are on for anything lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would have to say the HSI Professional Flat Iron is an ok product. It gets the job done, but I would not expect greatness from it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and I bought it on sale at a great price. Definitely a steal and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I was excited to get this product, its had problems staying heated and doesn&#x27;t reach its full heat potential (and the red light never switches to green letting me know its ready). I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now and contemplated returning it since the first day I used it, although i gave it a chance because of all the great reviews I read. Don&#x27;t know if maybe I got a defected one but as of right now my 20$ target straightener works better than this one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for my Chi that lasted many years. This isn&#x27;t it. It does a decent job, but it&#x27;s not great - and the plates pull my hair out. If you have the money to buy a more expensive straightener, I would go for higher priced quality. If you don&#x27;t, this one does a fine job of straightening my only mildly wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I have never used a hair straightener before so was not sure how this would work for me.  I have to say I&#x27;ve been more impressed by the results than I thought I would be.  I hoped that it would straighten the wave I have in the ends of my hair at least a bit.  It did that and more.  It straightened out the wave completely and smoothed down the surface of my hair also, making it look much sleeker and less coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very quick to use.  It takes me about 10 or 15 minutes, generally.  It heats up quickly too.</li>
    <li> I am not real happy with it. It tugs on my hair which makes me think its not real good quality plus it doesn&#x27; t seem to do the job I want it to.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for any and every girl in need of some mane taming. The heat settings are kind of in an odd place, the inside of the flat iron, but it is easy enough to reach, just be careful when it is already hot.The cord is long enough, but not too long, and the little batch of argon oil that comes with the product is superb. A small amount goes a long way and makes my hair look glossy and sleek. My only concern with this flat iron is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets as hot as others that I have used. It works well with my hair, though so it is a small complaint (and probably better for my hair in the long run.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Heats up fast and leaves hair smooth and shiny. The rounded body is perfect for curling hair under at the ends.  The bag, glove, and hair products are nice extras.</li>
    <li> I had never had this brand of flat iron before, but I checked at my beauty shop &amp; it was highly recommended.  I have no regrets!  I had previously owned a different brand - twice, but I like this one even better, and it got here quickly!  Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product , if you looking for a flat iron for a good price this is the one the get</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because her old one died... midway through her morning routine! I know, how inconsiderate?! Needless to say, she swiftly ended that relationship. Luckily, I found this sweet piece of hairstyling glory. She&#x27;s had it for a few months now and hasn&#x27;t complained once. I&#x27;m happy when she&#x27;s happy... and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It gets really hot really fast!!&lt;br /&gt;It came sooner than quoted, and in perfect condition!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend purchasing this!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron especially for the price.  I have owned a Chi before and don&#x27;t see a significant difference between the irons except for the price.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality hair straightener that leaves my hair shiny and soft. The price is very good for the quality of this product. I have had several other brands (Braun, Rowenta) that were much more expensive but this one is definitely my favorite!</li>
    <li> this is normally with any other products I used before, not bad ,it was actually worked, let my hair became smoothing, hope it can use over 2 years.</li>
    <li> This item works really well. I enjoy this product and I would not use anything else when it comes to my hair.</li>
    <li> This works great on my hair. I went natural and it straightens my hair with no problem. Others flat irons I typically have to go over a strand of hair 4 to 5 times before it is straight but not with this. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> i would recommend it to every girl who need special care for her hair this is one of the best iron hair</li>
    <li> Really like this. Almost works as well as the Centrix Straightener I had borrowed from a friend. Only complaint is the that cord plugin is large so i can&#x27;t have both the straightener &amp; a hairdryer plugged into the same outlet. That&#x27;s a problem when there is only one outlet in my bathroom. Other than that- love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Not as good as GHD, but honestly a high quality product - with a low cost. This product is unique because it features dual Voltage (meaning you can use in Europe with only an adapter (no need for voltage converter) ideal for travel. I use it in another country and it performs wonderfully.  Oh I have been using high quality flatiron for many years - this one definitely is on par with the 100 and up comparable items. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This product works really nicely! I needed an emergency hair straightener and decided to give this one a try... haven&#x27;t purchased a new one since it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe.  It worked great in France and Germany...just needed to use an adaptor and let it warm up.  No problems and it did the job!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product, especially after reading reviews comparing it to the chi brand, saying its as good if not better of a product. My chi had &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after 8 years of use. I decided to go with this product after reading the good reviews and wanting to save some money. It did not straighten my hair at all, even on the highest setting. It didn&#x27;t even come close to working the way I felt it should. I finally broke down and just bought another chi, to which I am very pleased with. Sometimes you just get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is easy to use; I have thick hair and there is plenty of &amp;#34;surface area&amp;#34; where the heated part is to hold a good sized chunk of my hair! I also like the long cord and the little attachment at the end of the cord that &amp;#34;spins&amp;#34; around to keep it from tangling.  There are several different temperature settings to choose from as well.  The flat iron has a nice, solid heft to it that makes it feel like a quality, professional tool. And the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I am  a previous owner of a 350.00+ Paul Mitchell Flat Iron. When it went out I was in a panic because I didn&#x27;t have the money to replace it right away. I have wavy frizzy hair that REQUIRES a flat iron or I look like I put my finger in a light socket. I needed a new one ASAP. HSI was affordable and had great reviews, so I took the chance. Boy has it paid off!! It leaves my hair silky, shiny, and&lt;br /&gt;super straight. Great product, great price, FANTASTIC service! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this hair straightener!! Makes my hair really smooth !!</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron for a good friend who has two daughters. They all three have very different hair types and it was amazing for all three of them. It not only straightens beautifully, it also manages to throw a great curl or flip at the ends. They are all three over the moon excited and pleased with the flat iron!!&lt;br /&gt;The price point is great, packaging is elegant and shipping was most efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> love this product!  straightens my hair very well.  affordable but high quality.</li>
    <li> I have used a CHI flat iron for years.  In fact I had two and one finally gave up the ghost.  Anyway I bought this as a backup Incase the other dies. Can&#x27;t live without my flatiron. If your love your CHI, this won&#x27;t replace it.  Just doesn&#x27;t have the same quality.  However, for the money, this is a good product.  I will keep it for a backup but, if my last CHI dies, I&#x27;m getting another one.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected. I have frizzy hair and this straightens it out perfectly.  Shipment arrived quickly and was perfectly packaged.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the value. It is not the smoothest pull on your hair, but considering materials, price, and size, it works exceptionally well. The extras were great too especially the Argan oil. Cool stuff!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the weight of this flat iron. After fifteen minutes using it, my wrist starts getting sore and I have to stop to rest it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this flat iron because I thought you had to spend over $100 to get a decent product. Completely wrong! I have very tight curls and I&#x27;ve been to many hair salons who have failed to get my hair straight. This iron is unbelievable not only was it able to straighten my hair but I&#x27;m able to put a nice wave in it and my hair had a beautiful shine. I definitely recommend this product. The price is so worth it.</li>
    <li> This works great for medium length hair.  It has a temperature control so you can avoid scorching your hair.  It heats up very quickly.  The only thing that would improve it would be to place the on/off button on the side rather than the inside.  That can be hard to see and manipulate for the over 50 crowd.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It makes curling easy,&lt;br /&gt;it bumps my hair with out pulling it out, and it is easy to clean. The best part about it is that its affordable!!</li>
    <li> The best straightner on the market bought. One for Mom and myself</li>
    <li> Worth the price. Gets the job done. heats up quickly.Has an On-Off button and a temperature control knob.Comes with a tiny bottle of Argan oil which is a treat to your hair.</li>
    <li> i am giving 4 stars because i haven&#x27;t used it enough to really love it yet. So far, the flat iron works really well for the price and hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair.</li>
    <li> I was used to the Remington brand for years, and decided to switch for this flat iron recently.&lt;br /&gt;The size and the temperature choice are perfect, it heats really fast, and it is easy to use, especially with the glove.&lt;br /&gt;At the first use I had to press the reset button and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome deal!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. I was skeptical at first because it was so inexpensive. It works great on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> had great reviews but I definitely have had better flat irons for less money. Wouldn&#x27;t get as hot as I wanted, even at 450 degrees. My other irons I used at a lower temp and they worked better.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and Transaction.</li>
    <li> Worked well on my trip! It heats up well also. i wish it was a bit smaller or that the company had something that was a bit smaller in size for travel. Will buy again if i had to.</li>
    <li> Very good flatiron and good price</li>
    <li> Was just as expected... Only better. They say&amp;#34; you Get what you pay for&amp;#34; but I definitely scored on this buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to use while I temporarily live in Germany. It works well and has the correct voltage to use here. It does not compare to my CHI that I have back in America, but I have very thick hair and it takes a lot of effort to straighten it to my liking. Overall it is a good product and worth the money, especially if you plan to travel abroad!</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well. Takes 5 minutes to straighten my long, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Pluses:  Works well, good grip, variable hit setting, protective carrying case, nice price.  The price is half that of the entry-level Chi, which I&#x27;ve used for year.  The Chi has the advantage of running more smoothly over the hair and leaving my hair softer.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Great heat control!</li>
    <li> Amazing ! Dont have split ends anymore :)</li>
    <li> i just bought it thinking it would be an alright product. but omg its amazing.. my hair its wavy but really thick and it left it silky smooth.. the argan oil is very good, yhe most amazing thing your hair stays frizz free.. my daughter hair is very curly and thick and dificult to manage but i was able to finish her hair in less than 30 minutes.. its by far the best flat iron i have ever bought or owned..</li>
    <li> I have very long hair that is fairly thick and I will be returning the product bc it didn&#x27;t impress me. It made my hair feel dried out and it felt like it squeezed out the moisture with every pass. It doesn&#x27;t snag your hair and it gets the job done. Ehh just so so...</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical at first because of the price but this flat iron is awesome! I have tried several others before but never getting the desired results. This flat iron give me sleek straight hair without damage, and I love the glove and argon oil sample. I recommend this product it is amazing!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE ARGAN OIL which came with the HSI hair straightener I purchesed. It a smells amazing and not too overpowering and leaves my hair shiny and silky without weighing it down. I have EXTREMELY fine hair and most products leave it greasy and too heavy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the HSI hair straightener seems very durable so far (I have been using it for one month) and straightens my hair very smoothly.</li>
    <li> Totally awesome!!  My old Chi straightener was so hot it burned my fingers and hair.  Hairdresser said I needed one with an adjustable setting.  I checked out Ulta and then went online.  Saw all of the awesome reviews and the great price, so I had to at least try it.  I do love it.  My hair feels so soft and look shiny.  I highly recommend!!  You won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this straightener for about 2 weeks now, and I love it! It heats up fairly quickly (not record timing but I usually set aside 45 mins to do my hair anyways) and it only takes 1-2 &#x27;sweeps&#x27; thru each section to get it perfectly straight!  It replaced my old straightener from Revlon (about 6 years old, worn out) so I am very pleased!! Plus it was on sale for like 30 dollars so deal! I recommend to anyone...it also does a great job of curling hair nicely too!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the  money. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It also came with a sample of Argan oil and that too is a great product.</li>
    <li> Good straightener.  Item arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for!!</li>
    <li> This is a good Product , I liked it !</li>
    <li> I received the product timely, and it does what it says it does without any unpleasant surprises. My hair looks good! I&#x27;m particularly happy about the price since this straightener&#x27;s MSRP is $199.99!</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my mom and she says that it doesn&#x27;t burn the hair, doesn&#x27;t leave an unpleasant smell of hair burning and the hair looks beautiful and prevents the frizz very good!!!! I recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This HSI flat iron works great controlling my flyaway hair. It gives my hair a nice shine and the small bottle of oil is a nice bonus. You can also easily curl your hair with it  The travel pouch will come in handy on business trips.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly.  It was a gift but I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad from my friend, so I&#x27;m assuming it works good</li>
    <li> This product heats up quickly and work great!</li>
    <li> My previous experience using a flat iron was limited to that of a very low-end (cheap) model that made my hair appear so limp and dry as if I&#x27;d used a clothes iron. I&#x27;m very pleased with ease of use and the smooth and shiny results using my new HSI.</li>
    <li> Quality product.  Love that it curls and flips.  Heats up quick.  Only wish is it had auto turn-off, but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> not sure it is as super fabulous as a lot of the reviews but I would say it works about as well as the chi, for 1/3 the price. so since I have champagne taste on a beer budget, it&#x27;s worth it and works.</li>
    <li> I had a chi and it lasted for about 5-6 years, once it broke I decided to get this straightener from all the great review it had. I would say that it is as good at the chi!! Great same quality. There is a lot of reviews saying it tugs on hair but my chi also did that. To me that&#x27;s not an issue as long as it keeps my hair straight!!! Love the product!</li>
    <li> I like it alright. The only problem I have with it is that it really doesnt clamp my hair very well. Every time I straighten my hair, the hair on the edges of the plate fall out of both sides and dont get straightened. I know what youre thinking, just straighten less hair, right? Well it still happens unless I&#x27;m litterally taking tiny segments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really isnt as big of a problem when straightening my hair, its awful for curling my hair. It usually means the strand I curl is half curled and half straight in weird areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, for the price, I think it will manage. The free trial argan oil is nice and makes my hair really shiny. To be honest though, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair any shinier than other hair oils, so I will likely not reorder their argan oil since its more expensive than the hair oils i buy at walmart or sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my chi got chipped and tugs my hair when I use it, but I still feel ilke my chi is so much better. Even the weight of my chi gives me more handle on my hair and it clamps tightly enough that no hair falls out when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
    <li> Worked really well in Norway! It is a little bigger than I would have liked but it got the job done.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I love it.</li>
    <li> Recieved the item quickly. It is very easy to use, works perfectly and I know I&#x27;ll use it often.</li>
    <li> I have used some products way more expensive than this and this was just as effective!</li>
    <li> I always buy hair straighteners on Black Friday because of the amazing deals, and I always need an extra laying around in case something happens to my other one. This one works great, heats up quickly, and straightens my curly hair in a matter of time! Good price, worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It gets very hot, is easy to handle. It came quickly, was wrapped well. No issues</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> The big problem is hat the controls - the on-and-off button and the temperature control -- are placed so as to make using them rather awkward. They are on the inside of one of the plates, close to where the plates come together. This leaves very little space to use these controls.</li>
    <li> Have been using for over a month. It works amazing. Easy to use and my hair looks really good.</li>
    <li> Good flat iron. Not any different than others I&#x27;ve used. Good price point.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the bonus items that come in the package too!</li>
    <li> Works great!  You can adjust the temperature as needed for different times.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This review is from my daughter, since I don&#x27;t use hair straightening devices like this.  (:  \\&quot;Not the best product I&#x27;ve used, but very good quality for the price. A little slower than most products heating up but it gets the job done!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great buy. My wife loves it, says &amp;#34;it works excellent&amp;#34; definetely recommend this product to anyone looking for a flat iron hair straightener</li>
    <li> Shipping came fast ! Good product</li>
    <li> Blue Novelties has done what very few companies do nowadays. They offer top-quality products at amazing prices - and the best part? Their customer service etiquette goes above and beyond to make sure you receive your product quickly and that you are pleased with it! Definitely a stand up supplier that has gained a customer for life! The HSI flat iron only takes about 15 seconds to heat up (410 is the temp I use) and glides through my hair leaving it very straight and shiny. Just as good as the CHI Deep Brilliance that I have used until now - and at a considerable savings!</li>
    <li> Much lighter than the first version.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Better than I hoped for. The product shipped on time and I am very happy with it. I was a bit unsure about trying it worrying that it would be a &amp;#34;consumer&amp;#34; version type product. It has exceeded my expectations and I will definitely do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! I&#x27;ve had mine for awhile and it still works great.</li>
    <li> This straightener is awesome! I have long, thick, and very wavy hair and it makes it stick straight, even if I start with all of my curl.</li>
    <li> I like it. Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Really good flat iron</li>
    <li> This product is good. I only gave it 4 stars because it is larger than I expected and a bit awkward to handle but it leaves hair smooth and does not &amp;#34; pull&amp;#34; which was a concern I had. Good buy!  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my very nice CHI when it crapped out. I was a little worried, but figured it was worth a shot and WOW! This is the absolute best straightener for the price! It heats quickly and gets very hot. It&#x27;s actually too hot for me, but has an adjustable temperature, unlike my CHI. I see the clips that people complained about having their hair caught in, but they haven&#x27;t been an issue with my very fine hair. The only complaint I have is that the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; light is located on the outside near the hinge and glows green, rather than red, making it difficult to see. May be a concern with younger daughters, but not enough of an issue for me to knock anything off the rating.</li>
    <li> Great##love these irons!</li>
    <li> I have thick semi-curly hair, and this flat iron does the job decently.  Especially for the price - works just as well as my last GHD iron did which was 2x as expensive.  The argan oil sample that came with it is also really nice -smells great &amp; makes my hair soft.  I would add a word of caution: for some reason, it seems like there are burrs or impurities in the ceramic that caught in my hair.  If you have fine hair or thin hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job but is not the best one I have had. You get what you paid for. Other than the actually product the seller was great! I got my product quickly!</li>
    <li> Good quality but didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations for my long, thick hair.  Even with the heat setting at maximum, my hair never turned out completely straight and smooth.  The ceramic also snags and pulls out my hair a lot, which is uncomfortable.  I was more impressed with my wet to straight straightener from Walmart...which lasted many years!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron...came quickly. LOVE the pouch that came with it. I&#x27;m always on the go so being able to protect other belongings in my bag is nice. Friendly staff</li>
    <li> Have purchase numorus flat irons pricing anywhere from $75 to $100 dollars with issues everytime.  Was tired of wasting money and this one has worked better then any of the other ones.</li>
    <li> It works great on my curly hair. I love it !</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron and the argan oil that came with it. My hair is graying, and this is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve found that tames my grays even in humid weather.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Better than my Chi that I had for 5 years. Heats up in about a minute and stays hot as I style.</li>
    <li> Very good product at a great price</li>
    <li> this iron doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it pulls my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amore makes the best iron for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This is a magnificent iron!  I have been using a flat iron for the past 11 years and have gone through quite a few of them.  I am a White Hispanic lady that has fine curly hair that frizzes easily when exposed to humidity.  After my chi iron suddenly stopped working (did not heat adequately anymore), I decided to purchase this iron based on the amazing reviews.  I was skeptical at first because of the price and wondered if it would actually work.  Nevertheless, I went ahead with the purchase of this iron and am so happy I did!  While my previous iron had a wider plate, I found that this feature was not needed.  Rather, the 1&amp;#34; plate makes it easier to store away and is less bulky for travel.  The 1&amp;#34; plate of the HSI iron was able to completely straighten my hair with just one pass.  Moreover, I found that I was able to perfectly straighten the roots of my hair on the back of my head (which for some reason is curlier than the front).  The iron attained the desired temperature quickly and maintained the desired heat level.  The glove provided is handy for people who wish to curl their hair with this iron.  I had never used a glove and gave it a quick try.  I was able to hold the hot iron at 410 degrees and did not feel the heat.  Nevertheless, I curled the ends of my hair with a regular curling iron since I found that it was quicker.  The oil provided left my fine curly hair a bit too weighed down.  I only put on a tiny amount and focused the treatment on my ends.  I feel that this product may be better suited for women with thicker or coarser hair.</li>
    <li> taking me a bit of time to get use to handling the ceramic tourmaline.  But that is me.  I like it and will continue to use it.  It gets VERY hot on high temperature.  You must take care when using it.  The temerature is adjustable.</li>
    <li> I had a CHI that lasted 7 years and was hesitant to try something new. After reading great reviews about the product and the customer service, I decided to give it a try since it was such a reasonable price. I only used it about 3 times before I decided a CHI was worth the money. Everything came exactly as listed, it felt rather sturdy, and was done heating up incredibly fast. The only reason I didn&#x27;t like it was because I felt my hair slightly tearing as I ran it through my hair. I also didn&#x27;t think it curled nearly as well as a CHI. My hair is curly and moderately thin, so a CHI straightened it in less than 15 minutes. I felt like this would&#x27;ve taken longer to straighten. Again, for the cost it&#x27;s extremely reasonable and worth at least trying. I just liked my experience with CHI more and feel that paying the extra money to preserve the softness of my hair and being able to curl is worth it. Excellent customer service and I got my refund (with a free shipping label) super quickly.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! I have owned a chi and this bad boy works just as well, if not better!! You can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!</li>
    <li> So far this straightener is really great. I have only used it a few times but it heats up quickly and goes a great job at straightening my hair. The travel pouch, heat glove and argan oil were great bonuses!</li>
    <li> I was wary of ordering this since I have always had the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; brand straighteners and paid a lot for them! I was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn&#x27;t say this one is life-changing by any means, but I think it works just as well as my last $120 one that only lasted a year. The company was very quick and it came nicely packaged.. plus the free argan oil, can&#x27;t beat the deal!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it.  Her old iron was starting to die and I did some research and decided this would be the best one for her and she couldn&#x27;t agree more.  The product arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I have short hair I used to use a curling iron but it made my hair too curly this is just right lift and body without too much curl plus is makes my hair shine..</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  I&#x27;ve used a couple times on my natural curly hair and it looks great!  Other flat irons never gave me the results without some frizz!!!</li>
    <li> I was impressed how great it works!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair straighteners for about 10 years and this feels, looks, and works like the ones I first started buying.&lt;br /&gt;You can tell instantly that this is a cheaply made product and it took twice as long to straighten my hair than other devices I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure where all these good reviews are coming from but save your money and head to Sally&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll find a better one for less money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it and I like the price.</li>
    <li> Great just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Hi - I had been using a Chi flatiron for the past 1.5 yrs, but it had stopped working suddenly.  It gave me a great look and was very satisfying, although the life span was short, esp for the cost!  So I have ordered the HSI, which is lower priced.  I think the packaging is great, the beautiful carry pouch lovely, and the extra argon oil fantastic.  However, the iron itself does not provide me with as much smoothing/straightening.  I have very thick shoulder length hair and live in a humid environment (western NC).  My hair frizzes here, and needs help!  So I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the results.  :(  Sorry to say.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, frizz-prone hair and this straightener smooths it quickly, without \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; in spots like others have before. Though others have complained that there is a gap between the plates, mine does not. It heats up very quickly to a high heat. All the extras that come with it make it the best deal around.</li>
    <li> Great iron for the price.</li>
    <li> I really wish I had spent the extra money on a better straightener. It&#x27;s fine on my already straight hair, but worthless for my daughters biracial hair.</li>
    <li> Nice Product for giving a Gift</li>
    <li> Exactly as promised. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works awesome. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron,very high quality and easy to use. It heats up very fast and it does not fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product also has a great price and very competitive to high priced flat irons. I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Love this tool.  It heats up fast and leaves my hair smooth and shiny as promised</li>
    <li> I love my new straightner. I was looking for something that was equivalent to the chi but without the price. It works great and it was a great price!</li>
    <li> Awesome product for a great price! Chi who?</li>
    <li> The original iron didn&#x27;t give me a nice smooth result, when the company found I wasn&#x27;t satisfied they contacted me, they thought it could be faulty and sent a replacement.  I was pleasantly surprised when I used the new iron, as it did give me the result I wanted.  I have thick hair that has been color treated for 30 years and as dry as it is, the iron still gave me a smooth result.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this iron for the quality and for the wonderful customer service provided by the company.</li>
    <li> so smooth, my hair looks amazing !! and it curls so easily without leaving a square edge to it</li>
    <li> This straightener is great! Especially for the price. I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve owned it for quite some time and just got one for my sister. She is also in love with it! It lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t pinch hair, and looks very professional.</li>
    <li> Best straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever used. Took less time to get my hair straight than my old one.</li>
    <li> Deal breakers:&lt;br /&gt;No auto shut off&lt;br /&gt;No lock switch to keep it shut/closed&lt;br /&gt;Does not curl hair nearly as well as other straighteners&lt;br /&gt;Plastic rim around iron plates towards the tip kept catching and pulling my hair (see photo)&lt;br /&gt;Iron plates not long enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron did get very hot and kept my hair smooth but it just is not a keeper for me and I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Worked great in Ireland!  Loved the travel pouch, made for a quick touch up in the airport after a long layover in misty NYC quick and easy since I didn&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down before I carefully stashed it back in my bag.  Only reason for a 4 instead of 5 star rating is that it does snag at the ends of my hair if I&#x27;m not careful.  My regular flat iron does not have this issue regardless of how much attention I am paying</li>
    <li> I like that you can adjust the temperature of the flat iron. My hair hasn&#x27;t gotten stuck in the blades like it did with my Chi. The only downside is there is no automatic shut off.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it.  She says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s had.</li>
    <li> I just used it once and it started buring my hair. So I sent it back.</li>
    <li> It does the job in flattening my hair, no complaints there.  The price is hard to beat for a good iron.  My reason for 4 stars, and not 5, is that it kind of pulls my hair when I straighten a section.  It feels like when you put a clip or barrette in your hair and take it out, a strand of hair or two got caught in, or wrapped around, the spring or pin.  It&#x27;s not painful and I don&#x27;t see any strands actually pulling out in the iron, it&#x27;s  just annoying.  I also have to straighten smaller sections of hair than with the first iron I bought ten years ago.  That iron lasted a long time!  I hope this one does too!</li>
    <li> Gets hot very quickly, works great! It was a nice surprise that it was in a pretty red bag and came with argan oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had babyliss and brocato brands both salon purchased and both more than $100. This iron works great, heats quickly with digital temp and comes with a nice sleeve for storage. It has a safety feature so you unplug it but I keep it on my vanity so it stays plugged in. ..in the sleeve.</li>
    <li> I would rate this product a 5 star. My daughters and I love the flat iron. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It heats extremely quickly, works well and is compact.  It has a light indicator when it is on, which is invaluable.  Can hardly wait to travel with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for travel to Estonia.  I leave next week.  I have been using it at home, though and it is a great product. I love the Argan oil that comes with it as well.  It heats up fast and evenly.  I am hoping that it works well overseas!  It comes with a great bag and glove as an added bonus.</li>
    <li> This frizzy hair dilemma is new to me, so I didn&#x27;t have any experience with straightening tools. This iron has made a significant impact on the time need to I spend on my hair. I now spend 15 minutes and get far better results over my prior 45 minutes of hair burning torture.</li>
    <li> easy to use, live this flat iron</li>
    <li> Great product! I had many people refer me to hot tools. I love how hot it gets and that it tells me the temp so I know when its at its hottest point. It didn&#x27;t come with the so called oil though.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron my wife purchased and she loves it...she says it heats up pretty quick goes on smooth. She has thick and frizzy hair and this iron makes her hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a flat iron that works well but doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair, and this one is great. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the great price!</li>
    <li> Horrible.  My hair caught on one edge of the iron repeatedly.  The plates are almost &amp;#34;sticky,&amp;#34; making it impossible for my hair to slide through it smoothly.  I tried it twice with no luck and returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now. At first, I tried the lower temperatures, and it didn&#x27;t work as well as I wanted for my hair (but it is great to have options for different hair types), so I tried the 450* setting, and it worked great. Silky smooth! It was affordable and works great! I am loving it as much as I loved my CHI&#x27;s, but am hoping it lasts longer than both of them (I&#x27;ve gone through 2 in the past 5 years or so-yikes!).</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron!! It straightens my hair so good! It is affordable and actually has been doing a better job than my chi!!! I recommend this flat iron!!</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 HSI flat irons in the past which both worked wonderfully. Both were purchased at kiosks in the mall.  This one that I purchased online is horrible.  It deserves at least 1 star because it straightened my hair but as you go down your length of hair it starts to pull and snag it. This makes it super uncomfortable and annoying. Neither of the flat irons I owned in the past did that.  Its great that it comes with a sample of the oil, a glove, and a pouch for the flat iron.  But the hair straightener itself was not good quality, at least I didn&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> I had my flat iron just over a year when it stopped working.  One week it worked then the next time I turned it on nothing happened I reset the plug, still nothing.  I&#x27;m not happy.  I purchased this model because of the high ratings.  Unfortunately, you win some, you loose some.  This one was a looser in my book.   My HSI Pro flat iron does a great job straightening my hair.  It is quick to heat up and fairly easy to use.  I love that I can change the heat settings and they stay constant once set.  I don&#x27;t use it on the hottest setting of 450 degrees.  It works fine on 410 and I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair.  I&#x27;m sure the longer I have it the more I will love it.  I have been using the HSI Pro about 4 months.  I could not give it five stars because the cord is shorter then I am used to having and shorter then I need. I really need a nine foot cord so it can easily reach another socket.  Working with seven feet makes using the HSI iron a little more difficult for me.  The exterior of the iron also gets extremely hot.  I need to be very careful not to burn my hands.  This was not the case with my old dryer.  Using it along with my hair dryer my hair comes out great.  I am very happy with the job the HSI does.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is easy to handle! I use it on the lowest temperature setting because I have very fine hair, but the curl (or straightening) lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I am beyond pleased with this flat iron! My hair is naturally curly. This flat iron smooths my hair without frizzing it. The temperature setting is a great feature! WELL worth the price I paid which was reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair smooth and straight without getting excessively hot.</li>
    <li> I always believe you get what you pay for, and this was a great investment that has paid off over and over. Love it, love it. It&#x27;s been a pro for over a year now.</li>
    <li> Did not heat up. This product has a label that says caution its very hot. I was able to hold this up in my hand with no gloves on by the plates while it is on. I tried it the day I got and I am returning it the day after( since I got it received on Sunday), Not Happy with this at all.</li>
    <li> Awful! Don&#x27;t know how this is so highly rated! Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and snagged my hair. DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> I have used chi for years, but gor this hsi professional and got a great surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I just love it !</li>
    <li> Easy ordering, timely delivery, great price--excellent product!  The flat iron heats quickly, works great.  One minor issue is that the on/off, temp buttons &amp; display are on the inside of the handles--hard to see.  I also take it with me on all my travels--easy to pack and bag comes in handy (but I have to wait for flat iron to cool before placing it inside the bag).  But, all in all, I love my flat iron!</li>
    <li> For something that you use every day, I should have spent more money on a hair straightener. The nob to turn on and off and adjust the heat is in an awkward spot. You can&#x27;t clearly tell that the iron is on, so you have to pay attention to ensure that the iron is turned off. I would not purchase this product again or recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d resisted getting one for her because I like her curls better than straight.  But she&#x27;s wanted one for years so I finally relented, just when her friends also got her one.  This one is better than her other, which I think was a Revlon. She&#x27;s very happy with it and uses it all the time.  Darn.</li>
    <li> It kept blowing fuses in hotels while in Greece, so was unable to use.</li>
    <li> Very nice straightener. It does exactly what I want it to do. I&#x27;m very pleased! I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This a great product, especially for the price. I love all of the features and it heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> My CHI broke. My husband glued it several times, then said he was done so I was on the hunt for a new flat iron. I was greatly surprised when I received my new HSI iron in the mail at a 1\3 of the price of a CHI. Fantastic! If you are trying to decide. Go for it.</li>
    <li> So far I like the flatiron, I love that it is temperature controlled and auto shut off. However, when I first got the iron my hair would pull a little and not go through smoothly. Instead of sending it back, I tried to make sure I was using less pressure than I used with my other flatiron and it seemed make a big difference. The blinking light, when it&#x27;s off is disturbing at night so I have to unplug it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good iron for a long time. After reading other reviews I ordered it. I have been using it for a year now and love it. It has multiple heat settings and leaves hair pretty shiny and straight. It came with oil which I really liked. Overall fully satisfied with the product. very good quality for a reasonable price...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted for a great price!</li>
    <li> I am a huge amazon purchaser and I tend to usually agree with positive reviews, however, this is by far the worst flat iron I have ever used or purchased.  Sadly, I assumed to quickly that it would be great and threw out the box so I cannot return it.  I have since ordered a new flat iron after giving this one a try a few days and am so much happier.  This iron does not get hot enough (I don&#x27;t even have curly hair - it is wavy) and I just don&#x27;t like what it does (or doesn&#x27;t do) to my hair......do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Really great quality flat iron. My hair is natural so I needed something with some real heat BUT not scorching heat. This flat is just as good as the higher priced CHI brand and I love the travel/storage pouch.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant in buying this but hands down it is awesome! WELL worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and reheats faster. It slides smoothly over the hair without pulling out one strand. It&#x27;s easy to add &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; with it&#x27;s rounded edges. Easy to grip and hold. A nice side note bonus is that is elegant looking.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a little travel pouch which is nice but I&#x27;m not sure how long it will hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with 1 glove and some sort of oil but no explanation on what that&#x27;s for which makes me feel like an idiot. Maybe someone can fill me in?</li>
    <li> THE.BEST.STRAIGHTNER.EVER!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your $$ (like I did for years) on &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand ones!!!! It came to me with prompt &amp; precise delivery! Included the Straightner, travel pouch with glove &amp; travel Argan oil treatment! AGAIN BEST STRAIGHTNER EVER!!!! AND SUPERIOR SERVICE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good and quick service</li>
    <li> Loved the light up temperature window on this unit.  Told me both when the power was working and if it had gotten too hot so that I did not burn my hair.  It does have a built in converter but seeing the temperature did save my hair on a few occasions.  Have retired my other straightener for this one at home as well. It&#x27;s a bit hard to see the control but made up for that by saving my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and leaves my hair smooth and shimmery. I particularly like the precision temperature control; helps you to use the lowest possible setting while still shaping your hair. Great price for a salon quality iron.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener for a very reasonable price. I have had it for couple months now and can&#x27;t complain about a thing.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this, I love that I CAN STRAIGHTEN AND CURL WITH THIS!!! Its works so fast and it&#x27;s easy!</li>
    <li> The plate is good and leaves very nice , shiny and smooth hair. but it does not last long .&lt;br /&gt;Moreover the cassette plug is poor is separated into two parts . I have to apply a special glue or something .</li>
    <li> This is absolutely awesome for the price.  Outperforms all of the previous drugstore flat irons we have tried, but not crazy overpriced like Chi or others.  Love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome! It heats up fast, stays hot and really straightens my curly hair easily!  I would definitely buy one again!</li>
    <li> Awesome Product!  I love the way it heats up so quickly, and makes my hair straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go to Europe with because of its worldwide electrical capacity. While it is a good product, it is NOT a CHI. I have owned CHIs for years, However, in a pinch, it was fine. It was great to be able to straighten my hair in PARIS!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Received it extremely quickly!</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron!  The best I&#x27;ve ever had!  Forget chi!  It was delivered quickly. Great product, great customer service.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done but doesn&#x27;t work as well as other nicer straighteners I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly. This is a fabulous product. My hair looks smoother, curls better without being fried and stays in place better all day. The pouch is a great travel item. I took this on a trip and accidentally left it in the hotel. I will be purchasing another asap! Can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying this. It heats up fast. It has a swivel cord which makes it easy to use. Temperature can be adjusted. I only use the middle setting and it&#x27;s hot enough for my purposes. I can say that it is very comparable to those that cost double it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Love these flat irons</li>
    <li> I had higher expectations based on the reviews.  I had a CHI straightener that died after one year, and I then bought a cheapie $20 model to tide me over until I could do some research.&lt;br /&gt;I like how smoothly my hair slides through this flat iron - the primary reason I am replacing the cheap model is because it snags my hair.  But the controls are in an awkward spot and it&#x27;s hard to see how high the temperature has been set.  This flat iron did not hold heat well, and even setting it at its highest temperature did not result in the iron getting as warm as my cheapie model at a lower setting.  I like to use my flat iron to curl my hair as well as straighten it.  Again, this flat iron did not perform as well as my current one at making curls.&lt;br /&gt;I went to a local beauty supply store, and the salesperson recommended a model just slightly more expensive than this flat iron.  I love it and am returning this one.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works just as well as my previous flat iron that I paid $150 for.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> In love with this iron. I have type 4a hair and this straightens beautifully in one swipe with a little heat protective serum. The shine left behind is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Very nice iron for the price. It straightens my hair pretty well, but my hair is fine and slightly wavy. It may not work as well on thicker, coarse hair. I have had irons that get my hair more sleek, but for 3 times the price of this one. It&#x27;s very durable, because I have dropped it countless times and it is still working fine.</li>
    <li> I feel like most of the reviews I skimmed through were a little out-dated so I was slightly mislead about the quality of the straightener.  It works, it gets hot, and does the job.  However, I actually find that this straightener takes a while to heat-up and I like doing my hair pretty quickly .  I think since most of these reviews are a few years old, the straightener heated up quickly for that time but compare to other straighteners today it&#x27;s not that quick.  Also, I prefer having a smaller outlet connector plug - this one is really bulky like a hairdryer which makes it not as compact as my previous hair irons.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron by far the best I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used many ranging from $99 to $300. I was shocked to find it on amazon for $40 after reading all the reviews on other sites charging $100+ so thought why not for $40 and I&#x27;m so glad I did this makes my hair soft, shiny, and most of all FLAT!!!&#x27; Don&#x27;t wait get it now.</li>
    <li> The lady I boight it for loves it</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after reading all the amazing reviews , and when I received it I understood why. The plate is a bit heavier than usual flat irons, but it had my hair so straight . I generally change flat irons ever so often but will stick with this for a while!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great value for the price</li>
    <li> Received the product quickly! Very reliable and had a great experience. Straightener is awesome</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron with the sole purpose of using it while on a recent  trip to Italy.  While in Italy, it worked beautifully and did not snag my hair, like another Dual Voltage Iron did, which I also bought off Amazon.  Because this was a last minute purchase to replace the other flat iron, which I had time to try before leaving for my trip, I packed it,  without trying, and hoped for the best.  The flat iron heats up quickly, glides smoothly over my very wavy hair, and leaves my hair with a nice shine.  I like it so well, it will replace my CHI iron, which I use at home.  Just a note of reminder for those considering this iron for international travel....you will need to plug this iron into an adapter, as unlike the iron I returned because it pulled my hair terribly, this one does not come with the adapters.  Chances are, however, that if you are traveling internationally, you will already be packing adapters.  No converter is needed as this is a dual voltage iron.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this works great!!! Still trying to get used to the fact that there&#x27;s no automatic shut off but as far as the product performance I love it and it works well!!!</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied. I like the weight of the product and am not concerned about being burned if I reach down too far on the handle.</li>
    <li> fast service and great product</li>
    <li> This is our 2nd one! The only reason it had to be replaced was because it was dropped and shattered.  Highest quality, lowest price.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this product. Great price for the item. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My old straightener started to die and so I looked up reviews and got this one. Have had for a couple of months and still very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I am a Professional California Licensed Cosmetologist, and absolutely LOVE this flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the storage bag.</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional 1&amp;#34; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron was not what I expected and I don&#x27;t understand all the &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; reviews.  I have a 7 year old straightener that was dying and needed replacing.  My 7 year old straightener which doesn&#x27;t work well anymore did a much better job than this.  The HSI dried out the ends of my hair and it did not get as hot as advertised so I kept having to go over the hair many many times to achieve the desired smooth look.  I already have fairly straight hair I just use the straightener to smooth my hair so it&#x27;s not like I am using it on extremely curly hair either.  I&#x27;m always told by hairdressers that I have really &amp;#34;healthy good&amp;#34; hair so it&#x27;s also not like my hair was already extremely damaged.  The HSI only did one thing really well - make my hair extremely dry.</li>
    <li> Really like it! Only used it once but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews I had to try this flat iron out. I have used a CHI for years but I love this flat iron. I would recommend saving your money or purchasing two and give one away. It works great on my hair, and works better than my Chi ever did.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a month or so but it definitely met my expectations. I like the different size wands &amp; it heats up well.</li>
    <li> Awesome iron for Great Price. On par with Chi</li>
    <li> excellent product, easy to use, good size for short hair</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I have ever purchased and I don&#x27;t regret it at all. It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair nor does it leave it frizzy or curly.</li>
    <li> What a great price for such a great flat iron. Left my hair feeling silky smooth and soft...not stuff and fried. Love this flat iron so far no issues with its performance or durability. Loving it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great.  My previous one just died out of the blue after only 1.5 years (different brand).  I would definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Bought to replace two from another popular company and so far so good. Works really well!</li>
    <li> Boy was I surprised about this product....it works better than my 100 buck CHI... It will be my go to straightener... Just hope it works well when I go to Ireland this summer!</li>
    <li> Use it often and love it!</li>
    <li> First product pulled/broke my hair while straightening. The company emailed me and once I told them the issue sent me a replacement. The second is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Its great for the price</li>
    <li> My wife and 2 daughters use this iron and say it works great.</li>
    <li> I like it but it sometimes seems to pull my hair as the shaft part isn&#x27;t as large as what I was using. This is a fraction of the cost of the Chi so works fairly well as a substitute.</li>
    <li> Heavy and sturdy feel. Heats very quickly, cools fast too. Hair doesn&#x27;t snag like it does with cheaper products.</li>
    <li> fantastic hair straightener!!</li>
    <li> It works great but it wont stay heated at 450 long enough to straighten all my hair</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron for my step daughter. She absolutely loves it and it is really affordable.</li>
    <li> I chose the HSI flat iron after reading several reviews regarding differences between tourmaline  ionic and ceramic plus features. Price was also a factor.  I like the ability to select a heat setting since I have really thin hair.  Having the ready light on the outside makes it easy to see.  It heats up quickly and easy to use though it is a little heavy.  The travel pouch is a plus for packing and protecting the iron.  I can&#x27;t believe a more expensive iron is any better.  If it lasts I will be thrilled!</li>
    <li> I loved the way this made my hair feel. Unfortunatly the platic piece that covers the plug broke off. I dropped it only a few inces from the ground and it broke off  I tried using it without but it sparked so I had to throw it out. Very dissappointed because it was a great straightner.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great.  It heats up fast and cools down pretty quick.  It has a long cord which is great.</li>
    <li> I really struggled writing this review. One reason is simple..I received an email from the seller, basically stating that if I didn&#x27;t like it to contact them. Doesn&#x27;t this defeat the whole entire purpose of these reviews? I thought about contacting them and even returning but decided I wanted to post my honest opinion and just get over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things I don&#x27;t like about this flat iron. One thing is the size (circumference) of the barrel. I have shorter hair and it makes flat ironing and curling very difficult. I have also had a lot of damage to my hair since I started using this new iron and never had that issue before, even when I used to flat iron my hair when it was extremely long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light indicator is another issue. It apparently only indicates when the iron is on, not anything else. It would be great if it changed colors to indicate when the iron was at the set temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had this product super long and I am already noticing some wear to the plates and that is very disappointing. Just not happy with this flat iron and I bought it based on all of the great reviews.</li>
    <li> I liike the flat iron and the HSI  lotion sample that came with it. After trying the two together I bought a big size bottle.</li>
    <li> wish it had automatic shut off.Works great</li>
    <li> I love using this straightener and the shipping company is also great. I do recommend the CHI straighteners</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> First time I used it internationally the assembly came apart and the active electrical component was on the floor with the plug in the wall, and a worthless casing in my hand.  This was such a DANGEROUS SITUATION.  If the electrical component had come in contact with my skin on the way to the floor, I would have quite a burn or worse.  My husband, who is an engineer, quickly uplugged the wall connection and immediately saw that NO screws had been put into the assembly so there was nothing to hold the device together.  There were holes for screws, but none had been used.  Quality controls seems to be lacking for HSI even though it had a quality inspector indicated.  Since this was the beginning of an almost 3 week trip, he put an improvised fastening device in place and I was able to use it.  However, I was so afraid that the assembly would come apart again, I used it sparingly and it was a stressful endeavor to straighten my hair.  I do have to say that the dual voltage worked well and did not create a hair frying experience like what you get when you try and use your US appliance with a transformer.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural and curly. Love the way my hair feels after using this product.  Leaves hair silky smooth and and shiny.  Recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product. I like it because you can also curl your hair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product and speedy service</li>
    <li> A great flatiron for the price.  Heats ups quickly, feels substantial. Perfect results.</li>
    <li> Works very well to smooth my wavy, frizzy hair. Heats up very fast and get plenty hot. The seller is awesome and provided excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Great product that really tames my wavy tresses. with short hair, I needed the 1&amp;#34; model and it works very well! I love it!</li>
    <li> She tells me, &amp;#34;I love it!&amp;#34; so it must work, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> My fave straightener, so much that I owned one for 3 years and recently broke the ceramic plate when dropping it. Had to get a new one. Only difference I didn&#x27;t like was the new ones plug changed to the bulky style plug.</li>
    <li> Gets very hot and straightens your hair without burning it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend. She normally buys the expensive ones, i didnt tell her what i paid for it until after she used it. She swore it was a top dollar straightener. She like it better than all the other chi irons she has had</li>
    <li> Product supports most of what it claims.  I would say it&#x27;s a good value.  Not totally sold on &#x27;professional&#x27; quality.  My teenage daughter and I both have thick hair.  Sill have to go over hair more than once to get super straight.  It does heat up very quickly and is well built.  For the price I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I buy an iron hair straightener and can not rate or compare it against another.  I selected the Ionic flat iron based on it&#x27;s review rating and so far (used it only three times, though) it&#x27;s been a good tool for my hair.  I have not encountered any malfunctions or issues...  It&#x27;s very smooth when pulling down or working on my hair, surprising for me being a first timer.  I assume, like everything else, over usage may harmful the hair in the long run.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes my hair smooth and shiny.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Was a great birthday present</li>
    <li> GREAT, better than any other hot iron that I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl friend a while ago to replace the one she had. She uses it almost daily and loves it. She bought one for her mom and sister who have also loved it. Great Buy</li>
    <li> I use this iron everyday.  It&#x27;s easy to use even for someone who has never used one before.  Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It is the best flat iron I have ever owned. I would recommend this product to any female.</li>
    <li> I will never purchase any other brand. I love these Irons I was unsure when I ordered, but I ordered any way after reading many reviews. I must say the reviews are real this is the best Iron I have ever used in my life. They should be around for a very long time. I also have a Jose Eber 100% ceramic iron and it could not touch this HSI. I am still in awe. On top of that the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;I am Black and my hair is nappy and I mean the real nappy If you are black you know what I am talking about. But anyways  you will not regret purchasing this iron. I promise you that. I hope they last long. They do come with a year warranty so that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t last long I&#x27;m gonna be mad. Over all thumbs up on this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best and most amaizing flat iron i ever had purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It lets my relaxer hair wonderfull and looking very natural snd healthy. It came with a promo of a little bottler of argan oil which is faboulous and lets hair smooth and shinny.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend both. Try and you&#x27;ll never be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair!  Love it!  Would recommend it to anyone who wants to straighten their hair!</li>
    <li> I returned after two uses. It caught and pulled my hair with every pass through and did not get hot enough for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this may not be a deal breaker for most, but I did not like that it had a large style plug rather than the regular, small direct type. This meant that I could not have it plugged in at the same time as my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I would keep the temperature low as it heats up very quick. The only drawback is sometimes my hair gets stuck on the top of the straightenet.</li>
    <li> I paid more than double for a Chi and this straightener works twice as good as that one. My hair is extremely thick and curly, too, so I have a hard time finding a good flat iron. I don&#x27;t think any brand will ever be a &amp;#34;one pass straightener&amp;#34; for my hair, but this is as good as it gets IMO.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair but this straightener, with adjustable temperature settings, gets my hair extremely straight. I&#x27;ve been using this model for about 6 months and have been very happy with it. It comes with a nice travel bag and a glove to use to protect your hand when your hair gets hot. The straightener is also compatible with different kinds of electricity so you won&#x27;t need a converter if using the product during international travel. (Just an adapter to fit the plug into the wall). There is no reason to pay a lot of money for a straightener when you can get this one and have beautiful straight hair very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative on this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off switch if it&#x27;s left on too long. You just have to remember to turn it off when you are finished styling your hair.</li>
    <li> Was so psyched from the reviews to purchase this! Tried it out and it pulls my hair on every swipe! Maybe it&#x27;s because I have fine hair, but this doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this exact flat iron before and my second wasn&#x27;t as great quality. It feels harsher on my hair, but good for the price.</li>
    <li> I had a CHI before buying this hair straightener... I bought it because of the reviews... I have wavy thick hair... I HATE THIS STRAIGHTENER!!!! It snags at the bottom... I can hear it damaging my tips of my hair... The ceramic does not feel like a good quality ceramic... I truly feel like it is damaging my hair... I had my CHI for over 10 years and I truly got what I paid for with it...</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener that heats up quickly and does the job perfectly. Ive only had 2-3 straighteners before this one, but this one is by far the best one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I had a flat iron that I bought 10 years ago and it just wasn&#x27;t really doing it&#x27;s job anymore (can you blame it?!) so I decided to try this one and it exceeded all my expectations. It&#x27;s pretty thin compared to my old one but it works 10 times better. Not only does my hair come out super straight but it stays straight which was a problem I had with the other one. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly! Long cord! Works fantastic even on medium heat which is much better for my hair than using the highest setting like my previous iron. Sleek design looks nice in the drawer too! Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better value.&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it had an automatic shut off but I just had to train myself to unplug it and put in the drawer when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron! !!.... GETS hot fast!! And it easy to use..It also comes with a glove. .. because like I said they get very Hot...I love it!!!...also came really fast. ..</li>
    <li> Love it! I use to have a Chi and I like this one better!</li>
    <li> This iron gives the exact results of the more expensive $100 irons for a better prices.  I purchased the older model and the heat control is just a knob and not a digital readout.</li>
    <li> It is good. Not as good as I had hoped for but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Although I rely heavily on customer reviews, I very rarely write them myself. However, this straightener is so good I can&#x27;t not write a review. I have tried/owned at a minimum of 5-10 different straighteners, both inexpensive and high end and this is the BEST. Amongst those are Helen of Troy, CHI, Conair, Wigo, Ken Paves, Bio-Ionic, and FHI. Up until I tried this straightener, FHI was my favorite and CHI was my least. I have normal/coarse/wavy hair-not crazy frizzy, but not pretty either. This straightener is the best in my opinion because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it heated up very fast&lt;br /&gt;-has an on/off switch (which I didn&#x27;t care about until I had a toddler)&lt;br /&gt;-heats to a higher temperature then my other straighteners, yet I do not feel like it &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; my hair&lt;br /&gt;-my first test of any straightener is to squeeze it closed and check to see it closes tight/secure/no light can be seen between plates...it was perfect&lt;br /&gt;-my hair never got caught/pulled where the plates are attached&lt;br /&gt;-for the first time, my hair still smelled good/clean..not stinky/burned being masked by a clean hair smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this straightener died in a month, I would absolutely buy it again. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great customer service. Product arrived quickly and as advertised. The argon oil is a great product and leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister in law and she loves it. Great price. I&#x27;ll definitely look into this one when mine gives up.</li>
    <li> It was disappointing, as I had purchased a cheaper iron from a local beauty store and returned it expecting this one to be much better, which is was not. The ceramic plates don&#x27;t smooth as easily as some irons, and they seem to be more damaging to my hair. I would not recommend paying for this iron when you can get a  better one in the local beauty store for less.</li>
    <li> My 2nd favorite Flat Iron aside from CHI. This really works perfectly too and glides well just like the CHI Iron !</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife about a year ago and it worked flawlessly. do to an unfortunate accident, water destroyed it. So I ordered another one. This one had the same model number and looked exactly the same with the exception with one small......annoying detail. the ceramic plates are housed by a small plastic prong at each corner of both plates which would pull on my wifes hair. If you order this ensure it looks like the picture, if not be ready for your hair to be pulled. why HSI would change a great item makes no sense to me. Now its off to search for something else.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for home use</li>
    <li> With this, I can straighten and curl my hair easily, and it only takes like less than 30 seconds to heat up. Very convenient  too , light (can be used in different countries) highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> Straightens my hair pretty well but I was really looking forward to curling my hair with it more. Unfortunately my hair doesn&#x27;t glide through and gets caught in between. I love the argan oil tho!</li>
    <li> Works great on my thick curly hair.i even bought another one as a gift.</li>
    <li> Works great. Good price too. Love my new straightener.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and I love it. Heats quickly, very easy to use and styling results are great. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Highly recommend the flat iron and the vendor.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described. High quality.  Works great.  I would recommend this to anyone.  professional style flat iron for home use.</li>
    <li> I had another brand that was highly recommended but ended up having to buy one every year.  The heat kept turning off.  The HSI  heats up quickly, and you can adjust the temperature.  It is actually less expensive so  great value for all it does.  The only down side is that it is a little difficult to get to the on/off switch, but the quality is so good this does not matter to me.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look silky and smooth.  It does not fry my hair.  I have seen some comments about it not being hot enough, but I think it is just right.  The hotter it is, the more fried your hair becomes...Hair looks great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many different straighteners through the years.  This is better than the more expensive brands.  I have tried a few of the more expensive ones and this exceeds in performance and value.  Love love love it!</li>
    <li> Great product for a reasonable price! This is the best price that I&#x27;ve seen. The flat iron works really well and gets hot easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because in order to get my fine hair to do anything at all, I had to turn the heat up to 400. Also, I have not been able to clean the product of the surface of the ceramic.  I have tried the warm water on a still warm iron per the instructions but it does not remove the product i.e., hair spray, etc.  I also used a cotton ball with a little alcohol on the warm plates but still could not remove the product.  Seems there is not a good solution to keeping the ceramic plates clean.  In that case, it won&#x27;t last long before I have to replace it.</li>
    <li> My sister in law loved this as a gift for chrismas. She said it works better than her CHI ever did.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great because it gets so hot and I really need that for my thick hair.  However, I think its a total tragedy that there is no auto shut off mechanism.  I mean if you forget to turn it off you could seriously burn your house down.  I would def recommend the manufacturer of this to rethink their product.  I hate using it only for this fact that I have to remember to unplug it every time after use.  I thought it would be a US requirement for this to be a part of the makeup of the product</li>
    <li> As someone with wavy-curly hair, I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair straightener. I&#x27;ve tried several ones in the past, but most of them ended up giving me split ends as well as added frizziness that I certainly didn&#x27;t need. When I got this flat iron, I was absolutely in love. It heats up really quickly and I don&#x27;t have to straighten one strand several times but just once and it&#x27;ll do the job. The only reason that I took off a star was because my box didn&#x27;t have the argan oil nor the glove inside. :(&lt;br /&gt;But overall, AMAZING!!!! Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for several months now and I love it!  It does a great job.  My only complaint would be that sometimes it takes a while to heat up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the other positive reviews which is what convinced me to purchase this!!  Heats up quick and works great!!  Great packaging also!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these in Sept. and was expecting these to atleast last a year. It is now March and they get no where as hot as they did when I got them. They only was good for about 6 months. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to use.  Purchased this with a very good Argan Oil and have been so happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price and speedy delivery. I love that it has a really long cord and heats up in under 3 minutes. Downfall is that you can&#x27;t control the heat- it&#x27;s just either on or off. But it straightens my hair well as is.</li>
    <li> Great product. Even on the lowest setting I get straight hair that lasts all day even after a sweaty workout.</li>
    <li> Works great. Heats up fast and evenly. Plates are smooth and firmly placed, no gaps that catch and pull your hair out. The placement of the digital display and button controls is awkward, on the inside of the handle, which I guess is necessary because your hand would hit them if they were on the outside. But it is kinda hard to read it. Much higher quality than what you find at the drugstore with Conair, etc.</li>
    <li> After the cord broke on my $100+ straightener, I had been converted to the importance of a high quality straightener but had a hard time stomaching the price of another. I took a chance on this and I&#x27;m glad I did. It performs as well as my old model and this one even has a temperature control (my old one didn&#x27;t). No complaints here! The price is right and it works!</li>
    <li> It is exactly as the description states. And it comes with a heat glove which is so useful- if you&#x27;ve never tried straightening your hair with one before you will fall in love. No more waiting in between strands for your hair to &amp;#34;cool down&amp;#34; before you pick up another piece. Instantly straightens my curly, frizzy hair with one or two irons.</li>
    <li> I rate this a 3.5.  It heats up very well and my kids love it.  What I dislike  about it is it&#x27;s bulk? I was looking for something a bit thinner in size.</li>
    <li> It would get 5 stars if my hair pulled through it as smooth as my old iron. Other than that I think it works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and I like it so far. It&#x27;s a great deal for the price, and the quality is good. It heats up fast. My hair is long and thick, so it&#x27;s always a pain trying to find a new straightener that does a good job and this one does! It straightens my hair at 415 degrees, so I don&#x27;t even need to put it at the maximum temperature in order for it to work. I do wish the iron was a bit thicker, but I can deal with it. I especially like the red carrying case it comes in, although it&#x27;s a bit difficult to fit the cord in there with it. Nice gesture, either way.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I haven&#x27;t even had this product for a year and it will no longer heat up past 116 degrees. Now I&#x27;m without a straightener and HSI won&#x27;t respond to my emails.    Honestly, I just got the product today. I usually straighten my hair in the morning but I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this one out! I washed and conditioned my hair and dried it complete. (This is a professional hair straightener, do NOT use it with wet hair!) I have normal hair, not too thin, not too thick. However, I have been on a medication lately that has been making me lose more hair than usual, (I&#x27;m only 20). I adjusted the temperature to 270 degrees F. My hair straightens very quickly normally, maybe fifteen minutes. This did not change. My hair is 100% less frizzy and 100% softer! I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a new straightener. Spend the extra $20-30 on a flat iron that isn&#x27;t going to tug and pull on your hair causing split ends left and right. I love my HSI.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The only thing I dislike about it is that it does not automatically shut-off.  I am not use to this and have left it on for hrs on accident.  Not very safe.  Wish it had this feature.</li>
    <li> I was looking to get a flat iron and a curling iron when I noticed this product could straighten and curl. Therefore, I figured this would be perfect for me since they advertised that it could do both.  The product arrived within the suggested time frame, which was fairly quickly, and appeared to be in great condition.  Upon further examination, I noticed the flat iron had a bit of weird white residue around the plates.  I&#x27;m not sure what the residue was, but I did not dwell on it too much as there was not a lot of it.  However,  it states that the product is in &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; condition and in my opinion, that means there should not have been any sort of residue on it.  Looking past that, it is a good hair straightener.  After using it, my hair feels very smooth and looks shiny. It definitely serves it&#x27;s purpose as a flat iron.  In addition, I would NOT recommend buying this product to use for curling.  I attempted to curl my hair and all it did was put a slight &amp;#34;kink&amp;#34; in it.  I have thin and slight wavy hair so it usually takes to straightening and curling pretty easily.  Overall, this is a good flat iron for straightening your hair.  It gets a rating of 3 stars due to weird white residue and its lack of curling capabilities.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this iron because most of the reviews were good and the price was hard to beat.  The iron worked fine, it was a little slower to heat up, about a minute or so.  While the iron did a very good job of straightening my hair it did not glide as smoothly as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> I have short hair.  does not work well on short, fine hair.  Had to return it.  It was a lot better price than QVC or HSN however.  So depending on your hair, might be wonderful</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new flat iron. I checked with my hair stylist on what brand I should get. After looking at this one and comparing it to what she recommend. The review&#x27;s on this one where so amazing that I had to try it. I&#x27;m so glad I did!! I love how fast it heats up and make my unruly hair so shinny and nice. I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s in the market for one. Its the best one I&#x27;ve ever bought, and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to some, Paul Mitchell, Chi, etc.</li>
    <li> Purchased this thermal flat iron for professional use in a salon.  I have used it and found it to be very nice.  The company was prompt and courteous  and I would buy from them again should the need arise.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener - it heats up incredibly fast and leaves my hair straight and silky.  This was the first straigtener I ever purchased and I use it religiously.</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly, got a nice pouch, and came with glove so its definitely a good deal.  I use it to give my hair wave and it does the trick.  Straightens well.  Bonus which I wasn&#x27;t aware is that you can travel anywhere around the world as it converts.  Just need the plug adapter.  Worth what I paid and more.  Also came with Aragon oil sample.</li>
    <li> Before I had purchased this HSI flat iron, I was using a Conair that I had found for $15.  The Conair obviously wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough to do my hair.  Spend the money &amp; get a decent one.  I am well satisfied, &amp; I was also very happy with how well the sample bottle of argan oil worked with it.  I recommend them both!</li>
    <li> this flat iron was reasonably priced &amp; does a fantastic job.  Very pleased with my purchase.  Make sure you give it plenty of time to heat up.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well I just received it and it said that I was suppose to get the argan oil but didn&#x27;t receive any</li>
    <li> Update:  This broke, did not make it to two years. :(.  It started acting up a few weeks ago, where it would not turn on right away and I had to fuss with the reset button to make it work.  Yesterday, I was using it, and all of a sudden it went off and now will not turn on again.  Had to order a new iron, went with a different brand this time since this one didn&#x27;t last.     I had a professional grade flat iron for about 9 years and finally dropped it one too many times.  Had to replace it and was looking around and saw this on Amazon.  For the price, this flat iron is amazing!  Do I think it is the BEST product available?  No but again, for the price it is great.  I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair and this works well for me.  I think I would prefer a more definite temperature selection than the little wheel with no numbers on it but I always need the max anyway. If this lasts for two years then I will feel I got my  money&#x27;s worth.  I would recommend this product if asked and especially at this low price :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron on a whim.  My flat iron was old and while searching for a new one, I came upon this one.  The reviews were all good so I went ahead and ordered.  It was shipped and delivered within a week.  I was unhappy with the iron itself.  Turns out, I received the wrong model, which was actually a plus because the temp went up to 450 instead of 400.  Since I have thick, unruly, 2b wavy/curly hair, my obvious choice was to select the 450 setting and start straightening. The first few sections turned out ok.  However, after I few minutes I noticed the irons temperature kept changing, it was like it was falling with each swipe on my hair and only raising if I waited 2-3 minutes between sections.  I&#x27;d flat iron a little, 315, sit for a few minutes, back up to 450.  Flat iron a little more 342, wait some more, 450.  It would up taking double the time to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the seller and their response was promt, they gave me the option of an echcange or full returned, I opted to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible I got a deffective item. But it&#x27;s also possible that I should&#x27;ve just went with my gut, not been so cheap and spent the extra $30 on the Rusk.  Which I would up doing. If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned in taking care of my hair, it&#x27;s you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener to replace an old one I had bought on sale at a hair salon.  What a huge difference.  I could straighten my hair much faster with this one, my hair felt a lot softer after, and the style and slight curl I was trying to get was so much easier.  Great price and service, packaging was well done too.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like it, it does the job. The cons it pulls the hairs in the creases slash sides of the flat iron. Maybe that is due to the floating plates.  I don&#x27;t like that I do not know the exact temperature, it is a guestamation (if that&#x27;s a word) it goes up to 410. I would recommend it to another person. It gets hot quickly. My hair did look shinier without any oil added to it. It comes with a glove and a small jar of Argan oil same brand as the flat iron. That was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> This product is high quality and works very well. I would recommend this to everyone. It&#x27;s leaves your hair so smooth and straight with very little time or effort.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks use, I am very happy with the HSI Flat Iron Straightener. I like it much better than any other brands I have tried.  It straightens without damaging, is easy to handle and has the dual voltage I needed.</li>
    <li> Spendore and get auto shut off!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a terrific product.  It is hot but doesn&#x27;t singe hair.  I&#x27;m planning on ordering a second one for my family.</li>
    <li> works great, better than more expensive irons.  the oil is wonderful and the customer service outstanding.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It heats up fast, you can choose different temperature based on your hair thickness. The seller shipped product fast as well. Good experience.</li>
    <li> This iron works great and it was a fantastic price.  I liked the argan oil sample packet so now I will buy more of that.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The service was FAST as well.</li>
    <li> I used my flat iron and was very satisfied and was happy with how easy it was to handle.  I would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> Love this straigjtener! Returned my Chi after reading online reviews and am completely happy.</li>
    <li> I believe this flat iron works well but since I&#x27;ve never flatten my hair before I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to best use it.  I&#x27;ve used the Argon Oil and other products I start by blow drying my hair on low then attempting to straighten it.... it seems to always come out frizzy and not that straight.  My hair is like Shirley Temple&#x27;s.. just Tons of spiral curls.. drives me nuts.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the flat iron&#x27;s fault I think it&#x27;s the operator that&#x27;s the problem !! :-)</li>
    <li> Does the job. It&#x27;s a good Fi. My hair seemed a little frizzy afterwards but it was combed to perfection.</li>
    <li> Mi wife and my 2 daughters loved it. It heat fast, and easy to set. Nothing special, but good product.</li>
    <li> hair got stuck in between of the crack where the plate was binded to the handle... really hurtful each time i need to straighten up my hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I purchased the flat iron for a trip to Ireland.  It perform well on my thick hair and straighten my hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was my favorite beauty buy in the last year.  It was a great price, and is a quality product.</li>
    <li> love it! heats up quick, straightens beautifully. Excellent price. I read some reviews about it being heavy, i was expecting 1980&#x27;s heavy but it was&#x27;nt. It just felt like a regular hair straightener.</li>
    <li> iron works pretty well, not hot enough to use with keratin treatment</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and the receiver was thrilled to get it, she had always wanted a flat iron.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this flat iron and it was a back to school gift she found and we purchased it for her.</li>
    <li> I didnt buy mine off amazon but i have it and it works really good. I used it to straighten my moms and friends hair. Ive had it for a long time and it still looks brand new. I love it because it doesnt fry my hair, its the perf temp.I also love it because of the marble inside, it prevents it from chipping away or things to stick to it.</li>
    <li> Everything was as described, great product,  price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at a great discount and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! It straightens my hair with out frying it and it leaves it smooth and shiny.  So easy to use.  Heats up quickly.  I just wish that the controls were on the outside of handle rather than between handles, but that is just a minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best out there. But for the price It is better than any thing you could get from Walmart.</li>
    <li> Helpful when traveling to Europe because of the dual voltage feature.</li>
    <li> Not what I was hoping for. This straightener doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I was expecting and doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair as smooth as others I have tried in the past. It works just okay for now, but I will most likely be looking to buy a different straghtener soon.</li>
    <li> This is about as good as a product the mall was trying to sell for $250. Just love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s lightweight, it heats fast and is easy to use. I love it! It makes really nice curls as well!</li>
    <li> THE PROS:&lt;br /&gt;The controls are simple and intuitive: on/off switch, dial for temperature, LED changing from red when heating to green when ready.&lt;br /&gt;The cord has a swivel at the end to eliminate kinks and tangles.&lt;br /&gt;The handgrip stays cool, even after the iron&#x27;s been in use for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus glove and pouch protect both your hands when using and your equipment in transit.&lt;br /&gt;For someone inexperienced in hair appliances, it&#x27;s simple to use and gives great results.&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic plates straighten without drying hair out, though it&#x27;s still a good idea to use a heat protectant spray.&lt;br /&gt;It handles a wide range of hair thicknesses and textures: my hair doesn&#x27;t burn (moderately thin, very fine, wavy, and auburn), and my sister&#x27;s hair actually gets straight (very thick, almost coarse, curly, and ash blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE \\&quot;YOU SHOULD KNOW\\&quot;S:&lt;br /&gt;None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE END RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron was recommended to me by a friend as the best buy if I wanted a low price, good quality, and ceramic plates that wouldn&#x27;t fry my hair, and I&#x27;m so glad I listened to her. For professional quality at drugstore prices, I cannot suggest anything better.</li>
    <li> For the price this iron performs great.  This is the second one I purchased because my teenage daughter has decided the first one belongs to her and it is almost a year ago but still going strong.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this straightener. It makes my hair look and feel wonderful. Have had a lot of compliments since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Still need to get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.....love the product</li>
    <li> Not good at all, after using it fora few minutes or turns off and it takes to long to heat up.</li>
    <li> This straightener stopped working well after a year. I went back to the Chi after looking for a cheaper option. I also tried the Sally Beauty Supply brand which was also a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I love this straighter. It works great!!! And the price is perfect. My chi straighter was getting old and after having my baby I cant splurge like I used to, but im glad I didnt this straighter works better than chi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dont straighten a large amount at once, small sections will give better results.</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I thought it was okay. I have to run it through my hair a few times before it becomes completely straight and it doesn&#x27;t stay straight till the end of the day. I found after a few hours my hair looked wavier. For under $50, it gets the job done but mine just broke after having it a little over a year so I&#x27;m buying a different one now. I personally would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Heats up quickly, does not ruin my hair, and loves that it comes with a pouch to store when I travel. Comes with free hair oil sample as well.</li>
    <li> I thought I just needed a trim so I went and got one yesterday. I straightened my hair this morning and it still worked the same, I feel like it&#x27;s killing my hair. I have naturally straight hair so I just like to go over it to make it look nice. I even bought new flat iron straightening spray and it still seems the same quality straightener. Disappointed, I bought this because the reviews said how great it was. Maybe I just got a dud.</li>
    <li> Excellent company, excellent product!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Leaves my extra fine hair straight and shiny.  Great product for a reasonable price.  I will never buy another brand...HSI is the one for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.  She is the one telling me how she likes it. She says it does take a while to get her entire head of hair straightened.  It is not the hottest setting she has ever used.  I think she wanted a wider paddle.  But that isn&#x27;t the fault of the product.  Keeping that in mind, would likely be the reason she said it takes longer to straighten.  Also, we live in S. Florida.  She wished her hair would stay silky straight, however I&#x27;d say again, likely due to the humidity and the need for a setting product.  I used it, and it worked fine for my hair.</li>
    <li> The wire is always getting tangled up and makes it hard to use wish it got a little hotter :(</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the second best flat iron I have purchased. It get very hot I like the black glove heat protector</li>
    <li> So far a great straightener. I always have brought hot tools brand and loved them but would have to replace it every year because the cord would short out. This HE I has a much better design that should stand up over time.</li>
    <li> Works well, cord doesn&#x27;t fit in the bag.</li>
    <li> I love this iron, i have tried different other products, but this one is something,,, you could make your thick hair straight in only 10 minutes, it is unbelievable, like a stylist . I would recommend this to my friends..</li>
    <li> this flat iron HSI PROFESSIONAL CERAMIC TOURMALINE, is of very good quality, which facilitates.&lt;br /&gt;  the work so you feel, softness and shine,&lt;br /&gt;their thermal, IONIC, finishing allows finishes give the hair a smooth and shiny texture.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it as a stylist because it is one of my favorite tools of the trade&lt;br /&gt;very good ......................love</li>
    <li> works great on my thick, course hair</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. Arrived on time. Much better quality than my previous flatiron. Works incredibly well on my thick African hair. Love that I can use it when I travel.</li>
    <li> Takes my frizzy/curly hair to straight in no time. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of naturally frizzy, wavy (not curly) hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t curly naturally, but it is wavy enough to get a smooth, straight look. This flat iron gets hot enough that it actually gets my hair smooth and straight, and it stays! The Argan oil that comes with it is FABULOUS. I definitely recommend buying that as well. For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I figured this many rave reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong - and I was right! This is a great iron and it rivals any $100-200 iron out there. It gets super hot and straightens my hair with one pass. I really can&#x27;t think of much i&#x27;d change about it. The price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> It is simply amazing. so glad i bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the reviews here, they were very helpful thank you!!</li>
    <li> I bought a flat iron last week. It was a great price and I am very happy with the purchase.I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this flat iron and since it worked so great on my hair I ordered one as well.  It&#x27;s a great product and more than worth the money you will pay for it here on Amazon.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I got it for my little sister as a gift. Every time I see her , she has a straight hair. She loves it and she keeps on thanking me for purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectation. Doesn&#x27;t get hot and I tried using for styling and curling did not curl at all not like my old one.</li>
    <li> It only heats up to 410F which is not high enough if you have a lot of thick hair.  The pouch, glove, and argan oil was nice though.</li>
    <li> I returned the iron since the light that indicates whether it was on or off was missing.  The iron was fine but not save without an on/off light indicator.</li>
    <li> It seems to work as expected.  Only reason for 4 is that I am not as skillful at this point in using flat iron yet and I pinched my hand twice while using it the first time.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It gets hot fast and straightening has never been easier!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The straightener worked well! I was very happy with the results of my hair after using this product. My hair is super curly too, and it made my hair completely straight!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat ironer. I have really curly but not coarse hair. It does its job of flattening my hair very well and ive even used it on my mom who has coarser hair than I do. The only issue I have with it is that it leaves a funny smell, but thats happened to me with all the flat ironers ive owned.</li>
    <li> Used it a few days now.  I have natural &amp;#34;African American&amp;#34; hair and it get&#x27;s it straight.</li>
    <li> Great product, as described and consistent with user reviews. Excellent price point! My curly frizz is quickly transformed into sleek and straight, and the iron doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for texturing hair with heat, Gives hair maximize bounce, and great for curls and waves. But the cool down for the devise takes like 10 minutes, can be an issue if your on the go.</li>
    <li> Loved this straightener! I have thick wavy hair and this straightener did wonders! Love love it!</li>
    <li> this review is based on the purchased I made i believe about a year ago or maybe longer. for these kind of products i rather give it a while to write a rating just to see if i really like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like this iron at all, but i&#x27;m still using it since it still works. I really don&#x27;t see the hype of this iron, it doesn&#x27;t warm up quickly, IT TAKES FOREVER. I plug the cord for this first before i start blow drying my hair, which takes me about ~10 minutes (I have long hair, my hair length is about past my chest). and still, it&#x27;s not fully hot. no matter what temperature i adjust it to. I don&#x27;t think it makes me hair as shiny as what i used to use which was the Solia. I purchased this iron based on the ratings but I just don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;I think what disappointed me the most is how long it takes to warm up and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look anything special (not that shiny, for some reasons my hair still looks slightly frizzy even i use a de-friz serum). Don&#x27;t buy this iron, i really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this on March 10th, what a great product at first. Was very excited about how amazing it was! Around May it just stopped working.  Those two months it was great, but not worth the money! It won&#x27;t heat up past 200 degrees. It&#x27;s ridiculous. So very dissapointed with this product!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my teenage granddaughter.  As far as I know she has been quite pleased with it.</li>
    <li> an amazing product! It gets hot with out burning, curls my hair better than my expensive curling iron. I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I like it, but would actually recommend getting the Infiniti Pro by Conair instead. I had the Conair and absolutely loved it. It does a faster job than the HSI and also less damaging of the hair because of the steam. However this one is good and pretty standard. It&#x27;ll do the job and the cord is long so you can move around more.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Nothing to complain about. For the money it is a good buy. Performing as expected and working well. Time will tell on how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons I have ever purchased and I love the oil that came with it!!</li>
    <li> This product straightens my hair much better than the best product I have used in the past which was the Chi.</li>
    <li> I ordered two flatirons and chose to keep the vibrating flat iron, feeling it was a superior product.  Feel most flatirons are way too high priced for the basic same thing.</li>
    <li> I had a Paul Mitchell flat iron forever and needed to buy a new one... Didn&#x27;t want to spend $120 though... The HSI flat iron is amazing! Good quality- heats up quickly and straightens my hair exactly how I like it! Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Easy to use and grips to hair. Would hightly recommend...great price for this product. Have tried many brands such as Chi and this blows it away.</li>
    <li> I wish the tourmaline plates were a bit wider but aside from that, its a good product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  The delivery was with in a week.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better flat iron especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, it helps a lot to control my freeze hair.</li>
    <li> Flat iron gets really hot so it straightens well! Absolutely love it and the price I paid. I would recommend if you looking for a Chi iron w/o chi price. Love love love!! Also when you leave it on like if you forget you left it on it&#x27;ll turn off by itself.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a co-worker, she did give feed back and let me know it was a good product. She didn&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> I love it....my hair improving every day, it has helped sealing the cuticle and I do use the oil but very little on the ends of my hair I have thyroid issues so the less I do to my thinning hair the better...but with this one swipe of a small portion of hair at a time and my hair looks beautiful and shiny...looove it will buy one for my daughters near christmas time....very pleased</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and not that curly (very easy to straight0 and it didn&#x27;t straight well my hair at all.</li>
    <li> Compared to the ION flatiron this one is just ok. It does the job. I wouldn&#x27;t spend over $40 for it, so I&#x27;d say its a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> It has already broke about 3 months ago.  Only lasted 2 months.  Hope they will make it good!!  Let&#x27;s hope!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to use on my trip to Europe because of the universal capabilities. It worked beautifully. I LOVE it. I actually had an expensive flat iron I had purchased at the mall that I gave away because this one works so much better. FIVE STARS!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a flat iron but couldn&#x27;t decide among the million brands available now. So I decided to go with the amazon top seller and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. It heats up fast and maintains a steady temperature . The indicator light tells me when to iron n when to stop .It straightens out my frizzes in one smooth motion. I use it when ever I need a good hair day ! It definitely lifts my spirits.</li>
    <li> Excellent, Recommended</li>
    <li> At first we were skeptical of ordering this product due to the great ratings and such a low price. It came really fast first of all. My wife was very pleased with how it tamed her very curly thick hair in only 1 to 2 swipes tops. It leaves her hair really silky and shiny without an oily residue. We are very pleased with the product and definitely recommend it to other people that may be skeptical of the price,in this case we got way more than we paid for. thumbs up</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned. I have already recommended it to several friends and coworkers. My hair has never looked this great!</li>
    <li> Many people compared this to CHI, it does not compare. It was horrid, and didn&#x27;t work. Returned it immediately and stuck with my CHI.</li>
    <li> It is great!!&lt;br /&gt;No damege hair, easily use for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;It is worthy of every money. Nice design,&lt;br /&gt;Go get this one. And you will satisfy with this one.</li>
    <li> works well, heats up fast, and is overall a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;small size makes it easy to manipulate for both straightening, or flipping curls by twisting the iron as you pull it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love love love this flat iron.  This is my second one.  Had a chi in between and it was absolutely horrible,  burnt my hair constantly and didn&#x27;t slide through easily.  This is the best iron I have ever use.  Glides through hair easily and never burns my ends.</li>
    <li> Order was on time and it works better than my more expensive one! I&#x27;m very pleased with this flat iron</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Great for price. Looks and results just like one for over one hundred dollars.</li>
    <li> I Bought this iron to use on my trip across Europe because it automatically converts the power to work here in the U.S. or there. It worked very well over there. I had no problem with it. I normally use the chi, but I was equally satisfied with how this iron works on my hair, and the price is phenomenal especially when compared to the price of other salon grade irons.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it . The product makes her hair silky and straight. She just did not like the smell  when it heats up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months now.  Once i finally get my hair straighten it looks nice, however, it takes a long time to get it straightened, and I don&#x27;t even have curly hair (mainly use it for frizzy&#x27;s and to get it straight at the ends).  When the iron is first turned on it takes several minutes for it to even heat up and be ready.  Once it is ready I can only get one thin sectionof hair straightened before it blinks back to red, and then it takes a good 30+ seconds to be warmed up ready for the next strand of hair.  I have tried the straightener turned up all the way 1/2 way and it takes just as long to reheat between sections of hair.  Not sure what all the great reviews are about, or I got a dud!</li>
    <li> It was a great purchase, I highly recommend. It&#x27;s simple to use, fast to heat, easy to hold, cheap and really cute.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this product less than a year ago (replacing a CHI), I was very pleased.  However, after less than a year, I have had a problem with the ceramic plates corroding.  I do often clean the plates with a soft, damp cloth to remove any residual hair product.  The plates have become so corroded/rough that they are damaging my hair as I try to slide my hair through the plates.  I&#x27;m back on Amazon today to purchase a new flat iron.  It will NOT be an HSI Professional</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten hair.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so great about this straightener. I may have just gotten a dud, but this hardly worked at all. It got warm, but nowhere near hot enough to straighten my hair, and I have thin wavy/straight hair. It pulled and snagged my hair at the plates and the whole product overall seemed cheap. I returned it right away- I figured my old 6+ year old straightener did a better job.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! Does not snag my hair, and straightens my unruly thick mess in one press. Very good!</li>
    <li> I would give this product 3.5 stars. I bought this product when the power source of my CHI flat iron crapped out on me.  For half the price of a CHI, I was quite skeptical about the quality of the HSI flat iron.  While it works quite well, the HSI does fall short of a CHI.  CHI glides through your hair silky smooth, like butter.  The HSI is a bit rougher and felt like it was tugging on my fine hair. I noticed that the HSI works better when you flatten a larger tuft of hair... maybe because my hair is so fine.  The HSI does the job, but the ceramic plates definitely aren&#x27;t as smooth of the CHI&#x27;s.  You get what you pay for, but overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product since it was quite inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> Received my flat iron Fast, and it is working beautifully so far.  So far I am very happy with the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am more impressed with is the customer service from this company.  I was sent an email asking for feedback and given a direct link to contact them if I was not happy with their service or the product.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  I have fine, thin wavy hair and it works beautifully to smooth and straighten my hair.  It is adjustable so I can use the lower heat settings.  The price was excellent.</li>
    <li> I have 4c type natural hair and my locks are thick and kinky and this does not straighten my hair at all smh what a waste of money. If you have 4c I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener to replace my much more expensive old Sedu.  I have not used it enough to see if I am going to like it as much as the Sedu.  My main concern is that it will do its job without damaging my hair.  As far as the order fulfillment, it was excellent as it arrived quickly and much sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> Damaged, hair. Better off getting one with silicone insulation.</li>
    <li> I thought it might be too good to be true, but it wasn&#x27;t... And it was less than half the price of my Chi. I have thick, frizzy hair. I&#x27;m an Asian who has to work hard to look Asian! And this iron does the trick!</li>
    <li> It is everything they said it was.  It works great.  Love the glove..</li>
    <li> This flat iron is excellent! I have very coarse, thick and wavy hard to straighten hair. This iron gets my hair completely straight and does not burn your hair! Used it at the Highest setting and hair was damp yet it straightned it as if it was done in Salon. An excellent product and price!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing! i straightened my hair with this and it is so straight and soft. when i put my hair behind my ears it still straightens. recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! My hair is very thick but this gets my hair silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t take very long at all. I also really love the travel pouch--I&#x27;ve had to take it with me right after straightening a few times after I used it and it was really helpful. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Worst flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. Waste of money and worse than my cheap $15 dollar one I purchased from Walmart!</li>
    <li> I am very please with my purchase.  It has met and exceeded my expectations!  It straightens very well, heats up quickly, and I can even make a nice curl on the ends of my hair!</li>
    <li> Decent straightener. Nothing special but I will keep it as a back up. I have since purchased another brand.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new straigntener because my Chi was broken. I wanted something affordable but still able to do the job right. I think this straigtener does a great job and am very happy with my purchase. I also really like the hair oil that came with it!</li>
    <li> Purchased for dual voltage use in Europe -- worked fine for that.  For back home, though, it does not perform nearly as well as my CHI!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair tool and I truly appreciate the bonus bottle of argan oil!</li>
    <li> I needed a lightweight, dual-voltage straightener for a trip to Europe. This one is perfect: takes up minimal space, adds minimal weight, works great in multiple countries, and left my hair &amp;#34;photo ready&amp;#34; instead of hidden under a hat for the whole trip. Now that I&#x27;m home, it&#x27;s still my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; appliance. You will love it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something good from most of the reviews I read. I now don&#x27;t straighten my hair at all since I got this one because it just can&#x27;t do the job.. My previous one had fell in water and got shorted out so couldn&#x27;t wait to get this because I much prefer my natural wavy hair straightened. With this one I might as well not do it at all.</li>
    <li> Good product delivered as expected. Continues to work well</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and in shape described. The product is works good and it was priced just right.</li>
    <li> Works well with short hair. Love it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect and received it very fast.</li>
    <li> My curly-headed daughters and I have had multiple straighteners ever since they became available, and this is probably the best I have used. I bought it just ahead of a trip to Europe because of its dual voltage (which worked beautifully), but I love it for how quickly it heats up and how well it works.  One pass and maybe two, and my hair is done. Other straighteners have needed more repetitions and have dried out my hair.  The sample of argon oil was a nice touch for travel.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Heats up quickly and smooths my hair easily. Very happy. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! Have very frizzy and curly hair and this has allowed me a whole new look. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Pros: Good priced product. Heats up very quickly. Range of temperature settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does a B+ job of straightening hair. Cord is REALLY long which is probably good for some people, but can be quite bulky to be moving around if you&#x27;re unplugging constantly.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok.  doesn&#x27;t seem as lay my hair flat as smoothly as other straighteners I have had in the past. I liked  the way it works.  However it quit working. I bought one for my granddaughter, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this hair straightener. I Have fine curly hair which I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of frizziness when I straighten it. This straightener however really takes care of the frizz. Can straighten it so much quicker too. Heats up fast and love the swivel cord too. I also love the argon oil that came with it. That works great as well on my hair. I would highly recommend this straightener and oil. Service was very prompt as well and was very pleased with price.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised.  It doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as my HAI Classic Pro.  That said, I purchased this because it can be used overseas, and in that regard it was the perfect purchase for me.</li>
    <li> My sister recomends the brand cost $ 100. This costs 1/3 price and works well as the one costs $ 100. There is no auto shutoff feature but i just turn it off after use.  no problem to me</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Second one for me, bought this one for my daughter to take to college. I&#x27;ve paid $200 for an iron before and this one works just as well.</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly, and was exactly what I wanted. Great service! I highly recommend this hair straitener.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent iron that gives you salon results. My hair looked like I had just left the salon once  I learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> Exactly want I needed.  Reasonable price.  Little heavy was the only surprise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. I wanted a higher quality flat iron at a lower price, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. Nice quality, heats quickly, and my hair has never gotten so straight with lower priced irons I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I cannot speak to the longevity of this product, but I can say that it straightens my hair beautifully.  The temperature is adjustable, though I have not taken to time to find out if this really matters or not, as I usually crank it up to almost the highest setting.  The only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s not a bog one, is that the tension is a little rough on your hands, so if you are curling your hair, it&#x27;s hard to keep it closed tightly on the hair.  Will need to see if this can be adjusted.  For the price and my experience so far, this can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned!! It really gets to the roots and heats up quickly!</li>
    <li> Gets hot quick and doesn&#x27;t snag hair like others do. Daily use and holding up great!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great.....it gets very hot very fast.  It is a bit narrower than my previous one...I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the smaller width....however, because it is so hot it straightens my hair much quicker.  Delivery was quick and the product arrived just as stated in the description.  I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt to purchase a new flat iron to replace mine which was in really poor shape (I was using tape to keep the thing together...) I came across the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron on Amazon.com and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I read some really frightening reviews on the CHI and simply wanted a low maintenance, headache-free experience. I am so glad that I did. I&#x27;ve owned the flat iron for a few weeks now. It&#x27;s been nothing but great! I was concerned b/c the heat setting on this is lower on this model than my previous one, however, it clearly does the job. I have extremely thick/long hair and with the use of this flat iron, it has made my life much easier! I love the scent of the argan oil that was included and the glove is perfect b/c again, this thing can get extremely hot! You can&#x27;t go wrong for purchasing this item and I&#x27;m more than happy I did!</li>
    <li> My daughter has seriously thick and unmanagebale wavy hair. We got a keratin treatment from my stylist and this straightener. She is starting middle school this year and I wanted her to feel good about herself. He hair is so easy to style now between this straightener and the treatment. It was well worth the money for her to geel so confident.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a Chi straightener but haven&#x27;t wanted to spend that much, I gave in a bought this one. Love it! Really like where the controls are, you don&#x27;t have to always check to see if you have turned it off because you accidentally touched it with you fingers. My grand-daughter used it and she said she like it better than her moms Chi....made me very happy!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly. Fast shipping. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron a little over a year ago. Within 6 months, the flat iron began to fail me...it would constantly heat up and then cool down when the cord was moved even a little bit. Obviously, there was something wrong with the wiring. I really liked it at first--ESPECIALLY for the price. I&#x27;d even say it was comparable to my CHI, except with this you can control the temperature (which is an important feature to me). I&#x27;m disappointed that this didn&#x27;t last me very long. I&#x27;ve had flat irons that endured daily use for up to 5 years! I will be moving on to the J Beverly Hills brand flat iron...which is supposedly even better than the ghd.</li>
    <li> So far I am loving it ☺️</li>
    <li> Wonderful Straightener!! Even works on my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly hair. So glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a CHI flat iron for my picky daughter. She was a die hard CHI user but since I was buying I did some research. The HSI was reported to work as well as the CHI if not even better. The price was much lower than for the CHI so based on user reviews I decided to give it a try and had one sent to her. She is ecstatic! She said it was better than the CHI and she loves the Argon oil treatment that came with it! Yay! Score one for Mom, and 5 stars for the HSI!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron. It really only takes one pass to straighten my hair. It heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love it!!! great item, great price!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really well, I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. It heats up quickly and leaves my hair smooth and straight.</li>
    <li> Seems okay. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know much.</li>
    <li> High quality iron at an affordable price. I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! My hair is thick with alot of body so I need the heat to straighten. So far so good and would order another.</li>
    <li> I have not normally been in the practice of using a flat iron but after reading multiple reviews decided to give this one a try.  It has not disappointed.  My hair is medium/long and quite fine so tends to be prone to frizz particularly in high humidity. I found a good dry oil mist that I use before blow drying and then after styling with the HSI flat iron, my hair looks shiny, and stays sleek and looking great throughout  the day. I have  been  quite pleased overall!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself! It is one of the best straighteners! I had to buy two more as gifts!</li>
    <li> I love it, thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Super fast shipping and makes my hair look great!</li>
    <li> Not quite a chi but close. A great product for a fantastic price and I love the argon oil . I was very happy with my purchase :-) I love that hair never gets caught and I am able to straighten ore even curl my end.</li>
    <li> I, like many of you I bet, found this product after scoffing at the unbelievably high prices of other flat irons. I&#x27;m so happy I did! I have been using it for months now, and it always provides the perfect shiny straightness to my hair. It never snags and It heats up very quick, which is great for mornings when I&#x27;m rushed. I have short hair and the design allows me to get that perfect little curl at the bottom of my hair. Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Great iron, works like a charm on my curly and thick hair.,no damage. I like the oil they sent with it. I do wish I got the timer version as I sometimes forget to turn it off, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> OMG! WOW!!! You have to get these my best friend owns the CHI she used my HSI and she has a pair now. It&#x27;s really gives you the curls and straight hair that you are looking for. The cord is long and it rotates which is really great when you are making a curl. This flat iron is really an investment.</li>
    <li> I have used it for about 5 times and it did the job. I cannot say it is very different than my other $15 one.</li>
    <li> good flat iron, did need to purchase a holder/stand for it though-it&#x27;s very hot!</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast and I absolutely LOVE this flat iron! A friend of mine recommended it to me and it has changed my life lol it straightens my hair in minutes!</li>
    <li> Iron performed well.  Used it while in London with no problems. You do still need a converter plug to access the electrical outlet.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever bought (and I&#x27;ve spent over $250 for professional ones before)! Took my straightening time down to 5-10 minutes. I have a chin length bob cut, thick, course, curly hair; my hair is frizzy without product and also ringlets. I gave it a four because I with the heat dial had more than just the lowest and highest tempatures on it. Great long cord. Easy to use on shorter areas of hair.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this product is its ease of use.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, it heats up quickly and allows me to set the temperature level.  I have very thick hair but I keep it layered for lots of volume. This iron creates movement in my hair and for the first time, I tried flipping my hair up through the layers, and this iron makes it happen.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron is one of the best, if not the best, straightener I have used! It is affordable and works perfectly! I do not have anything negative to say about it. It does not get too hot like some of the other reviews had stated, but it does come with a glove if you would need it. It does not pull hair like some other irons I have used. It leaves my thick hair soft and straight! I love it! It also comes with argan oil as an added bonus! I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a new flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> I have a teenage daughter who constantly straightens her hair.  She was devastated when her Chi stopped working.  After reviewing this straightening iron on line, I decided to try it.  It is definitely comparable to the Chi and much better priced.  We are very happy with this and I once again have a happy daughter!</li>
    <li> Shipper was great, there was a missing product and they replaced it right away.&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t replace my other straightener that works great, but that was also more expensive. For the price i paid for it, this works okay for traveling and as a back-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times now but it works much better than my last flat iron. My hair is fine and on the thinner side. It&#x27;s gotten dry and frizzy over recent years and it is very resistant to heat styling but this makes it look shiny and nicer than it has looked in a long time (outside of my salon visits). Also the Argan oil is great. I&#x27;m definitely getting more of that when I run out. Great product!</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars if it had an auto-off feature.  Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is not as great as previous reviewers would have you believe.  I have used high end products in the past and feel that it is not the same quality. I was looking for a good CHEAP replacement and that is what I found. I would not recommend the product for someone who is looking for a perfectly smooth finish fast.  I got a decent product for a decent price.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this flat iron, it takes forever to heat up and loses it&#x27;s heat after one swipe through my hair. My hair is not particularly thick or coarse, it is naturally wavy though. It&#x27;s the same quality of cheap flat irons purchased at your local Target. I really did want to love it based on the reviews, I&#x27;ve tried it a handful of times to double check but it&#x27;s just low quality.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, it works great for her, and she says she only needs the heat on half and her hair seems to be benefiting greatly! Cord is plenty long, make sure you hit the little reset button on it to get it going. My wife loves it and and that means I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping A+</li>
    <li> I was expecting for it to straighten up my hair after one slide but it takes several.  Its work the price though.</li>
    <li> It is as they say. It is worth the price... a good tool for home and the salon. I bought it as a gift and will do so again since it was lost on vacation. It is well made, looks and feels like a tool four times its cost and we have no regrets buying it. You should not either.</li>
    <li> I love love love these flat irons. I only have t go through my hair once for it to straighten completely. The Argon oil was a great bonus. I will definitely be buying this oil!!!.</li>
    <li> On time and the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever had, hands down!</li>
    <li> Happy with it so far.  I was a little worried based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read but for the price, I am very happy with the product I received.  Does what I need it to do.  Come up to temp rather quickly and stays hot.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman who has long hair that is thick &amp; not all flatirons can tame my mane. I was apprehensive buying this because the price was so fair for a flatiron that is normally $99! I ended up purchasing it &amp; (as I rarely do) flatironed my whole head by myself. I was astonished!! It was so easy to maneuver through my hair without burning my scalp or hands. The finished product was salon worthy for sure.</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener. I bought it when I cut my hair short because my 2&amp;#34; straightener was too big. It was cheap anyway, and this new ceramic straightener is Waaaaaaay better than I expected it to be. Love love love!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, multiple passes through hair to straighten, and pulled hair. Cannot use it, will have to return.</li>
    <li> The iron can straighten my hair even when it is very wavy! It is quick and great results!</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron.  I use it for curling my hair and it works wonderfully!  Thank you for offering such a great product at a reasonable price.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product works well.</li>
    <li> I received it on the expecting day &amp; I LOVE it, the only problem I had was when I opened the package the argan oil had spilled a bit , but other than that I LOVE it !</li>
    <li> Bought this hair straightener as a gift for my sister and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Bought thus as a gift for my daughter.  She is very happy with it and really likes to oil that came with the straightener.  Thank you for quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I have owned the same flat iron for like 10 years. It was kinda crusted over with product and I recently went Curly Girl (I&#x27;m mixed black/white with 3b/c hair) and have been doing a much better job of taking care of my now 2 years natural hair. So I wanted to buy a new flat iron that would do the least damage to my hair. However, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, as I only plan to flat iron my hair a few times a year. I did some research and found this flat iron has good reviews here on Amazon. To top it off it was affordable AND was both ceramic and tourmaline which I had read was good for the hair. I have only used it once and it worked well. My hair was a bit too flat and greasy looking but I think that was just me being heavy handed with the heat protectant spray and argan oil leave in. The flat iron comes with a nice bag to keep it in and with a little argan oil leave in treatment sample and a glove, which I found I didn&#x27;t even need to use because even though I had the flat iron about 80% turned up, my hair wasn&#x27;t that hot to the touch. Again, I only used this once, so I can&#x27;t really say I love it yet. Next time I plan to use less product before hand and see if I get straight/flat hair but with a little body and bounce to it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this has such high reviews. It sorta straightens my hair but I have to go over it multiple times, and even then my hair gets frizzy by the middle of the day. The other straightener I had kept my hair straight all day.</li>
    <li> when I first ordered this product it didn&#x27;t work very well on my hair at all I left a review and it was replaced with a new 1 and this 1 works so much better the first 1 must&#x27;ve had a defect I recommend this to anyone looking for solid product</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the flat iron because the price seemed too good to be true. I have used it for the past three weeks and I really like it!</li>
    <li> The service was excellent. I received product on time and in great condition.  The product itself did not work well on my hair type.  It straightened my hair but it didn&#x27;t smooth it out.  I will have to go back to the original flat iron I used before. There was no issue with returning product.</li>
    <li> This straightener was a steal!!!  It works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Wife likes it. So that&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is amazing, I bought two of them. One is for me and one is a gift for a family member. This is a very high quality straightener and I love how it makes my hair feel. It has a range of heat settings and comes with oil for your hair. After I use it my hair is perfectly straight and so soft. I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good flat iron for the price. Not the best I&#x27;ve used, but pretty comparable to name brands. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have automatic shut off and I&#x27;ve forgot to turn this thing off quite a few times and it gets pretty hot for a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Product is worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised maybe a knokoff</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron! After using many different brands, the HSI Professional 1 ceramic ionic straightener is by far the best one! I highly recommend it! The price is great too!</li>
    <li> The product works but doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it says it should.</li>
    <li> Good quality low price</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, recomendado al 100%</li>
    <li> Shipped to me and doesn&#x27;t work. Plates do not touch... so hair does not straighten. I bough this specifically to bring out of town... now I am stuck without a flat iron... and all because someone sent me a defective product. Thanks a lot for absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> This straightener is fabulous! I had a previous generation version of this one that I liked, but I left it in a hotel bathroom by mistake. I thought this one would be the same as my old one, but this one is even better!!! It is featherlight and the hot iron part is so smooth I thought I was doing something wrong! I absolutely recommend this product. It&#x27;s a high quality, professional straightener for an excellent price!</li>
    <li> So far, my wife loves her flat iron.  She goes through several a year and has always bought CHI brand, because they are the only ones that get hot enough....until now!  Let&#x27;s hope HSI continues to work as well as it has.  We bought 2 because of the value...2 HSI were cheaper than one CHI brand.</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up very quickly and once it is ready, is very easy to use. I have frizzy, curly, color-treated hair that is thinning (ah, middle age!), but it is still thick. This iron tames it pretty quickly. It seems to work best on the 2nd day after washing. If your hair is color-treated, it is best to use the lowest setting that will work for you.</li>
    <li> Sister asked me to buy fir her bc I have a prime account. She loved it enough that my mom bought one too. I personally have a buzz so I wouldn&#x27;t have personal experience with this.</li>
    <li> i have thick curly hair and this straightner was amazing! Easy to use and price is incredible</li>
    <li> I really like the flat iron. Still isn&#x27;t powerful enough to keep my natural hair from frizzing up tho. :(</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron because of the reviews. I received this flat iron really fast and once I got it I was pretty excited to try it out. I have been using my Chi for about 3 years now so I thought it was time for something new. I have really thick, wavy  &amp; frizzy medium length hair so it takes me a while to get my hair to look the way I want it to. I have been having the HSI flat iron for two weeks. Initially the flat iron was a beat up one of the plates was scratched &amp; the handles looked a bit worn. Either way I gave it a shot and it turned on. I have to use it at the highest temp. because of the type of hair I have. It pulls on my hair and my hair gets frizzy after a while. Maybe its my type of hair but because of this the flat iron didn&#x27;t impress me at all. I actually think that I can get a better flat iron at a grocery store. Then again I didn&#x27;t pay much for it so I&#x27;ll end the review with the pros. It leaves my hair soft and shiny, it takes me a bit less time to do my hair (some days) and it leaves my hair really straight. Take your chances it may work better on other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very light weight and yet straightens my thick hair just as good as the iron I had previously, for a much better price.</li>
    <li> Works great. This was actually a replacement for an older HSI model that worked great for 4 years.</li>
    <li> very smooth plates! Heats up to 450 degrees which means there isn&#x27;t anything you can&#x27;t straighten with this product. Easy to turn on and off. Amazing product for the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price.  Just be careful when you use it the first time be sure to check temp setting as it is inside the handle and if you plug it in before you check it may be too hot</li>
    <li> Well made; feels good in hand so it is easier to use. The glove is a great addition. Who needs burnt fingers?  And the price was good, too!</li>
    <li> the flat iron is okay,  I have to go over my hair several times before it get&#x27;s straight.</li>
    <li> Love this iron. I have fine, thin hair and on a low setting it will straighten my hair without pulling my hair. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product for a very fair price! I also loved oil which comes in the pack :)</li>
    <li> Great product! I have naturally thick and straight hair and I use it to make my hair wavy. It&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
    <li> Really good.  Watch temp iron gets really hot and u don&#x27;t want to fry ur hair.  It&#x27;s the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used.  The only downside is the 2nd day I feel my hair looks a little greasy.  Dry powder helps.  Could be cause it&#x27;s stick straight.  Anyway, thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Value For Money. Wish I knew about this sooner!</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI PROFESSIONAL PREMIUM QUALITY EZ FLOW VENTED HAIR Detangling Brush.  This is a great brush.  It seems to get my hair dry faster without tangling.</li>
    <li> Great for international use!</li>
    <li> So this was working for a couple of months and I was happy that I finally found a hair iron that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune but does the job ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently the connector has gotten loose so I have to keep it in a certain position to work. Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t. Actually tonight it smoked the whole room that the fire alarm went off. At this point I&#x27;m scared of fire hazard but I really need a hair iron asap. There&#x27;s a reason why this thing is so cheap.</li>
    <li> Works just like I got it done at the salon but even better!! No one believes I&#x27;m natural when I use this!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Easy transaction! Great product!! This is my second HSI Professional flat iron. I gave my older one to my daughter which worked perfectly fine after 2 years of use. This flat iron does not take long to heat up. Definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs. The ceramic gets hot enough to straighten without too much damage.</li>
    <li> tough one...i absolutely LOVED this at first. In fact, was planning on buying an additional one the day it stopped working. I purchased it for my daughter (replacing a CHI) and she thought it was way better than the Chi.  Well, we&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 weeks, and the red &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button stopped working.  That was ok, but then the next time we went to use it, it only got luke warm at best!  No way was it straightening her wavy hair.  Such a bummer.  Had high, high hopes for this.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron for my curly hair!</li>
    <li> i so dislike this iron. it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth like most other ceramic tourmaline straightners do. I had cut my har short and needed a thinner straightner. This 1 is just horrible.</li>
    <li> I  absolutely love this product, works wonders on my hair and no perm needed.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price! The results are much better than using a ceramic iron.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, it works like a charm. It is waaay better that the flst itons i have spent twice as much for it. I am very glad that i bought this</li>
    <li> For the price this flat iron is great.  Like the adjustable heat setting, which allows me to lower temp if I&#x27;m just going over my hair a second time after sleeping on it or if I&#x27;m doing the back sections that don&#x27;t need the high heat. Awesome that it included a heat glove so you can protect your hand handling your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Heats up very quickly and leaves my hair flat after one pass. Others I have used takes a few passes, but not this one. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews on flat irons. The HSI was not rated as high as other popular brands however; to my surprise this is by far the best flat iron, I have owned. Best of all you can&#x27;t beat the price. My iron was delivered on time and I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This review is for the guys who are interested in creating some awesome hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy and I bought this straightener about 5 months ago from amazon, and so far I must say that I am very satisfied with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of things I should mention:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You will never have tangled power cord wires.  Everyone should know how annoying it is in the morning, when your wires are tangled up such as your blow dryer.  When you try to maneuver it, you end up pulling the cord out.  You won&#x27;t have problem with it because the cord can rotate from the base of your straightener (it will un-tangle itself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The heating speed:  it will heat up very fast.  from 0 to 310 degrees, it takes about 20 seconds which is always helpful in those rushed morning moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. the smoothness of the heating plates: even if you squeeze hard to create curls, you will notice it is effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I set the heat to about 310, and it won&#x27;t burn your hair.  You won&#x27;t see those puff of smoke that comes up from cheap straighteners .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, straight asian hair and this item can bend my hair&#x27;s will at ease, so do not be afraid if your hair is a bit coarse.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed the first two times that I used it, but since then it has heated up extremely fast and left my coarse, color-treated hair looking shiny and smooth enough that I am happy to wear it down instead of keeping it in a constant ponytail. I love that it is dual voltage.</li>
    <li> Excellent, easy to use and quick results</li>
    <li> Product was shipped fast and works like a charm. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great straightener for the price. It does not get my hair completely straight though. It is still better than what I had purchased at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my year travel to china. I will be posting updates after I use this product I currently use CHI  Update May 25, 2017: After 2 years of use using it 3-5 times a month the product has finally died and no longer works.</li>
    <li> This is a really good hair straightener. I love the little bottle of oil it comes with, and it makes my hair super shiny and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it four stars is that the heating plate is a little small for my preferences. I had an old one with a much larger plate that I really loved, but it broke so I replaced it with this hair iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like it, and I use it every time I have to straighten my hair! I&#x27;ll probably get used to the smaller plate eventually! :)</li>
    <li> Perfect last minute purchase for my trip to Europe. I am always hesitant on straightener purchases bc I have curly, thick hair and I&#x27;ve learned not all straighteners work equally! But this one is great!</li>
    <li> The product was damaged when I received it. The product did not look like it had Ceramic Plates? The coating on the plates was dented and damaged. I never turned it on. I would never have ran my hair through this Flat Iron. The packaging was nice, but the product it&#x27;s self should have never made it through quality control with that type of damage.&lt;br /&gt; No Star Rating....</li>
    <li> Great flat iron much better than my last</li>
    <li> one of the most satisfying price/value products i&#x27;ve purchased of this type</li>
    <li> My wife ordered.  It is great.  I recommend to everyone that is looking for a Straightner.</li>
    <li> I previously had a professional straightener. This does not work as well on my think hair. It is still puffy. Takes much longer. Not loving it.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review before but now I have had it for a while. Just want to say it works well and I love it. Thank you. Very quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected. A great option for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed... I buy this item cuz I saw on youtube that it is better than Babyliss Nano titanium, that is my favorite flat iron... But NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: useful led that says when the flat iron is ready, hair feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: my hair is not straight, is freezy, tha plates pulls my hair, Small plates, I take like forever to &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really good flat iron I recomend Babyliss and Remington wet to straight</li>
    <li> Died on me in 6 months! The heat went out. But it was very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> A nice flat iron. I have thin hair and from reading the other reviews thought that the iron would be the win for my hair.  It does a good job, but not as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> This straightener works well enough. I&#x27;ve always used a Chi and actually thought that was what I was ordering but decided to keep the HSI anyway. It works fine, just used to the Chi. The HSI was a good price. It was easy to order and received my product when expected.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used and I have over a decade of experience with flat irons.</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and has a light indicator so that you know when it&#x27;s ready and I love that you can adjust the heat level.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Make sure you do a little research to find out what temperature is best for your hair type, and also buy the product you need to protect against heat damage.</li>
    <li> Great Straightener! I was a little hesitant on buying such a small surface iron but it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than a CHI, but not worth it. I had to return mine because it snagged and pulled my hair really bad. I&#x27;ve always used CHI and after the 2nd one went out one me after 5 years, I gambled on getting a cheaper brand. If you use a flat iron in your daily hair routine, it&#x27;d be best to just pay the extra money and get a better quality one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a gift, and she has long, thick, wavy hair. She loves this straightener &amp; she has had many...from the cheapest to very expensive models. Heats up quickly &amp; does a beautiful job without damaging hair.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! So pleased.</li>
    <li> It heats up fairly quickly. The cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled up. There&#x27;s a light that tell you when the flat iron is ready for use. The package comes with a glove and a mini container of argan oil and a red sleeve. I&#x27;m fairly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair comes out....it doesnt burn and im able to curl my tips!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fabulous!  My hair is super shiny and it gives it tons of volume.  Love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, although it is hard to control temperature...does not have an automatic shut-off.</li>
    <li> I totally love this flat iron!  I had a Chi that quit working in less than a year, so I replaced it with this iron.  Not only is it better, but cheaper by leaps and bounds - I picked it up when it was $49.99.  It&#x27;s a great product at a reasonable price.  Cant beat that...</li>
    <li> Professional quality which is just what I wanted and it didn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as they were asking at my beauty supply store near by.  Very pleased not only with the product but also the follow up email by the company to confirm I was a satisfied customer!  I wish more companies operated this way!!</li>
    <li> It was gift for my wife and she love it</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for daughter in law.</li>
    <li> Great person to do bussines with, fast shipping, excellent communication, item as described, very responsible, amazing argan oik, comes with a cupon. loved the flat iron. Recommended</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this flat iron straightener because the plates that heat up didnt slide easily on my hair.  Almost felt like they would catch.  Didnt straighten very well either.   I was hopeful it would work but for me it just didnt.  I will stick with the CHI brand.  I returned this item.</li>
    <li> Everything was according to my expectations, great product with excellent quality.</li>
    <li> My goal of having better hair without getting up earlier: check plus!</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this flat iron since the reviews were so positive, but it was just okay. I will admit that I like my old andis better and it cost less. I have really thick, kinky hair... and I have to turn the flat iron all the way up and go throw my hair two-three times before it gets straight. I will also say that once it&#x27;s straight it does last... when I flat iron my hair, I usually put a curl at the end and after about a week (even with me combing my hair) the ends was still curled so that was positive! So again, it was just okay... at least for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and gets my kinky hair super straight in one swipe!</li>
    <li> bought this to replace a $100 flat iron that I bought at the mall. This works just as well for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> Gave as a Christmas gift and they loved it. Works great buy if you need a good straightener</li>
    <li> My Brazilian Straight means the world to me and my place of work requires me to have my hair in bun constantly (5 to 6 days a week!). My hair usually has a wavy pattern by the end of the day and I like it straight and this flat iron gets the job done. The adjustable temperature gauge is brilliant and helps alot! My friend received the HSI flatiron and I&#x27;m so glad she did becuase it just made me want to have one of my own. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is for a gift so I am hoping it works for her.</li>
    <li> I got this product a few days ago and the packaging was awesome, it felt like christmas when It arrived at my house. I plugged it in and in like 15 seconds it got completly hot, The box the straightner came in included a random glove. It arrived quickly also, quicker than stated so I was very pleased! :)</li>
    <li> I have been watching this straightener for awhile, trying to decide If I wanted to spend that much money on one and let me say, I am so glad I did..LOVE it...works great. I have really curly, frizzy hair and this works amazing on it...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It heats quickly and the first time I used it I did not realize how hot it could get.  I have since started using a lower setting.I had used a different brand and would have to pass it through several times to get the same result I get with this one just once through.  I like the oil they sent as a sample also, I plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> I felt it was necessary to update my original review from a few months ago due to one glaring design flaw.  this iron doesn&#x27;t appear to turn itself off after a certain period of time!  Now I understand that personal responsibility when using electronics is imperative, but who among us has never stepped away from their routine and forgotten they have left an appliance on.  With something that gets as hot as this iron and can potentially start a fire or burn people, I would imagine that it would have a safety shut off.  If this iron does, it is FAR too long.  Every flat iron or curling iron I have ever owned (which were all far cheaper than this one) turned off after 30 min or an hour.  This high end iron iron should too!  I understand that it is geared towards professionals who may be using it all day long, yet it is a small price to pay in inconvenience to have to turn it back on and let it heat a few minutes than take the chance of an electrical fire due to negligence.  Frankly, I am surprised this device is UL listed with out this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, as much as I have loved using this iron (to be fair, after a few months of use I have liked using it more than my original review), I don&#x27;t want to chance an electrical fire if I forget to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a flat iron that worked well, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 or more to get one.  My drug store Revlon model really didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  This model does the trick.  It gets hot quickly, and does a great job.  My only complaint is that it still takes quite a while to straighten my hair, and since it is short and fine, perhaps my technique is to blame.  My hair was silky and straight all day even when it was quite humid out.  My favorite part of the iron is the soft flexible cord and how easily the iron stores. I am a hair styling novice, but find this flat iron definitely improves my style despite my lack in experience.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Flat Iron, leaves my hair soft and shiny and cut my styling time in half!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this after some research and seeking out recommendations from friends. And I am very pleased with the outcome! This is the least expensive straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased and works just as well, or better, than those that cost more. Heat resistant glove was a great perk too...really comes in handy when using the straightener as a curler.</li>
    <li> returned it, did not work on 110V when I was traveling.</li>
    <li> Just love how my hair shines and feels so soft even do I&#x27;m using a flat iron!!</li>
    <li> Flat iron works great but the part that plugs into the wall was broken when I received it in the mail. It still works but the box that plugs into the wall will not stay together and is missing the reset button.</li>
    <li> This died after 2 months. It was very cheap so I suppose you get what you pay for. I replaced it with a Sedu which is much better so far.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied satisfied with my purchase. I bought one as a gift and 2weeks later bought on for myself</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and works well</li>
    <li> Here is my daughter&#x27;s review: \\&quot;Absolutely amazing! Works well every time! The Bio Silk also makes my hair really soft. I will definitely be buying more of that. However, I won&#x27;t be buying a new straightener because this will last me a long time.\\&quot;    Straight from a teenager&#x27;s mouth!</li>
    <li> I order this flat iron after read good review. But I m not happy with this flat iron to much. Is not heat like another straitner.</li>
    <li> This flat iron feels solid, heats up quickly, really nice quality.  I was about ready to spend $175 at my hair salon for a GHD but figured I&#x27;d try this first and return it if I was unhappy.  It&#x27;s an awesome flat iron.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it holds up over time.  Comes with a heat resistant pouch.  Heats up ultra-fast.  I&#x27;m not knocking GHSD, from what I hear they&#x27;re amazing, but this was less than a third of the price  plus I am worried about GHD knockoffs.  I had never heard of HSI (as far as I no they&#x27;re not well-known) so no issue with knockoffs as opposed to the big names like CHI, GHD, etc. The results are fantastic and long-lasting on me.</li>
    <li> I have owned many straighteners in the past but none have kept my hair in such good condition. After buying a cheap ISO for about 15 bucks, I had so many split ends and my hair was so dry. The HSI is the cheapest straightener that will still keep your hair healthy. I use mine just about every day!</li>
    <li> Works great on my cave woman hair!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, heavy flat iron that gets really hot.  However after using it for a while, my hair was in horrible shape.  The ends were all split and my previous flat iron never caused that.  I finally quit using it and went back to my previous one.</li>
    <li> I had an inexpensive straightener before I got this one, and this is SO much better! It heats up to 400 degrees very quickly.  It has a dial so you can adjust the heat.  It works very well! it smooths out my rough hair very quickly and evenly.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t really have an on-off switch, so you can&#x27;t just leave it out all the time on &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  Overall, it&#x27;s great and makes doing my hair super quick and easy</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and I was looking to replace my old HAI flat iron that broke after many years if service. This flat iron claims to heat up above 400 degrees but my old iron seemed be be hotter at the same temp. Also this iron does not run through my hair as smoothly as my other one did. This iron does do a good job at making my hair stick straight so for the cost its a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the seller, I was very happy at the speed of delivery. I got it sooner than I expected!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who has very long hair. He&#x27;s had several cheap straighteners, but hasn&#x27;t been happy with them. He likes this one. It does what it needs to do and doesn&#x27;t cost a ton like some of them. I liked the glove - I straightened his hair with it once and it saved me from the typical burns.</li>
    <li> i love this flat iron! i have tried at least 3 flat irons in the past few months and have been dissatisfied until buying the HSI Professional Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. i did a lot of research and everything kept coming back to the HSI. i was still skeptical even after reading so many positive reviews. because from my experience floating plates on a flat iron tend to have the edges at the ends of the plates that will &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; your hair, but without floating plates you will not get the same hair straightening and smoothing results. i have not experienced any biting with this flat iron, yay! it glides through my hair smoothly, making it silky and shiny. you can use it to smooth, straighten, defrizz, curl and flip. i had a recent bad haircut which left my hair very frizzy from scalp to ends. using this flat iron takes away my frizzies and leaves my hair silky, shiny and smooth. i have tried a Jilbere and other brands before and they did not work well. i have never tried the Chi, but i am so satisfied with this HSI Professional flat iron that i have no reason to spend the money on a Chi. i LOVE this flat iron! it heats up in what seems like mere seconds and has an auto shut off just incase you forget to turn it off. there is a light to let you know when it is on. the cord is super long and has a swivel connection to the iron for a tangle free cord. and you can not beat the price! it retails for close to $200. i would definitely recommend this HSI professional flat iron!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My Wife loves it! Happy Wife&#x3D; Happy Life!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product .. Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed by this product and would advise those who are interested NOT to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It does not run smoothly through your hair.  If you&#x27;ve used a good quality flat iron before, you know it doesn&#x27;t snag your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was busy and didn&#x27;t get a chance to go through the return process early enough, and now it&#x27;s in my storage closet waiting for our next yard sale.&lt;br /&gt;I went and purchased the CHI from my local CVS.  Previously, I&#x27;ve used a Sedu, which was purchased online at Folica.com.</li>
    <li> My new HSI Professional flat iron hair straightener works well.  There are a couple design elements I think were better on my former model from a different manufacturer:  the off/on button and the temperature control button (terribly small) are on the inside of the iron; the two &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; cannot be locked closed for easier storage, and the actual temperature is not displayed.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative instead of buying another CHI, but this just isn&#x27;t the same quality of CHI flat irons. It takes much longer for me to straighten my hair - I have to go over each section  multiple times. And even after that, it&#x27;s still sometimes frizzy or imperfect. I will definitely spend the extra money to get a CHI next time.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love the oil that came with it and the carrying bag. It came quick no issues.</li>
    <li> This straightener is a good device for the price.  This one did not have the flexibility of setting options and digital display like the last one I purchased from the same manufacturer.  It would be helpful if there was something in the description that could identify different models and features to avoid confusion.  But, it still works fine as a straightener, and it was slightly cheaper than the other one I purchased.</li>
    <li> Received this item quickly and  I LOVE the product.  It is better than my old Chi!  Heats quickly and the case is very nice too.</li>
    <li> So far so good, my wife and daughter both enjoy using this flat iron.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> The product (flat iron hair straightener) arrived quickly and matches the description. I have never used them before and don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better than others, but it does what it says: straightens hair. I like the temperature control option, as it allows to reduce the damage from heat.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great! I have very curly, frizzy hair and this thing tames it straight. Watch out though, this thing gets HOT! And it also makes my hair very hot to the touch. I don&#x27;t understand why straightening irons do not have an auto-shutoff feature. I have left this on for an entire day and didn&#x27;t burn down the house, but an auto-shutoff would have been much better.</li>
    <li> I love my hair straightener... It works perfect!! and Im so in love with it. They did a great job with Customer service,I called them cause i was missing a organ oirl little bottle. I contacted them , they apologized and they sent me one in  less than 2 days.. Good jobs you guys!!i will totally buy it again from here!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed by this straightener. My hair began to wave again after about 15 minutes, which is unusual because my hair straightens very easily. I then slept on my hair, and in the morning it looked like I hadn&#x27;t even touched my hair with a straightener! I also did not receive the travel size argan oil. The only thing I like about this straightener is that it worked well on my bangs.</li>
    <li> I expected it to live up to my Chi that I gave to a friend...  It didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s hot enough, but the ceramic plates are not as smooth through my hair.  I have the suspicion that the price is inflated to look like the discount is better.  It would never have sold for $200, at least not for very long.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself and it&#x27;s a great straightener I love it and am very satisfied. Straightens my hair in one stroke ;)</li>
    <li> After checking the reviews I ordered the straightener.  I was disappointed in its performance; it pulled my hair out.  It did not operated as well as my Chi.  Luckily I found a Chi at the local TJMaxx.  I cannot recommend this item.</li>
    <li> After my chi broke I was hesitant getting a new flat iron. This is every bit as good as a chi. It heats up fast, and works great!</li>
    <li> Is it the best straightener in the world? Probably not. However it&#x27;s awesome for the price. It does take a little longer to heat up than some of the more expensive straighteners but once heated it does hold the heat pretty well. The plates are smooth and glide over my thick wavy hair without pulling. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I love them.. the best flat irons I ever purchased and I bought a LOT from spending any where from $20.00 to $200.00 these are the best....&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jules</li>
    <li> Very pleased with its performance.  Have used it for 2 months.  No problems.  One thing I would suggest is to pick the choice with the digital read for the temperature.  I picked the one with the manual set and it is hard to see without my reading glasses.  Also, this version doesn&#x27;t have a good grip which I think the other two versions do.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive this flat iron. However, it pulls your hair. I am really disappointed. Would send it back if it wasn&#x27;t so much trouble.</li>
    <li> Very good product...love it</li>
    <li> I have used it twice and it&#x27;s working well.</li>
    <li> Great product, Great price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The heat settings work very well. I am a novice using this and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good iron for good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first straightener and I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this flat iron for the price. But it doesn&#x27;t quite work for my type of hair, which is extremely thick and curly and not to mentioned I have a lot of hair. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as i need it to leave my hair straight in a short period of time. overall i rate it as an &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; product for my type of hair but it can probably be a 5 Star product for someone with less fine hair.</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews, I was excited to receive the HSI Ionic Flat Iron.  Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I&#x27;m really disappointed.  My biggest complaint is the iron snags my hair as I run it through the plates.  I was hoping it would take less ironing to get the look I like, but no luck.  Only up side is the low cost.</li>
    <li> My wife has gone through a hundred different straighteners...even more expensive than these... this is by her favorite.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent flat iron. It handles well and is hot enough to straighten or softly curl your hair quickly. I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair with tight curls (for you curly girls, mine is a 3b). I have NEVER been able to straighten my hair, until now! This iron is amazing, and my hair stayed straight for 2 days (until I washed it). Its a miracle worker...</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and color it.  The HSI professional allowed me to adjust the temperature to a lower setting and combined with the argon oil, the straightner glides through my hair leaving it shiny and healthy looking without damaging my hair.  I am so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair is long and has some layers, after going without one for years, I broke down and bought thus one. I am so happy with it. It heats up very fast and smoothies it n a pass or 2. I have now been using this on my girls hair it only takes me a few minutes for each. I love it. I am so happy I bought this. Works so much better than the old one that I had. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron, and it works well, it&#x27;s just a little bulkier than I would like.</li>
    <li> I like the straightener, don&#x27;t get me wrong. It does a very good job straightening, that I can not argue. However, I was also hoping it would curl my hair just as well. In that aspect, it was not what I expected. The curls don&#x27;t come out as curly as they did with other straighteners that I had used. The problem may be that it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair, ( it&#x27;s thick and straight).  I was hoping they would from all the great reviews I read, but oh well. I will keep trying. Other than that, good customer service, the plates are smooth, and I loved the packaging and the red slip it came with.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this flat iron! The best one ever! Great Deal! Now I have to get my daughter one!</li>
    <li> I have always used the chi iron and it lasted a very long time....until my son dropped it and just stopped working. so i was browsing amazon and this was the first iron that came up and was hesitant to buy it because of the price. But i went ahead and ordered it and glad that I did. It actually works pretty well and makes my hair very straight. The only downfall is that it pulls your hair strands time to time and it hurts! But other than that, its a great iron. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter in September 2013 and it was great for about 3 months and then while she was doing her hair one of the plates broke.  Amazon gave me a full refund and I was very pleased that they did that for me.  I just don&#x27;t know if I want to replace it with the exact same one.  Am afraid it will happen again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just not the same as the one I loved for so long, but it does the job.  It just feels differently in my hand and takes some getting used to.  (:</li>
    <li> The iron works beautifully on my long, thick hair, and the glove and pouch that come with it are very nice bonuses. I previously used a 1.5&amp;#34; Revlon iron because I thought the larger plate size would reduce the amount of time it took to straighten my hair, but the HSI actually takes less time because of the high heat settings. The product was perfectly packaged and also arrived in perfect condition. Excellent product and excellent vendor.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is amazing! I have really thick hair and this product glides right through it. The end result is exactly what I want...straight and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight hair so I was just looking for one to curl my hair and it works great. It heats up very quickly which I love. Great packaging and great product. Already referred this to a friend who now also bought.</li>
    <li> I recently purchase this flat iron thanks to the reviews it had received, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that i had expected until i decided to contact with the seller about my experience with the flat iron. They nicely and quickly gave me a new one and it does wonders!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this less than 10 times and now it no longer turns on.  I am returning it to Amazon, but frustrating because I now have to find a new one and am without a straightening iron.</li>
    <li> Paid $140. I have had it for 6 years and works very well.  Still heating up a storm.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This straighter gets the job done, but isn&#x27;t as good as some other ones I&#x27;ve used that were sold around the same price. Warms up fast, though.</li>
    <li> So my wife&#x27;s old iron needed to be replaced. I saw this as an alternative to the much more expensive one she had her eye on and it had a high rating. I was a little hesitant with the very low price from the listed retail price. However, I went for it and so far I have heard no complaints.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Heats up fast and works great!  I really like the bag it comes with to store the iron in when you aren&#x27;t using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was on special. Got a great desl on it. It heats up quickly. Be careful.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this hair iron. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and I like that I can adjust the temperature.</li>
    <li> I have owned several different flat irons over the years but this is absolutely the best one I have ever owned. I have very thick curly hair and very hard to straighten but with this flat iron it is not only easier, but is much faster.</li>
    <li> It Is easy to use it, but it makes my hair dry alittel bit. Over all I liked it too much :)</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up high and quick - does a great job straightening hair. Not entirely sure what the glove is for that came with it but its a great iron</li>
    <li> While it is more pricey than other flat irons, It leaves the hair shiny and does help with frizz control for those straight styles.</li>
    <li> Please help me return it and try another one. Please I need my money back or a return box and a replacement</li>
    <li> I love that it gets hot enough to effective straighten and shine hair without any damage! It heats up fast! My daughter and I both love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She has long and very thick hair, but it really worked for her.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  Other reviews were right on. You don&#x27;t need to spend $100 to get great results!</li>
    <li> I wanted something nice to replace my Conair infiniti pro, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $$$. This was a good price and had thousands of good reviews.  To my dismay, it&#x27;s only okay, I see absolutely no difference in performance to my under $20 conair.  Kind of upset.  Am returning and continuing my search for smooth hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a while ago and at first thought it was a terrible waste of money, it did not heat up too hot, temperature would go down when I ran it through my hair, and it pulled at my hair. The company contacted me on their own asking how I liked the product, I was honest.. and they sent me a brand new straightener! And it worked much better! A++ customer service here!</li>
    <li> Got this straightener on sale and it has worked for me for about a year now. Gets hot quickly and straightens hair well. I have thick coarse hair and have had no problems. Definitely a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> JJust got the flat iron. Im really excited to try it. The only reason Im giving this a 4 star  is because i noticed the seal was broken on the box. The flat iron appears to be new. Heats up well. I tried it on a piece of my hair i was pleased. Just hope it lasts and nothing is defective on. The broken seal made me a little skeptical. I really (and i stress really) hope this product works as described.</li>
    <li> I rated this high because my hair looks shiny and smooth afterwards. Like that I am able to change the temperature setting.</li>
    <li> My straightener I had for 5-6 years that I paid $120 for stopped working the day we were to board for our cruise.  Of course....murphy&#x27;s law.  Anyway, in my research for a new one this brand kept coming up in my research.  Wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work as I have been through cheaper straighteners and they are terrible.  But since it kept coming up as a great one I thought what was the harm in trying this one.  The trust test is on my oldest daughters hair as she has biracial THICK TIGHT curly hair.  WORKED AMAZING! Quite honestly it worked better than the previous one! YAY!! So excited!</li>
    <li> I love this  hair strainer I&#x27;ve had it for four years and I love it but I broke into the middle but I still use it it&#x27;s really really nice if I had to order another one I will order same but skinny one and lighter one but I really recommend this for anybody that&#x27;s looking for a hair straightener price is reasonable</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron ever.  I decided to order one and did alot of research.  This item got great reviews and they were right.  I use it almost daily.  Very easy.  Does a fantastic job on straightening.  Haven&#x27;t got burned yet although the glove is included if you want to be sure. There are also videos online instructing you how to use it for curls also, although it takes some practice and I really wanted it for straightening.  All in all a great product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use it yet.  My sister borrowed it to take it to Florida. She called me from Florida and said I&#x27;ll never see it again, that the flat iron was &amp;#34;ALL THAT.&amp;#34;  If she&#x27;s not kidding, I guess I&#x27;ll be buying another one.</li>
    <li> Great price for a very good iron.  The iron works great, you can adjust the temp and settings on it and only takes one use to get the style you want.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the expensive brands, and is comfortable and easy to use. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on a chi. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned!!  It does not dry my hair.  Would absolutely purchase this product again!!</li>
    <li> I have owned several CHI flat irons, but purchased the HSI flat iron because it was more economical and had good reviews.  My first observation was that it is heavier than the CHI and doesn&#x27;t seem to open as wide.  That alone would not lower my opinion, but I am very unhappy with the amount of time it takes to heat up.  If I want to heat it to 450 degrees it takes over 10 minutes.  I don&#x27;t have the extra time to spend waiting on it to heat up, and I do miss the CHI which heated up in no time flat.</li>
    <li> Mine broke when it fell off the shelf. When I went to look for another one, this had the best reviews so I got it again. I need to learn how to use it for curls.</li>
    <li> Good straightener that heats up quickly and is small and lightweight. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the plug is so big. Otherwise, it&#x27;s really nice and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair straightener.  My only complaint is that I myself get a little nervous when I have control of the temperature and tend to not increase it as high as it should be.  It&#x27;s not a fault of this product at all, but if you&#x27;re a nervous person like me - you may want to find one with a general &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; switch!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my very picky 16-year-old niece.  Well it looks like I did a good job!  She loves it and uses it every day.  I&#x27;ve seen her posts on Instagram and Facebook and people always compliment her on her hair.  Might buy one for myself next!!</li>
    <li> The first flat iron I bought came defective. HSI was kind enough to exchange my flat iron for a new one. I absolutely love it. It leaves my hair looking healthy and silky.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> My two coworkers and I got to talking about needing new flat irons and how it was important each of us to find really good ones at a great price. We were looking for one with tourmaline (negative ions) from a hairstylist&#x27;s suggestion. We found many for $80+ and all planned to order them but weren&#x27;t very excited about the price. We came across this one and couldn&#x27;t believe the price!!! Each of us placed our order immediately and we had them within the week.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about two months now and it works great. I have wavy hair and I love it. One of my co workers has very thick, very curly hair and she is loving it. Even uses it to make big wavy curls and it looks fabulous. One of our co workers has thin straight hair and it seemed to make her hair staticky so she didn&#x27;t love it like we did but it could have been many factors. I know for sure for wavy and very curly hair it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Chi straightener for the past 9 years until it finally died on me. I was looking into getting another Chi but saw raving reviews for this much cheaper option. The straightener heats up so quickly, and it comes with a velvet carrying case for travel. There is also a temperature control knob, but I always keep mine at the highest temperature because I have thick hair. I&#x27;m hoping this straightener will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend. Leaves hair smooth and perfectly straight. I&#x27;ve had a chi for years and this is just as good or better</li>
    <li> My Chi flat iron died out on my and I needed another one right away. Before spending over $100 on a new flat iron, I wanted to try other options first. I saw this one while browsing and decided to give it a try. It works just as well as my Chi flat iron and I couldn&#x27;t be happier since I got the HSI for a fraction of the price! I can still make the same tight or wavy curls in 5-10 minutes like my Chi one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only things I don&#x27;t like about the HSI flat iron is that it takes a little longer for it to heat up and the light indicating whether the flat iron is done heating up keeps switching back and forth from green to red while using it. Other than that, still a great flat iron for the price!</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews and comparing other irons, I decided to buy this HSI. I have used for 1 month and the results are ok. It is not the best of the world, but it is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Works amazing!!! I couldn&#x27;t find a straightener that left my frizzy and hard to handle hair but this straightener did it!!!</li>
    <li> best hair straighten EVER PRODUCT speaks for itself you wont be disappointed. can def. recommend this to anyone on a budget.</li>
    <li> This is my very first flat iron. I&#x27;ve always used curling irons, but I&#x27;m growing my hair out and my hair is naturally curly. This flatiron is so easy to use. I just love it! And I love that it automatically turns itself off, which can be controlled by a setting, I believe. Great product and I think I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> I thought I had unmanageable hair until I used this HSI flat iron!  Frizzy hair days are in the past. It&#x27;s all about the heat and this iron delivers it!  Very easy to use and light weight! At first, I was skeptical about the 1 inch size-but straightening in sections is the way to go.  I seriously thought there was no hope for my hair.  But after researching and reading reviews, I chose this one. THANK YOU HSI!!!!</li>
    <li> this was a great deal !!! My girl loves i and uses every morning with no problems definitely a plus.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy and thick hair and I find it really hard to manage it until I found this excellent product. It irons hair so smoothly that afterwards, it leaves your hair flowy and shiny. Now, I appreciate the volume of my hair. And this product comes with protective gloves incase you can&#x27;t stand the heat while ironing your hair. Very customer-friendly and worth the price. I am glad I took the risk of buying this product, great one.</li>
    <li> It is very useful! I can curl my hair anytime I want. It is very safe and comfortable to handle.</li>
    <li> left my chi on vacation, so needed another straightener so bought this brand.  was hesitant but used it and was empressed by how well it works, for half the price.  I love the digital display of different settings.  The only small down fall to me would be that the little digital display window is between the two plate arms which you cannot pull apart so you have to look close and through the side of the iron to see if on and what temp its on.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this straightener back in November as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I accidentally knocked it off of the bathroom counter onto the floor last week and it broke. I obviously had to buy a new one as not only was the drop my fault, but my daughter absolutely LOVES this straightener. Best she&#x27;s ever used she says. She has very long, thick hair (I have shorter hair, and not as thick--this straightener worked great on my hair as well). The plates are very nice on this straightener. I have owned two Chi&#x27;s and I would say not only is this flat iron just as good, I think it&#x27;s even better. And I paid alot more for my Chi&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I placed another order for this flat iron...the NON digital one. Unfortunately I received the digital one, so I contacted Amazon and they offered a refund with a pre-paid shipping label, OR I could get $15 refunded and keep the flat iron. Because I used Amazon points that I couldn&#x27;t have refunded, I chose the $15 refund and kept the straightener as it would have made the straightener super inexpensive. So why not keep it for a back up? I then placed a new order for the same one I was originally supposed to get and yet again, received the wrong flat iron. I was pretty irritated with that. However, I contacted the company directly this time and they immediately corrected the problem by sending the one I was supposed to get, along with a pre paid ship envelope to send the other one back. I was super pleased with them on that.&lt;br /&gt;They also asked why we preferred the digital to the non digital, which I appreciated them asking because as a company, they should do that in my opinion. I explained that even in using the digital after we decided to keep it, it did not work the same as the non digital one we owned previously (that I broke)...it just didn&#x27;t straighten the same, nor did the plates look the same to my daughter and I. So with that, we prefer the non digital version of this flat iron. It&#x27;s a great product. The digital works very good as well, don&#x27;t get me wrong...we just like the other better is all.&lt;br /&gt;So with that, this is a fantastic straightener, and the company that sells them completely backs up their product and wants your satisfaction in your purchase. I give the company five stars as well with how they handled it when I got the wrong item twice. I&#x27;d never hesitate to purchase from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great company to purchase from.ital works very good as well, don&#x27;t get me wrong...we just like the other better is all.&lt;br /&gt;So with that, this is a fantastic straightener, and the company that sells them completely backs up their product and wants your satisfaction in your purchase. I give the company five stars as well with how they handled it when I got the wrong item twice. I&#x27;d never hesitate to purchase from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great company to purchase from.</li>
    <li> This iron gets up to 430 degrees and straightens my hair and my clients very well. I love it. It has helped build my clientele and I am ready to see what else HSI has to offer.</li>
    <li> I really like the flat iron I have short hair. And it really works fast for what I need to fix my hair. thanks, again jeannine</li>
    <li> I received the flat iron in one day was very pleased with it. I have fine hair and often flat irons are too damaging to my hair. I especially like the glove for handling the iron is hot and the storage bag. I would recommend this flat iron to anyone no matter the hair type.</li>
    <li> Great so far....will update later</li>
    <li> Poorly made!  Purchased in Nov 2014, used about 5 times.  I last used it this week and went to pull the plug from my electrical socket, it completely came apart as I pulled it out the wall.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery. Loved it so much that I purchased 2 additional ones. It works even better than the Maxiglide that it replaced which in the past had been the only flat iron to get my hair straight. HSI leaves my hair looking like I just left the salon. I am beyond happy with this product and highly recommend it for unruly hair. :)</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and it is really easy to use and the glove really helps to protect my hand.</li>
    <li> Product came very quickly and was as described.  I really enjoy having a temperature setting.  I hope it will cut down on the damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this and love the way my hair looks.  Best Iron I have ever owned.  Even my hairdresser noticed a huge difference in my hair, less dry and way more shine</li>
    <li> I chose 4 stars instead of 5 only because the on/off switch is inside and near the heating element instead of on the outside.  That&#x27;s a danger if a person intends on using the switch.  Otherwise, it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Chi and Croc in the past, but they didn&#x27;t last very long. I wanted to try something inexpensive. I have medium thickness hair and it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair like the expensive brands. Also, the Croc had plates that would smoothly glide my hair through. The HSI feels rough when my hair glides through the plates.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this straighter.  It heats up very fast, and very hot.  It has the ability to set the heat you want in small increments.  We tried to use the glove the first day, and I still got burned.  It isn&#x27;t silicone.  I found the glove less useful.</li>
    <li> works great, high quality product.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener it really works great and the price was good too I will recommend it and the Company highly</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. I have curly hair and this straightens my hair pin straight within minutes</li>
    <li> Arrived throughly packaged and the product is a rock star. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a price you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
    <li> I am still a novice at using a flat iron, but I do like what this one does.  I can straighten as well as curl my hair which makes it a very versatile tool.  I do highly recommend using a thermal protector to protect the hair from over-heating.  I would recommend this iron...</li>
    <li> results : smooth shiney  hair :-)</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair so smooth and silky.  I have thick hair and this works great.  Love the argan oil it came with and the red silky carrying pouch.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This gets hot way faster than my other one did.  Its ready before I am even done blowdrying my hair.  I had thought that since I had really fine thin hair that I could get away with a lesser quality straightener since I didnt need it super hot anyways-wrong!  I will never buy a junk straightener again after having this one.  I can adjust the temp lower to still protect my hair.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have thick hair and it works relatively quickly. There&#x27;s no way to lock it shut and its a little bulky but otherwise a good product.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I bought a flat iron from our local mall for over $100. It may have been this same company. It was called &amp;#34;Hairstyler&amp;#34;.  I loved it. After years of use, it began to short out, so naturally I went to Amazon to look for another one just like it. I found this one. I was hesitant because of the low price but I took a chance. It is just like my older one and I can&#x27;t believe the price!! It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. I have course, frizzy textured, thick hair and it straightens my hair with ease. The product is exactly as it is described. My 16 year old daughter has a Babyliss flat iron and she likes mine a lot better. I will definitely order another one for my daughter very soon.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find a flat iron with tourmaline plates for such a great price. The recipient has reported it works well, is easy to use, and is a big improvement over the flat iron it replaced.</li>
    <li> Very good straightener. Came with a glove and hair treatment. Works like a champ. Thank you. I would definitely suggest this for everyone.</li>
    <li> I Love this flat iron!  It heats quickly and does not pull my hair.  This product gives me control as to how hot I want it with the heat dial setting.  I haven&#x27;t used the oil that came with the product yet so I do not know much about that but the travel bag is nice.  Overall an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of them for both of my daughters. They both love them!</li>
    <li> This is a good flat iron, it keeps my hair in style without damaging it.</li>
    <li> I bought this staightner because of the great reviews it had, but it&#x27;s NOT that great. Not better than the chi like some people said. It pulls on your hair. I have to have it on the highest setting for it to actually staighten my hair which is wavy, but not coarse. It does the job, but it takes me a little longer than usual. For the low price that I paid, I&#x27;ll keep it. But I&#x27;ll be saving up my money to buy a Chi.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair and it is very thick. I mean thick, when braided it&#x27;s as thick as a three year olds wrist. This iron straightened my hair in one pass,  which isn&#x27;t typical when ironing my hair.  I absolutely loved the end result and my hair actually remained straight the next day,  no touch up needed. This is a high quality straightener at an affordable price,  guess not everything is to good to be true!</li>
    <li> Curls wonderfully, heats up on a dime, case and heat glove are wonderful, fast free shipping. Great product, got to replace my old sedu and was looking for something to curl, flip, and straighten.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair after my hair returned following chemo treatments. This flat iron seems to do the job to straighten it out but the key is definitely how it is dried. I found when I let it dry naturally and the curls were there, the iron wasn&#x27;t able to straighten the curl out. Overall very pleased with the product. Delivery was very fast.</li>
    <li> Worthless.  Burns hair.  Best to order expensive flat iron that won&#x27;t fry hair.</li>
    <li> I was expecting an amazing product that got the job done extremely easy with semi lasting results.  However, my expectations of this product were not met fully.  It is a great product just not what I was looking for.  I had better results with straighteners that were slightly cheaper.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use this product, although I really wanted to. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize until after I purchased it that this straightener does not have a auto shut off feature. This is a deal breaker so I sent it back the day I received it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised but shipping was slow.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this flat iron.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Like the other review said it does pull your hair somewhat.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my thick hair. Heats up quick and arrived super fast. I just wish it had a timed shut off feature for safety reasons. Great flat iron for the price!</li>
    <li> took the iron to europe used it twice, it stop heating up after the that. had to drag around europe in my small bag for a month. When i got home, I asked for a return and never heard from the company. I also bought the multiple irons and never used them. I guess I am afraid they will not work also.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Highly recommend! Great buy!</li>
    <li> It is a good product for a decent price.  It took a few trys to get the kinks out of my hair (my hair is not super curly or anything), but in the end it did the job I wanted it to.  It took very little time to heat up which I really liked and I love that it came with the travel oil and glove.  I like the product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I live in hot and humid south Florida. This really worked on my frizzies (gray hair) and lasted from one day to the next. Amazing! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product. Straightens my thick frizzy curly hair better than any chi I&#x27;ve ever bought. The outside of the straightener looked and felt a little cheaper than I had expected but it does not hinder the way this straightener works. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> This straightener does not automatically turn off if left unattended for long amounts of time. I would not have purchased this particular straightener if I had known. The straightener itself does a good job. The lack of the safety measure of automatic shut-off is why I only give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is great  and worth the price.Worth the grab!!</li>
    <li> This burned out after a couple of test drives before our trip to Europe</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair coarse hair. I&#x27;m Mexican. I bought this because of it&#x27;s rave reviews and it turned out to be a dud. Did not straighten well, not hot enough for my type of hair. Would not suggest this product for ethnic women.</li>
    <li> After my straightener broke I wanted to get something better at a reasonable prize, and this product fit what I needed ! it doesn&#x27;t reach extremely high temperatures so its safe to use and will leave your hair completely straight ! definitely recommend it !</li>
    <li> Product is fine but still getting used to the narrower flat iron. My old flat iron was wider.  It works just fine and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used this straightener about 12 times in the last 8 months. It does not heat up any more. Maybe I just got a lemon one because somehow it gets thousands of great reviews. The reviews are the reason I bought this product but I wish I did not waste my money in the first place.</li>
    <li> I have had  the product for a few months now and it works just as well as when I bought it. This is the best flat iorn I have tried or owned, and though I am sure that there are better out the you just can&#x27;t bet this Quaity-price-Match. I recomend this to anyone who is looking for a well priced well made flat iorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets Hot Fast&lt;br /&gt;Lets You Know When It is Hot Enough&lt;br /&gt;Long Cord&lt;br /&gt;Cord Adjust&lt;br /&gt;Comes with Case and Mit&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil (Good Stuff ;)&lt;br /&gt;Nice Grip/Design&lt;br /&gt;The Love of My Hairs Life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Heat Contol is on the Inside</li>
    <li> For the money, I believe this is a good product. It feels like similar quality compared to the HAI iron I previously had.  My stylist recommended I look into a higher price range but as a stay at home mom, I couldn&#x27;t justify the purchase. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a few months with no obvious negative effects. I does snag my hair at times, though.</li>
    <li> It worked really well when I first got it.  Had it for about a year now and it&#x27;s already acting up.  Ironically, after the 1 year warranty was up (just like my Chi and FHI flat irons did).  The iron now heats up to the max, way too hot.  I cannot adjust the tempature anymore.  My hair is ruined because of this straightner.  I would give it 0 stars, but it&#x27;s my poor judgment for continuing to use it when it started acting up.  It was great while it worked, but it will only last you about a year.</li>
    <li> Works great! I love it.</li>
    <li> A major concern is there is no auto shut off. Minor concerns is the light that show on/off is on the BOTTOM of the flat iron and the on/off button is tucked inside the handle, very close to the hot surface.  Not sure what the thought process was behind the placement of that switch, but it&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;safe, in my opinion. Thanks for the glove, however, to place on the hand holding the hair, that was a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> So glad I finally upgraded my flat iron. The old one was way too wide, so hard to use with shorter hair and it would stick to the hair. Awful! This new iron solves all of those issues. Heats up quickly, easy to use with short hair, glides well on the hair. The travel case provided is quite nice too. I haven&#x27;t tried the argan oil or the glove but I&#x27;m a satisfied customer. It arrived quickly. as well.</li>
    <li> Works well as a straightner, struggles curling hair though.</li>
    <li> Good but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as i&#x27;d like</li>
    <li> Initially I was very excited about this product. The flat iron had raving reviews from women with various hair types. My hair is thick and very wavy. Following the reviews from several women who stated this flat iron worked wonders on difficult hair I made the purchase. My satisfaction of the flat iron slowly decreased and I am now regretting the purchase. The flat iron does not straighten my hair completely, it takes much longer than expected in attempting to straighten my hair, and it does not leave my hair straight. I have tried to contact the company for a refund or exchange with no success.</li>
    <li> Not as impressed as I had thought with all the great reviews. It is a bit above average. Possibly, I should have ordered the one with the larger plate.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Product exactly as described!</li>
    <li> My wife travels all over the world this device worked Great In Japan Israel in fact anywhere she travels good quality sturdy well made.</li>
    <li> Truly loved this iron! It&#x27;s one of the best irons I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> product delivered quickly and works as expected.</li>
    <li> I have only had this a short time but am very pleased with the results. My previous iron was a Chi and I was hesitant to try anything new - but I&#x27;m glad I did. The price is much more reasonable for the HSI. Also, I LOVE the argan oil included as well as the heat glove! I ordered using standard (free) shipping yet received the iron quickly. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My hair would be totally lost without my HSI. More affordable than CHI, and a better product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my granddaughter for her birthday. I hesitated because I like to buy gifts in advance and Amazon&#x27;s return policy is not as good as Costco&#x27;s or others. Whew! This works great and she loves it. She especially liked the temperature control, the case and the sample product. She is very happy with this flat iron. Still - I do not order many items early because of the return policy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what model other people are reviewing because it seems all reviews are lumped under multi listing for different models. I did not like this flat iron gave my hair static and fly aways. I will be returning this iron.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t love this more! I had always used a chi straightener and was scared to try anything else, but this works even better than my Chi and was half the price.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works wonderful.  The best part is that it leaves my hair so healthy looking and actually improves the blonde color of my hair</li>
    <li> Purchased it about two weeks ago. It heats up very fast and it&#x27;s very quick at straightening my curly frizzy hair. It is a great product. I did not find the glove they included very useful, the same goes for the little bottle of oil and pouch. But the main product is great!</li>
    <li> Everything was as advertised.  Works Great, just wish it had a automatic shut off timer.  Great product for the price though.  41WF/Florida</li>
    <li> It straightens well, able to add a little volume to hair by lifting the iron up at the roots.  My only complaint is that it takes forever to heat up.  ~3-4 minutes vs my previous iron that took 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I love it, only thing missing is theres no numbers on the heating options, only low, med and high. Other than that its a great buy!</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast. Works great on my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Great tool... fast shipping!  Very pleased with the price as well!</li>
    <li> I liked the straightener, worked well on my extremely thick, long hair. Then one day it just would not turn on. I am now left with frizzy hair and very disappointed.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!!</li>
    <li> It straightens my hair beautifully but.....the plates are loose and fall out of the grooves while I&#x27;m trying to straighten???? What&#x27;s with these plates??? anyone else have this trouble???  Bought another one of these because I loved the way it straighten my hair. Hoping that the loose plates were a freak problem. Don&#x27;t hear anyone else complaining about them. But this one isn&#x27;t as good it seems to grab my hair and it doesn&#x27;t get that hot. Oh well...Why is it when a company has a good product they change it..I find that all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy so far. I used to straighten my hair with a curling iron and it took forever. I was able to do in 10 minutes what used to take 30. The heat adjust easily, the iron is to handle and is fairly lightweight. I have and would continue recommending this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m quite clumsy...ok VERY clumsy lol so I have managed to break  two previous ones that I&#x27;ve ordered but I always order the exact same one. It works great! I can straighten, flip my ends, curl my hair, and have waves all with one tool.</li>
    <li> Excellent straightner! It heats up fast! Best straightner I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron with a couple of thrown in extras. Great value and quality!</li>
    <li> Still makes my hair frizzy even after I apply the oil that was sent with the flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is an OK flat iron. I was looking for something to tame my thick, semi-straight, frizzy hair that wasn&#x27;t too costly so I bought the HSI based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-heats up very fast&lt;br /&gt;-slim and compact for storage&lt;br /&gt;-various temp settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Auto shut off timer isn&#x27;t long enough, it has generally heated up and shut off before I&#x27;m even finished with blow drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Display is near impossible to see. it&#x27;s located inside the handle and at an odd angle so you can see the color that it&#x27;s lit but not the actual setting its on&lt;br /&gt;-snags and pulls hair between blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an OK flat iron for the price but when it&#x27;s dead, I won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
    <li> Love it, does a great job on my hair that lasts! Affordable price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Love it! I was looking for a new hair straightener since my old one had stopped working and I tend to straighten my hair more than average. I decided to purchase this one and it&#x27;s worth every penny! It heats up fast, my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck on the plates, and it comes with a mini sample of argon oil for your hair which by the way is great!</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because the small button to set the temperature is very inconvienent and I can&amp;#34;t tell how high the setting is.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous flat iron. I have used others before and none of them could make my hair as straight and shiny  as this one. Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Its a very good iron, i have used professional irons before and this is cool!! The plates do not pull my hair! However, It do not heat instantly and the temperature could be stronger, so this is great but not the best! It came really quick!</li>
    <li> Loved this straightener for traveling! It worked well in Europe and the UK which just a normal European-to-American plug adapter, no switching voltages or heavy converters needed! Heated up fast and remained hot. Only complaint is that it would seem to lose a bit of heat when straightening if you have thick hair. Overall, though, it was never that annoying and I would absolutely tell my friends to buy this straightener if they&#x27;re heading out of the country!</li>
    <li> I order the flatiron August 1st it came today August 7th. I opened it right up everything was clean looking good, then I plug it in to use it, it didn&#x27;t heat at all i turned it all the way to 410 and nothing I waited for 10 minutes I tried plugging it in somewhere else and I still got nothing so I&#x27;m sending them back not for replacement for my money!</li>
    <li> Easy in handling.  The argen oil sample with it is awesome. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Does a beautiful job straightening my naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best straight iron for such a great price.  I have used other big name brands that can cost $100 plus, and this easily compares with those.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair when I use it and I have very thick hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well unless something is super hot, and this works perfectly.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it for straightens and curling</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing I have very thick hair and with this straightener I can do my hair in 20 minutes when most others take about 45/69 minutes to get it done. It is very well built</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller service to match!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Will not buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice iron that left my hair so smooth and straight. Considering the price, no complaints whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Gets really hot very quickly and works great on my hair which is thick</li>
    <li> Absolutely a wonderful product</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the oil!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember buying this...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the HSI flat iron. It heats up quickly and straights my wavy hair in a one time pass over.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter with long, rather thick hair--she is happy with the results she gets and the oil made her hair oh so soft!</li>
    <li> Smaller then expected and doesn&#x27;t have a light indicator which was really helpful with my other HSI straightener to tell if it was on or off. But it definitely gets points for the ability to curl my hair quickly especially for an amateur in the curling department.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t nearly get hot enough to straighten my hair, and I don&#x27;t even have curly hair. Mine just gets wavy. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI Professional 1&amp;#34; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Straightener for my mom a few weeks ago and she liked it so much that I bought one for myself! It has a wide range of heat settings that work great for thick or thin hair, the element heats up quickly (30 seconds or so), which saves on waiting time, the Argon Leave in oil treatment is a bonus and leaves hair shiny, and it has a no tangle cord. A lot of straighteners I have tried end up snagging my hair or frying it, this one works great, no cons for me!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because I am planning to go to Europe and needed a flat iron with power conversion.  It works really well at home, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it with different power sources.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Good price.</li>
    <li> very well constructed and my wife is no longer complaining about her old flat iron.</li>
    <li> Only tried it once since i got it so far. Probably should have waited for it to get hotter but the light turned green and i used it but it didn&#x27;t work quite well. So im hoping it pays off the more i use it. Other than that i love it! Dont under stand the glove though</li>
    <li> Since receiving the flat iron by his I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and I can already tell you that I love it!  I&#x27;m definitely happy with my purchase.  I bought this to replace my CHI Flat iron that was no longer safe to use due to the cord began to crack, and created sparks.  The hsi iron works just as good if not even better than my old one.  I love the fact that you can adjust the temperature.  I use it on the highest setting due to I have thick, coarse, unruly hair.  I also love the sample of the Aragon oil, I need to get more.  I highly  recommend  the hsi flat iron.  It&#x27;s a great item at a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this straightener.  It leaves my hair soft, straight, and frizz free.</li>
    <li> She loves it. As good as much more expensive options</li>
    <li> The price was great, my graddaugters love it and so do I,  I have another brand of flat iron was much more expensive and the HSI Professional iron works much better left my air silky.</li>
    <li> This is my key to straight smooth hair! It keeps my bangs (literally) in line. Love the satin bag for storage, and the velcro keeper for the cord.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron thinking it would perform pretty close the the 4100 CHI flat irons. Unfortunately this is not the case. It works no better then my cheap $20 dollar flat iron. I have thick, wavy hair and it takes several passes thru my hair to get it to look the way I would like it to. This product was very disapointing.</li>
    <li> The straightener is nothing fancy. I like that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and I like the heat proof case and extras that come along with it. It&#x27;s a decent straightener for the money. But the customer service was great! My straightener came with a small chip in the plates and they sent me a new one with no questions asked and it was very quick! Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I thought with all of the positive reviews that this would be a good product.  I purchased this when my Sedu broke after 3 yrs and I wish I would have spent the extra just bought another Sedu.  This flat iron burned my hair after about a week of use (with protective product in it) - it seems like the heat setting is very unpredictable from use to use.  It also doesn&#x27;t flow through the hair well-it feels like it drags/and will snag your hair.  Not impressed.  Would not buy another HSI product.</li>
    <li> Everything as expected</li>
    <li> I have wavy thick hair. This straightener takes a long time to use. My previous straightener only took me maybe 15 minutes to get straight hair. This one was 25-30 minutes.  I had to swipe the same section at least 3 times for it to be straightened. Does not do frizz control. After about 2 hours my hair would become somewhat wavy in sections and a little frizzy. I live in NC and the humidity is high, but I also visited Utah (no humidity) and my hair still wouldn&#x27;t stay straight. Another con, it pulled my hair out while I straightened it. There is a small space between the plates that my hair would get snagged in.</li>
    <li> Gets hair super straight but you can&#x27;t adjust the heat. Other than that it works.</li>
    <li> This flat iron rocks my hair. Great value!!</li>
    <li> A great product for an amazing price! And the customer service and follow up is second to none. Do yourself a favor, and just get it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron. It works well and heats up fast. I use it every day on my medium length thin hair no problem.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! Works very well!</li>
    <li> Everything seems fine with my product.  Used it on my sister to test it out, thought it would straighten hair better, but it could be me not really knowing what I&#x27;m doing yet.  She has really curly hair and it straightened it, but it was also frizzy. Going to practice this a little more and hope it does a better job.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Works great. Shipped exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I was overall pretty happy with my HSI, but it crapped out on me almost a year to the day after I bought it. The cord keeps shorting out, so the unit won&#x27;t stay on. I kind of expected it to last a little longer, so I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have been skeptical about flat irons coming as advertised , so I love good surprises! This item came with extra bells and whistles. The shape is slightly rounded, there is a temp control and timer.Lightweight, very smooth finish and minimal heat up time.  Love, love, love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I move forward to 2017, and I am still happy with this gem. Just got back from a road trip that included multiple opportunities for fine dining, and the HSI kept me in great shape in the hair department!!</li>
    <li> Received my iron quickly and just as described.  I like the quality feel of the iron and it does a great job on my hair.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the price!</li>
    <li> My daughters who have really thick hair and average small curls really benefited from this flat iron. My eldest commented that her hair is lighter now because it&#x27;s straight. My youngest kept asking me to curl her hair with it. Straight or curly, either way they love it.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s great.  I purchased based on product reviews and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Delivery was quick, too.</li>
    <li> I had a chi for years and I like this flat iron way better. Leaves my hair feeling great and appreciate the temperature settings as the chi didn&#x27;t offer that.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE. I am an expert flat ironer and even on the highest heat, my hair was still frizzy in the end. The sample argan oil helped with smoothing hair but no matter what, my hair was very puffy after the stroke. I gave away my ConAir for this one and will definitely be switching back. If your hair is thin it may work to make it appear more thickened but if you&#x27;re already thick, don&#x27;t bother. Hate it. Wish I could return.</li>
    <li> August 2015 Purchase: I usually don&#x27;t write reviews. I&#x27;ve only used it for a day. Reading all these praising reviews I was expecting this straightener to be an amazing tool but it was just alright. It did snag on my fine curly/wavy hair, which was very disappointing. Argan oil smells amazing but have not used to it enough to notice a big difference overall. You get what you pay for I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pros: affordable&lt;br /&gt;comes with argan oil and carry case&lt;br /&gt;dual voltage&lt;br /&gt;heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;swiveling longgg cord&lt;br /&gt;decent quality&lt;br /&gt;glove provided to hold onto straightener, since it does get hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: snags on hair&lt;br /&gt;no auto switch off&lt;br /&gt;no lcd display for temp (only a tunable temperature setting old version)</li>
    <li> I love this very very much</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but for now it gets a great review from me because it straightens you hair while drying it.</li>
    <li> This product is Ok. I don&#x27;t like it too much.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this straightener. I had been using an inexpensive one and it just didn&#x27;t seem to be getting hot enough. When I received this one, the first thing I noticed was that the plates were crooked, so my hair would catch in the plates instead of glide through. Also, it didn&#x27;t seem to heat up any hotter than my old straightener. I returned this one and bought another brand that works much better for me.</li>
    <li> I like it, it leaves my hair soft and straight</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This flat iron performed just as I hoped it would. I needed it for travel in the U.K. and it has worked really well.</li>
    <li> Super little iron for a wonderful price!! Very happy with it so far!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected!</li>
    <li> My second and I love it.  Allows me to have more time between brazilian keratin treatments.</li>
    <li> So I read a lot of reviews and the only bad things people had to say involved people who had a much more expensive one they were trying to replace.... Glad I gave this a shot! It is smooth, my hair does well with it and it does not dry my hair out as much though I don&#x27;t use it every day as that is horrible for your hairs health but so far so good for me! I have fine hair though so that may make a difference...</li>
    <li> I expected great things from this product based on other reviews. I was disappointed to find that the product did not even turn on or get hot when plugging in. I reset the plug and tried other various troubleshooting techniques with no luck. Sending back!</li>
    <li> Nopes does not meet expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick black wavy hair and this iron does not do the best job; Hair is not even silky.</li>
    <li> Natural girl here, I love this flat iron. The only thing is that I wish the temperature dial was more user friendly. The only way I know that it&#x27;s on high (410°F) is when I can&#x27;t turn the knob anymore. Not good if you want it at a specific temperature. If it had a digital reader then I will give it 5 stars. Anyway, I love how soft and silky smooth it leaves my hair. And it comes with a travel baggie so that you can store it hot. I love flat ironing my hair now.</li>
    <li> great product works as promised</li>
    <li> Great product, GREAT price</li>
    <li> I was pretty iffy at first on buying this product... but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate spending money on pricey items like a Chi. So my straightener always use to be a Conair Wet to Straight straightener which I always thought did a great job. I never used the &amp;#34;wet to straight&amp;#34; part but for my thick hair I thought it did a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, the straightener died on me within a year and I was very disappointed. I decided to look at straighteners on Amazon and i&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me tell you about my hair. I dye it once a month (currently a dark brown) and my hairstyle in a inverted bob. That being said, my hair was pretty short but thick. Not the best condition it can be in sometimes as it use to frizz out pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also the type of person who will take a shower the night before, too tired to blow-dry, so I got to bed with a damp head. So waking up the next morning, my hair is everywhere. My morning routine is to head to the bathroom where I would first turn on my straightener, brush my teeth, etc to left it warm up since it took quite a bit. This straightener can go up to 410 F, which is what i use and it automatically heats up to that point within I would say a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say on my old straightener, took me about 20 minutes to completely straighten my hair. With this one, the time has been cut in half. The straightener first off feels so nice while you&#x27;re using it as it glides. And once it does straighten, your hair looks so nice and shiny. I&#x27;ve always used got2b straightening spray and I have to say that my hair style stays straighter for almost the whole day compared to my other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part for me: The pouch. I use to always leave my straightener on the counter to let it cool off before putting it away, which took forever that most of the time I had to leave for work. Now that I have this pouch, I immediately can put it away after done using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for $40, it&#x27;s a great straightener. so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Wife loved it she rated it 4 stars ...she said she couldn&#x27;t find an auto shut off and that would make it 5 stars</li>
    <li> This does a great job.  I really like that you can adjust the temperature.  However the dial is small and hard for &#x27;old eyes&#x27; like mine to see.  I am sure it is easy for you young ones.  It comes with a nice felt bag to store it in.</li>
    <li> Better than a Chi...and easier price than the Solia.  Great for the price. ..</li>
    <li> I had a cheaper flat iron that was not working for my hair.  This one makes a huge difference, and I love the sample of oil they provide--it makes my hair sleek and protects it from the heat.  My stylist says this brand is good as well.  My husband is happy with the results as well.</li>
    <li> I have used a Chi Iron for years, and if finally bit the dust. I got this based on low cost. It does straighten and does a good job, but it is not comparable to a Chi Iron. It leaves my hair a bit frizzy still, where the Chi Iron made is smooth and straight. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product at an unbelievable price. It&#x27;s perfect for me, plus the satin storage pouch comes in handy for traveling. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a nice straightener for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Ok for a cheap flat iron, but if your expecting Chi results don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> I used to have a GHD and opted for a less expensive straightener. The HSI is working great!</li>
    <li> The service was good but the straightener itself isn&#x27;t as good as I expected.  Pros: it works in the UK and it heats up quickly.  Cons: it isn&#x27;t as hot as I expected and leaves your hair dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slim, effective, great for curling or straightening and is dual voltage. I&#x27;ve used this in no less than 5 countries and got the same operation quality in each. Quickly smooths and straightens my hair, flips, curls, whatever I want it to do. I have thick soft hair. I had very long hair that is now shoulder length and it worked well for both. I&#x27;ve never bought that designer brand one and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need it with this one.</li>
    <li> I like how fast it heats up. It also slides through your hair easily to curl it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom- she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get&#x27;s almost as hot as my Chi which is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I was excited when it arrived but have been disappointed in the heat quality. It really doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I need for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> arrived with a cracked plate s I reordered it and am returning this one</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter wanted a straight iron to keep at her dad&#x27;s house. I wasn&#x27;t about to shell out the kind of money that I spent on mine. She says it works just as well as my more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I am a african american with medium hair. When washed its really soft and curly but gets tangled very easily. I really like these flat irons. They leave my hair soft and I love the fact that when it gets to the ends their is no pulling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my trip to Europe because it says it will work with their voltage. I decided to use it at home first to make sure it was going to work. It works but I still love my Thairapy 365 wet and dry flat iron better. I didn&#x27;t want to risk damaging it though in Europe.</li>
    <li> Does an amazing job. Bought it for my mom and she has really thick curly hair. It does such a beautiful, quick job.</li>
    <li> I loved this flat iron for the first 3 months that I had it....until it stopped working.  I would turn it on and the light would just flash red and never turn green.  I tried resetting the plug as instructed, but have continued to have issues.  It will not heat up at all any more, and it&#x27;s too late to return it to Amazon, so I&#x27;ll have to throw it out.  I&#x27;m very unhappy to have to throw away a $50 item that I have owned for only a few months.  I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this HSI ceramic iron to keep in my gym/travel bag. I thought I should give it a test run. Thusly, it never made it to my travel bag. I love it! Often one pass of the iron through my hair is all that I need. My more expensive and less quality flatiron is relegated to the guest bath. I&#x27;m buying another HSI for my travel/gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> i am 28 years old and have never had a hair straightener. this straightener is great, my hair looks perfect. and i love the argon oil. so happy i made the jump - previously i was just using a curling iron to straighten my hair. woo hoo!</li>
    <li> Item was shipped quickly, packaging was correctly sealed. Flat iron works good. However, it&#x27;s not a smooth feeling on my hair - it feels gritty.</li>
    <li> I bought a GHD straightener after another one of my CHI straighteners broke. Because the GHD was a high-end product, I expected it to work wonders. Unfortunately, I felt that the GHD did not heat up enough. I had to flat iron the same piece of hair 3 times to get it straight. I have thick, wavy hair that is dyed, high-lighted, and frizzy. The GHD did not help with the frizz at all. I returned the GHD and ordered the HSI straightener off of Amazon. WOW! This straightener gets my hair straight with one pass and I don&#x27;t have to turn the heat up all of the way. I love this straightener! It heats up quickly, does not snag my hair, and makes straightening my hair a quick and easy process. The price is the cherry on top. They also have another version of this straightener that shuts itself off after two hours (for those of us who forget to turn it off) This product is definitely top-notch and worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have other brands but this iron is the best one.  The Argon oil makes my hair soft and shiny without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been searching for a flat iron that would be affordable and dependable. I have only had it for a short while but I have to say it has made such a difference in styling my hair.  It is easy to use, has a good range on the temperature control too.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love this because:&lt;br /&gt;1.) It&#x27;s perfectly shaped to straighten AND curl. The cord swivels for curling. 1 tool does everything I want.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Adjustable heat settings-- I have damaged hair from color processing. Used with a heat protectant, the argon oil included with the iron &amp; the lowest heat setting, I was able to get my hair to appear more soft &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has worked perfectly well so far. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron worked better than expensive products that i have previously tried!</li>
    <li> It works ok but not nice as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a teenager with long thick hair. I liked that the temperature range was the same as the one her stylist used and when she used it at home her hair looked great!</li>
    <li> My daughters have sworn by their Chi hot iron for years but were suprised about how well this flat iron performed.  Agreed it is just as good or better!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for the little sis. She seems happy with it. It arrived on time and was in great gift worthy condition. No complaints here :-)</li>
    <li> I chose this after watching a YouTube video depicting the use of a flat iron. I have developed unmanageable tufts of hair in my old age that stick out from the sides of my head like Scrooge McDuck. The aragon oil that is recommended with this works well without the flat iron. The flat iron has helped me look more &#x27;put together&#x27; although it takes practice.</li>
    <li> I do not like this flat iron, it doesn&#x27;t get really hot, it doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair out I have used it on my thick African American hair and I used it on my mannequin hair and it doesn&#x27;t curl the hair well, human hair or weave hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this straightener in the mail, but I am wondering if I got a defective model because mine didn&#x27;t seem to heat up correctly and it really snagged and pulled my hair when I used it. I usually blow dry my hair with a round brush, but I like to use a straightening iron to give it a sleeker, more modern look. I had to turn it up to the highest temperature to even make my hair straight instead of curled under. That and the pulling thing was enough for me to send it back. I am not sure why it received such rave reviews from others. Maybe it works better on course hair and not fine hair like mine. Hope others have better results!</li>
    <li> Works great and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Great price also. You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one! I ave all lengths of hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and the HSI flat iron works wonders in straightening my hair in less than half hour. Perfect!</li>
    <li> To heavy if you need to hold for any length of time.  If not, great unit and a very good price.</li>
    <li> I did&#x27;nt know the difference between a plastic hair straighter and  a ceramic one till I saw in the ceramic one at the mall, which they were selling it for over $100. I came home found this product checked the review and ordered the same day. Now I have it and I like it a lot, works the same as I saw in the mall but a lot cheaper.  ENJOY</li>
    <li> My sister in law wanted a flat iron for Christmas and after reading reviews online, I decided to buy this one...&lt;br /&gt;So far, she is happy with it...  Fast shipping...  :)</li>
    <li> I have very thick very wavy long hair and I use a wide flat iron for it but I needed a narrow iron for the waves that are close to the root.  This works great.  It gets very hot, but does not burn my hair.  Makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I am a black female with natural coarse hair.  This flat iron made my hair bone straight and my hair is very tightly coiled.  When I use Tresemme heat spray as a heat protectant, my hair looks amazing!  I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my mother and it really lived up the hype without a doubt! The fact that is comes with warranty and not to mention the amazing service given, I am very pleased! This can curl and straighten very well! We came across DOZENS of hair straigteners and NEVER lasted long. We would spend so much money. Of course the price to this is quite a lot for a hair straightener, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. I have my own straightener, but I always seem to be going to my mom&#x27;s room using this one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Good worth my bucks recommend to anyone that wants straight hair especially of color with thick hair it really works</li>
    <li> heats fast, straightens the first time.  My hair is shinier than before and stays straight through the next day!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!  The last flat Iron I purchased stopped working before one year and when I tried to contact the manufacturer they did not have an email address or a phone number that was working.  I purchased the HSI because it has great reviews and like that I can go back to Amazon if I have problems.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Warms up quickly and works well. if I use it as explained by my hairdresser, it works just as she described. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing straightener! I was a little leery at first at how well it would work because of the price, but this straightener works just as good, if not better, than my $200 straightener. It straightens my hair in one try and curls my hair so easily! I will be ordering another one as back-up!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. It&#x27;s small sleek and does the job in a flash. Leaves hair silky smooth and straight.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I just got this I have naturally curly hair but I wear it straight, my ends are always frizzy and I&#x27;ve learned to live with that. But turns out it wasn&#x27;t my hair it was my hair straightener&#x27;s!!! So it leaves my hair straight shiny and no more frizz and as a bonus I can even curl it with this, something I have watched friends do and tried for years with no luck they kept saying I needed to &#x27;train&#x27; my hair.... nope just get the right straightener. Love it my hair looks great and feels great and I have been using low to medium (almost to the middle on the dial) setting all my other straighteners I had to use on high or my hair wouldn&#x27;t get straight even after going over the same spot 6 times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously great flat iron my hair has never looked better and it takes less than 1/2 the amount of time. I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner heat protectant stuff that it came with but I plan to. The only negative is I can&#x27;t get the cord to fit in the carry bag with the straightener but its not like I will ever really use it so no biggie.</li>
    <li> So far, my wife loves it.  Works great on the kids&#x27; hair.  Hasn&#x27;t tried making a cheese sandwich with it yet, though.</li>
    <li> I checked reviews before ordering and have not been disappointed. I have fine hair and it works great for me. Love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter got this as a Christmas gift. She absolutely loves it. It straightens it quick and good!!! I would recomend it!!!</li>
    <li> What a deal.........Works great...heats up super fast....love the way my hair feels after...and stays that way til i wash my hair again..........what a steal....better than CHI....to me.</li>
    <li> So far this has lived up to all the review I read about it.  I have been using it for about 2 months now and it works great. I have semi curly hair and it straights it on the first go through.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I want to say that my girlfriend loves it. And for me to say this about her is very rare. She is very picky about things.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is ok,  it does get very hot but... It just doesn&#x27;t glide through your hair well, it kinda pulls at the hair as your running it through it, and pulls some of it out  ):</li>
    <li> I bought this well over a year ago and it still works very well. I even dropped it pretty good once. My son and i both use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Great item. My wife loves it. she tells me almost every day how great it works. she was very happy when she opened it on christmas.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my wife. After reading several reviews, decided it sounded like it was worth a try. My wife loves it. It has worked great. She has had no complaints or problems with it. Bought along with an auto shut-off plug (sold separate) which makes it even better since it will shut off if she forgets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 2+year old Remington straighter and it was getting a bit squeaky so I decided to try this straightener out since it&#x27;s apparently amazing with it&#x27;s 2000+ reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say that I am a bit disappointed with this purchase. The first straighter I received was defective and didn&#x27;t heat up properly, even at 400 degrees. At the lowest setting, there wasn&#x27;t any heat, and at the highest setting, it seemed to be at the lowest heat setting. My old straighter has a LED thermostat and I swear it heats up hotter at 320 degrees than this one does at over 400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while I am using the straightener, the light that indicates if it&#x27;s completely heated turns from green to red. This tells me that while  the plates are together, it shuts off and when you release it, it begins to heat up again. Must be bad wiring or something because even my cheapo 20 dollar straighter doesn&#x27;t do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Novelties, the company I purchased this on amazon from was kind enough to immediate ship me a replacement after I informed them of this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the placement and upon using it, it seemed to work fine on the lowest heat setting so I assumed it would work even better on the highest. This wasn&#x27;t the case. It started experiencing the same problems as the first one they sent me, light turning red while in use, and not heating up to the degree indicated on the dial. It seems to heat a up a bit more than the first one I received but it still kind of sucks and it takes me longer to straighten my hair than my old, beat up straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am a bit disappointed with this product. It does straighten my hair after like 30 minutes of use compared to 15 minutes with my old straightener, but I didn&#x27;t pay 50 bucks to waste more time.</li>
    <li> I have naturally very wavy to loose curly hair and have spent a good portion of my life straightening it. I have tried a lot of different brands and this one is overwhelmingly the best. It has great heat setting control and it smoothly moves over my hair; no tugging. My hair looks healthy and shiny and doesn&#x27;t end up with a lot of split ends or breakage. The price is right for this professional grade flattener. The only think I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have automatic shut off and I have forgotten to unplug or turn it off a couple of times, but that&#x27;s on me. I very highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Started out okay but after using for a little while the temperature shot up and Burned my hair.  The cost to ship back is not worth it to return. Would NOT recommend !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hot tools titanium straightener for about 4-5 years. At first i really liked it but then after i bought a second one, i realized it sucks compared to other straighteners. So my second one just randomly breaks on me and i needed a new, cheapish straightener so i came across this according to high rates and popularity.  I bought the basic one cause theres no need for that Digital LCD screen.  It heats up pretty fast, but i think that red light/green light function is utterly useless since it switches back and forth.  NOW. the one things i REALLY dont like is the way the straightener doesnt glide across my hair. My hottools straightener glided through my hair like butter. this straightener kind of snags little strands of my hair which is irritating and the straightener grips onto my clothing as well when i open and close it.  All in all, it gets the job done. my hair is pretty straight and shiny after use. this is a good temporary striaghtener but im going to save up for the babyliss titanium nano pro straightener instead.</li>
    <li> The HSI Flat Iron hair straightener is a truly awesome product at a truly awesome price!!!  They even included a professional styling glove and a sample of their argan oil, which is remarkable to say the least!! My hair has never had a more silky, professional look/feel without paying significant money at a salon. I would highly recommend the HSI Flat Iron!!!  I would not purchase any other brand!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and coarse curly hair and this flat iron did the job! My hair was shiny and straight after an hour and a half (approximately the time to straighten my frizzy lion mane). I am extremely happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I got the flat irong very quickly and love how it works. The flat iron also heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> this is the most expensive flat iron i have ever bought in my entire life. All the irons i bought where under $30. Hence, it was a bit of  a sacrifice that i had to make. it does a good job; it straightens my hair very good,and it allows me to make curls. i just don&#x27;t like the smell, but i guess the smell comes with all irons.</li>
    <li> i love this flat iron. it gets hot and does a great job straightening my hair. i use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t purchase this. Poor quality I feel like I should have spent a little bit more money for a better quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Next time... I will.</li>
    <li> I purchased based on the overall volume of good reviews, but I really don&#x27;t understand where those all came from.  I&#x27;ve only used cheap $20 flatirons before and wanted a nicer one but this one is painful to use...it pulls my hair terribly and I&#x27;m left covered in pulled out hair after using it for 10 minutes.  I just used a 20 euros flatiron on vacation for a week and it was a dream compared to the HSI!!</li>
    <li> I had long resisted purchasing a flat iron because I thought I would not be able to find a good one which would work on my thick curly hair without spending over $100.  Based on Amazon reviews, I purchased this flatiron.  Both my daughter and I have loved this flat iron.  Not only does it straignten and smooth hair quickly, it leaves it shiney and glossy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I waited so long to research a product and make a purchase.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is everything I thought it would be.  It came on time and was packaged professionally.  This was a Christmas gift from my boyfriend and one of my favorite gifts I received.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this flat iron. It heats up in seconds. Yes, that&#x27;s right. I said SECONDS. I just plug it in, turn it on, count to 10, and it&#x27;s ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several curling irons, but I normally use this to curl my hair because I like the loose curls that you can only get with a flat iron, and it works great for that. It does a stellar job as a straightener too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely can&#x27;t imagine my life without this thing now. I use it every day and am extremely happy with this purchase. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> works very nice.  I actually got curls in my hair from using it that have held for 2 days.  Nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a superior flat iron and the price was fantastic. Getting the Aragon Oil was also a very nice bonus.</li>
    <li> I purchased as a gift for my wife and she is very pleased with it, works well  warms up to right temperature</li>
    <li> This was my first non-hand me down Flat Iron purchase - used it the day I got it, works wonders, takes no time at all and I&#x27;m loving the compact-ness of it!</li>
    <li> this straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot or stay hot consistently. I would return it, but id rather beat it with a bat than be short return shipping and empty handed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancés birthday present, and she loves it! I did a lot of studying on different types of flat irons, and for the price and all the good reviews I ended up choosing this one.  i highly recommend this product. It takes about 2 min to heat up an does wonders for thick wavy hair. And yes there are negative reviews out there on this product, but every item will get them, most of the bad reviews happen because the people who are shipping the item mishandle packages all day and thats how they get damaged.... but overall your not going to find a better product for the price unless your willing to spend over a hundred dollars.  My fiance has been using it for just over a month now and not one complaint from it. It also comes with a safety heat glove and a sample of argon oil I did not even know about. So hurry up and get this! You will no be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have long hair that is naturally straight but wavy. I like my hair to be pin straight and I have not been able to find a straightener that really makes my hair look fantastic, until now! I absolutely love this straightener! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> got it just on time. I actually bought it for my sister and she loves it. Her fizzy hair is finally tamed.</li>
    <li> Does not do at all what it claims would not straighten my hair... returned the product right away after receiving.</li>
    <li> The product was almost everything I expected. It looked very nice and professional. The only issue I have with it that I find kind of weird is that when it gets up to temperature and the light turns green, it doesnt stay green. It goes from red to green. Not sure why this is but no other flat irons ive had have ever done that</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this straightener.  She has VERY thick hair and this works very well to get the hair really smooth. It also came with a small bottle of argan oil to smooth hair.</li>
    <li> This item is affordable and handy. It does not blow steam/ smoke like other flat irons. It gets the job done and it is easy to use. I wish I can get my hands on a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have been using different kinds of hair iron but this product satisfy me. It&#x27;s great to use and no more damaging hair from everyday use of hair iron</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron to use with the Keratin hair treatment process and it worked beautifully! The iron heats up to 410 deg which is the lowest temp required for this process and this is just as hot as I wanted it to be because my hair wouldn&#x27;t tolerate it any hotter. And it did the trick, it straightened the hair but didn&#x27;t burn it. Another nice touch was the glove they provided which made doing this process much more comfortable because you have to apply heat to strands of hair 5 to 7 times and the hair gets very hot, enough to burn your hand. I would also mention that it was delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  It heats up quickly and only takes 5 minutes of my time! I should have purchased it a long time ago!</li>
    <li> I loved this hair iron! It leaves my hair silky and smooth. It works wonderful and you won&#x27;t get a better deal for it&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife and she says her older one on the same temperature it blazing hot but this one it get just hot enough to were she likes it.</li>
    <li> Exploring my long hair look for the first time (male) and this does the trick for an affordable price! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works great!  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was there is no light or anything to let you know if it&#x27;s turned on.  Also it would be great if it had auto shutoff.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend doing business with Abzoo.... The product was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Great communications with seller.The flat iron works great. Its more than what I&lt;br /&gt;expected. If you are looking for an inexpensive flat iron but want a professional one,&lt;br /&gt;this is the one to get!</li>
    <li> Great purchase, you need just 5 minutes and you will feel like just left from hairdressers’ office, really recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and came with lots of extras (trail heat gel, a styling glove, storage pouch). Definitely not as good as my old chi but you can&#x27;t beat this straightener for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good streightener,  I already had one, but it was horrible. When I saw HSI, started to read the reviews, those were a big help to me.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday tried it on my hair, and it was like I expected. I&#x27;M SO HAPPY!!!</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Heats fast&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;- Quick application&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable heating feature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Would like it to get a little hotter at the top setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for the lady. She loves it! Much cheaper than the Chi branded straighteners.As I&#x27;m writing this, she&#x27;s providing feedback. She says that for a straightener, it doesn&#x27;t curl well. To me, that&#x27;s crazy talk, but I guess some women actually use straighteners to apply curl so they don&#x27;t have to use multiple products. Just craziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I saved quite a bit buying this thing. She has no complaints at all. For an affordable price, you get a great build quality with a chic case.</li>
    <li> It works great. I don&#x27;t like buying things on line but the reviews were accurate. There is a temp gauge which is great. It gets pretty hot and allows me to do my hair in less time as a result. Solid product, shipped in the right time and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing straightener and curler.  Works wonders on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I definitely recommend this to anyone.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, heats up in about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with this five star appliance, because in my opinion it really is the Rolls Royce of hair straighteners, (I am British). It has all the bells and whistles that anyone could wish for, and does the job excellently and quickly.  This item is top quality in every respect, and I never travel without it - even to Europe.  I love the protective travel bag together with all the other stellar features, and highly recommend this professional hair straightener.  It makes such a positive difference to my hair and therefore my general appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Gramcrackergran, CA.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron, and it really worked wonders on my hair. My hair looked shiny and soft, I certainly will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> The only thing  I dislike about this flatiron is the temperature setting is hard to set.  It takes small fingers to adjust to the proper heat setting.  Otherwise, it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I really like this iron. I have wavy hair and this iron i s hot and does the job well. Made nice and lite to handle. The 1 inch is perfect for my thick hair. I would recommend this straightener. I have use many others and this beats them all.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to love this, but it never seemed to retain its heat. It took forever to heat up and every time I passed through my hair, it would lose its heat again. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a great buy. The straightener works great, and you never get the feeling of your hair being burnt. It comes with a cute case to store it in. I have very thick medium blonde hair and it straightens it within 3-5 strokes around my head (which is great for me.) I am impressed with it. I would recommend it to anyone. My hair still feels and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> This product is everything that I hoped it would be.  I have crazy curls and they are extremely difficult to tame.  I have tried other flat iron&#x27;s and none of them could keep my locks straight for an entire day.  This flat iron does and outstanding job without having to use the aid of hairspray or any other product with it.  I give it 10 thumbs up!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few straighteners and they all failed to keep my hair straight for the majority of the day. With this one, after school and everything when I come home, my hair is still pretty darn straight. Best straightener I have ever used :).</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the HSI Professional Flat Iron that I ordered from Amazon.com.  It came in a nice presentation box - flat iron, pouch case, sample of argan oil and glove.  I have only used this iron a few times, but it is even making my hard to straighten hair nice and straight without frying it.  A good value for the purchase price.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to get this one because of its claims to be less damaging on your hair, but I almost feel like my old straightener, one that I had for over 6 years and bought at target for $14, a very cheap metal plated one, works better, leaves my hair straighter longer, and treated my hair the same way. I like that this straightener has the light to alert you when it is heated to the right temperature and that I can also curl my hair with it, something that I wasn&#x27;t able to do with the old one, and that it heats and cools fairly quickly. I still choose to use this one over my old one because I can curl it and do more with it, but am disappointed in its claims to be less damaging.</li>
    <li> This iron worked fine for my very thick hair.  Yes, my hair does pull a little, but that happened on other irons as well.  I think because I am trying to straighten too much hair at one time.  Leaves my hair straight and silky with the help of a gel type straightener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it! I find it to be very high quality and simply a steal for the price!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a flat iron, sight unseen. However, I&#x27;m delighted with this product. It does everything as described - couldn&#x27;t be happier. And the price was right.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was pleased to receive it in less time than they said it would take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have used it only about 3 times, and I have noticed that the red indicator light starts coming on while I am using it.  This is after it has been plugged in, and the light has turned green.  This occurred 3 times while I did my hair . My hair is fairly short, so it doesn&#x27;t sit long while I am dividing the strands of hair to be straightened, so I&#x27;m not sure why the red light keeps returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it is working properly at this point.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Much better than her old one that I paid much more for.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this iron, as it was a replacement for a CHI iron that just quit on me out of the blue. But, it arrived and I immediately put it to work and found that it snagged and pulled at my hair. It may be because the plates don&#x27;t come together evenly, so some hair remains caught in the plates while other hair is let loose. I am not really sure why, but I can see uneven gapping when I look at the plates as they are pressed together. I need a flat iron that does not pull at my layered hair. It is going back.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flatiron with trepidation, since the last one I had cost a lot more and heated up to 450degrees, (this one only goes to 410 degrees). I have extremely thick coarse hair and thought I needed the 450 degrees, but went ahead and purchased this because of the price.  I have been very happily surprised, the flat iron works great on my hair, it heats up quickly and the pouch provided is very pretty. All in all a great buy</li>
    <li> I was a faithful CHI customer for 10 years.  After I had 3 CHI flat irons fizzle out in the period of one year, I was over that brand.  I read reviews for this flat iron and I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!! The quality is equal to, if not far superior, to that of a CHI.  I was also impressed with the packaging (received a glove, argon sample, and a carrying case).  My hair is silkier and I am able to straighten my hair in record timing.  I also like the heating feature of the iron so I could play with the temperature setting.  I have fine hair and this iron is perfect.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> So A hair straightener on the Gift list I figured pretty easy gift little did I know they range in all areas of prices sizes and even shapes all claiming to be the best. So walking into target Walmart etc... Was a headache because I like to see reviews and feedback before I buy products for myself but since this is for my girlfriend it better last and do its job or ill never hear the end of it. So I trusted the ration of great feedback to the one star reviews that were a little worrisome and I&#x27;m glad I did this is mostly what I hear from my girl I obviously am not a personal user if this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros : great size . Heats up very quickly cord is a good length , looks stylish , comes with a cute baggy to carry while traveling , comes with a glove but its not used , lightweight and above all it gets the job done with half the time of other products. Also great price ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons : not to many here at all as long as it keeps working as it did brand new for a good amount of time but she did tell me that the sample they send you for your hair wasn&#x27;t enough to really see if its worth buying whatever that is ladies you might know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product it works and a great price she Loves it so I love it ill one more thing she doesn&#x27;t use it every day so I do not know how it will hold up under constant demand</li>
    <li> I purchased the flat iron for a Christmas gift.  The person I selected it for had specifically asked for a Chi iron and did not want any other, so I was a bit nervous when I purchased this one.  After comparing the two, I just found the HSI to have better quality and ratings.  Soooo, quality won out over brand name.  I am very happy to say that after using it just once, the person I gifted it to was thrilled with her HSI flat iron.</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like it, she said it does not work as good as Babyliss. She has very sick and dry hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this flat iron. I was getting tired of my Chi iron because I felt that I wasn&#x27;t getting the shine like I get at the salon. Well this iron is worth the money spent on it. You can adjust the heat setting for your hair texture and this flat iron left my hair shiny and bouncy. The box includes a glove that come along with the iron to protect your hand from the hot hair. I rate this iron 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> excellent hair straightner - we love it, came well before time &amp; works very well - was packaged very well too</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener. For the price it works very well. It tugs on my hair a little bit (meaning it doesn&#x27;t glide down my hair softly), but it gets the job done. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this much but the times I have it works great! It heats up very fast and gets very hot. The silky bag is really nice too!</li>
    <li> awesome, this is usually freakin expensive and Amazon is the bomb.com for giving us ladies a deal. Love Love, it works perfectly on my long thick, curly/wavy hair and i have a lot so its a must have, if ur thinking about getting it, i recommend it and give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My cheap old flat iron works better then the new HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener</li>
    <li> Great I love it. Bought to curl my hair since I already own a good iron but I&#x27;ve already forgotten about the other one. This one does not snag your hair and it heats up quick and makes your hair straight and shiny. Great for my half white half black hair.</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes my hair nice and smooth!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had bought this as a replacement after  my beloved and relatively brand new CHI was ruined from a faulty adapter used on my trip to Europe. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for a new one so I decided to give this a try.  I figured why not, it was inexpensive enough and if it wasn&#x27;t great it would at least hold me over until I could afford a better one.  Well, I was amazed at how well it worked.  Gets hot enough to tame my unruly hair and its a GREAT price. I&#x27;ve had this product for 8 months now and it is still going strong.  I don&#x27;t even miss having the digital feature like I thought I would.  I have found the perfect spot on the dial and never touch it so it works perfectly every use.</li>
    <li> Got I for my daughter who has curly hair - she loves it! Other straighteners took her over an hour to get ok but sometimes frizzy results. She uses this and is done in 25 minutes and can do loose curls in a snap!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic Iconic Hair Straightener. Great company!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully in half the time, strokes whatever you call it. Well worth the price. I threw all my old straighteners out!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron,  but hard to put back in the pouch.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my niece and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this brand or not, but it works great!</li>
    <li> I live in a city that has super humid summers and this has been the one and only flat iron that has kept my hair straight and frizz free. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It served me well...until I got a short haircut!</li>
    <li> love it and it&#x27;s well made!!  I bought two</li>
    <li> Works great.  Arrived quickly.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is AMAZING! At first I was really hesitant in buying this product because of all of the bad reviews.In the end, I decided to give it a shot since it was the number 1 seller on Amazon for hair straighteners. When I received it, the box was damaged (there was a huge bent mark on the corner of the box). I was really scared of the product afterwards, but even so, I gave it a chance. When I used it, oh my goodness, it was AMAZING! It literally heated up REALLY quickly (10 seconds at most) . I didn&#x27;t even try when I was curling my hair, and it came out BEAUTIFUL! It was SO smooth when I was using it (no snag). Not only that, but there was NO burnt smell after using it at all! Usually every time I do my hair, it always leave a burnt smell, but not this product. This product also made my hair feel very smooth! I am quite surprised. I never knew a hair straightener can actually feel as if it&#x27;s natural! No smell, and easy to curl/straight! Only thing I&#x27;m iffy about would be it smells sorta plasticy when it is on. Other than that, theres nothing wrong with this product and its amazing! I know this could happen with any product, but this product when I curled my hair lasted for couple days. I do recommend buying it!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and is just as described.  Using this flat iron with a little bit of argan oil leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery. One of the best purchases I have made on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Arrived before the date expected, on a Sunday - LOVE! Used it that day, and every day since....heats up quickly, easy to use!  Just as I expected! Great value for the $!</li>
    <li> Love this - works great!</li>
    <li> Great value.  Nice size, easy operation.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have owned quite a few. This is by far the best one. You can not beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have only used this flat iron once. It is comparable to a Chi iron. I was able to straighten my daughter&#x27;s natural kinky curly hair with this flat iron using Argan Oil by One and Only. Her hair came out very silky and hydrated. I was super thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> Just what I need, especially for my travel to Europe. I really, really like this product. Just as I expected!</li>
    <li> While I like this flat iron a lot, I haven&#x27;t experienced a huge difference between this one and my old cheap Conair iron. The HSI does seem to get hot faster. I do wish there was an auto shutoff future though.</li>
    <li> This product worked great...when it worked. I bought it November 2013. Now, in July 2014, not even a year later, it has a short in it and turns on and off while in use. I just got on Amazon to see if I can get a replacement since I have only owned it for 10 months, but it stated that I lost that privilege January 2014. I am not happy as this stayed in one place in my bathroom and handled well. There is no reason for it to have a short in it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a present for my sister and oh boy is her hair straight now</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron, that is at an unbelievably good price on here! The first iron I received from this company had a slight issue, the plates didn&#x27;t press together properly which resulted in it not working very effectively; however, I sent them an email regarding this, and with no questions asked, they quickly sent me a new iron that turned out working amazingly! It&#x27;s a very good product, and a very good company to work with as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this straightening iron for months. I purchased it after I had a second CHI bite the dust. It is quick and efficient. It arrived quickly as advertised, and even came with a little bottle of hair oil - which smells wonderful and helps smooth my hair :) Great purchase overall!</li>
    <li> It is the bomb for wet and dry hair.  Tames fizzes.</li>
    <li> Works well. Heats up quickly</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for a $250 GHD iron that after 6 months of use I just was beyond unhappy with.  Returned it to the store  and took a chance on this much lower priced HSI item instead.   On day 1 I knew I I had made the right choice.  Works just as described.  Heats up fast, can get a nice, sleek, straight look fast.  Low price is a just a bonus!  Just wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted 6 months hoping that maybe I could get used to that other expensive GHD model.</li>
    <li> amazing product! I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron.  I have totally straight hair, and if anyone ever told me I&#x27;d use a flat iron, I would have thought they were nuts!  I love the way it makes my hair sleek and I can give it just a hit of curl at the end.  It heats up fast and has an indicator light to let me know when it&#x27;s ready.  The width of the plates are great for this newbie. I get the look I want without weird kinks and goofy bends.  The padded bag reminds me not to bounce it around and to take care of it.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> would give it 5 stars but have not really learned to use a flat iron.  The order and shipping went smooth.  Wish I could say more but this is about all I know about a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Read the other reviews and thought it would be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but it doesn&#x27;t go through my hair smoothly. I have wavy (not very curly) hair and I wanted an iron to reduce the frizz. I wish I had spent the money for a CHI iron as my daughter has one and it just glides through my hair every time, even after being 4 years old. Keep in mind the old adage \\&quot;buy cheap, buy twice\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and don&#x27;t see myself using it again. It doesn&#x27;t glide through your hair at all and feels like it is pulling. It will go on craigslist.</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty thick, and this works well on it. It straightens quickly and my hair stays straight throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 months and it&#x27;s held up well. My only complaint is that it pulls my hairs a lot as I use it.</li>
    <li> want to protect my hair as much as possible even when straightening. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have to hold it closed. otherwise worth the 5 stars</li>
    <li> My wife has been very pleased with this.  We haven&#x27;t had any of the performance/quality issues that others have mentioned.  We&#x27;ve only had it a few months though.  Overall we&#x27;ve been very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> great and does not over heat</li>
    <li> I so love this. keeps my curls and does wonders. thought it was smaller when they said travel size like a 1 inch type that could fit in handbag but it couldnt</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in preparation for a trip to Europe. My biggest requirement was the dual voltage. The styling iron worked well, heats quickly, and came with a very nice travel pouch and styling glove. My only complaint is that the spring which closes the iron is a little weak, and the heated plates are a little short. There is room on the tongs for more heated surface. However, it still works well enough for &amp;#34;vacation hair&amp;#34;, since we won&#x27;t be going anywhere really formal or dressy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife who loved it initially however within 3-4 months wiring became loose or something as the cord is not in a fixed position on the flat iron, it can rotate. It began to turn off frequently while she was using it making it impossible to continue using. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> its a great flat iron</li>
    <li> Great for black hair and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love it! I would love it more if it had an on light. My daughter is bad to leave her straightener on, so the light would help to alert the authorities.</li>
    <li> This flat iron did not live up to the hype and all the excellent reviews posted by others.  There is no light to indicate whether it&#x27;s on or off.  The temperature dial just turns and there is no way to know what temperature you are at.  Does an okay job a flattening the hair, but it takes more than one or two passes and I&#x27;m afraid to make it hotter without knowing what temp its at</li>
    <li> This straightener is great!!! It is perfect temperature and i have really thick hair and been looking for the perfect one and have used so many other ones that didn&#x27;t work. But this is is amazing  and there is a on and off button and the dial to turn up and down the heat for your right temp. it also has a swivel cord so it works with you not against you lol!!! I also use a heat spray before I use the straightener on my hair to help not fry my hair called guardian angel by got2b which works perfect with the straightener and makes your hair shiny and perfectly straight and professional looking!!! I soooo recommend this product to anyone looking for a perfect hair straightener!!!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS IT IS PERFECTTT!!!</li>
    <li> A Worth buy, my hair feels wonderful &amp; so silky. It gets Heat up quickly &amp; gives you the result as good as of Permanent Straightening. And i read somewhere in the comments that it takes time to cool down but what i experienced is it also cools down quickly. Very Satisfied with the product so far.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used. It gives me near salon quality results.</li>
    <li> Great product and even better customer service!  The first one I ordered pulled out my hair and had a few other issues.  I emailed customer service and within a week I received a new, better product!  This flat iron gets hotter than any others I&#x27;ve had.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Loved the product. My friend suggested me to buy this.</li>
    <li> This is my second flat iron and it is wonderful.  You get what you pay for and it is worth every penney</li>
    <li> Super hard to get flat iron into the pouch. But works well.</li>
    <li> Straightens well but my hair still gets caught in between the plates and gets pulled. The material for the handle feels too light weight.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, love that the product came with a sample of Argon oil. Makes my hair shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> This flat iron works like a pressing comb on coarse hair. Excellent flat iron and love the price.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> this is coming from someone who has coarse thick hair where I have to perm it to get it tamed, other wise it&#x27;s a broomstick or a lion&#x27;s mane. yes, i have terrible hair and this is an excellent straightener that can actually tame it! and I&#x27;ve used sedu revolution and chi straighteners before too, they were 2-3xs as much and they sucked! price does not always reflect quality. this is an awesome straightener, just wish it came in a 1.5 inch instead of a 1.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using a CHI - this seems to do a great job, for far less of an investment!!</li>
    <li> Easy and works great. Comes with a nice traveling cover. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> not as great as everyone says it is.  Maybe I was spoiled as I have a Paul Mitchell before this.  It was not super expensive so I guess you get what you pay for.  I ended up going to target and got a Chi when it was on sale.  Feels like this one pulls my hair</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great! My hair is naturally straight, but I have a bob and I use the straightener to flip my hair under. It works great and does not pull my hair like other straighteners have done in the past. It also heats up very quickly! Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Love this more than my CHI!</li>
    <li> This item would be good for most people but it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me. I didn&#x27;t care for the location of the controls.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever gotten. It makes my hair look amazing.</li>
    <li> Love it, had one similar....works great!  It came with one glove...that still confuses me....not sure what it is for.....</li>
    <li> This hair straightener has worked wonderfully so far. I was a bit hesitant on getting this straightener for keeping at my dorm because I have a different professional straightener that I love at my home.&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets for getting this straightener and would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works great. Heats up fast!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used the Instyler for 4 years, and this beats it. There was no snagging and pulling and no crazy smoke or smells. For anyone who wants to know, I&#x27;m African American, and this gets my hair straight in just 1 or 2 passes. I&#x27;m so happy with this product, and everyone should get one!</li>
    <li> So far so good. This heats up quickly and gets very hot. I just wish it had longer plates so I could be done quicker. I have a lot of hair. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Item is just as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 because I did not think it got hot enough</li>
    <li> Great straightener for the price! Works great is the prefect straightener for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> Fabulous flat iron...my favorite!  Heats up nicely and keeps my hair smooth!</li>
    <li> As good as my chi but half the price.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR ME...MY HAIR IS NATURALLY CURLY BUT MORE THIN THAN THICK . I LIVE IN FLORIDA SO HUMIDITY IS MY ENEMY!!!! MY HAIR DID STAY STRAIGHT ALL DAY WITH RAIN AND 95 TEMP WITH HIGH HUMIDITY.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery, good communication with seller. The iron is great, only teeny thing it is not automatic shut off so I have to be responsible!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  I bought it for our overseas trip to France &amp; England.  This iron automatically detects what voltage is needed, so all I needed was an adapter.  I heard from so many people who tried to use their flat iron abroad with a converter only to fry the iron, so I wanted to try this as the reviews all said it worked easily with an adapter.  They were right!  I have shorter hair, so I have less hair to straighten, so if you have really long hair and/or hard hair to straighten, this iron might take you awhile.  For me, this works great!  You can even curl your hair by turning the iron - I have trouble doing that with our other flat iron - I think this one works because it&#x27;s more narrow.  The travel pouch was nice and this is compact so it travels well.</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with the quality and performance of the flatiron.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it thank you</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in perfect working order.  It even included a heat proof glove that I have no idea what to do with.  The heated plates are super slippery and do not grip or damage your hair.  I love it and feel like a pro when I use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this one. This is the first professional straightener that I bought other than the small ones for travelling. This product is pretty easy to work with: easy to turn on/off and quite effective in straightening the hair!&lt;br /&gt;Also the delivery was faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> It is excellent product and the temperature rises rapidly, but it small size so you needs  a long time for the entire hair</li>
    <li> Love it. Exactly what I was expecting. Delivered in a timely manner. One satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Good flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> The reviews are right--this is an excellent flat iron. Glad I bought it and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all.  The plates wouldn&#x27;t close all the way and when I tried to run it through my hair it snagged on every stand.  I may have gotten a lemon but I had to return it.  Seller was great about taking it back.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightner. It is fantastic and works better than any other straightner I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Works great on my thick, curly hair!  Professional quality at a great price! Fast delivery.  Would definitely recommend especially if you&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! After expensive salon quality flat iron broke decided to give this a shot and so glad I did! Straightens all hair types, multiple heat settings, easy to use, ceramic plates, durable, very inexpensive. No complaints...such a great product bought multiple for family and friends!</li>
    <li> So far so good! It arrived on time and has been very easy to use and works well. I really like the addition of the oil with the straightener... They work well together but even separately they are great products! Also, it was important to me to have a straightener that wouldn&#x27;t give me the &amp;#34;static hair-frizzy&amp;#34; look and this one doesn&#x27;t! (My hair is average/normal texture, in case you&#x27;re wondering)..</li>
    <li> So far so good Love it! only thing I would change is put the on/off switch on the outside of the iron not inside!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, and it performs beautifully!  I bought it for our daughter, and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great shopping experience.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great flatiron that lets you adjust the temperature.  It straightens beautifully and comes with a glove and storage pouch.</li>
    <li> Product was heavier than I anticipated and feels a little bulky compared to my Chi, which it&#x27;s replacing. Heats up quickly and, at a high enough temperature, stays continuously hot enough to straighten my hair, which is of medium thickness. The heat is controlled by twisting a knob with a notch in it to denote the relative heat; there&#x27;s no way to set a specific temperature. This is probably a personal preference, but I don&#x27;t like that the on/off switch moves up/down relative to resting the straightener on its side (same edge of both plates touching surface) rather than left/right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, still gets the job done &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I think it&#x27;s a good buy for the current discounted price; don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it at the regular price of $200. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but I plan to use it as a backup straightener when I find another I&#x27;m more comfortable with. Also, I have yet to use the complimentary oil and glove.</li>
    <li> This product did not disappoint.  It works better than any straightener than I&#x27;ve ever had, though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever paid over $50 for one. It is noticeably more effective when I let it heat up sufficiently.  I like the carrying case as well.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> better than expected.  Quick shipping.  High quality.  I would (and have) reconmend this flat iron to everyone considering purchasing a professional straightner.</li>
    <li> Great Service....loved product!!</li>
    <li> Quality iron. I like that it heats up quickly and has dual voltage.</li>
    <li> This flat iron met all my expectations, I love it, I love that I can curl my hair with it. I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> First flat iron.  Great?</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tool! Thanks so much for making a quality product. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron for the price! Heats quickly!</li>
    <li> I had a more expensive straightener in my cart when I read the reviews for this flat-iron.  It was reviewed so highly and was priced so economically I thought it would be worth a try.  It&#x27;s a terrific product.  I had an expensive Solano professional flat iron and this is every bit as good.  I&#x27;m super glad I took a chance and ordered it because it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> Very good product...My niece in a professional hair care specialist  and told me that this is a really good product and the price was amazing...I&#x27;m very pleased at it&#x27;s performance</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron very satisfied, also delivered timely. I wear my hair natural and it really straightens my hair. Thanks</li>
    <li> Heats fast; straightens my thick hair&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Great product, worked as described.</li>
    <li> My remington straightener recently broke(which i LOVED) and i went to buy the same one again on amazon. I noticed it was the #2 best seller. I thought that since it was by far the best straightener ive ever owned (i have very curly, thick, difficult hair), maybe i should check out the #1 best seller, the HSI. 7000 reviews and nearly 5 stars, wow! after reading hundreds of amazing reviews i was sold and felt very excited about my purchase, eager for it to come in the mail. To my disappointment, this straightener is one of the worst i have ever used. i dont understand how it can have so many good reviews, maybe it would work well on wavy or already straight hair but for my curls this was simply not good enough. It loses heat very quickly and i would have to take breaks and walk away from it and do something else while it would regain enough heat to straighten only a few pieces of hair and repeat this process. I read some reviews about some of them being defective, but i do not think mine is, because it still gets very hot, it just does not work as well as the Remington S8510DS. I would have to go over each section of hair multiple times and it usually takes me about 30 minutes with my remington to do my hair; with this it took an hour. Even after spending an hour on my hair, it looked very dull and when i left the house it looked terrible and frizzy within 30 minutes. I am back on amazon now to write this review and re-purchase my remington. Please don&#x27;t be fooled by these reviews. If you have curly hair and are looking to purchase a great iron, buy the Remington S8510DS.</li>
    <li> This straightener reminded me of the ones u get conned into buying at the mall. They say it has a lifetime warranty but than the company disappears. Love your hair and pay the extra money for one with a good reputation</li>
    <li> it is like gamma ones. I thought it was a lot better. Better buy a babyliss pro .... i am going back to those better</li>
    <li> I intended to replace my flat iron with the Chi brand but ordered this one by accident.  I like it as much as the Chi, but wish that they would find a way to put the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button on the outside.  I&#x27;m always worried about burning myself when I turn it off and have to put my hand inside to do so.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my up coming trip to Germany. I have not left yet but tried the product at home. It worked great and seems equal to my more expensive flat iron. I mainly bought it since it has dual voltage. But, I might start using it daily. It was just as described.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product so far, it heats up quickly, and works well on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick hair and this flat iron is the best one I have ever had (and I used to have a Chi) I use the Tresemme karatin shampoo and conditioner and then I use the leave in cream, the combo of all 3 products plus this flat iron makes my hair super straight and shinny.</li>
    <li> Very nicely packed Hair Straightener. Heats  up fast, comes with a glove and a storage pouch.</li>
    <li> i have long thick hair- this does not heat up hot enough, and it take a long time to reheat once you are in the middle of using it- NOT happy with it</li>
    <li> This product is very well made. It does a very good job at straightening my hair.  It came in a very timely manner. I would recommend this product because it is a professional iron at a very good price, much better than some other sites that I looked at.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and is as described.</li>
    <li> It is okay.  The straightening ability seems lacking compared to other straighteners I have used but it is decent.</li>
    <li> Exactly as aniticipated.  Not sure what the glove is for....but i guess if you have never used a flat iron before you moght feel safer with the glove.  Anyway, so much easier to use than my very old 3.25 inch model.  Easy to get all my shorter hair inside the iron.  Heats up in a flash,  plan to use in Italy later this year</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I had a Chi for a long time but it started to go, need something a little cheaper and just as effective.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Worked as I expected it to.  Loved that you can adjust the heat setting.  Easy to use</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener and I usually buy the expensive ones like the CHI but this time i tried something new and it works great</li>
    <li> This product looks great and probably works great for most  people. My hair is fine and frizzy and hence I have to use it several times before it straightens my hair and that too the day after I wash my hair. The Argon Oil does not work for me either. Almond oil works better for my hair. The day I wash my hair it does nothing for me no matter how many times I use it.</li>
    <li> I love it! It straightens my wavy hair perfectly! I&#x27;ve been using cheap hair straighteners, and I wish that I would have found this one earlier. It was a great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.  Perfect experience!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic -- behaves just as you want it to.  Very effective, quick.</li>
    <li> Love this IRON!!! It works great, and it replaced my expensive one for the fraction of the cost. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used. It glides through my hair like silk. I am very happy with purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The best hair straightener in the market. Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. Easy to control temperature.</li>
    <li> This works so well! I have long wavy/curly hair and this straightens my hair quickly. Not to mention the price is great!</li>
    <li> Wife says it works perfectly!!!!! I don&#x60;t use product, but I take her word for it! She loves it !</li>
    <li> I love it it works better than I expected. And it heats up really fast but the best part is I don&#x27;t burn my fingers when I use it. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> After spending hours of reviewing and comparing different products, I decided to purchase this one because of all the good reviews and the price. I am glad I did! I was debating between the Chi and Babyliss which I am sure they&#x27;re good products, I decided to buy HSI because I wanted high quality yet affordable. I have chemically processed hair (Keratin treated over a year ago) and my hair is now weak and damaged so I wanted something gentle on the hair and I can say that this iron is definitely it for my hair type. I have medium length hair and after blow drying my hair, it took me about 15 minutes to iron my hair. It is easy to hold, the case is cute and the argan oil sampler that came with it was great so I am thinking of buying it too. I recommend this product and after all it&#x27;s really not that expensive so you won&#x27;t lose much really...give it a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product and heats very fast. For the price, it is good compared to high end straighteners. The only problem is that the roundness of the flat iron makes it hard to straighten shorter hair unlike the chi straighter ftat.</li>
    <li> This thing works great! I absolutely love it. I had a cheap target one before, and this one is so much better because I can adjust the heat settings on it. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Chi for a couple years and when it broke I purchased this item. I have to say that so far I think it works better! And it is much more affordable! I use my flat irons a lot (4-5 times a week) so I will track to see how long this one will last, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It she loves it, I love it. :)</li>
    <li> Simply love it, leaves my hair silky and very straight just as I wanted it! And I must add that I just bought a second for my daughter and a third for a friend, as this flat iron is excellent.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Finally something that will beat the humidity for my natural curly hair!  The oil that comes with it is also very nice.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron with good heat control!</li>
    <li> Love my flat iron...got 1 for a gift.She loved it also.Thanks for being you AMAZON.  Mary Jean Giordano</li>
    <li> Just as described and works great. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I originally planned on buying a Chi but happy I got this one instead.Fantastic and cheaper</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used it works amazing on my very fine and thin hair it&#x27;s  so much better than this 200-300$ flat irons</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s good for Asian hair! It lets my hair be straight, and very sweet with a glove in the box.</li>
    <li> I love my hair straightener, I don&#x27;t use it very often since my hair is straight naturally but when I do it works great, especially when I curl  my hair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my HSI flat iron.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron, it makes my hair so smooth and shiny, I also love the argan oil that comes with. I&#x27;ve used both every day since receiving them and can&#x27;t say enough how pleased I am and for such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought for my wife. I read a few reviews that stated this had an auto-off function. It does not. This is the only reason I returned it.</li>
    <li> I Love this flat iron it works really great I find it pulls my hair sometimes a bit but it straightens really great!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Makes straightening my hair so quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron. It works perfectly on the lowest setting on my fine hair. Great price, efficient service, well packaged -- no problems.</li>
    <li> great to curl hair...best iron I have ever owned!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It heats up quick, has a solidly constructed hinge, a wide range of heat settings. It works like a charm and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up in a jiffy; just in few minutes your hair is ready. And the argan oil is simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order a new argan oil bottle soon. It&#x27;s simply awesome! Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Great service... The seller is so prompt and genuine!</li>
    <li> Does the job in 1/5 of the time as a reg flattening iron&lt;br /&gt;Fairly inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Heats up to crazy hot but body stays cool&lt;br /&gt;Never have needed to use the included gloves&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful satin carry case for travel</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair so I&#x27;ve never thought I needed a flat iron, but my daughter convinced me to try it and I&#x27;m hooked.  It took me a while to figure out how to use it.  This is fabulous flatiron for the price and I love that it&#x27;s dual voltage for travel.  I&#x27;m thinking about getting a 1 1/2&amp;#34; iron as well.</li>
    <li> When I dropped and broke my first HSI flat iron, I didn&#x27;t even bother to look for a different one. I ordered the same one from Amazon and received it two days later.  Great flat iron. My hair is nice and smooth with no friz. Easy to handle with one hand while working my hair with the other hand.</li>
    <li> I broke my first one because I was being clumsy.  I bought it again and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I like that it comes with a protective case for traveling, which you can put inside even though it has not completely cooled yet.  I also like that it comes with a small sample jar of argan oil for you hair!  I bought this also for my brother&#x27;s gf as an xmas gift</li>
    <li> Good flat iron. Heats quickly. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair. Gets hair pretty smooth. I have thicker wavy hair.</li>
    <li> i have thick, wavy hair,medium texture. This did not smooth and straighten as well as my previous one-Remington S8510DS Flat Iron, Frizz Therapy, 1 Inch. I had to make several passes and have the heat over 400.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as my 130 dollars flat iron if not better.well worth the money</li>
    <li> quick delivery and great price on flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener!!&lt;br /&gt;Works better than all of my other hair straighteners!&lt;br /&gt;It supper straightens my hair..it was worth the price..&lt;br /&gt;and fast shipping too : )</li>
    <li> I purchased this for travel abroad.  I used it at 240V and it worked great.  Just as good or better than the CHI I have at home.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!! Very happy.</li>
    <li> I just got it and it was packaged lovely and the hot bag for it is awesome. Works like it should and goes up to 410 degrees which I need at least. Only complaint is that it just feels so cheap, no weight to it, light plastic like a toy. But it works and the price was cheap! So, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert about using a flat iron but this seems to be a good product, quick heat-up, and a good value through this vendor.</li>
    <li> Everything I had hoped. I recall reading somewhere that it could achieve the designated temperature within 20 seconds. Though the red light changes to green after ~20 seconds it still takes ~45 seconds. I&#x27;m not complaining though.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does a much better job than my previous one.  I have only had it a short while but so far I really like it.</li>
    <li> Usually I don&#x27; take the time to write these but this tool is amazing! First straightener than I can use quickly and get pin straight hair! Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one!</li>
    <li> Best Straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It works Magic! I would definitely recommend it to anyone with thick or curly hair.</li>
    <li> Once you use this straightner u will never go back. Smooth silky straight hair and cut time in half for actually straightening my hair</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t have to get it as hot as I do to straighten my hair but that&#x27;s probably a personal problem.Good straightener, especially for the price. My girlfriend has the same one and after I used hers - I bought it! Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. works great</li>
    <li> the best flat iron i ever had, and i have thick hair and it presses it very straight, would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron it works great! Definitely would recommend. I also got my daughter one a few weeks later.</li>
    <li> I have ethnic hair, this straightener combined with the argan oil, has taken my hair silkiness to a new level! TOTALLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, the cover is great for travel, and the product arrived quickly and in great shape. All of the helpful reviews made this purchase a no brainer...it has lived up to all the hype!</li>
    <li> Piece of garbage.  Went to use it for the first time and the wire is shorting out.  Returning it</li>
    <li> I rarely wear my own hair as I love the convenience of extensions.. (actually getting them back tomorrow..lol)  Needless to say my hair is currently natural, I have never used any type of chemical relaxer on my hair.  My hair is weird as it is this odd combination of soft and curly in some places and then it gets very course in one odd spot at the top of my head.. and along my crown it can tend to be a bit thinner... so I needed a flat iron where I could control the heat.. I&#x27;ve had irritating experiences with flat irons getting far too hot and leaving an awful burny smell in my hair.  Ugh... so annoying having afro american hair sometimes, dang I miss my low maintenance extensions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so anyway.. I wanted my hair to be straight so it would be faster to braid my hair for my sew in... so I plugged this puppy in and went to town on my hair.  And OMG... it is fanfriggin awesome.  I LOVE this flat iron.  The heat is very easy to control, the digital display makes it extremely easy to see how warm the iron is getting.. (nice surprise because I thought I had ordered the one without the display..) anyhow, it took me about 15 minutes to get my curly, shoulder length, curly&#x27;-coursey hair bone straight.. fantastic.  I used the heat setting on 300 and on the weird coarse spot at the top of my bean I cranked it up to 350... I then bounced off to get my extensions and my beautiful malaysian weave hair installed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is very easy to handle and feels great in my hands, very easy to make curls with it because it is so slender. The glove that it comes with is a nice touch...I&#x27;ve no use for it but thanks for including it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... here we are now several hours later and I know sit here with my glorious extensions reinstalled.. I couldnt wait to play with my new straightener.. ladies... OMFG, this straightener was fantastic on the very long hair I had installed.... it is SO easy to flip my hair to get those luxurious Kim Kardashian type curls.. I&#x27;ve had such issues with other straighteners.. this one is just fantastic I&#x27;m recommending anyone in the world and on the freakin&#x27;- planet who straightens their hair..... forget the Chi.. this one is amazeballs...  I LOVE extensions and wigs, and have SEVERAL Rupaulesque wigs around that are synthetic but can handle heat up to 350 degrees.. I used this on one of my favorite wigs that I washed but had been too lazy to go through the hassle of taking to my stylist to get curled.. and it curled it like a freakin&#x27; champ.. I was shocked.. I think it is the ceramic tourmaline plates that &amp;#34;she&amp;#34; (my wig) really liked that made it so easy to get some awesome curls..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major gripe.. turning it off is a bit confusing. The LCD screen keeps flashing &amp;#34; OFF&amp;#34; the iron is cool to the touch.. but seriously.. stop flashing, I&#x27;ll turn you on again soon...  You&#x27;re just being needy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, but enouhgh of that... here&#x27;s the bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Great Affordable Price&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable heat setting&lt;br /&gt;Great for Afro American hair&lt;br /&gt;Great for synthic wigs that can take heat&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic for luxurious Malaysian/Remy hair (weave hair people.. that&#x27;s weave hair)&lt;br /&gt;LCD Display&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;Long Swivel Cord&lt;br /&gt;Heat glove&lt;br /&gt;Storage Bag&lt;br /&gt;Design makes it easy to maneuver to use it as a curling wand&lt;br /&gt;Slim design makes it easy to get close to scalp to straighten tough curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Consistently blinks to &amp;#34;OFF&amp;#34; when you turn it off only way to be sure it&#x27;s OFF is to unplug it&lt;br /&gt;Can continue to heat up, but very slowly, check LCD to be sure you are still at desired temperature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other cons yet..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me and my Kardashian curls are headed out to go do some dancing tonight.. thanks for reading and buy this straightener!!urls..

    <li> I decided to give this a try after using a Chi for ten years. The difference in quality is huge. I spent over a hundred dollars on three different chi models, and all of them left my hair looking and feeling dry. Even the smell it left behind was horrid. Like burnt toast! The HSI is so much better! It leaves my hair shiny, smooth, and gives it body too! It doesn&#x27;t catch your hair, it just glides over it. The oil and the pouch are great extras and the shipping was fast! This is an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> This flat iron honestly surprised me! I was not expecting the quality to be half as amazing as it is! I owned an Amika flat iron that I purchased from a kiosk in the mall for $210. It worked fine but after using it almost everyday for 2 years it wasn&#x27;t working as well as it should anymore so I started looking for a new one and when I came across this one I thought it was too good to be true but it was everything I could&#x27;ve asked for and more! It looks and works just as well, if not better than the Amika one! It heats up quickly and makes my hair so soft and shiny and I have frizzy, kinky, curly hair so that&#x27;s a miracle. I can&#x27;t recommend this straightener enough!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife when we traveled across Europe. She&#x27;s picky with these things and needs it to get really hot. She liked it so much she uses it as her primary hair straightener now. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my gf and she loves it! She&#x27;s had other brands but was let down by their &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> After having two Chi straighteners die on me in 3 years, I decided to find a new brand. So I googled top rated straighteners. The HSI was the first result to come up. It had great reviews and for half the price of a Chi I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. The HSI works just as good if not better than the Chi. I like how its made thicker and a little heavier. The Chi&#x27;s for how expensive they are aren&#x27;t built durably.  I also quite like the temperature control as well. Also, its nice how they designed the plates not directly to the edge of the flat iron. I don&#x27;t know about you but I&#x27;ve been known to accidentally burn my for head.  Well with their design it almost makes it fool proof to not have that accident happen. So all in all for going out on a whim and being in a bind with needing a new straighter fast. Id say the HSI is a great choice. It&#x27;s inexpensive and works great!</li>
    <li> I will say that its not terribly amazing or life changing like some reviews managed to say. It does do the job and is way better than my babylis i had.  If you have thick hair then it def needs to be gone over more than once or it will stay wavy. It a little heavier than i wished it was and the dial is kindof cheap so you have to make sure its set to the temp you want it and make sure it doesn&#x27;t move.  Overall, this product was worth the money :p</li>
    <li> This is an amazing flat iron! It definitely puts all my older ones to shame. It&#x27;s easy to handle and it leaves my hair looking so beautiful and shiny! The oil it brings is very nice but it&#x27;s only good for one use, I wish it had been a little bigger. Still this is a really good deal</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron that would get hot enough and straighten my hair with ease. This flat iron is a complete steal at this price! It works amazing for all hair types I am sure. I have kinky curly hair and it straightened it with no problem.</li>
    <li> Heats up lightning fast and completely flattens my super coarse wavy frizzy hair!  The price is incredible for the value... I have a Chi and it works just as well!</li>
    <li> Beautiful quality flat iron!!  Heat resistant handle with hidden on/off switch and heat controls provides ease in handling.  A nice safety feature.  The heating element has mutlple heat settings for all hair types.  The one inch ceramic/tourmaline ion plates are wide enough for all hair types and lengths but narrow enough to style bangs.  The ample cord length allows freedom when styling.  Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron met all my expectations. My hair is course, curly and very thick and took about 1/2 the time to style it than it normally would. The argan oil was good but because my hair is so course I had to use quite a bit of the product so it did not go far. But I did like how it made my hair feel and it looked healthy and shiny. I would highly recommend this flat iron and argan oil.</li>
    <li> About me/my hair: I am african-american with Bra strap length hair. Naturally, I have a texture of 4a/4b&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron truly works like a professional. It is salon quality and gives AMAZING results that last! The package came with a flat iron, travel pouch, and HSI leave in Argan oil. Great bonuses! I only had to pass the iron over my hair twice to receive my desired results ( I like my hair bone straight). The iron glides smoothly and effortlessly while not overheating hair, getting stuck, or snagging hair at the ends. Excellent finish that left my hair bouncy and shiny. Cord swivels so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being in the way. One note of advice: when you first use it, make sure you press the reset button! I almost returned it thinking I received a defective iron when something told me to read the instructions :/ lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I have to say about this is the delivery time. I am a prime member and this was set for free 2 day delivery. I ordered this on a Saturday morning (2:26am to be exact) and did not receive it until that following Friday. No, there weren&#x27;t any holidays in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this a wonderful product, investment, and staple to add to your regimen. More than 50% off...you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> After two years my Chi had quit working. I paid well over $120 for my Chi straightener. I found the HSI, read the reviews and decided to give it a whirl. I love this straightener, it truly does a way better job than my chi. My hair is a little course and very thick, but my hair was left silky, bouncy and shiny after using the HSI. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly! I haven&#x27;t used the item yet, I purchased it to be able to take it with me when I travel.  It appears to be what it states it should be.</li>
    <li> The flat iron packaging is great, but i wish the degree was a little higher for more heat.  I like my hair bone straight.</li>
    <li> Good ceramic iron for the price that I paid. The Argan Oil worked well. Would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I was excited after having read all these awesome reviews but quite disappointed with the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;It does have its pros: love the red satin bag,  long power cord with swivel, auto switch off, heat indicating light(turns green when ready) and the argan oil (the oil is a must buy).&lt;br /&gt;However, whenever I straighten my hair, the effect does not last longer than a couple of hours even if I am indoors :( I end up straightening them multiple times which sucks</li>
    <li> Previous model was an expensive CHI which worked good but lately doesn&#x27;t heat up hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;Looking for something less pricey since the competition is everywhere now for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HSI grips the hair and pulls some out.  Couldn&#x27;t use it more than 3 times before giving up.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately returns back to the vendor via Amazon was no problem and full refund. Thanks!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought this Revlon model and is way smoother.  Used Revlon now for 6 months and very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008U5XS2O Remington S8510DS Flat Frizz Therapy]]</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair and have never been able to find a straightener that actually works. I straightened my hair without blow drying and it looked great. It was super humid out, but my hair stayed straight. Love this straightener!</li>
    <li> This item came just as described. I love the iron, it works very well and heat up super fast. I would buy from this shop again, they shipped fast and I love the item.</li>
    <li> I returned this flat iron.  It did not straighten my hair as other people said.  It felt like it did not glide smoothly through my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for styling hair. The ceramic keeps you from damaging hair when using the flat iron.  The product is packaged nicely, the glove keeps the heat from your hand and the travel pouch is great when packing.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have used many flat irons. I love this one. It heats up fast and glides over my hair beautifully.  I have recommended it to many friends.</li>
    <li> I finally used this flat iron this past weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;Gets super hot, super quick&lt;br /&gt;Straightens my curly/wavy hair with ease&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;Pulls my hair when I pull down to straighten. It feels as though strands are getting caught, but no hair is actually getting pulled out.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair but I use straightener sometimes on a bad hair day. This one works fine. Some reviewers mentioned they use it on African American hair and are very happy with it&#x27;s performance. I am surprised as my Asian hair doesn&#x27;t get that straight as I expect it to :) For the price, gloves and argan oil, I guess it isn&#x27;t so bad. BTW, the argan oil is really good. I&#x27;ll buy it for sure, makes my hair appear soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with this product.  It was shipped on time and was in perfect condition.  My flatiron broke right before I left for vacation and I decided to look on Amazon because a new one is so expensive.  I was leary about the price being so inexpensive for this type of iron, but so far it appears to be legit.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it works great with heat up fast, smooth and I love the free glove as well as it protected me from the quick heat. Thanks Amazon for a fast delivery of this good product.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to be as hot as the last flat iron I owned which was a CHI.  Liked the CH I better.</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron quickly!  Love this straightener!  I have use a bunch of different kinds throughout the years and this heats up quickly and does a fantastic job on my hair.  I have naturally curly hair so I blow dry it first then flat iron and I can do everything in 20-25 minutes.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto-shut off. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Dries out hair. Not work the money. This ionic flat iron works like a cheap iron you can buy from walmart.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron!! Best one I&#x27;ve ever owned! and it was at an AWESOME price!! Had never used this brand before, so wasn&#x27;t sure how well it  would do. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> So I was a little worried about the possibility of it not being able to straighten my hair: I have a combination of nappy, frizzy curly hair. It isn&#x27;t completely nappy or completely curly and oftentimes it is hard to straighten. This straightener does it beautifully. I can finally keep a consistent straight style without damaging my hair! I recommend getting more argan oil (not necessarily from HSI.... though theirs is great). I&#x27;m not too worried about it burning my hair due to the fact that the temperature only goes up to 410. I recommend this for all types of hair.....also the feature where you can curl or flip it is super useful if you want to add a bit more life or to frame your face in just the right way.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, I decided to try this flat iron. My very fine hair is styled in a bob, and my stylist used a flat iron to produce a smooth, sleek, shiny result.  Having only used a curling iron or curling brush for many years, I bought this flat iron as a replacement.  It did not take long for me to learn how to use it and get the same results that my stylist did.  I am very happy I made this purchase.  Almost got a more expensive one because I wanted a dual voltage flat iron, but the HSI has that feature, it will definitely travel with me to Europe, can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this straightener and it shipped quickly, too! Ys, there is no automatic shut off, but for $40, who can complain?? It has done wonders for my hair and I cannot find the split ends like I used to....thank goodness!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!!!! It gets hot quickly, is easy to hold and&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t pull at the cuticle while using.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants flat sleek hair.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I have long, thick hair that is naturally very frizzy and big. I bought this iron because it had all the features I was looking for - ceramic, ionic, variable temp and it seemed to be a very good deal for the price. It is doing the trick - seems to glide nicely, and it doesn&#x27;t really take that long to do. Feels smooth and straight - the way I always wanted it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality and performance of my HSI Ceramic flat iron. It heats quickly and straightens the hair without pulling or frying it. I have fine hair, but like the straight look and this flat iron does a great job. I also like the swivel cord feature and the feel and weight of the iron. Excellent product and great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter....our older straightener did a much better job than this one so we returned it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without this, it&#x27;s quick and painless. Heats up fast. Happy with this purchase. Would like to purchase additional one to keep as at work.</li>
    <li> This flat iron compares to some of the chi products I have used but only better!  I love having the temperature control and the surface coating of the iron does not appear that it will crack off like my last chi. It has a great price for the value. I&#x27;m very hard on my flat irons and have even dropped it a few times  without noticing any damage</li>
    <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on another brand. This one is awesome. It heats up quickly and gets really hot.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I ever had. Takes 1/4 of the time it normally does for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; ones...I have had it for about 3 years and BEST STRAIGHTENER STILL</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty thick and waves all over the place.  I don&#x27;t straighten my hair every day, but there are just some days that my hair dries in some crazy way and I can&#x27;t fix it without a flat iron.  For a long time I had just been using a $15 generic flat iron that I bought at a drug store.  This past year, though, I lived overseas and gave my old flat iron to a friend to try to keep the weight down in my suitcase.  When I got back to America I decided to treat myself and get a slightly more expensive flat iron.  I love the confidence you have when you walk out of a salon with a great new haircut, but I had never been able to reproduce that sort of look myself.  The reviews on this flat iron were fantastic and it was on sale, so I decided to try it out.  Usually, when I flat iron my hair, it looks nice and straight for a while and then starts to wave and curl again, especially if it&#x27;s raining or humid.  I had kind of just given up on that being my hair and hadn&#x27;t expected a better flat iron to fix that.  I fell in love with this flat iron the first time I used it.  It&#x27;s sleek and warms up quickly.  Even though my hair is thick, it usually takes me less than ten minutes to get it to look how I want it to.  The argan oil sample that came with the set makes your hair sleek and shiny and smells very nice.  I live in a pretty dry climate, especially during the winter, so having the oil to keep my hair healthy really comes in handy.  The set also comes with a soft red pouch for storage and a glove (although I usually just keep my hand further back and haven&#x27;t needed to use it yet).  The best part is that my hair stays straight all day!  I use it before interviews and presentations and it always gives me a confidence boost.  I feel like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of the salon.  This is definitely the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> No heat, no nothing...Don&#x27;t waste your time...and your money. The best thing with this iron is, that you can return it. Never again HSI</li>
    <li> MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN MORE FRIZZY!!!! WTH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if flat ironing my hair was a scientific experimentation, I failed at the process horribly. Here&#x27;s how it went...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Had a flat iron that worked well on my relaxed hair, but would snag my hair at the edges. 2. Stopped relaxing and flat ironing and went natural (I&#x27;m mixed with 3b and 3c, i think?). 3. Did the big chop 1 1/2 years later. 4. Bought HSI. 5. Gave my old iron away. 6. Fat ironed my natural hair for the first time since going natural with the HSI. 7. DISASTER!! Result: Soft, but frizzy hair... even on the highest setting!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see I had way too many variables. I don&#x27;t know whether it was the new texture of my hair or the flat iron. I plan to &#x27;borrow&#x27; the old flat iron and use it to see if I have the same results. That&#x27;d be this flat iron&#x27;s only saving grace. If I use the other iron and get the same results, then I&#x27;ll just have to never straighten my hair again. If my old iron works, I&#x27;ll trade my niece the shiny NEW iron for the clompy OLD one. If anyone is interested, I&#x27;ll post my new experiment results.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful straightener that&lt;br /&gt;I had absolutely no problem using both in the U.S. And on my trip to Istanbul and Turkey. I have very long thick hair and this straightener was powerful enough to tame it in no time. I also own a GHD straightener, and this one works the same at a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suggest anyone to buy this product. It is completely useless and the quality is really bad. There was a small piece of hair inside the hair iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Xmas gift for my granddaughter who has hair extensions added (weave). She uses it every day and finishes her hair faster. She loves that it heats quickly and evenly, and has a temp control. I am glad  made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for the price.  I have wavy/straight &amp;#34;Caucasian&amp;#34; hair that is extremely thick and long so this may not have been the best straightener  for me... Seems to work well on small areas of my hair.</li>
    <li> This was a great price for this amazing product.  Some straighteners are very poorly made and don&#x27;t do the job but this one is awesome!</li>
    <li> Bought for wife &amp; daughter, they liked it while it worked.  They set it down hard on our tile counter top and the plate cracked and broke in half.  Called about warranty and rep at HSI said plates aren&#x27;t covered, and that because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;professional grade&amp;#34; the plates are very fragile.  He offered $20 off - but I had to purchase from their website which is $100 retail for the iron.  So would be better off buying another from Amazon, but I think I&#x27;ll buy another brand since they didn&#x27;t stand behind their warranty.  I gave them their one shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with how well this flat iron straightens my hair WHEN it is working properly. It seems like the cord connection is not good, so while I use it, the little &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light constantly turns from green to red. I jiggle the cord and a few seconds later, it will go back to green. I think it&#x27;s not keeping its heat because of this, and it&#x27;s pretty frustrating. I think it may be a manufacturing defect, but since I just purchased it, I don&#x27;t want to spend the $20 to ship it to the company to have it repaired.</li>
    <li> This is so nice.  I can straighten my hair in no time at all and I have very curly, coarse hair.  So glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I bout a second one for a christmas present to my sister. She loves it.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described. The straightener works so well that it saves a lot of time hair styling in the morning. I loved the packing and a travel bag also.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! I was a little skeptical about purchasing it because of the price was way less than what it retails for (I think it was a holiday price), but I received a brand new flat iron in the box.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this flat iron I fell in love.....it makes your so shiny.....I use a low heat setting and still get great results.</li>
    <li> This iron is GARBAGE! It DOESN&#x27;T stay hot enough because the light keeps switching from green to red and requires multiple (5 to 7) passes. It RIPS hair out too. MISLEADING PRODUCT REVIEWS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed this product had so many good reviews.  There is a set of plastic corners or edges that are on the ends of the heating plates. These catch and pull my hair breaking or pulling out my hair.  The unit is also bulky and heavy. Amazon has been great though and handled the matter.</li>
    <li> I thought that I am buying CHI flat iron. But its NOT! It is HSI that looks the same:) It doesn&#x27;t work like CHI flat iron does. I went for the price and no looking at the actual name, that almost looks the same. Amazon did return my money and had no problem with that.</li>
    <li> Straightener works great and comes with a handy traveling case. It gets much hotter than irons I&#x27;ve used previously and also has an adjustable temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the speedy shipping!</li>
    <li> Horrible. If you have nice hair, this will suck. I have fine and soft smooth hair. It makes all my baby hairs go nuts. And ALWAYS leaves it feeling like straw. Hate it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!  It&#x27;s every works great,it heads up fast and I would recommend it to everyone..I&#x27;m glad that I bought this flat iron hair straightener.....</li>
    <li> Does a nice job of straightening and the glove really helps from burning your hands.  Only issue I have is that it keeps turning off and on (needing to back up to temperature) while in use.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen with past flat irons.</li>
    <li> Not worth your time or money!  Going back to Babylis Pro- definitely worth the extra money!!!!</li>
    <li> i love it. i thought i&#x27;d regret it (3 am purchase), but its the best straightener i&#x27;ve had in awhile, especially for the price. i would definitely buy again if i had a problem with this one. only downside (i guess), is it doesn&#x27;t turn off after a certain period of time, so if you leave the house and leave it on you&#x27;ll need to rush home to turn it off.</li>
    <li> She loves it and that is all that matters to me.  She researched and wanted this one over many others.  She is well pleased.</li>
    <li> The vendor&#x27;s service was great. Product is exactly as described. It is a bit bigger than I had expected (my fault) but I am getting used to it. I have always used a 1\\&quot; curling iron, so this takes some practice. I do wish it had an automatic shut-off but knew it didn&#x27;t when I ordered. I am letting my hair grow out a bit, so this whole process is a period of adjustment. With the carry case which was included, I will definitely take this on my upcoming trips.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron for Christmas after mine took one to many falls off the counter. I absolutely cannot figure out how this got so many top rated reviews. I have thick, somewhat frizzy, naturally curly hair and this iron does not get the job done. I have never left a review before but felt like this product warranted one. The ends are not sealed so my hair gets caught in between the plates on every pull. I have to use the iron on its highest setting and then have to pull four or five times through to even get something remotely straight. I don&#x27;t think you need to spend a ton of money on a good flat iron, my old one was priced comparable to this one but holy cow it was so much better. Please, if you have hair like mine do not waste your money on this thing.  I&#x27;m glad it was only $40.00 that way I don&#x27;t feel so guilty replacing it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and exactly as advertised.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received my straightener in the mail on time but it doesn&#x27;t work. I turned it on also pressed the recent button  and nothing heats up.  I want my money back so I can buy something that works. VERY DISAPPOINTED! !!</li>
    <li> Makes hair straight and shinny!</li>
    <li> Very good. Gets super hot and seals my hair well so even when I am outside and it is windy my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this for my wife because it has fairly good reviews when her hair iron burnt out.  She originally had a Chi.  Unfortunately this is nothing like the Chi, it takes much longer, doesn&#x27;t have as good of a finish... overall very disappointing.  The unit we were provided may just be weak or not working properly since deliver..but regardless I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> The reviews convinced me to get these $199.99 iron for my daughter for Christmas this year. It was even better that I only paid $39.99. It comes with a cover to use after use and storage. My daughter says it is the best straightener she has ever used. Her hair is smooth ad soft after using it. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for Christmas found on an Amazon wish list. She loved it but we have no idea what the glove is for.</li>
    <li> The low heat setting does nothing so it must be set on the highest setting which makes me wonder why bother having an adjustable heat setting.</li>
    <li> no problems with shipping or the item, it was as ordered.  It was a gift so not sure about performance but I have heard no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair. As long as you get a good heat protectant and straighten with very little in your hair. Comes out very well. I tend to use my flat iron as a curler too...because of the thickness of the iron around the plates, it&#x27;s not as good for that. But great for the price. Most people are amazed I could straighten the back by myself and it&#x27;s salon quality depending on your skills</li>
    <li> My wife loves this straightener and she&#x27;s super picky about them.  I think she tried every straightener from the local store before settling on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one main problem, and I think it&#x27;s a major one, it does not have auto shutoff.  I think pretty much all of the straighteners from the local store had this feature, cheaper and more expensive ones.  It&#x27;s a feature my wife absolutely requires, she&#x27;s so forgetful in the morning.  It has become part of my morning ritual, check if her straightener is still on.  She has even melted part of the handle on her hair dryer because she left it on and it was close enough to the dryer to melt it over a few hours.  Once I smelt the burning plastic I knew she left it on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair straightening, 5 stars, she loves it!!  Lack of auto shutoff... Big 2 star hit in my book.  My wife agrees, she wishes it shutoff on its own as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HSI, make one that shuts off and charge a little more!  We&#x27;ll gladly throw this one out and purchase your new model with this feature.  Don&#x27;t change anything else in the process.</li>
    <li> I am actually going to try and return this flat iron because it pulls on the hair. I bought this for my daughter and now she is using mine because she doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I have ever owned. I have thick, curly hair and I only have to run it through my hair once and it&#x27;s straight and silky. Simply the best!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a hair straightener comparable to the Chi flat iron. This one is a very reasonable price for the quality. I just got it today and I am hoping it will last me 5 years like my Chi did.&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this iron is the adjustable temperature. I like to use a lower temp on my bottom layer which is very damaged and a higher temp on my top layer which is shorter and has to be stick-straight to look good. I have boob-length somewhat thin hair and bangs and my total time straightening my hair with this was about 8 minutes, very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the cord. With my old drugstore straightener, the slightest bump into the cord would result in it falling right off my dresser and attacking my ankles. This straightener STAYS PUT!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it and will stay happy as long as I get 3 years out of it.</li>
    <li> No auto of feature for safety.  Otherwise it works well and the included storage bag is handy as well. I just have an issue with it not turning off automatically.</li>
    <li> GREAT flat iron!  Love the travel case and oil it came with.  The cord is nice and long and the power switch is easy to access.</li>
    <li> Good straightener, heats quickly, fairly smooth finish for my very curly, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have had in awhile! I use it daily, no pulling out grabbing. Easy to change temps and hearts up fast with an led that let&#x27;s you know when it&#x27;s ready!</li>
    <li> I just tried my straightener for the first time yesterday. It took an extremely long time to heat up, and once it did heat up it didn&#x27;t stay hot. Not impressed, will be returning this item.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron best purchase ever a must have. I have very coarse hair and this baby those the job!</li>
    <li> I was a Tried and True Believer that the &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34; was the Only Great Straightener out there......Well Guess What? I Now know that there is Another and That is &amp;#34;HSI.&amp;#34; I have Only had the Straightener for a Week now and &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34; I Could Not be More Pleased than i am with this Product, and the Presentation of the Product is Wonderful...The Makers of the &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34; could Learn a few things from &amp;#34;HSI!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and thought it was a good buy but my wife was not happy with it at all. She said it doesnt get hot enough. She was used to a Chi tho so I guess you get what you pay for. Its all what your used too. I wouldnt recommend. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Just sucks.....  Can&#x27;t believe I bought this trash..........  You get what you pay for.. I know that but this s*** ain&#x27;t super cheap either?!?!!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. Love it, works as well as any other I&#x27;ve ever had including the chi.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I think it works better than both Hana and CHI, which I have had multiple of. I wish that it was longer though, the ceramic plate is considerably shorter than my last straighteners, which means I have to do my hair in smaller sections.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement quick, Going by reviews this seemed like a good deal. Quick shipping, worked as promised, no problems so far.</li>
    <li> I had a CHI prior to purchasing this flat iron and I must say that it works just as good if not better than the more expensive CHI. I have used it on both my fine/straight hair and my daughters&#x27; hair which is course and curly and it works effortlessly for both of us! I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Not digital like it says. When straightened it stays throughout the day and I  had to curl tiny sections of hair when I did my hair for an event but it stayed very well. didn&#x27;t pull at all. Overall does a great job.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, slides easily through my hair, and leaves it smooth and shiny! Works just like my CHI, I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my teenage daughter and she loves it.  Has not had any complaints.  When she first plugged it in, she thought it did not work, but there is a reset button on it so be sure to push that if you have any issues to begin with.</li>
    <li> My girl loved it.  The product was packaged perfect, arrived timely, and had all the features she wanted.  Even the hot glove was a big hit.  And all that for a great price as well.  Thanks Amazon!!  Happy once again with your performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Steven T. Davis</li>
    <li> This is my second one and and for the price it is great! I highly recommend this product - use to use the CHI and this is a better straightener for a way better price!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas!  Easy to use , lightweight and a perfect size for her hands.  Love the storage/carry bag it comes with.  The only thing I would  change,  is the wideness  of the heating plates, wish it was a tad bit wider as my daughter has a lot of thick hair!</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction...Thank you! My daughter really likes her new flat iron. It heats up quickly. Very good quality product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this product and its so good when my wife uses it. It provides more shine and richness in textures. We both love this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron and the price is unbelievable too!!!</li>
    <li> you can easily flatten and flip your hair, doesn&#x27;t burn or catch your hair easy to pull hair through.  only con I see is no auto shut off</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener for my 16 year old daughter after reading all the great reviews.  she loves it works great.</li>
    <li> I liked this flat iron; it was easy to use and clearly noted when it was on/off.  I have fine coily hair and I had some trouble with temperature settings.  On the one hand, because my hair is fine a lower setting should have been used; however because my hair is very coily, the lower setting was not enough and I ended up having to use a much highter setting - even then my hair wasn&#x27;t totally strait.  Because I could smell my hair burning on both settings, I&#x27;ve only used this product once.  I&#x27;m not sure if the burning was due to the amount of oil on my hair or the lack of enough oil.  This was my first time ever using a flat iron and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll make some changes next time around to have a better experience.</li>
    <li> These are OK...not nearly as good as my GHDs. With such great ratings I was expecting more. But for the price I guess they are fine</li>
    <li> Easy to control the temperature and works wonders on straightening.</li>
    <li> I went on the reviews and my decision to buy this was not a disappointment. My friends have purchased more expensive flat irons this past Christmas, but were impressed with the results of mine and how much I paid. I&#x27;m glad I researched highest rated flat iron on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter.  Her coworkers wanted to know what she was using on her hair because it looked so great.  She told them and they went and purchased these irons for themselves.  I guess I can&#x27;t give a better review than this.  They all said &amp;#34;Absolutele Amazing&amp;#34; and I am in no way associated business wise with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! Use almost daily!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I bought this product to replace my old straighter that I have had for about 4 years and I am really enjoying it.  This one isn&#x27;t pink with sparkly rhinestones but its still pretty legit.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fabulous.  Heats up quickly and works nicely--even an non-professional hair person like myself can work with it!</li>
    <li> good product. heats very fast. my hair is thin so I use it in a very low heating temp and works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;i bought the one with the LCD because it&#x27;s more helpful in setting the temp and everything.&lt;br /&gt;ships fast and great customer service</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron as a christmas gift for my daughter.  She really likes it and how it works.  Nothing but good news.  I would highly recommend that product.&lt;br /&gt;We received the order on time and in great condition.  Will order from vendor again.&lt;br /&gt;-Gtown, MD</li>
    <li> This has been a great little addition to my bathroom countertop.  The variable temperature is great - gets more than hot enough for my medium weight hair. I would prefer to see the heat dial on the side of the flatiron as opposed to in between the two arms where it is now and I think the bag that comes with it is a little useless - it would be much better with a heat resistant carrying bag. All in all a great purchase though, especially for the cost.</li>
    <li> Great unit, love it !</li>
    <li> It came on time and works like a breeze. Love that the glove game with it so I can get to the shorter hair in my bob hair cut.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great!</li>
    <li> I gave this item to my daughter for Christmas. She has very long, thick hair and had wanted a straightener like this for some time. I had been relunctant, due to the high price. We found this item on Amazon and were surprised that the price was so reasonable. She  told me that she would give the straightener 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> We received the first iron but for some reason it did not work.  You sent another which works as advertized.  Thank you for the quick response and the new iron which mets our expectations.</li>
    <li> This gets the job done quick, easy and beautifully. I have really long, thick and curly hair, which is a triple hassle, but this flat iron was able to tame it :) I am sooo happy I found a great flat iron worth the price an worth keeping. It has always been a pain in the butt to find and use a flat iron since I have super long, super thick and super curly hair. But FINALLY I can rest in peace lol.</li>
    <li> THIS FLAT IRON LIVES UP TO THE 5 STARS RATING. I HAVE REVIEWED HUNDREDS OF FLAT IRON AND DECIDED TO CHOOSE THIS HSI.&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY REASON THIS IS GETTING A 4 STARS, IS THE RESET BUTTON STOP WORKING. I ONLY HAVE THIS FLAT IRON FOR 1 MONTH.</li>
    <li> She said this was the best iron she has ever had. Threw her chi in the trash with a smile on her face.</li>
    <li> both my teenage daughters threw out their old straightens the day they got their HSIs.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;what used to take me three or four run throughs now is straight on the first swipe - and feel how soft my hair is!&amp;#34; says the younger.&lt;br /&gt;The older of the two is equally impressed. She usually hoards everything, keeping the old even when she replaces it with something new. Not so this time, even though she has previously bragged to her younger sister about how good her (old) straightener is, after her first day using her new HSI, I found the old flat iron in the goodwill bin. That right there is a testimony.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and she is very happy. Her last one cost $150 and this one is as good for a 3rd of cost.</li>
    <li> Not sure if anyone else is having this issue, but I received my flat iron today and I have set the temp and waited for the green light to turn on, as im using the iron the red light comes back on... Any thoughts ?</li>
    <li> Gets nice and hot which I need for my hair.  The temperature adjustment&lt;br /&gt;makes it great for any hair type.  Price is great too!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, product as described, works well, great price professional packaging. Would recommend absolutely. I was nervous because of the low price, but the product is as it was described.</li>
    <li> My Paul Mitchell is way better than this flattening iron, but it&#x27;s also three times the price. Guess it&#x27;s a trade off.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife as an alternative to CHI. Very happy with the performance. The glove was a nice bonus as the iron can get hot as intended.</li>
    <li> This flat iron worked nicely for me the first day, or so I thought. Within a matter of 3 days I had more damage created to my hair than any flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I have straight normal hair that isn&#x27;t frizzy and this flat iron makes my hair look frizzy. The temperature is not balanced so it gets way too hot and if you lower it it&#x27;s not hot enough. Not to mention the spring plates pull hair so that&#x27;s twice the damage done. Avoid buying this unless you want damaged hair and wasted money.</li>
    <li> It is great for the price. It heats up fast and gives shine and is easy to use. As good as chi for the price it is better than ;]</li>
    <li> I have used this straightener for 2 years.... I mean... 2 years too long. Unfortunately when I purchased this it was $50... Not that cheap in my opinion. The only thing similar between this and the CHI is the appearance. It snagged my hair and did not run smoothly through my hair like the CHIs always did. My hair was looking lifeless and damaged. I used CHIs prior to purchasing this, and I finally broke down and bought another CHI today because I cannot stand to use this straightener one. more. day. I just used my CHI and wow, what a difference! It runs sooooo smooth through my hair and my hair looks healthy and has life to it. I got my CHI from ultra for $89 with a two yr warrenty. Ulta said they would also replace it up to 6months. A great deal. Wish I had switched sooner.</li>
    <li> Had a CHI and decided to go cheaper this time. The reviews were pretty good so I thought I&#x27;d try it for the price. It pulled at my hair, I hated it. Returned it and got the CHI... remembered why it&#x27;s worth the expensive price tag, it feels so smooth on my hair. Didn;t like this straightener at all</li>
    <li> Curls great but kills your hair.</li>
    <li> Received item as promised and in great time. Thank you!! A+!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, especially for the price! So far so good after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Greatest flat iron at truly great price.</li>
    <li> Love this flatiron and it was a great deal. Came on time and included everything mentioned in the description. I have extremely coarse, wavy hair and it does wonders on it.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve used one and it&#x27;s working great very easy and I live the pouch to store it in when it&#x27;s still hot</li>
    <li> It takes ages to heat and does not maintain the heat. Ive used other straighteners that leave you perfect in 2 minutes. This is not one of them.</li>
    <li> My hair is baby fine and curly...with many different layers... it really wasn&#x27;t quite hot enough to make my hair completely straight... this was the third one I have purchased within two years... it does leave a beautiful shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Wife loved it!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this hair straightener and really like the way it curls my hair! Yes, that&#x27;s right, I bought the straightener because it claims it&#x27;s for curling and flipping as well as straightening. I have another one (different make)that I use only for flattening my unruly hair, but can&#x27;t use that one for curling because it is too large and flat. I have medium length hair that is medium in texture and thickness but has become a little bit wild with the years...(very curly grey hairs), so I saw this as a chance to change my hairdo up a bit. It heats very quickly and is easy to use. I like the way I can flip my hair up at the ends and wear a 60&#x27;s style flip do. The curl seems to last for a couple of days and I can touch it up if I need to. Be careful of the tip ends of the straightener though; they are very hot if you don&#x27;t put your fingers in the right place (hence, the 4 star rating). I suppose you could get a heat glove (they are also sold on Amazon)and I am thinking of doing just that. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase - been using it every day since it arrived</li>
    <li> Shiny, silky straight hair at last! I&#x27;d been holding out, trying to decide which flat iron to buy, and I decided on this one. The reviews all indicated this was the way to go and I can&#x27;t agree more. I am so thrilled with my purchase. It arrive before I expected, as indicated with the oil to try. I love the multiple settings. It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, just helps create long straight shiny glass that I&#x27;d wanted. I haven&#x27;t ever used another flat iron to compare but if you purchase this one you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Yay! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter fir christmas. She absolutely loves it. She used it today and her hair has a beautiful shine to it that other straighteners haven&#x27;t given. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned...similar to that of which my stylist uses on me.  heats quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull hair and has numerous heat settings to choose from.  would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great iron the only thing is it took 10 min. To heat up</li>
    <li> I had a HAI flat iron that finally went after 10 years, with the economy being the way it is I did not want to spend $130 on a flat iron, however, I very much wanted the quality of the $130 flat iron.  I found it in the HSI.  My only complaint is that it does not glide as smoothly across my hair as the HAI, but the result is the same!  I have thick wavy hair and this flat iron makes it soft, smooth and straight.  I love it and would definitely recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> I was unsure after reading some of the mixed reviews. I was looking at the Herstyler that I saw at the mall which was 3-4 times more than the HSI. I absolutely love it! It leaves my hair straight, and super shiney. The pouch it comes with is a fantastic accessory.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as described. I have had no problems with the flat iron. The flat iron does a great job on my hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does an excellent job. I love the look and feel of it too. It came with a storage pouch for travel, which was a nice touch. The seller has also been amazing in terms of service, they followed up within days of receipt to make sure I was pleased with the product. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars...there does not appear to be an automatic shut off...not that I will ever leave it plugged in but it is just a nice back up. If it exists on the flat iron, it is not stated in the owner&#x27;s guide. Otherwise, think this is an excellent flat iron for price and I looked at a lot of them ranging from ($50-$140). Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have not used every flatiron like some reviewers BUT I&#x27;ve used enough to know what does and does not work. This works... plain and simple. I have thick wavy hair and this easily straightens it in one pass. And my hair stays straight through the day. For the price (I paid 45 with free shipping) there is not another iron on amazon that compares:)</li>
    <li> **Update, January 1, 2012. I have had this hair straightener for less than 6 months and the ceramic plates already broke! I can not contact the seller because they do not have an email listed.** Very upset about my purchase! I had a JOICO (sp?) hair straightener before this one. I bought it at a hair salon and it was over $100. It lasted for almost 7 years. After it broke I ended up purchasing a Revlon one for about $30. It was all right but definitely not what I was used it. So, I purchased this one. The reviews seemed to be really good. However, I found that the straightener works just as good as the $30 Revlon one. I should have just saved my money. The packaging is nice, but that does not mean anything if the product does not work as well as they say.I truly thought it would be like the more expensive Joico one. I would not buy this item again. Very disappointed. Whoever said they use theirs in their salon, I am flabbergasted about that statement. Definitely not salon worthy.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is more than the seller claims. It does everything and more than those priced twice as much. If you want style without damage buy this item. Best on the market.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite straightener!! This straightener gets the job done every time. I love it! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair get akk greasy and gross after straightening my hair. Plus I can adjust setting so the heat doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair either. I love this straightener and haven&#x27;t had a problem yet!</li>
    <li> I considered getting a new flat iron for months, mostly because the flat iron I had worked, but not well since it snagged on my hair quite often. After a lot of researching and reading reviews, I decided to purchase this particular straightner because it seemed to be the best deal (around $45 and lots of great reviews). I picked this one over the Chi because I didn&#x27;t want to risk getting a fake Chi and buying one that&#x27;s undoubtedly authentic (from Ulta or Sephora) was a bit too expensive for a poor college student.     When I received the product, the first thing I noticed was that it didn&#x27;t come with the Bio Silk sample as stated, but with a tiny sample of HSI argan oil. I didn&#x27;t really mind this, but not getting what you&#x27;re expecting is still a bit annoying. Oh yes, and the argan oil leaked inside the box, also annoying.    When I clamped the staightner down, it didn&#x27;t clamp all the way--it clamped down on the top, but there was a gap towards the bottom. But if I applied more pressure, it clamped down all the way. I felt uneasy about this but decided to put it to the test. I have pretty straight and fine Asian hair, so my hair is not hard to straighten at all. However, this straightner snagged my hair like crazy, more so than my $20 drugstore iron. It also took me about 3-4 (painful) swipes to straighten my hair, not good.    All in all, I was extremely dissapointed by this iron. I&#x27;m not sure if all of these straightners are like the one I had ordered, or if I had just received a defective item. I really think and hope it&#x27;s the latter though. Amazon has amazing customer service though, they&#x27;ve never failed me. I called and spoke with an Amazon rep, and she emailed me a prepaid shipping label as soon as I told her I was dissatisfied with the product, amazing. However, I am still compelled to rate this product 1 star since this review is for the iron, not ease of return.</li>
    <li> Not as promised or reviews suggested.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the good reviews and was not dissappointed. I have never had any luck using a flat iron. I thought I was doing something wrong. Now I realize that I only needed a good quality product to produce the same look as my stylist at the salon!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product at an incredible price.  My only complaints are that the \\&quot;free Bio Silk Sample\\&quot; was actually a different product which had already been opened.  The broken seal on the bottle caused the styling product to leak out and leave a stain on the cloth carrying case that came with the iron.  This was a minor problem and should not dissuade the choice to purchase the iron.  It also included a glove to be worn when using the iron as it get quite hot and there is a burn risk.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! The adjustable heat setting is perfect to alternate between my fine hair and my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African-american woman with natural hair. So I was at first a little hesitant on buying any flat-iron, thinking I wouldn&#x27;t find something that would do my hair justice. I bought the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron based on what the other reviews have said and I&#x27;m glad I did! My hair is so straight! It looks as if I have a relaxer in; and I&#x27;ve gotten multiple compliments based on the results. So far, I&#x27;m very satisfied considering this has been the first time I&#x27;ve straightened my hair since I&#x27;ve been natural (2 years and counting). The price wasn&#x27;t bad either and I didn&#x27;t want to get something that would damage my hair. Yes, the flat-iron does get pretty hot but you can control how hot you want it. And I&#x27;ve found that using the heat protectant as I straighten my hair protects it from being damaged. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Gets hot quickly, and the shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I love it... it really leaves my hair straight...like really straight....</li>
    <li> I gave this to my wife as a gift and replacement for her older flat iron.  She complained consistently that her old flat iron would catch random strands of hair and pull on them.  I purchased this unit after reading all the great reviews and little else.  My wife has used this flat iron several times since I gave it to her and had nothing bad to say about it.  It has not been catching her hair and pulling on it.  The construction is durable and the rubberized grip makes it comfortable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love how it heats up super fast and I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same strands of hair over and over again. It looks great with just one swipe. Although it wasn&#x27;t the bio silk serum it was an argain oil. Which is fine since I don&#x27;t plan on using it. And it comes with a cute holder bag for the flat iron which is awesome and it also includes a glove so your fingers won&#x27;t get burnt. How considerate!</li>
    <li> In comparison to my very old Remington Combined Straightener/Curler made with all metal, it is OK. It seems to not get as hot and close down on the hair as tightly.Therefore it seems to take longer to straighten my hair. I guess I need to use it longer to appreciate it more. It probably will protect the health of my hair. Teresa</li>
    <li> I ordered my HSI on a Thursday afternoon and received it on Saturday. A friend recommended I get a CHI but the reviews were so good for this that I thought I would take a chance and try one. I have straightened my hair a couple of times so far with the HSI and it seems to work very well and my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel fried like it did with the cheap flat iron I was using.  It even comes with a nice satin case.     It was a nice change of pace to only have to go over each section one time to get it straight, especially since my hair is super thick and curly!</li>
    <li> It has never taken me an hour to straighten my hair. I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and it was on highest setting.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and decided to buy this product. It is just ok. Nothing amazing or over the top. Its ok for the price. I was very upset because my free bio silk sample was completely empty. They never filled in. Don&#x27;t expect this to be the best iron ever. Its is just ok. I have used better ones.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve always used Hot Tools or Chi, and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from HSI but this straightener is amazing. I have thick, curly hair, and it straightens beautifully. It keeps my hear shiny and smooth.   The price was amazing, the product was amazing, great packaging, incredibly prompt delivery. One of the best online purchases I&#x27;ve ever made, definitely found \\&quot;the\\&quot; straightener!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Very happy with it. Came the day after I ordered it in a very nice box with a satin bag! I was pleasantly surprised :)</li>
    <li> Great price!  Works great; heats up quickly and goes through hair smoothly.  Very pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> after much research i stumbled on the HSI it had nothing but good reviews so i decided to try it im so happy i decided to get it this is the best flat iron ever its way better then the one my hair dresser uses.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I went ahead and purchased this product!! My hair is very thick and wavy and my previous straightener was not able to get all the bumps out! The HSI has been able to get my hair very straight and soft I love it!! .. And the price was a bonus!!!! :) I would definatley reccomend it!</li>
    <li> I am new to using flat irons.  My first purchase was of a very inexpensive one.  I decided to try the HSI flat iron because of the reviews from other customers.  It performs much better than my current one.  Honestly, I need more practice with it to give an accurate review.  I will say that it heats  up quickly and rids my hair of \\&quot;frizziness\\&quot;.  I feel sure that I will love it after learning to use it.  I think it is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> It says something in the instructions that there is some \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; time involved with using this iron, but my wife said that this was not the case at all.  She pulled it out of the box, plugged it in and was done in a few minutes.  She&#x27;s very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter said &amp;#34;My hair is pretty crazy curly and this tamed the beast- best flat iron ever!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My T3 tourmaline flat iron did not survive my recent European trip.  When it died I immediately looked at my options on Amazon.  I selected this HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron based on reviews and the incredible price.  I am not disappointed!  While the T3 was somewhat easier to handle the HSI does a much better job with flips at the ends of my long hair.  I have noticed I need to be more careful when working near the ends since I have fine, thin hair.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product.  I especially like the dual voltage, rapid heat time and staying power of my hair style.</li>
    <li> difficult to read temp..on product ...returned but not credited to cc fast enough..HSN&lt;br /&gt;is much faster at refunds, but they also charge a processing fee. As for the product, the&lt;br /&gt;iron was difficult to use because of the way it is manufactured.....not great.</li>
    <li> This item does a great job straightening and curling my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my daughter.  She did all the research and chose this flatiron.  She likes how quickly it heats up and how flat her hair stays once she&#x27;s straightened it.  She would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great product- my daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I love the high-end straightener I have been using for the past year, but when I saw this one on sale, I figured I could use a back up.  I decided to try it out when I received it and it has now become by full time straightener.  I love that it easily allows me to add a little curl to the ends of my hair without having to break out my curling iron.  The HSI heats up rapidly and is able to quickly straighten my curly hair, leaving it nice and shiny.  I went to a wedding this past weekend and my hair stayed remarkably straight all through the entire day (and night).  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am not at all a high maintenance girl - I just got a bob and don&#x27;t want the edges to fling out on the sides when I wake up in the morning, you know what I mean? This thing does the trick! It heats up fast and gets the job done. No weird noises, no pain, no steam or anything weird like that. I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> So far this iron is outperforming my other irons! Very hot which is what I need- my hair is thick and coarse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few straighteners in my day and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I had my hair in a pony tail all day and this baby got the kink right out, first time! No more frying my hair to try and get it straight! Easy to use, comes with a nice glove in case you have sensitive hands and also comes with a nice cloth bag for storage. Long cord and very light! I also love how you can control the heat, no more on/off! I would recommend this to anyone who is frustrated with how expensive a good straightener is, what a great price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. My daughter in law loved it</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I &#x27;ve had.  For the last 3 years, my experience with  flat irons wasn&#x27;t good (Chi, Gold&#x27;n Hot).  Finally I found the best.The HSI is the best.</li>
    <li> Usually I don&#x27;t write reviews but after using this iron for almost 3 years (and it&#x27;s still working great) I had to come back and rate it. I have very rough and super curly, frizzy long hair. In minutes this iron turns them in beautiful straight (or smooth curls) hair. I have gotten compliments on my hair. If you know how to use this iron properly you can turn any hair into beautiful hair. Just recently I hooked my sister in law to this iron. She loves it. She ended up taking mine and I am buying a new one now. When I purchased it 3 years back it was little expensive than today&#x27;s rate. But for the quality of work and long lasting life of this iron it&#x27;s worth every penny. At this price it&#x27;s a steal. Every woman needs and deserves this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there are some rave reviews, this is a very AVERAGE straightener, and NOT worth the price. I am not pleased at all with my purchase, it&#x27;s nothing special!</li>
    <li> Gotta say, wonderful product for the price.  My wife says: \\&quot;I have been very happy with this.  I was a little concerned that it would not get hot enough, but that has not been an issue.  I haven&#x27;t even been using it at full heat.\\&quot;  Don&#x27;t want to cook those little hairs!</li>
    <li> Bought three for Christmas gifts, and everyone LOVES them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now, it works great, but the light doesn&#x27;t come on anymore and it&#x27;s very hard to see when it&#x27;s on/off or what temp it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this flat iron. I can get my medium length hair sleek straight in about twenty minutes!The argan oil helps too. Now I actually look forward to straightening my hair... Very, very happy!!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this iron! I have had mine for about a year and loved it so much i bought 2 as Christmas gifts! Its the professional performance without the professional price.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Thank you. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron about a month ago and I&#x27;m reviewing now because I have used it every day, and I mean heavy useage and it has performed beautifully.  I have it on for very long periods of time because I have very thick african-american hair and I also add in clip in extensions, and this tool does a wonderful job of blending.  It gets my hair super straight and you cannot tell where my real hair ends and the extensions begin.  I&#x27;ve had other flat irons that could not produce the same result without some sort of spray, oil or creme added to the hair prior to use of the flat iron.  Awesome.  Also, the glove was a very useful tool, I used to get burned alot because I have to go very close to the scalp and the glove save me a lot of pain.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves it !! This is the best one she has ever owned !! Great seller</li>
    <li> This is the second one I purchased.  This time for a friend who mentioned how much she liked mine.  Shipped as promised--great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with flat irons because I have straight hair but my hair stylish suggest I get it to create a sleek look. I was going to buy a CHI flat iron but the HSI one got good reviews and had a good price. I&#x27;ve used it 2 or 3 times and it seems to heat up quickly. I love the argan oil that comes with it. It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> After reading about possible fake CHI Irons on the internet (she was wanting one), I showed her the reviews on the HSI 1, and she agreed to get it instead. She likes to use it, and the tourmaline plates are very smooth and parallel to each other. The heat control seems to work great, so in conclusion: Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.  Faster than old iron to heat and works much more quickly.  Should damage hair less too.</li>
    <li> perfect - fast shipping.</li>
    <li> HSI 1 tourmaline ionic flat iron was bought to replace my old $150.00 flat iron. Can&#x27;t believe this one is as good if not better. Amazing, got lucky with this great deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener approx. 1 year ago. I had an issue where it stopped working a few days ago. Blue Novalties did everything to make it right! I was pleasantly surprised with their outstanding customer service. It worked really well on my very natually curly hair. I&#x27;d have to agree with the reviews that say sometimes it does get strands of hair caught in the plates because they do move a bit but I didn&#x27;t find that a big issue for me. I would say a great buy for your money compared to other professional straighteners I&#x27;ve owned. If the one I owned still worked and I wasn&#x27;t getting a replacement, I&#x27;d for sure give it 5 stars. Customer service for Blue Novalties however, for sure 5 star.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and she&#x27;s just now getting around to taking it out of the box to use it and it won&#x27;t even turn on. She&#x27;s tried multiple outlets just incase that was the issue but it still doesn&#x27;t work. If I could give this less than 1 star I would.  I&#x27;m disapointed that I spent as much as I did and even read through the reveiews of this and never once read a review sayng it didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price</li>
    <li> This was a very high quality flat iron. It was a gift and the recipient was very pleased with it and with the free bottle of Argain Oil treatment.</li>
    <li> I have natural  hair and it got my hair very smooth and silky, I love this flat iron and it&#x27;s a great a price also.</li>
    <li> The casing is to thick. It makes handling  awkward. Usually, I can use a one inch  for my hair, but I  couldn&#x27;t with this one. For the  price I paid, I will probably  give it away. I was disappointed that I purchased this flat  iron.</li>
    <li> I was real nervous at first as I was new to straightening my hair... this flat iron is easy to use.  Heat up fast and I used the medium temp for normal, slightly wavy, shoulder length, color treated hair.  I am forever grateful that the price point is under $50 as the others are well over this price point.  I&#x27;m Happy and my Hubs is Happy - Win-Win!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really well! It heats up very fast and leaves hair smooth and straight! I would definitely recommend it! And the shipping was incredibly fast! It was here before the estimated arrival date! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron in February and in November one side quit heating up.  After some confusion over old documentation for warranty information, I did get the item replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement I was sent in November just went bad.  Apparently this product only meant to work for 6-9 months and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m off to shop for another straightener...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after reading all the amazing reviews and for the price I thought I was getting a great deal. Well, It came in the mail and I was really disappointed, I was expecting something so much better. Of course you get what you paid for. This was a cheap made product, I just thought maybe I was not using it right but I have an old flat iron I bought at the mall 5 years ago and still does a better job than this new one. I just felt embarrassed and didn&#x27;t try to return it or anything but after reading the most recent reviews I can see I&#x27;m not the only one that got fooled with the good reviews. I&#x27;ll be more careful next time. Oh, the argan oil treatment that came with the Iron is great, I already used it all and bought a full size, I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this straightener for my teenage daughters and they love it. They both have wavy/curly hair and it works just as well and better than the high-dollar straighteners we have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was a Christmas gift for one of my daughters.  She &amp;#34;LOVES IT&amp;#34;!!!!!  She recently got her hair cut shorter than she normally wears it needed a thinner straightener.  Thank you for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever owned. My hair stays straight all day and it actually feels so soft. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out and it honestly only takes me 5 minutes to straighten my whole head of hair and my hair is THICK and FRIZZY! All other straightners left my hair still poofy and a bit frizzy, but this one doesn&#x27;t! YAY!!.   Only problem: I have only used it twice but the green light never goes on. It stays red, so I don&#x27;t know if this means it never gets hot enough or its never ready? This kind of worries me...  Great product though. Hopefully mine doesn&#x27;t have some sort of defect.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this flat iron. It is an upgrade from the last brand I had and it straightens much quicker and easier. That said, I do not have curly hair to begin with - but it makes mine poker straight very easily.</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter and she loves it...</li>
    <li> This straightener is great. It warms to more than 400 degrees, and it straightens better than my chi I had previously. I can curl my hair with one attempt and I get ringlet curls that hold with no need for hairspray. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works great my wife loves it. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener.  It definitely is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product....it was just what I needed at the right price and professional quality. I&#x27;m African American and I was using the Instyler for about a year and don&#x27;t get me wrong it worked well but I needed something that could give my hair a nice shine and sleek feel and the HSI Professional flat iron did just that! Never has me hair been so bouncy and shiny with just one stroke of my hair shaft. And I can curl my hair with it too. It saves me sooooo much time I will be purchasing a back up soon. Thanks for this great product Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant before receiving this product however, when I received the tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener I was very pleased at how hot it gets in a short time. If I had to say something it would be that I wish it had a shut off timer and grips at the tip to hold when straightening the hair other than that, \\&quot;Love It\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My mom has always wanted her hair straighter (doesn&#x27;t everyone who has curly hair, and vice versa?). This iron seems to be good for her, it&#x27;s high quality and the cord is attached in a way that keeps it from getting curled itself, or tangled. Fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> I got it as a gift and when she used it, it seemed to work very nice and her hair looked lovely.</li>
    <li> Great and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Iron after my CHI power chord broke and was afraid to buy another chi even though they are great they are made with very poor quality. This iron heats up faster than the chi works better and it very strong and durable.  I cant begin to explain to you how good of  iron this is. THe oil they send you along with it is amazing as well. When this one breaks if it ever breaks we will purchase another of the same model.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It flat irons my fine curly hair in less than 20 minutes! And even with standard shopping it came in two days later! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Finally...I am not spending hours waiting for my two teenage daughters to finish straightening their hair! The price was reasonable and the product works extremely well.  We have been buying cheaper brands for years but these work faster and allow them to guide the straightener without burning their fingers.  We were very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Although I have only used this product once, I am very satisfied so far. The straightner takes a little longer to heat up than my old Chi (which is the only reason I deducted a star), but the straightening power is just the same and this straightner was just a fraction of the cost. The heat is strong enough for my hair and the straightner seems like its built to last. I have high expectations for it, and so far it is just as good as the old Chi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of straighteners and this is by far the best, quick heat up and love the adjustable temperature setting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed that this was a best selling item as it didn&#x27;t work on my hair at all. It fried my hair when used on the &amp;#34;half way&amp;#34; temperature and didn&#x27;t curl it at all. Not a good flat iron for a beginner. Very disappointing purchase in so many ways. My hair looked better BEFORE I used it as there is absolutely no bounce after using this ...even if you are trying to create volume. When I went to just give up and straighten my hair it also didn&#x27;t even straighten. Snags a lot. Terrible product for me. I have medium thickness, relatively long hair. Definitely a no.</li>
    <li> Great product, salon quality. It comes with a glove that comes in really handy if you are not used to constantly burning your hands.</li>
    <li> This Iron is the best I have ever owned! Its better than the $100 Iron I purchased from the beauty supply store! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair straightener!</li>
    <li> Bought for wife who has thick, thick - wavy hair.  It works, but not very easily.  Takes too long due to the dense hair.  Probably would be perfect for someone with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about ordering this flat iron because I had not heard this brand before. However, the price was very enticing. I used it twice already and I am extremely happy. I have very long curly hair and the HSI flat iron does the job right away. And a huge A+ for the design: it does NOT pull your hair! The small oil sample they sent me smells very good but I have not tried it yet. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter wanted a new straightener for Christmas and I saw the reviews for this one were so positive that I decided to give it a whirl.  Well, not only did she absolutely love it and say it was by far the best one she&#x27;d ever used, but her sister started using it and wanted one of her own.  I had just purchased a Chi for her sister but she said this one worked even better.  I purchased a second one for her and now she uses it all the time and LOVES it.  She says she doesn&#x27;t have to straighten sections more than once to get it to look smooth.  Just one pass does the trick, which means it takes half the time to do the job.</li>
    <li> I was gonna buy the one sold by Herstyler to match my flat iron but I am SOOOO glad I did not spend the $40 bucks for it!  This one is made of good quality, heavy duty and can also be used either on the counter or mounted on the wall!  I really like it and am happier it is off my counter to prevent cracking!  Cannot wait to try more of your products!  &#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It leaves your hair so shiny, and silky! It will also make a great gift for someone.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  I can&#x27;t believe I found such a great item at such a great price.  My FHI iron broke and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a replacement so I went with this one because the reviews were so great.  Well worth it!  Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Heats up perfectly. Does not pull my baby fine hair! And what a great price!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve always thought a hair straightener was just a hair straightener until I got this one! It&#x27;s perfect...makes my hair so shiny and silky smooth. Warms up quickly and slides beautifully! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. It doesn&#x27;t work well at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this last May, at first its really good.. but after a while it didn&#x27;t work as well, The curls wouldn&#x27;t stay and when I straightened my hair it was still frizzy.. Not too crazy about this straighter.. takes longer to heat up and the temperature goes down after a few min.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of Caribbean descent with very thick/relaxed hair. The previous flat irons that I&#x27;ve used caused a lot of hair breakage. After researching flat irons online, I decided to purchase the HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Flat Iron. I have no regrets, and for the quality and price, it was an excellent choice.  The surface of the flat iron surface has a smooth finish that does not pull or break the hair. It locks in the moisture in your hair and you can control the heat based on your hair texture.  I love the sleeve this flat iron came in, which would be excellent to use when travelling.  This also came with a sample Argan Oil, which is similar to the Moroccan Oil; very light weight but adds shine and moisture. I must add that it makes your hair smell soo nice!  Excellent investment for your hair. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like this better than my old Chi and it costs so much less! Dual voltage, multiple temperatures, and it works just as well, if not better.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was worried about the quality of the manufacturing. But since the price was about $50, I decided to take the risk. (I know many products come out of the same factory with different labels and cosmetic differences and figured this was the same type of deal.) It arrived quickly and in great condition. It works well and feels solid. No clicks, buzzing, noises or quirks. I have no complaints.  I&#x27;ve used a GHD curling iron for about 3 years now and wanted to try a smaller barrel. (1\\&quot; vs 1.5\\&quot;) The smaller width is easier for me to put a curl into my hair. Both straighten quickly, beautifully and leave a gorgeous shine. It&#x27;s nice to be able to adjust the heat so now I go down a little and save those heat degrees from my hair.  Bottom line is if you want a top line flat iron, do try this. It works as well as my $250 one for a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ll post updates periodically on its durability.</li>
    <li> This was a great item. I love it. Very fast shipping and at a good price as well. would recommend if want a good iron at a great price.</li>
    <li> AWESOME flat iron for the price!!! My Chi flat iron recently stopped working and I purchased this flat iron to tide me over. I am so pleased with this one that I think once my Chi flat iron is fixed, it will remain in the cabinet as a backup.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is everything I wanted it to be. The plates great and don&#x27;t snag.  The variable heat setting is so handy for fine hair. It arrived in two days as promised.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product!</li>
    <li> Great price, easy to use and works very well.  This flat iron heats up and cools down quickly, it straightens at the the first try adn I love how my hair looks.  I am not sure why people need to spend a lot more money on a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have been travelling between America and Australia and this is a life saver!  It truly is dual voltage and I&#x27;m able to use it in both countries without a problem.  I use an adapter for the plug in Australia but that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;d already lost one curling iron to the voltage problem burning it up basically and I was worried about frying my CHI straightener so I searched for something dual voltage and was so happy to find this high quality iron at a great price!  it arrived quickly and I would recommend it to anyone travelling.</li>
    <li> Amazing best thing ever</li>
    <li> It works pretty well for its price.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  I needed a thin flat iron like this as I cut my hair really short and my old one was close to scalding my neck.  This item has a simple on/off switch  w/a temperature adjustment.  It heats up fast and cools down w/in 5 minutes.  so far, this product has been ideal I am not worried about frying my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this iron to have a lightweight option for doing my hair. I have a LOT of hair and it is very long, and I have nerve damage in my dominant hand/arm. These two factors make doing my hair difficult. This iron heats up pretty fast and stays decently hot during styling. The major plus for me is that it is small and light.</li>
    <li> Lovely to use, and I&#x27;m a clutz with styling irons!</li>
    <li> Really nice flat iron.  Dissappointed in the Tiny size of argon oil (mini)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about as nice as the $20 Remington I had bought from Wal-Mart a few years ago. I definitely got what I paid for ($35) but there&#x27;s no way it would be worth $100+ like it says it was. Does the job though!</li>
    <li> only negative is that is is much heavier in weight than my CHI</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new convert to straighteners because of this product.  I tried 3 before this but returned them all quickly.  I have fine but thick straight hair that I am growing into a bob. Curling irons or hot brushes have been my standard--when I use a tool at all. I&#x27;m a very active person who doesn&#x27;t fuss over my hair much, but I needed something for that &amp;#34;finishing touch&amp;#34; -- for work or social events.  Reviews prompted me to try a straightener again, with this product.  Bulls-eye.  Easy to use.  Heats up fast.  Shiny, straight hair...with a curl at bottom when I want it.  Helps raise up the flat crown and bangs too.  Only problem:  no auto shut-off.  Since it burns so hot, this worries me.  I&#x27;m not sure why straighteners lack this feature, when curling irons and other implements have made it standard.  Just make a habit to pay attention to the little red &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light.  Some people unplug it every day but that option just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron!!  I love how straight and silky it makes my hair.  For $36 it is an awesome flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and once in a while I want straight hair.  So I purchased this HSI Professional Ceramic flat iron and am very happy I got this one as it is easy to use, heats almost instantly and has a long cord.  Another feature I appreciate is the velcro strap to wrap the cord up when it is not in use.  I would recommend this product to any female looking for a flat iron.  For me there are no negatives about this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron, works better than a chi.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this, sounded like a great deal! The reason that this is so inexpensive is because it lacks quality!!! I have had this for about 3 months and one of the plates is broken and the other is loose! Very disappointed!! Don&#x27;t waste your money, put it toward a Chi!</li>
    <li> Had to send this back. Felt cheap compared to my HAI and snagged my hair. The gap between the ceramic plates were too big (which snags hair), the flat iron itself was much bulkier than the picture.  I ultimately caved in and went to planet beauty to get my HAI. I won&#x27;t ever tough another flat iron.</li>
    <li> Excellent product very reliable for our use.</li>
    <li> For the past 20 yrs I&#x27;ve been using very high end expensive flat irons.  I really needed a flat iron fast since mine stopped working and times are tough so I decided to give this $40 iron a chance and boy am a glad I did!  I really didn&#x27;t expect this iron to work as great as it has.  It straightens my really curly hair and it stays straight for days.  Is this the best iron I&#x27;ve used?  No but it&#x27;s an amazing iron and I highly recommend it.  It does take a little longer to heat up then my more expensive ones, and I do have to use it on the highest temp for it to get my hair really straight but it does an amazing job!!!!  Normally, you get what you pay for but not in this case, you get a lot more than you paid for!  If you&#x27;re hesitant, don&#x27;t be.  You will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Very nice, does the trick!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I dropped this hair straightener and the blades broke. It should be a lot more durable than that. Made my hair very frizzy! Not pleased with this product at all.</li>
    <li> This straightener works alright but is not all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be in the reviews. People said it worked better than their CHI straightener. Well I&#x27;ve had my CHI for 5 years and it still works better than the HSI. The HSI did straighten my hair but it pulled unevenly on finer strands of hair and didn&#x27;t work as quick as promised. However, the argon oil that came with is great! Just a dime sized amount on my hair when wet makes it super smoothe and shiny for the whole day.</li>
    <li> okay to use, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for almost 5 months now. Until now I have really liked it. It sits well in you hand, the temperature adjustment is nice, I like seeing the temp displayed. I have thick long hair and it get the job done well. I use it every day. Recently I went to use it and it would not get up to temperature. I searched online and found this is a common problem with this straightener. I luckily still had my previous Conair straightener that i had been using for multiple year and is still going strong.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific iron and the price is incredibly reasonable.  Arrived on time, works beautifully, gets to full heat in about 90 seconds,  Includes satin case, styling glove ad a sample of  Aragon Oil.  Gets my hair looking good in no time at all.  Variable heat to suit your hair type.  I would highly recommend this item if you are looking for a flatiron.</li>
    <li> Not happy this was supposed to be a real good Straightener. Started out working real nice on the wives hair then It quite heating up in less than 8 months of random use.  Buyer be ware. Now we know why it doesn&#x27;t have a longer warranty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very very disappointed with this I read its reviews And thought hey this would be great but nope my hair won&#x27;t stay straight at all</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the excellent reviews. This was my first flat iron. I was horrified to discover that where the plates attach create a trap that catches and pulls out your hair unless you are extremely careful to section each piece without stray hairs. After a couple of weeks, convinced that this could not be how they all function, I bought the Remington Pearl...it works great and I can slide the iron through my hair and down to perfectly flatten without pulling out my hair. Other than the tearing of hair, the HSI iron works great but I gave it one star as an iron should not do more damage than good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for years and loved it,...then left it in my rental car a few weeks ago!! So glad I was able to get another one so quick for a great price!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this flat iron. Very easy to use and helps me have the hair style I love.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! Ive always had a good straightener but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned!!!</li>
    <li> My wife love it. So far no complaint about the product. Thank you so much :)</li>
    <li> It came in set of 3(straightener/ glove / argan oil).... I love the oil more than the straightener.... Hahaha! It makes wonder....i thought its time to head for saloon for treatment( frizzy damage hair) till i put this on....it feel so smooth &amp; tangle free! I jus cant stop myself playing with my hair wholeday long!! Its been a week now &amp; i found my hair is healthier ever! Im gonna get another bigger bottle after run out of this argan oil!! For the straightener-- pros( dual voltage) / cons( i dun see it has anything more than a normal straightener)</li>
    <li> As expected, deliverd on time and does what it is supposed to do.  Wish it had a n auto-shut off, then it would be 5 stars.  Lets see how it holds-up with daily use over time.</li>
    <li> Love it! makes my hair straight &amp; smooth</li>
    <li> After a few months of use, it now doesn&#x27;t work. Disappointing, was one of my favorite straighteners.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good straightner considering the price</li>
    <li> Love My New Flat Iron!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> very nice hair iron, at a great price, shipped promptly.  The storage bag and the glove are thoughtful additions.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it works great so I bought one for the wife.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast. Smooth plates don&#x27;t pull on hair as you move it through. I&#x27;ve used the Sedu, which is amazing (and also really expensive), so I&amp;#34;m comparing it to that, so it wasn&#x27;t as good as that one, but still worked really well! I have thick Indian hair that&#x27;s wavy when I get out of the shower, and it was able to tame this jungle and make it straight, smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> really good..bought it for my wife and she likes it.</li>
    <li> Heats fast and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> The reviews speak for themselves!!! This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Ordering the HSI Ceramic Fl. at irons was a great thing for my wife&#x27;s and daughter&#x27;s hair.  The oil used with the iron really caused their natural, unrelaxed hair to become soft, movable and did not burn the hair in any way.  My wife loves this product!!!</li>
    <li> this is so food in such a good price!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a high quality flat iron.  Not so much.  Seems very cheap.</li>
    <li> good one for the price</li>
    <li> Just as good as a CHI!</li>
    <li> This was a bday gift for my sister! The flatiron and I received rave reviews!</li>
    <li> Love the new straightener.  The price was right and it&#x27;s high quality.</li>
    <li> So fortunate to have gotten this iron on sale! This is the best iron I have ever owned and will be suggesting it for others in my family.</li>
    <li> Curls great. Doesn&#x27;t straighten quite to my OCD expectations but it gets the job done</li>
    <li> As described Quick shipment</li>
    <li> I like this better than my Chi &amp; it is WAY cheaper. Great product!</li>
    <li> This replaced my chi and I have absolutely no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> The straightener does catch a bit on my hair but straightens well. Thanks for the great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> There are few more expensive flat irons that are better. But this one definitely ranks up there with the expensive ones at a fourth of the price. The argon oil that comes with the flat iron is fabulous! It does not make your hair heavy or oily at all. You do not have to use the argon oil. The flat iron by itself is still wonderful! But it makes your hair so soft, silky and shiny that you will want to .</li>
    <li> Great heat adjustable iron. Long cord. Really appreciated the heat-proof glove and insulated carry case. Made the whole package worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully, the price was super low, and I really appreciate the glove and hair product that came with it.</li>
    <li> Product delivered very quickly and works really well. The flat iron doesn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair at all! I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it says it does, but it is working great so far</li>
    <li> I bought my flat iron on 8/10/14 and it is not working.  It hasn&#x27;t even been 2 months and it won&#x27;t heat up even though it is on the highest setting. I am extremely upset. I was trying to do my hair for a wedding and I had to go through my hair 5 times and it would not heat up. My hair was so frizzy I ended up just putting it in a ponytail- for my sisters wedding!! I have tried to reset it numerous times and it has not worked. My 4 sisters and lots of girl friends have asked me whether they should buy this and I will have to tell them no because of this horrific experience. There were some reviews that warned against this stating it worked for a bit and all of a sudden it stopped heating up. My inexpensive conair flat iron which I had for 5 years lasted and worked better than this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good price and works very well. It heats up within 5 minute with a button that allows for &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and temp control. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Germany and Belgium since it can switch voltage.  It worked perfectly. I never had an issue charging my phones or using my laptop.  I love that it has both outlets like a power strip and USB ports for easy phone charging.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long, and wavy hair and this iron cannot flatten my hair completely. little disappointed and thinking about returning. Good reviews but chi might be better.</li>
    <li> For straightning it is good. But making curls with it (the reason I bought it) I would look for a different one.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair iron twice. I like it so far. It did the work it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Prior to getting this professional iron, I used conair. I definitely love my conair, but wanted to step it up.  This iron gets pretty hot, I don&#x27;t have to put the setting on the highest to get my desired level of flatness. I use mine at a little more than half way. I really appreciated getting the glove with it, as well as the trial size oil. This is a well manufactured product and seems to be very heavy duty. All in all I am extremely happy with this product, especially at the price that I paid. You won&#x27;t be dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightner got a great price !</li>
    <li> This was a holiday gift for our young adult daughter. She has used it several times and loves it. It straightens her shoulder length hair in 15 minutes  and is easy to use. The only thing she would have liked is a way to lock it closed while it is heating.</li>
    <li> such an AMAZING flat iron. so happy with this product. one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve purchased. Great price for this hardworking mommy of two. love it.</li>
    <li> Great value!  Easy to use and did not burn me or fry my hair.  It flattens out my hair really nicely and gets rid of all the frizz.  Would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love this straighterner...gets hot fast and straightens in one stroke. Would definitely would recommend to people especially with unruly hair.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed and the price is great!!!</li>
    <li> In process of returning item.  Two stars for presentation and value.  No more because it didn&#x27;t heat well enough and seemed to drag and tug on my hair.  Same products in my hair, only difference was the flat iron.  Hair didn&#x27;t appear sleek like it did with my previous flat iron that just died; it made my hair look dull and unfinished.</li>
    <li> Did a great job on my daughters curly hair!  I don&#x27;t know if the heating is accurate tho</li>
    <li> I like this for the price but I don&#x27;t think it worked as good as my Chi. The HSI Iron pulls at my hair every time I use it, this is the only reason why I don&#x27;t care for it. Pros: Good price, I like how the cord turns with you as you need it to and it heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> This arrived very fast.  Love when that happens!  Packaged well and worked great right out of box.  I have never used a flat iron before so have to experiment......but to me the fast shipping and all that was included, well....I am cheap and look for deals no matter what it is, and this seems to be a winner!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  This straightener is at least as good as my CHI and a third of the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron for about a month now.  I am very happy with it.  Its heavier to hold than my last flat iron but it is still pretty easy to handle.  The only thing I wish I had in this iron is an automatic shut off.  My last iron had it and I never had to stress out about whether or not I left it on all day.  Otherwise, my hair is smooth and healthy feeling and stays straight through most humid weather.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a decent hair straightener but my fiance complained about it pulling at her hair too much so we returned it.</li>
    <li> Excelent ! Love the iron and the argan oil</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, she loves it!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
    <li> Great product even for a n00b!!!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  I&#x27;d order this again.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sister who has natural hair and she seems to really like it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron was a blessing. I have used it for over a year now. It&#x27;s very effective and has worked flawlessly all this time, and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price of the fancy one my sister uses. I love the glove and the argan oil that it comes with, but I almost never use the glove because I&#x27;ve never had a problem keeping my fingers safe using this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good ceramic straightener for it&#x27;s price, however, I&#x27;ve only had the product for about a week and accidentally dropped it (only once) and the ceramic plate cracked already! What a bummer! Wish I could have gotten more uses out of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the high reviews (which I&#x27;m now very suspicious of...) The product came in nice boxing, and that&#x27;s about as far as the pros come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a few minutes to warm up, longer than any other iron i&#x27;ve used. Could not straighten my hair with it. Tugs and pulls hair every single time. It was torture. I thought it was just me, but after trying it on multiple other people, they&#x27;ve all concluded it has got to be the worst flat iron they&#x27;ve ever used. The plastic feels cheap, and the swivle cord looks like it&#x27;s not secured properly into iron and may snap off any moment. I returned it after 3 days.</li>
    <li> Pretty close comparison to my Chi that I had for 9 years. Let&#x27;s see how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> Now hair is a  touchy topic for me. As much as my hair affects my confidence, it is that much difficult to manage. Naturally wavy and super frizzy, with multiple chemical straightening treatments AND coloring - I&#x27;ve tried it all and STRUGGLED. After much of the salon, hairstyles, products, treatments, damage, research brouhaha, I concluded that smooth, straight hair is what I can stick with, but my hairstylist just refused a chemical straightening :|. So I knew it was time for a good salon model hair iron that would not damage my hair and save me a ton of agony. Days of research and online comparisons and of course the 9000+ reviews on Amazon made me go with HSI which I had to take great pains to get delivered to India. So the big question -  Was it worth it?  Absolutely and more! Just love how it takes only minutes to straighten my wild waves and how smoothly this iron does it for me. The argan oil is just a miracle product because my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth in the longest time. Easy to grip, tourmaline plates, temp control and of course the great price are all just a few of the many benefits. The only flip side is it takes a few minutes before cooling down so have to really watch it around my little nephew! But all in all, A HUGE RELIEF to finally have manageable hair which looks and feels great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron a lot.  I Won&#x27;t say I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have a  heating control switch ( I think the control switch is available on another model, but for the price this is a very nice flat iron ) I have  natural ethnic hair and I wanted a flat iron to smooth my bangs as I wear my bangs straight. I have to use the high heat ( I don&#x27;t flat iron my entire head of hair ) so the high setting ( for such a small amount of hair ) is ok for me.  I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Thus is fantastic! My hair is left soft and I can curl, straighten, or anything in between.</li>
    <li> It more than meets expectations.  I love the way it heats up quickly and that there are so many heat setting options.  Hair is shiny.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!! BEST STRAIGHTENER I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Customer service and product were excellent!</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for maybe 6 months. At first it was ok, nothing special. I already have straight hair and use a flat iron for shaping/ smoothing. I recently noticed that the red light stopped changing to green when it was ready, though the iron was obviously very hot. I kept the setting somewhere around 300 degrees- difficult to tell with this dial. I now have a horribly damaged p, extremely kinky, rough, dry section of hair after using this. Since the damage starts at the level I generally place the iron on my hair, I can&#x27;t think of anything else that could have ruined my hair like this. I suspect that the iron was just heating itself up to full heat and not where the dial was set.</li>
    <li> Purchased another one for my use.  Prior was a gift for my 14 yr. granddaughter and she is extremely happy with it.  She had used a Chi before and likes this straightener better.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic tourmaline Flat Iron.  I am very happy with my purchase, I already used it twice.  Leaves my hair very smooth and shiny.  I was a little concern about using a flat iron since I have fine hair, I did not want to damage it.  I use it in the middle setting and it works just great and does not burn my hair.  I use it in one quick pass, always lifting my hair up and away from my scalp so it does not look flat against my head.  To my surprise I received my package in 2 business days ( I did not pay for quick delivery).  The presentation of the product is beautiful, It comes in a beautiful pink satin padded pouch.  A plus is that it has dual voltage already built in so you do not need to take a converter,(you just need to buy an plug adaptor for whichever country to are going to visit, this is  a great feature for me as I am planning to take it on my overseas vacation.  Thanks again Amazon, you always come through for me with prompt and quality products-  Happy!!!:)</li>
    <li> Came fast and works well.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT!  Ripped out my hair when I used it.  Not as hot as described.  Had to use immense pressure on hair to get it to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using hairart ceramic straighteners for years, but decided to try something different.  BIG MISTAKE.  Returned and went with Hairart straightener.  So much better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two months now and have had no problems. It works just as well as more expensive ones I have used in the past. Shipping was quick. Overall a good product!</li>
    <li> This a the ideal straightener.  So easy to use and it gets hot super fast.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Does the job perfectly and leaves my hair frizz-free and lasts for atleast two days, Plus it comes with a free holding bag and glove! l highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Conair for years and decided to give the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; model a try. What and amazing difference! And the price is very reasonable!! It really straightens and completely smooths! Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It heats up fast and gives my hair a shine.</li>
    <li> Takes minutes to straighten my hair now instead of the hour and a half!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair very smooth and no fly aways, better than chi.</li>
    <li> The straightener heats up quickly, has adjustable temperature dial, and comes with a handy carry pouch for travel or storage. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and this straightener works wonders on my hair!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good straightener...</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener &amp; you certainly couldn&#x27;t beat the sale price I got it for. It also has a very long cord which is a convenient feature.</li>
    <li> Great price, product and delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews. I must admit I usually just buy a cheap iron and call it a day. I got this one in after a long wait, almost 2 weeks for delivery. When I started using it for the first time I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as most of the reviewers. I thought it worked well, but then again so did my previous cheap iron. However I was satisfied enough and set on keeping it until it broke. The part that holds the cord in fell apart at the base of the iron. I packed it up and sent it back and took a refund because I was not offered a replacement. I might have reordered but too much hassle and wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on writing reviews but babbbyyyyy.......when I tell you the hsi argon oil along with the hsi professional ceramic flat irons are amazing I&#x27;m not lieing. I tried both products together for the first time and my hair is so silky, smooth, bouncy, not frizzy, and my hair looks like I went to the shop to get a wash and press. I love love love the argon oil and will buy the bigger one soon. The oil I believe what really makes my hair feel and look the way it does, and I love the fact that the flat irons doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all, it just glides straight through my hair. I have thin fine hair and after using both,  my hair looks full and very healthy again so far so good ya&#x27;ll, please please please take my word for it....at least buy the hsi argon oil.</li>
    <li> I selected this item based on the high positive review on the product and the customer service. Unfortunately, it was not the same thing I experienced. The product is well packaged. However, it was not getting hot enough (my hair would not stay straight). I had several flat irons before (not HSI) and I am familiar with what a hot iron mean. Contacted the customer service and they asked me to ship it for them on my own for replacement. I don&#x27;t understand why should I pay to ship a malfunctioned unit! What if the replacement unit is also malfunction!</li>
    <li> Love it. It heats up quick and stays hot.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener a week ago, received two days later and finally tested it out today. I am Hispanic with a bit of a middle eastern side so my hair is extremely thick and curly, this straightener straightened my hair beautifully! Didn&#x27;t pull or tug on my hair, didn&#x27;t burn it and I was able to straighten it in no time without having to go over it five times! The only problem was that it took a little long heating up, but once it was heated, oh, it was heated! I definitely recommend this straightener. If it worked for my crazy lantino hair, it&#x27;ll definitely work for yours as well!</li>
    <li> Smooth, easy to handle, does not catch hair.</li>
    <li> Very good iron. My girlfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> Love it - heats up fast does not &#x27;chinge&#x27; my hair</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product. My friend had brought this product as a gift for his niece and she told her friend about it. So my wife heard about it and that&#x27;s why I brought the product. My friend has brought three of these already to give as gifts to his family members.</li>
    <li> Not the best but decent for the price</li>
    <li> So easy that even an idiot like me can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t like dealing with my own hair but this flat iron actually makes dealing with my mop top so easy that it&#x27;s almost fun.  I love how the plates get very hot but not so much my hair starts burning.  Great product for an amazing price..  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Gets my thick hair really straight and smooth. I bought this for traveling to Scotland but find myself using it over my Chi at home in the states.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and heats up fast. Very nice quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using irons for 10+ years now and trust I&#x27;ve gone through some pricy ones. My hair is long, thick, wavy and stubborn and the result I get is straight and sleek. This iron travels well too, it works internationally (chi&#x27;s don&#x27;t) and has a heat sleeve for when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works wonders on my very curly, very coarse hair. I&#x27;ve never been able to get that fresh out of the salon look, until now. My hairstylist doesn&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t come around as often ;)</li>
    <li> The description is very accurate.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my flat iron.  It is the best one I have purchased.  It leaves my hair looking great.  My daughter is the one who told me about this product.  I will gladly let others know how satisfied I am.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to I guess. I find the long cord a bit of a problem. I have thick hair and this process takes a very long time -- not quite the salon quality I was hoping for</li>
    <li> After ironing my hair it felt so smooth I never used something like this in the past...It helped me a lot with my knots in my hair this product is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this straightner. Leaves my hair straight, smooth and shiney.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair, which sometimes gets a little frizzy close to the roots after washing and blow drying. This iron allows me to straighten and smooth out the frizzy part, but also curl the ends into beautiful curls. Very effective.  Leaves the hair undamaged and shiny.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is really bulky. The stuff it came with was nice, but the actual flat iron does not work nearly as well as others I&#x27;ve used. Now I have to buy another one</li>
    <li> First time user of flat iron.  This seems to be a top-notch product!  There were user guidelines included which helped this first-timer out a lot.</li>
    <li> Works good, I still prefer to straighten using my curling iron.. I think it gets hotter.  But good product.</li>
    <li> Better than my Chi.  Great product at a greater price!  Would highly recommend to anyone.  I have very curly hair and it calms my curls without burning or drying.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product,based on the reviews of others,hoping it would be the flat iron of my dreams....it wasn&#x27;t. I have thin,fine hair...so used the iron on the lowest setting. It still burned it. The ends look all frayed and frizzy...not sleek and shiny like product promised. I gave it to my daughter in law,and bought a baby bliss...which I should have gotten to begin with</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been told that I have a lot of hair. Most hair dressers have to color/cut my hair in 3, sometimes 4 layers. But I don&#x27;t even bother to straighten my hair in layers with this flat iron because I don&#x27;t really have to. Works really well! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It works better than the CHI straightener I have. It is the only flat iron I use because it heats up quickly and leaves my hair straight and shiny.</li>
    <li> This a great product, I highly recommend. It works better than my previous flat iron, and at a much better price. Great vendor, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love it, I have very thick wavy hair and this works wonders</li>
    <li> It is a good flat iron for the price. It doesn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as my previous CHI one but satisfied with the product overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve checked out various ceramic styled flatirons in local stores and this iron is priced well under the price of the ones I&#x27;ve seen.  It is an excellent iron and after using it for a couple weeks...I really can feel the difference in my hair.  Also, the time it takes to style my hair has been cut considerably since this is a &#x27;once-through and done&#x27; process.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, heats qiuck, nice travel pouch, one swipe over hair is all needed. My previous one was also a pro style purchased from my sister in law who is a stylist. HSI is much better. Especially like the Argon oil</li>
    <li> Very happy with the straightener. I had originally only received a little one time sample of the Argan oil, so I sent a message to the company and they quickly sent me the travel one as stated in the product description. I really like the oil too. I would highly recommend the straightener to anyone and definitely will buy from them again (I&#x27;m eyeballing the curling irons now).</li>
    <li> I love this iron!  It straightens my hair in half the time I&#x27;ve experienced with any other product. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family (and I have).  It heats up quickly and leaves my hair straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> Wish it got a bit hotter, as I have thick, naturally curly  hair, but it does work really well, especially for the price. I would say it is just as good as a chi. the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it has a tendency to snag my hair, and that is really annoying!</li>
    <li> I like this product for the price. I hate flat ironing my hair. I want to do it as quickly as possible when necessary. I still have to blow dry with a round brush for sleekness but this does put on a good finishing touch.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what was expected with quick fast delivery</li>
    <li> Really fine product.  Temperature control is excellent.  Good feel in the hand.  The Argan oil is a nice added bonus.</li>
    <li> The hair straightener is great. I appreciate how fast the seller was in getting this to me. Everything has been as advertised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this flatiron for a trip to Italy because it was dual voltage and not terribly expensive. I was thrilled with how well it worked on my trip, but thought it would not work as well when I returned to the heat and humidity back home in Louisiana. I was wrong! My hair has never looked better. It stays smooth even in 90% humidity, and I love the little waves that the curved edges create in my hair. This flatiron exceeded my expectations and outperforms my other, much more expensive, one.</li>
    <li> Smoothing never a snag would recommend over chi ghd and many others</li>
    <li> Gets hot super fast and works great!</li>
    <li> My wife has not had any problems with this product. she loves the features for this flat iron. had great commuications from seller. great transaction</li>
    <li> This sleeks my thick, course, curly hair in no time...flat. ;-)  I have never had a flat iron tame my hair in one pass before, but this one does!  The Argan oil leaves your hair feeling soft and looking super shiny.  The item is high quality and I imagine this iron will last me a long time.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My daughter has struggled to find a decently priced flat iron.  It seems there is always a problem with it,  This flat iron was recommended to us by our hair stylist.  It has been great.  She was especially pleased with the way it left her hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  The flat iron works great, and the pouch that came with it was a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Nicely packaged.  I LOVE that the temp is adjustable!&lt;br /&gt;This works very well on my hair and I am glad I purchased from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this straightener based upon reviews, and the reviews are correct!&lt;br /&gt;A+ Service!</li>
    <li> I love this flatiron it works wonders!!!! I still use it to this day...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as another one my wife has but she likes it since the old one chipped.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Love that it heats up so quickly. This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought. I have one and am buying another for my friend. She&#x27;s been using a conair flat iron and it does not work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron. Salon results! Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works great!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it on my daughters hair and it works wonders?</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I am very happy with this flat iron. It is better then my old &amp;#34;chi&amp;#34; flat iron. It is highly affordable for truly a professional quality produce. I have very thick hair, and this iron made it salon perfect. Also they include a very nice oil with it. Just you a tab, that&#x27;s all you need. They also provide a glove which is very helpful when you need a high to use a high temperature. I recommend this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product so far! Works great on my hair and it&#x27;s compact for travel and not bulky as some of the others are. LOVE it and I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well and the price is good too! I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. Heats up quickly and makes my kinky, frizzy hair smooth and shinny. I love it and would definitely recommend it to everyone! If you have coarse or curly hair, this is the iron you need.  The HSI Argon oil that came with it is amazing stuff. I have ordered more. I will buy this iron again when it&#x27;s time for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does a wonderful job straightening my hair as needed.  Nice carrying case, useful when travelling.</li>
    <li> I waited waaayyyyy tooo loooongggg to purchase a new flat iron &amp; wanted something fast, hot,  &amp; functional for my long,  very thick wavy locks! I took a fb poll from all my gal pals &amp; 1 suggested the HSI. I read the reviews &amp; LOVED the price so I decided to give it a shot! Upon its arrival I was excited to fire it up, though skeptical. From my first session on, it&#x27;s performed just as I&#x27;ve needed; fast, hot, &amp; functional! Takes me less than 1/2 the time as my old flat iron &amp; when i added in the argon oil my locks laid smoothly, shined luxuriously, &amp; felt fantastic! I will forever use these products!</li>
    <li> I love this straightner! I&#x27;ve always used a CHI but decided to give this one a shot after reading reviews. It heats super fast, straightens with a few swipes through my hair, and my hair feels soft afterward. So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but not crazy over it</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to use during a trip to Italy, since it&#x27;s dual voltage. It worked great! I love the fact that you can adjust the heat settings. It didn&#x27;t take long to heat and worked great on my hair. It comes with a pouch with is wonderful for travel. This is a quality product and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good flat jron! It leaves your hair silky &amp; shiny. I love them.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service - extremely happy with all aspects.</li>
    <li> makes a huge difference and the oil it comes with works wonders</li>
    <li> This item works great I did not need a lot of heat I stayed under 200°so that&#x27;s a plus 4 me the con is I can not say the exect number that&#x27;s the only problem</li>
    <li> I have used MANY flat irons and I have always had fairly decent results with any of them, but THIS one is AMAZING. I have never had my hair be this straight before. I have naturally wavy/curly hair and straightening has always been an issue for me, but this can flatten everything in 15-30 minutes easily.&lt;br /&gt;it heats up FAST. It works GREAT. It feels very sturdy and not flimsy like many others I have used. It even feels better in my hand than a Chi. It&#x27;s handle allows a good grip and the plates glide through hair with little to no tangling or hair pulling.&lt;br /&gt;I had an issue with the delivery date and didn&#x27;t receive my item when it said I would, but I contacted the seller and had an IMMEDIATE response. They were very kind.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for product AND customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought a ceramic-plated flat iron for $20 at Target and as soon as I used it and saw smoke come out of it as it touched my hair, I knew I needed a new iron. This one flattens with one stroke without any singeing or smoking. My hair comes out shiny. It&#x27;s performed exactly as I hoped. The travel bag and oil are nice bonuses.</li>
    <li> I love this ceramic flat iron, my hair looks so beautiful!</li>
    <li> My trusty flat iron of almost 5 years finally died on me. After doing much research and reading other&#x27;s reviews, I settled on this flat iron. It arrived fairly quickly with my other items, and after unpacking it, I was excited at how it looked and felt. I have long, wavy thick hair, and a lot of it. So straightening it takes some work. I will admit, the first few times it worked like a charm. I had the temperature maxed out, but for my hair it was perfect. Then one day the digital readout light started going out, and the temperature quickly dropped anywhere from 20-30 degrees after just a few runs through my hair. I then had to wait for it to get back up before I could proceed. The lower temperatures do not work well on my hair. Needless to say I need it to stay as close to 450 as possible. When it is at 450 it works great; it would be greater if it stayed around that temp for more than a minute or two. Would probably work wonders for those with finer hair? But for myself, I was disappointed. I&#x27;ll keep using this until I find something better.</li>
    <li> Works grate and feels well built.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe i can actually use a hair straightener and just as unbelievable is how easy it is to use...AND NO BURNING as you can set the heating temperature! I am nearly 75 years old for starters (yep!!) and have tried off and on for years to use different flat irons but have always ended up with singed ends to my hair or burning my hand at some point. It was pricer than i had wanted but thought how much $ i could save if i could do my own hair and that is just the case; goodbye hair salons except for haircuts!. Just writing to say, you can teach an old dog new tricks if the trick is easy to learn! thank you for making an easy to use product that i look forward , not dread, using.</li>
    <li> I had this straightener for about 3 years and I love it. It is good for its price. It works fast and it does not pull on your hair. The surface of it is smooth. It keeps your hair straight for a long period of time. In the pictures there&#x27;s a before and after and another picture a few hours later.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Great price!</li>
    <li> I like my new flat iron because it leaves my hair smooth and shine. I mainly use it to curl my hair than flattening it. When I used it the first time it pulled my hair but once I got used it, the pulling stops. I like the fact you can adjust the temperature. Overall I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron a couple  of months ago.  It heats up quickly and holds hair tightly.  It works very well.  The reason I gave it three stars is that is does not have auto shut off.  I have left it on at least 10 times now.  All of my previous flat irons had auto shut off, so I  am having trouble remembering to turn it off.  If it had auto off, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron is the best iron you can get. I decided on going natural and needed something to make my hair easy and manageable. The read the reviews and I decided to try it. It works great. I was able to get to my roots without burning myself. I have AA hair and it&#x27;s really thick. With this, my hair was smooth and manageable. It said the Argon Oil was travel size. I was looking forward to that but it&#x27;s just a sample. If you are looking for an affordable flat iron, CHOOSE THIS.</li>
    <li> So far, I am very pleased with this iron. I used to use a curling iron but came to realize that a flat iron was better for my style. I&#x27;ve had a couple cheap ones from the drug store which didn&#x27;t do the job. I had just purchased a $100 CHI from Target when this deal came up so I returned that and bought the HSI. Definitely a good move on my part!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works as well if not better than the pricier models.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I had purchased an expensive flat iron from a kiosk in a mall a year ago and it kept damaging/burning my hair even on the lowest setting and I new I needed to do something! I am so happy with my purchase and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Works great! Heats up quickly!</li>
    <li> Love this iron!!  It heats up quick, easy to use and doesn&#x27;t frizz out my hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived in speed time, and the product is fabulous.  Have had a Chi over the years, and I believe this product to be better Happy Camper</li>
    <li> wonderful straightener!</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my mom as a late present and she was just wowed by the way it was presented in a case and how nice it looked! I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I read quite a few reviews before purchasing my new flat iron. I LOVE this one. It gets really hot and it smooths my frizzy hair quickly. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, solid product</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product, bonus sample sized bottle of oil to try on your hair before styling (works wonders)</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, leaves hair smooth and frizz free. Quick straighten time for my difficult hair</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I got it for a great price, it heats up quickly, I can straighten my hair in a lot less time than I used to.</li>
    <li> Really great deal, high quality!</li>
    <li> Just as good as a CHI at a much better price!</li>
    <li> All good !  Works well and ifs easy to use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it a lot. But like it when I do.  I use it between the days I wash and style my hair to give it more body or direction. I use it with the Argan OIl Spray for a smooth shiny look.  Don&#x27;t suggest you use it on dry hair or you could singe your hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased the iron for my sister. It arrived much earlier than expected and it worked much better than her other one. It heats up quickly so almost no wait to do your hair.  It does get verrry hot so make sure to check the temp and adjust according to type of hair.  The only thing I thought was odd is the on off button and temp control on the inside of the handle which makes it hard to see.  Overall it seems to work well since I haven&#x27;t had any complaints from my sister.</li>
    <li> Great basic straightener I bought one each for my girls. Works well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  More than met my expectations for size of &#x27;iron&#x27; (1/2 inch) ability to control heat and ease of use!!!  Thank you for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my wife&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> Excellent and more than my expectation.I recommended it for african hair .</li>
    <li> I purchased this after having a much larger straightener for several years.  This one works great.  Just takes a little getting used to because my other one had comb attachment on one side and was larger and held more hair and seemed to have a better hold on my hair.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! Love it</li>
    <li> Light and nice and smooth</li>
    <li> My flat iron arrived faster than seems possible and is wonderful. I ordered it not as a replacement, but as a travel one because of the dual current and have not had the chance to test it using 220v yet, but I expect it to work just as well. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned! It&#x27;s perfect!!! It heats up really quick, has a convenient travel bag and has an indicator light to let you know when it&#x27;s finished heating up.</li>
    <li> Best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It straightens my hair quickly and leaves it shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great item Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> The HSI 1in Flat Iron works wonders on my hair.  The dial for the heat is a great feature to protect my hair from heat damage.  My stylist stated that I got a great deal and that the Argon oil is a good product and to only use one or two drops, start at the ends of the hair and use very little on the roots.  Thank you for a great product and an excellent deal!</li>
    <li> daughter loves it! great price and her hair stays straight longer than her previous straightener.</li>
    <li> It broke after like a couple months of use from its own heat</li>
    <li> Good product for the price!</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron. It arrived fast, I am very happy with how little I paid for it. Works great! I have thick and wavy hair. I had a Paul Mitchell flat iron before, and this one works just as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron and very reasonably priced. I have fine, fragile hair and I really appreciate the adjustable temperature. I use it at half heat and it&#x27;s perfect. I wish they would make a travel version.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It heats up really fast and it works great! The price was fantastic too. When you turn it off, it doesn&#x27;t take long to get cold.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It heats up fast, and straightens my hair quickly and safely because the edges of the heated part don&#x27;t heat up.  The price was really great for a professional straightener.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works magic on my natural hair. Better than any other flat iron especially for the price. And i highly recommend the leave-in oil treatment that my left hair feeling soft,silky, with lots of body. It only comes in trail size and i used it all in one application so i would recommend  ordering 4 oz bottle. It is so worth it.</li>
    <li> I have owned two FHI flat irons which I absolutely LOVED!!! Sadly they both met untimely deaths :&#x27;(. Not wanting to spend a small fortune again, I decided to try the HSI. Its no FHI but it was much better than a drug store flat iron. I have thick, coarse (4a/4b) hair but with the right flat iron and products can be straightened smooth and shiny. The HSI straightened my hair but the usual sheen wasn&#x27;t there. I needed more products than usual to reach my desired look. Also, the hair didn&#x27;t remain straight in humidity as long as usual. I&#x27;m going to keep the iron as a quality backup iron but have ordered an iron of another brand as my hopeful \\&quot;go to iron\\&quot;. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like using a flat iron, but I was pleasantly surprised with the HSI professional ionic. I have very fine hair and I like the fact that there is an adjustable heat control. Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> When this arrived and I took a look at it, I was shocked to find the controls INSIDE by the heat plates.  This is an injury hazard.  Also, the wheel that controls the temperature is completely loose and won&#x27;t stay in one position.  You can never be sure of where the heat control has been turned to, since there is no indicator mark on it.  Returned.</li>
    <li> I ordered the HSI flat iron as a b-day gift for my daughter. We are both very pleased with the product. Easy online shopping with no surprises or let downs.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to order this iron at first because this same flat iron is MUCH more expensive elsewhere.  Boy was I happy with my purchase!  So much better than the old flat iron I had been using (I had previously been using an 8 year old $12.99 iron from a popular big box store).  Try it with the argon oil sample.  Hair looks so shiny!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product because of the great reviews. When I got it the light would not come and it would not get hot. After messing around with it for about 30 minutes I got it to work. I just was not impressed. My hair is very fine, but my hair did not get very straight. I thought it was because I did not put argon oil on it first. So I did it again. My hair frizzed up the very next day. Unfortunately I am not a fan. I really want to send it back.</li>
    <li> Used this on a recent trip to Europe.  All I needed was an outlet adapter.  It straightened hair well and was easy to use.  The little pouch is very handy as well.  For the price this is a great little flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> When I first open up the package I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like it, but once I turned it on and started to use I love it.  I like the way it heats up fast and you only need to pass it once on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many hair straighteners due to my thick curly hair. Recently I decided to buy a new straightener after my current one&#x27;s temperature settings never heated up to correct temperature and never stayed hot consistently. My hair dresser recommended me another expensive straightener but after seeing all the good reviews about this straightener I figured why not? $100 less and people seemed quite pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;First off, it took forever to get. I&#x27;m glad my current straightener didn&#x27;t completely break because I would of gone weeks without a straightener. Anyhow, it finally came and the box was very nice and it came in the pouch like it said. No complains there. So I tried it out. I turned it all the way up, since it didn&#x27;t even heat up close to my previous straightener. The plates were not smooth on my hair at all. I felt like I was loosing more hair than straightening and it did not straighten my hair well at all! I had to go over it several times, wait for it to heat up, keep going over it. Forget it! HUH! LONG STORY SHORT. I&#x27;m still using my \\&quot;old\\&quot; straightener and using this as a travel one. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to be a good flat iron after reading the reviews but i was blown away by all the compliments I received after using it. This product makes my hair look and feel like I just stepped out of the salon. My hair has always looked dry and brittle but not anymore. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price! Heats up fast which is great especially when you&#x27;re in a hurry to get out of the house fast! I loved that it came with a fancy little bag and some oils for your hair! The only down fall is, no auto turn off. I forget to turn it off one time and it was left on the entire time I was at work! It survived but not safe! All and all Great product! P.s. shipped fast which meant a lot to me since the flat iron I had broke and I was in desperate need of one A.S.A.P!</li>
    <li> I needed an easy and affordable flat iron that would not damage my hair. This one fit the bill! It arrived as expected,is very easy to use, and is worth the cost. I have been using it over the past 3 weeks and love the results!! I have medium length hair that wants to curl and live in a very humid climate. This product works perfectly!</li>
    <li> After my CHI power cord was chewed by a dog, I decided to give another product a chance. At a fraction of the cost the HSI flat iron works just as good as my CHI and would recommend this product to anybody</li>
    <li> I really like this product and the price is awesome. I am going to highly recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the HSI flat iron.  My hair is a frizzy disaster, and I&#x27;m terrible at doing my own hair.  If I&#x27;d joined the circus as a clown, I wouldn&#x27;t need a wig.  However, with the help of this product, I&#x27;ve been able to get my hair tamed down into something much more manageable, and in any one else&#x27;s hands, I bet this iron would make my hair look great!  It heats up in very little time.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. This is my second straightener from HSI, and I absolutely love them. I think they are better made, and less damaging than Chi at an incredible price. A great buy!</li>
    <li> As far as shipping, this item came in a day or so before i expected which was great. It heats up really quick too which I personally love. The only negative is that because I have thick wavy hair, it takes a couple tries before it&#x27;s straight the way I like, even on a hotter setting. It may be because the metal plate is an inch versus my old one that was four or five. But overall im fairly satisfied with the product and it leaves my hair looking really shiny.</li>
    <li> I saw the product and price and decided to purchase it. I have used chi for a year and this product is the best. I am an African American who is natural. It straighten out my hair. It lasted about a week. I would recommended this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. This flat iron is excellent quality and I have had no trouble. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is well designed (likely by someone who travels and has high expectations of hair appliances).  It works.  It gets hot (very hot if you wish) really fast.  I stress tested this is Switzerland and France (I travel a lot for work).  It&#x27;s small, lightweight, easy to use with a swivel cord.  I don&#x27;t usually post reviews but just had to say this is a great product.  I don&#x27;t believe in multi-use products, I prefer a curling iron and a straightener -- but I traveled for 10 days with just this iron (brave of me!) and was 100% satisfied. Less in the luggage.  It comes with a cute bag (handy for easy packing), and a glove (no idea why a glove). You will not be disappointed.  Please make us a travel curling iron as good as this.</li>
    <li> I had assumed an item that was purchased so frequently and given such high ratings would be great. But this straightener does not heat up as it claims. I have a Fifteen dollar straightener I purchased from Walmart that gets hotter than this one. Hopefully it does the job anyway as I have course, wavy hair :)</li>
    <li> The heating iron does not heat well. even if i touch the plates at the highest setting, i won&#x27;t scorch my fingers because its not hot.&lt;br /&gt;I have very frizzy and dry hair and the straightener wouldn&#x27;t straighten my hair even if I go over small section of my hair 10 times.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I loved the product and the shipping was faster than I thought.</li>
    <li> Love this iron. Curls as well as it straightens. And a great price point to boot!</li>
    <li> its sleek and does the job. i heard that small irons can also double as a curler but i haven&#x27;t tried it yet</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain.  This is a decent flat iron.  This was purchased to hold me over until I got a bioionic or ghd or another \\&quot;better\\&quot; iron.  But, this one straightens and curls just like I want... and it was inexpensive.  Win -win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum - February 25, 2014.  It worked fine on Sunday and was dead on Monday. It was actually a GREAT flat iron - until it died.  I WILL NOT change the stars - because it was fantastic. I know anyone can curl with a flat iron, but I give credit to the design of this flat iron because the curls were SO perfect, people would ask how I did them.  But, you get what you pay for - and I guess I can buy another if it is the same price I bought it for then.  If it was crap, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Hoping this one lasts a little longer than a few months!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent flat iron. Does the job so no complaints there, but I don&#x27;t like how I have to keep going over my hair more than once. It usually takes 3-4 tries before my hair turns straight. I have african american hair and it&#x27;s quite thick (I&#x27;m not relaxed). I might try the CHI flat iron instead.</li>
    <li> This is a very good flat iron.  I liked the fact that you can select temperature, however, I found that we have to have it turned to the hottest setting all the time.  Overall, I think it was a good value.</li>
    <li> I have thick, super wavy hair and Iv tried I don&#x27;t know how many straighteners looking for something that does its jobs and actually keeps it straight. The ONLY thing that has came close is the Chi Air, which is outrageously expensive. Let me tell you this HSI straighter is by far better than Chi. Not only does it straighten my hair with one swipe, but it stays straight all day and it makes my hair super soft and shiny. And the argan oil that comes with it is great as well. I would definitely recommend this straighter to anybody. Along with the bigger bottle of argan oil(sold separately)</li>
    <li> Sleek. Heats up quickly. &amp; because of its rounded sides, it doesn&#x27;t snag hair, like so many other flat irons. It also adds a nice shine to hair. Best part, it not only straightens, but it creates beautiful curls fast. Hands down,  best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Based on the cheap price of the product ($39), I assumed the straightener wouldn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. Even though the original cost is around $200, I still had much doubt about the hype that this straightener was getting from the customer reviews. I kept contemplating on whether I should make the purchase or not, but in the end I really needed a new straightener so I thought &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; After trying it for the first time, I can easily say this product has been the best $40 I have spent in my life! I have very thick, damaged hair that is a MESS to handle and I struggled to straighten it daily, but this straightener saves me about a good 10-15 minutes because it literally straightens perfectly in one clamp. Other straighteners that I have used have always left my hair dry and damaged, but this straightener made my hair softer and lighter. I&#x27;ve probably used about 6-7 different straighteners my whole life and I can easily say that this one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned!! GREAT product!!! Love it :)</li>
    <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about voltage anymore during my frequent business trips around the world! The temperature is reached relatively fast and is high enough to leave my hair the way I want it to be. The only con I found is that it is a bit thick and heavy, but other than that I recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> Super thick, wavey,  med/long hair has never been straighten so fast. Lasts 2 days! Use the argon oil, highly recommend, some brands smell like perfume. Fast ship, sturdy product. Only 1\\&quot; plate buts its all u need. I wash hair at night in morning its dry and all i do is straighten with hsi! Done LESS THAN 20m and off to work-mom of 3</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on price and reviews.  One strong statement in particular that got my attention was that it&#x27;s better than a CHI, the very brand that I was replacing due to it being close to 10 years old.  This product is fine and a great value for the price, but I would not say it&#x27;s better than a CHI.  I&#x27;m happy enough with it though.</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional 1&amp;#34; Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic that i bought, works well for the price, although you still have to separate the hair into small sections and pass it a few times to get a result close to what you wanted. I bought it because of its dual voltage 120/240, and because of the &amp;#34;Ionic&amp;#34; description. Its highest temperature is 410 degrees F. It heats up fast. It has an on/off switch, a little dot of light to indicate when you have it on, on the outside of one of its sides.&lt;br /&gt; It is supposed to help with controlling a frizzy hair, and in my case i bought it to see if it would work specially at the top of my head to control the static, frizzes, but i don&#x27;t see the difference. I still have to use different products to control the frizzes and the static. It came with a sample of Argan Oil for the hair, and a carrying pouch that was a plus, and the shipping was fast. Very convenient. Overall, for the price, $49.85 through Blue Novelties, the voltage, and extras, it is a good choice to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I could never find a flat iron that was hot enough.  So I mentioned that to my cosmetologist and the HSI and CHI flat irons were the ones they recommended. I really am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my straightener!  I&#x27;ve used name brand straighteners before but nothing can compare to my new HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON!  This straightener heats up within seconds and it is really easy to use because it is so light!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great straightener and love that it comes with travel pouch and glove</li>
    <li> i really enjoy my flat iron and it really get my hair how i wanted it i didnt wrap my hair up for 2days and it still look nice and thin. i like these flat iron</li>
    <li> Yay I&#x27;m so excited I received my flat irons today. I used them as soon as I got them . They work amazingly,my hair went from very poofy and frizzy to straight with lots of body. They also came way before I expected them. The only thing about this flat iron that I&#x27;m not happy with is that there is a chip on one of the plates which snags and pull my hair every time I straightened a piece of my hair and it really hurts. Other then that the flat irons are great and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely RECOMMEND buying these flat irons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME ! ! :)</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Works great love the way it smooths out my hair. !!</li>
    <li> I love my new flat irons! My hair has more body and shine! It&#x27;s bone straight and bouncy!! I have thick and course hair and I run the flat irons over twice that is all it take for my hair to flow!!</li>
    <li> My wife says it works fine</li>
    <li> Works great, love the carrying case, no complaints - especially the price!</li>
    <li> Do not find it heats up that great.  Not better then Chi</li>
    <li> Horrible not what they said think all reviews are misleading  Burned hair and did now work like any flat iton I have used before  Daughter and I could not use and will not recommend this one to anyone</li>
    <li> My first flat iron....I love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this product . My daughter and me not need to waist money in the salon. With this iron hair you look pretty in the comfort of your house.</li>
    <li> I had a previous version of this flat iron and it lasted me almost 10 years before biting the dust (due to puppies chewing the cord). I think it would have lasted me even longer. This version has nice upgrades and still gives me the same incredible results.</li>
    <li> Works well although I can&#x27;t compare to any other straightener.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it sometimes is difficult to get my hair to do what I want. With this I have had an easier time and it doesn&#x27;t take forever like with my old one. Plus it is hot and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed when I first used a Chi, then I saw the price ((gasp))!  I&#x27;ll drop serious bucks at Beauty Brands for good conditioner, but not on hair styling products.  There&#x27;s no need to when you have items like this!  It heats up super hot, does a FANTASTIC job of straightening QUICKLY (and I have course hair and a lot of it), and you can even flip it at the end and roll and it does a lovely curl, just like Chi.  No reason to spend all that money when this gem is out there.  I&#x27;m a fan for life.  I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on how smooth my hair looks since using it.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron and the great deal on it!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Just as good, if not better, than irons in the $100+ range. And, if I could give customer service 10 stars, I would! Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron after using a Chi for several years, so I am a little biased.  I think it works fine as a straightener goes, but I am a little disappointed in that I feel it doesn&#x27;t heat up to it&#x27;s full potential.  I have natural curly hair, and it works okay.  I&#x27;ve only used it approx. 1 month on and off - so I&#x27;m still trying to decide if I would recommend it or not.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  Heats up fast.  The heat bag comes in handy.  Great iron for a great&lt;br /&gt;price!</li>
    <li> After researching the best quality flat irons, I came the HSI and couldn&#x27;t believe it was made of everything I was looking for (particularly 100% ceramic) and would cost less than $40! Because the plates are floating (won&#x27;t pull your hair) and pure ceramic, you must handle with care (no dropping or clapping the plates).  Overall, this flat iron is a great buy. Shipping was quick, too.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing and super professional. I was scared at first seeing how expensive the really good ones were but I&#x27;m so glad I took the risk. They include so much for a great price. The argan oil is doing wonders on my hair and the glove and sleeve it came with makes it great for travel. I love how it&#x27;s so good and at such an affordable price too! Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron..I would recommend this product!! Gets the job done!! I wish the argon oil was in a bottle than in a packet.. But overall #1</li>
    <li> I was not confident that this would work, after burning myself and returning the only other flat iron I&#x27;d bought at the drugstore.  But the price and reviews were good, and I&#x27;m delighted with the quality, ease of operation, and results from this.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well - heats quickly and straightens hair fast. You don&#x27;t have to do a section more than once which is better for your hair.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take much space in my check in and with the dual voltage, it works great for me at home in the States and when I was just visiting India and Singapore.  All I needed in both countries were converters for the outlet shape.  I don&#x27;t use the glove or oil.</li>
    <li> As an African-american female with coarse thick roots this flat iron is a heavenly gift! i wear sew-ins for protective style and use relaxer very sparingly. The hair I leave out of my sew-in consists of 14&#x27; strands. this flat iron gets my hair bone straight with its heat and leaves a silky shine touch that helps blend my natural with the weave. Looking forward to relaxing my hair and using this iron for my whole head. If you are looking for a quick heat-up iron that gives hair that salon look &amp; feel this is the iron you need to purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I didn&#x27;t really need a new one, but this deal was so good that I had to get it! I love it and it runs through my hair so well. :)</li>
    <li> I had a chi before I got this and compared to the chi this is a pretty good straightener. I would recommend this. Great for the price!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT FLAT IRON FOR THE PRICE YOU CANT GO WRONG IT WORKS GREAT HEATS UP FAST AND MY HAIR LOOKS REALLY STRAIGHT I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Its great! Exactly what I expected would recommend to friends and family and at a such wonderful price a a</li>
    <li> I want to love this straightener, but sadly, I was spoiled by the auto shut-off feature on my last straightener and have therefore forgotten to turn this one off several times when leaving for work in the morning. I don&#x27;t think a burned down house is worth the straight hair, so I will probably have to replace this flat iron with one that turns itself off after 60 minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  It&#x27;s not as hot as my previous one and it takes a few secs to heat up after you do a section of hair.  I would like to return it but I think I&#x27;m too late.  Would not buy this brand again.  I did receive it in a timely manner and have no complaints about the distributor.</li>
    <li> I love this Flat Iron and the way it makes my hair feel after using it. The glove and pouch are an added bonus. I really like the Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment because it makes my hair silky soft. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Certainly a great value and with all the accompanying accessories it is impressive. The iron itself is a bit light and not quite as efficient as I would like. To be fair, this is a great product for a non professional (home use) and the price is right. I am a hair professional and wanted an extra for travel. My hair is long also, and this product while good enough is not quite there with the professional results, not hot enough and leaving the light frizz on top layers. Overall, I imagine this would be good for most people, especially at the price.</li>
    <li> this was a birthday gift for my daughter and she loved it.She said it was just what she was looking for.her girlfriend has the same one and she wanted it.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews expected this to be a good flat iron.  Does not straighten that great.  Was not happy with this product at all.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter to use since she kept taking mine. it is great! she can handle on her own. the heat setting are good and it straightens her thick wavy hair with ease.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these a couple of years ago, when it was on sale. I was in dire need of one, as I had been using a cheap Walmart-bought flat iron. I personally was not able to use the oil much, since my hair is already thin and becomes oily quick, but I could definitely see what others liked about it. As far as the flat iron itself, I really liked this one! It was much nicer than my cheapy one. It heated up quick and went through my frizzy hair perfect. Unfortunately, I end up using the flat iron quite often, but my hair always stay quite straight throughout the day with this one. Sadly, the plates in it started falling off just over a year after purchasing, and my search began for a new one (my hair was getting snagged in it constantly). I will say though, it was by far the best I&#x27;d used, and lasted longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my Tourmaline HSI iron. Works just as the add said it would. Heats up very fast and hot!</li>
    <li> This flat iron was recommended by a friend and works well on my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s hair.  I would definitely recommend it. It heats quickly, there are parts of the iron you can hold without burning your fingers as you guide the iron on the hair.  Loved the Argan Oil...makes her hair so smooth!</li>
    <li> Just as expected - works great.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d ignore the reviews. Big mistake. The item doesn&#x27;t heat up to the stated heat. When I&#x27;m done, it looks like I haven&#x27;t even used it on my thick hair. Plus, the green light that says it&#x27;s ready switches to red every time I open it. Definitely not worth the price. So sorry I wasted my time and money.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter for her birthday because she liked to use mine.  She loves it and it is a great iron for the price.  We are really happy with the purchase and it shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It doesn&#x27;t pull her hair or doesn&#x27;t dry it out/fry it. It is a great product and I would get this for myself if I used heat products on my hair. Great Quality. It came exactly when it said it would.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item quite some time ago and I am still using it now.  It is a very good durable ceramic flat iron.  I had never heard of the brand before and took a chance because the price was so good at that time.  To date I have had no problems and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> bought for my daughter, she seems very pleased.</li>
    <li> My daughter and wife cannot stop using it,</li>
    <li> I got it at a great price when it was on sale. It heats up quickly and provides consistent results. Works just as well as the CHI I had before this.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy/curly hair and this straightener makes my hair straight in one pass. With my last straightener I needed to pass over each section of hair several times. This on leaves my hair straight and shiny. I love it and am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t as good as I expected it to be via the ratings</li>
    <li> Love this product! Exactly what I needed. This is the first time I am using a hot iron on my hair but it was very easy to work with and love the output.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another flat iron, this one works OK but I&#x27;m not overwhelmed with it.</li>
    <li> A very high quality product, easy to use and maintain.  It doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long and it works exceptionally well with my hair, which is very frizzy.</li>
    <li> makes my hair damaged, I use my old one now</li>
    <li> Works good, but the on/off switch and heat control is difficult to reach because it&#x27;s on the inside of the iron.</li>
    <li> already broken and just got June 2nd. I was standing right by my teen daughter when she was straightening her hair and we heard a sound and looked at it, the metal within the straightener had cracked in half obviously due to the heat. Barely had for 4 months and too late for a return.</li>
    <li> I have used chi in the past, decided to try this one after my chi broke from electrical issues, it heats up well and straightens better than my chi. It leaves my hair soft and shiny, it does have a &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; feel if you have your hair too close to outer plates so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 instead of 5 but I would recommend this flat iron</li>
    <li> Heats up SUPER fast and super hot. Does a great job straightening for lazy people like me who don&#x27;t want to spend more than 10 minutes for great looking hair. Cuts down on frizz too - really smooths it out.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Prompt shipping and item is exactly what was described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple months ago for my wife when her flat iron broke. She said it works great and likes being able to adjust the temperature. I personally don&#x27;t know much about this, but she really likes this flat iron and hasn&#x27;t complained yet.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Easy to use and warms up very fast.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it daily.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this , but I&#x27;ve been using it and it does not heat up enough to straighten my hair, and I have thin hair .</li>
    <li> Love it! This iron is truly professional, not like the last one we got that said &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; on the box. It gets REALLY hot. So if you have super curly hair this is the iron for you. I like the temperature knob because I have bleached areas of hair that I can&#x27;t use as much heat as my virgin hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Fast shipping and it came exactly as it had been described.</li>
    <li> Well, I was very happy with this flat iron until I looked closely at it when I plugged it in this afternoon. One of the plates is cracked, and I just bought it in January of this year. I have heard from someone else who had two of these that ended up with cracked plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I will have to spring for one of the more expensive flat irons. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! I&#x27;ve only had my hair flat ironed once and it was with a $200 iron. This made my hair feel even better and shinier than that one did. I&#x27;m so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great company.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I had higher expectations that I should have. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it gets the job done, especially with my course frizzy hair, however I don&#x27;t get a sleep straight look. If anything my hair looks straightly tousled. Doesn&#x27;t mean I dont love the look but it is called a &amp;#34;flat iron&amp;#34;. Dont regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Packed beautifully.  Sleek.  Heats well.  Really pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Works great. It straights quickly. Much better than my last iron</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried at a great price. My hair has a strange wave and is very thick. Smooths my hair nicely and quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my wife. She loves it, and work perfect. She would buy another product from this seller</li>
    <li> This iron did NOT pass smoothly over my hair. I had a Sultra that I loved, this is no where near the quality my Sultra was. Returned the item. Fulfillment of the order and return went fine. Thanks anyway.</li>
    <li> Originally wanted a Chi. This works just as well at a much better price!</li>
    <li> The worst product I have ever bought!!  I have brought 2 in the last year and they both had some kind of electrical problem will never buy another one!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Nice straightener, It&#x27;s pretty much as i expected.  Happy with the purchase, use it daily.</li>
    <li> I am IN LOVE with this hair straightener!  I ordered it and it showed up the very next day! I use to not straighten my hair every day because it took too long to get it done. (I have very long hair) But, since getting this straightener I have done my hair every day! It doesnt take long at all, and it&#x27;s just like I got it done in a salon!! BEST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product as stated. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The flat iron is effective for 2.5 years only. I purchased my first HSI flat iron in July 2011. Hopefully, I can get more use out of the improved version.</li>
    <li> I found this very hard to use--it does not go through my hair smoothly the way most reviews said.  I will put this in the closet and go back to my old one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many ceramic curlers, and this is my final stop. I have fine thin hair, these curlers help my hair feel silky, smooth....love it.</li>
    <li> It is Christmas  gift.  I will  respond  in time.</li>
    <li> I literally had stopped straightening my hair several years ago because I could not find a great flat iron for my mixed textured hair. As a naturalista my hair has proven to be more fine than thick and finding a flat iron that did not make my hair look crispy was hard to find... until I just took a chance with the HSI ceramic ionic flat iron. OMGosh! It is amazing. It has temp control so I do not have to settle with 400+ degrees on my hair and it glides so smoothly without tugging on my strands. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and it hasn&#x27;t dissapointed yet. DEFINTELY A GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this straightener, my hair gets tangled really easily, and falls a lot, I never straighten my hair because nothing really works my just gets frizzy but this straightener including with the oil left my hair looking real healthy and still!! and my hair didn&#x27;t get tangle after i straighten it but also it didn&#x27;t pull my hair and I love that..</li>
    <li> Luv my hot iron am looking great again</li>
    <li> The service was terrific - as far as the product itself goes - I bought it as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  No input on how it works.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> I have only had this straightener for about 2 months and it has already quit working. I decided to purchase it after reading tons of great reviews on it. I don&#x27;t know if I received a different straightener than all of these people or what happened, but this is the worst straightener I have ever purchased. It was not smooth on my hair, it pulled, and never took the frizz out. Spend a little more money and get an actual professional straightener.</li>
    <li> Great in all aspects it pulls my hair sometimes. But that probably cause I&#x27;m doing something wrong. Lol. But I like it so far</li>
    <li> Very good iron at an excellent price! Very similar to chi.</li>
    <li> Love this flatiron! Gets extremely hot very quickly, and can be used to straighten or curl my hair. I love the hair oil it came with, too.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the oil that comes with it.  My curls are tighter and last longer.  I love the glove that they send with it.  It was money well spent.  I have brought too many flat irons and I believe I have FINALLY found the right one for me.  They even give you a free 1 year warranty with it if you register your product.  You have the opportunity to buy an extended warranty also even though I did not.  The price is unbeatable compared to so many others that are well over $100 or more.  I&#x27;m In love with this one.</li>
    <li> I was initially looking for a chi flat-iron to replace my broken chi flat iron when I came across this flat iron.  After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The iron comes with a heat resistant glove to protect your hand, a cover and a sample of argan oil.  There is a light indicator that lets you know when the iron is hot and it takes about 20-30 seconds to heat.  I like that the cord is a swivel cord because it eases tension when you are working different sections of your hair (my chi had a short in the power cord). The only drawback was that the iron does not have a digital dial (it&#x27;s a knob and the only temp indicator is  140 on one end and 410 on the other end) so you have to guesstimate the proper heating for your hair.  I started at the middle and worked my way up.  The price is a fraction of the chi flat iron and the quality is just as good.  I have very thick coarse hair and after using the iron, my hair is shiny and bouncy.  The iron has rounded edges which makes it easier to curl the hair around the iron (hope that makes sense). The iron glides smoothly down the hair strand with no tugs at my hair.  I also love the sample of the argan oil and will be buying more.  I rated the product four stars because of the dial, but I am very pleased and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener after purchasing a conair and having it quit working after a couple of months.  I like that this straightener is round, I will look for this when purchasing my replacement.  I have thin fairly straight hair and even on high this straightener doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of straightening.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot which is odd because I normally feel that straighteners get too hot for my hair.  Also, this does not have auto shut off.  I would have never purchased had I known that.  Also the plug in is huge.  It is like a hair dryer so I have to use a separate plug in.  It is a pain.  Not worth it even for the price.  I will be finding a replacement asap.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It gets the job done, and done well.  It&#x27;s a tiny bit heavier than others but it feels solid and well built.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for this specific item for Christmas, and loves it.</li>
    <li> After almost 2 years I still love it.</li>
    <li> Love this hair iron straightener.  Easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> It works as promised! It heats up fast, no snagging. You will not be dissapointed if you buy this flat iron!  02/09/16 Update : I have been using this flat iron since Dec 2014 regularly.  It came with argan oil... I never used it. I JUST used it a few days ago with the flat iron. The flat iron was great without the argan oil, but it works even better with it! I&#x27;m very happy that I made the decision  (based off of reviews) to purchase this flat iron. It is very cost effective but works like it is very expensive. I recently noticed that HSI Professional has hair products, I will be purchasing those. (They have great reviews as well).</li>
    <li> better than what i had before.&lt;br /&gt;positives:&lt;br /&gt;It works. I have wavy hair and it straightens ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here and there still some hair stay wavy. I used it on damp and dry hair both. I applied argan oil provided.&lt;br /&gt;It takes about a minute for green light to appear. It needs three or four times to pass through my hair to work.&lt;br /&gt;The back of ceramic area is so hot when you touch. They have provided the gloves but I didn&#x27;t think it will be this hot to be forced to use the gloves each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend based on the price and performance.</li>
    <li> My daughter is beyond thrilled with this flat iron.  She is mixed with super thick curly hair and this flat iron does a great job.  Not sure if it really is a $150 flat iron that I only paid $40 for or not, but still well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Very satisfied.  Good value</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for xmas....she tried it the same day...apparently I didn&#x27;t know she wanted it a certain heat. .it only gets to 410 degrees she likes 450..which I had no clue about because I&#x27;m a guy...but she said it makes her hair soft and it&#x27;s good enough to get the job done..just takes a little longer then what she&#x27;s use to.</li>
    <li> The very best!  It absolutely is life changing for my hair.  This flat iron surpasses any other that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife she has VERY  curled hair.  Think rosanne rosanne-a-dana.  And this thin straightens her hair FLAT.  AND QUICKLY.  this is salon quality. Cheaper and better than competition. Read:chi.  I&#x27;m very impressed and it&#x27;s lasted years</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter, she said she wanted or need more heat to straighten her hair.  Her hair texture is very curly.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!!!!  Now I can throw my other &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; irons out!  Works great, makes my hair look silky unlike others that leave my hair feeling and looking like straw.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Heats up fast. Great quality. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loved it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this item!! She can straighten her hair in half the time it use to take her. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> Give a pretty natural curl on my hair. Not really try the straight part yet~ but love it~</li>
    <li> The product works well, as described and I&#x27;m very happy with the results in the one week I have received and used it.</li>
    <li> MeT all my expectations</li>
    <li> Exactly what was described. Works great and it takes me less time to do my hair. Quick delivery time.</li>
    <li> I have soft hair. This flat iron is the best and it helps me keep my curls all day.</li>
    <li> It is a great straightener for the money. It is just very fragile. After only using it twice I dropped knocked it off my bathroom counter. It feel onto my ceramic tile floor....totally my fault... and one ceramic plate broke. I&#x27;ve had many different flat irons over the years, and knocked them all on the floor. This was the first one that has been so fragile. Although knocking it off the counter was totally my fault, I believe this should be better made and be able to withstand such a fall (as my other flat irons were).</li>
    <li> Great Deal! I like how iron works. Not in love but good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 20 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.  She said it works great and she likes the glove and oil that came with it.  This professional product is very superior to flatirons she has bought in the past.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this straightener and the oil!  I have tried many and this one straightens well and it lasts for days!</li>
    <li> Returned it today via UPS. It didnt work.</li>
    <li> I returned this flat iron. I loved the size of it but did not like where the on/off temp buttons were at on it. It also pulled my hair. Returned it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product as a Christmas present for my daughter. Shipping was extremely fast and package arrived in perfect condition.  My daughter loves it and it is so much better than the one she was using. She highly recommends this straightener.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to love this flat iron- but it&#x27;s not a Chi...It&#x27;s not even a HerStyler. Honestly, it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my hair and get it to a smooth, shiny finish. I&#x27;ve used a lot of straighteners in my life- some expensive, and some inexpensive. This flat iron is well made, and probably would work for some who straighten on low heat. My hair isn&#x27;t overly thick or coarse by any means, but this straightener just isn&#x27;t hot enough to smooth out my hair. Immediately after straightening, it looks pretty decent and within an hour, my hair is fuzzy. This never happened with other straighteners so I have to believe it&#x27;s just not hot enough. Not sure if I got a defective model, or if this is a common thing...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron!  Works beautifully and does not leave my hair full of static.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough, not even close to 410 degrees! Also pulls on my hair, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas, her old $20 unit worked better than this one. Returned and getting a different one.</li>
    <li> The packaging was very nice and the case it came with is great. As for the straightner,  it pulls my hair. I&#x27;ve tried turning the heat up/down, more hair, less hair and nothing has helped. Although,it does leave my hair shinney but I will probably return due to the pulling out my hair. :(</li>
    <li> I did not know I needed this but always had a problem with the hair on the left side of my face kinking and not hanging right while trying  to grow out my hair.  A friend recommended your product to me and now everything is under control! Thanks</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I was hesitant on the great price but couldn&#x27;t bear to buy something this cheap at a store and didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for a chi.  The argon oil sample was a plus too!  Needless to say I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my flat iron. Love the adjustable heat option!</li>
    <li> Great straightener!!! Leaves hair silky smooth!</li>
    <li> This Iron is not that bad but is definitely not really good it pulls on my hair! I hate that and I wouldn&#x27;t  recommend this Iron</li>
    <li> For the price it is a good buy. I like that the temperature can be adjusted and it has a sleeve to store it in.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem as solid as the CHI, bit given the much higher price of a CHI that&#x27;s understandable. I have been happy with it so far and it works well. (I have short  choppy hair with long bangs).</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She can straighten or make loose, beachy waves with it. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smooth and shiney - no fly aways at all.</li>
    <li> Love my HSI straightener!</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying this product. I had a really expensive straightener before and I needed to replace it. I didn&#x27;t thing that a product that was 80% less expensive could be as good. I was wrong. I love it and it works great.</li>
    <li> Great value for its price.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price.. This is my second time buying this product..</li>
    <li> My wife liked it so much. Bty the way, this is the second one we bought as the first one was gifted.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Been using this for over a year now and I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetogist and love this iron. Heavy duty, controls on the inside - gets super hot.  Great buy</li>
    <li> The package came well packed, My wifw seems to like the iron very much.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron.  Straightens my daughters hair quickly and beautifully, leaving her hair very shinny.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron we have purchased. It glides thru my daughter&#x27;s hair with no snags or crimping. Heats up quickly and does the job well. We highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great!  My wife is enjoying the results and the ease of use.  Turned out to be a great Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Heats up fast, has heat control and because the base turns it can also curl your hair!</li>
    <li> Traveling to another country?  You will need this or one like it with dual voltage.  I am addicted to straightening my hair, and looked a very long time for a straightener to take on my trip to Ireland.  You will still need the correct plug for wherever you are visiting, but you won&#x27;t need a converter for this one (which is great if you&#x27;re worried about it shorting out).  It&#x27;s not as good as a Chi, but it worked just fine for me and I used it on a daily basis.  It&#x27;s fairly cheap, which is also nice.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, was in excellent condition and exceeded expectations as a product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Prompt service and product is as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to the higher end flat irons.  Thought I would try this one since it had good reviews, but I am disappointed in the results it produces.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.  I like being able to control the temperature of the iron.  I also like the glove to protect my fingers!  However, you do need to remember to turn the iron off and on manually.  It does not shut off on its own.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!! This is my first time to use a flat iron and I am really impressed. I have natural curly and frizzy hair and after using HSI, my hair is straight, smooth and also it shines! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It works, but doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because you have to use a strong clench to guide it through your hair.  I don&#x27;t have strong hands.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase the cheaper flat irons at Walmart. This HSI has my hair looking straight from the salon!</li>
    <li> Useless also believe in everyone&#x27;s choice should be good</li>
    <li> Given the price and good reviews, I had slightly high expectations when I ordered this HSI Professional Ceramic Flat Iron.  After a couple months of use now, I can honestly say I would never purchase this item again.  I use to have a &#x27;drugstore&#x27; brand flat iron that worked better and got hotter than this one, for half the cost. This iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I need it to and it also takes longer than expected to heat up. The iron does a decent job at straightening, but it leaves my hair feeling dry and dull instead of smooth and shiny. The iron also doesn&#x27;t work for doing anything other than straightening as I&#x27;ve discovered after using it to try and create some soft curls or wave, and it failed every time. This might be a good flat iron for someone who wants to work with low heat but, otherwise, save your money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product by two day shipping.  The first time that I turned it on it worked.  Then it would not turn on at all and is broken.</li>
    <li> Love the hair treatment that goes with the flat iron. My hair looks and feels like it does when I leave the salon. In love with this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what they said it was very very nice and he came to my house in such a short time very satisfied five stars.</li>
    <li> I was happy with a product!</li>
    <li> Works great at home, and internationally.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good value!</li>
    <li> It is an exceptional straightener, our old one took forever and we really felt like we were damaging our hair but this one works so well and it heats up really quickly and the plates are so smooth.</li>
    <li> The product was very much what I need I am very thankful for finding it on your site.</li>
    <li> Not a good flat iron, don&#x27;t waste your money. It takes many passes to straighten hair, even at the highest setting. It is not smooth, hair will catch at times. No auto shut off.&lt;br /&gt;Just got a Paul Mitchell express ion smooth plus, it is the best, flat ironed my hair in no time. Plus it has a 1 hour auto shut off.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great straightener for the price, it made my hair super soft and silky. My hair tends to get really tangled and messy and doesn&#x27;t after I use this straightener on it. It didn&#x27;t very long for it to arrive</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally frizzy. After using this product if was silky smoothe and lasted the whole day! I love it and will recom it!</li>
    <li> Seriously a fabulous flat iron! I use it to curl my new short bob haircut and have gotten so many compliments. Nice smooth finish, takes maybe ten minutes to have a fab look. Was shipped to me super fast as promised and the price is great! I highly recommend! Buy it...you wont be sorry!</li>
    <li> This straightener really is amazing quality for the price. Yeah the dial heat control over having a digital one can be a bummer and there&#x27;s no auto shut off, but this thing works perfectly. It heats up quickly, stays nice and hot, doesn&#x27;t tug at your hair, and is still going strong after having had it for some time. HSI does also make a version that has a digital heat control if that&#x27;s important to you. If you&#x27;re on a budget (or even if you&#x27;re not), this is honestly one of the best hair straighteners I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife for xmas and she absolutely loves this flat iron .Its light weight and the swivel cord is a big plus. Great price also,looks like a high end model</li>
    <li> Brought this as a gift for someone and she loves it. I was so impressed with how well it presses kinkier hair textures that I&#x27;m thinking of getting one for when I occasionally straighten my hear.</li>
    <li> Daughter absolutely love these, she asked for a Chi after reading reviews on this one and price I gave this one a try, and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> So the flat iron works fine - but I was surprised about how thin it was which means it takes a long time to do my hair.  I had been using another model that was wider and it went much quicker.  I suppose if you are used to the think ones, it won&#x27;t be a surprise for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in their product description they said you would get a free sample of their straightening oil - I did not receive any oil.</li>
    <li> This straightener works really great.&lt;br /&gt;It works great. It&#x27;s good. It is nice. It is good. Good for your hail</li>
    <li> Very good straightener for a great price. I got it for my daughter and she loves how well it works for her.</li>
    <li> Whenever a stylist straightens my hair, it always looks a hundred times better than when I do it at home. Their recommendations to even the playing field were to firstly blow dry my hair with a bristle brush (flat, not circular), and get a better straightener, because the one I had was ten years old. Because of this straightener, I can almost match what a stylist does at home without the $200 salon straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was extremely quick, and packaging was secure.</li>
    <li> I gave my daughter one 2 yrs ago &amp; it&#x27;s great, so when my chi died I ordered my own.</li>
    <li> It really works!!!!&lt;br /&gt;So happy that I purchased this flat iron.&#x27;s I am so in love with this product. It works wonders on hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift. no complaints.</li>
    <li> It exceeded my expectations! This flat iron works miracles for thick African-American hair &amp; it gives your hair body for days !</li>
    <li> Pros: Fantastic straightener. Doesn&#x27;t snag on hair, heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t leave &#x27;dents&#x27; in your hair, works well and fast. Also my hair stays straight ALL day, unlike my old one. It works well to curl you hair too, if you intend to use it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The actual straightener gets kind of hot, but not unmanageable or unsafe for your hands. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair crazy shiny, but gives it a somewhat noticeable sheen (for the money you are saving, you can buy other products for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this product again and recommend it to friends. Also FYI the bag is just for travel its not heatproof or anything like that.</li>
    <li> This straightener along with the argan oil is the absolute best. I had a $100+ straightener before and it pulled my hair and left my ends feeling fried all of the time.  This straightener makes my very thick and curly hair feel smooth and silky and STAYS straight. It also feels like it is improving my overall hair health and I am SO happy I made this leap to something new!</li>
    <li> I have type 4a hair that has not been chemically altered and got this as a trial run to see if the reviews were really real and yes they were! I use grape seed oil and tresseme heat protection and whenever I do press my hair (once a month) it lasts for 4 to 6 days without needing a touch up to  and people can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t perm my  hair it gets so straight! Heats up in record time, like within 40 seconds,g gets extremely hot so be careful. The oil that comes with it is pretty darn good but I been using grape seed oiand um kinda hooked. All my sisters are going to get one thanks to the results they see.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews, so wanted to try it.  I used it on my hair and my sisters hair and didn&#x27;t see all rave about it.  Not sure what other people see in this product...my old flat iron works better than this.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and she loves it.  I was not to sure of purchasing it online, but she tells me it&#x27;s great!  Impressed!</li>
    <li> Received it with no problems</li>
    <li> Broke after 2 months! Just stopped turning on. I am very sad to learn I cannot exchange this for a new one. I liked it but it just stopped working so now I need to buy another.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast. My hair is frizzy and curly and this iron works wonderfully and takes me less than 10 minutes! It&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
    <li> Love this straightner!! I lost my last one and needed one ASAP. Read the great reviews on this so I didn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase. It heats up quick and makes hair silk smooth! Even comes with a glove so I can use it to put waves it curls in my hair. So happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product. I had compared prices in local stores and found this flat iron to be less costly than most. It is sturdy with a nice long cord and easily adjustable temperature setting. It&#x27;s perfect when you want some style and sleekness but not a lot of curl. The Argon Oil was a nice added touch. I would recommend this flat iron, and the carrying case is great too.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly--indicator light goes from red to green so you know it&#x27;s up to temperature.  Heat control dial and on/off switch on the inside of the unit, so no chance of bumping or accidentally adjusting temperature with your hand.  Quality construction.  Plates glide smoothly on hair to give desired results.  Nice storage bag, glove, and hair oil included as well.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this hair straightener.  Takes me maybe 3 minutes to straighten my hair and I just got a bad perm.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife for Christmas- She loves it- So, I do too. I am purchasing one for my mom this week.</li>
    <li> Got delivery even quicker that the estimated date. I got these flat irons because it was the only one that can use 110/240 I have only used one so far in my country where the current is 110 it does  a good enough job on my hair but expected it to be a bit hotter. Can&#x27;t tell the temperature as there are no increment marks. I hope it works just as well when i travel to Australia early next year with it. The 2nd. iron is a gift for my daughter who lives in Australia</li>
    <li> I ordered my HSI flat iron not too long ago. The one I received was defective. I finally found time to actually email Blue Novelties regarding it. The light would not stay on it kept blinking off/on and when I move the wire it would turn on only to turn off again. Needless to say the customer service at Blue Novelties responded back promptly and I received the new/used HSI flat iron the next few days. I am happy with my new flat iron. Kudos guys.</li>
    <li> Love this straightner!</li>
    <li> Better than a chi or anything else on the market.the price makes it better.I&#x27;m a natural aa with thick curly hair n it gives me that relaxer straight.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!  It&#x27;s better then the ones in the salons.</li>
    <li> Works great!  It&#x27;s nice to have different temperature levels and straightens without scorching my hair.</li>
    <li> Like every other review on here this straightener is a miracle. It is so good and straighten so well and also can curl! I&#x27;ve had Chi straighteners and I&#x27;ve had Bio silk straighteners. And those were all $100 and up. The straightener is the best straight nerd ever used and it is far less cheaper. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and you had no problems with it. Awesome. Seriously. Awesome</li>
    <li> This flat iron met all my expectations. I appreciate the adjustable heat dial and it leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a couple of times since I received it, but it is alot better than the one I had before. My hair has a natural wave to it and is hard to straighten. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love,love,love it. Works great!!</li>
    <li> Not very good. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Not smooth when going over hair.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. I bought this around Christmas time last year and it still works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this flat iron for her birthday.  I decided to also to buy one for myself.  My daughter has long thick hair and I have short senior hair. We have both been please with the results of our hair after using the HSI Professional flat iron.  The HSI Professional 1 flat iron is definitely worth the price it compares with much higher priced flat irons on the market. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> After being disappointed by my other flat irons over the years I decided to finally try this one after reading about it being one of the best and very affordable. I am biracial (Black and latina). I relax my curly hair every two months. I also do lots of cardio so tons of sweat. My old flat irons would straighten my hair but as soon as I would walk outside my hair would revert back to being frizzy and then I would have to flat iron again. With this flat iron my hair STAYS STRAIGHT the whole day. There is no need for me to flat iron again, unless i go to the gym. My hair looks amazing! I can&#x27;t find any frizz anywhere and I&#x27;ve been outside and everything. I highly recommend this product. The only problem that I have with this flat iron is the fact that it has a on/off switch that you have to move. I prefer the kind that has the automatic shut off just in case you forget it&#x27;s on. Thankfully I always remember to turn it off but it would be nice to have a automatic shut off feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because all of the amazing reviews. I had a chi and I regret not buying a chi again. My hair isn&#x27;t smooth,or less frizzy and the worst part of it is the HEAT WONT STAY THE SAME TEMP. That is the most annoying part of this product. I don&#x27;t have time for it to reheat every time I do a section of hair. It takes forever to heat up in the first place and then waiting for it to reheat is not worth my time or money. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it the price is amazing the iron works great the pouch was super cool. The glove. But the only thing i didn&#x27;t like it&#x27;s that the argan oil is not a travel size is a sample.</li>
    <li> I find this flat iron difficult to use.  The swivel cord that attaches to the iron is heavy and directs the appliance to tilt and fall over when setting it down.  For this reason,  I find this product cumbersome to use.  I was attracted to it because of the price but, that being said, I would now pay considerably more for another product that is lighter, easier to control, and tnot at the mercy of the swivel cord.</li>
    <li> The flat iron didn&#x27;t live up to reviews we read, it worked okay as a touch up to ends. My daughter hair is natural/product free which leaves her roots thick/course the flat iron isn&#x27;t made for that type of job..  My hair is a soft fine/curly and it leaves waves at the roots. Not to happy with it over all!</li>
    <li> Bought as a trip only straightener for an Italian vacation. Like it so much the original is now back in the drawer and this one is now the primary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was incredibly fast. One day.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this straightener to replace one that I had used for years.  I was hesitant because it wasn&#x27;t the brand that I normally use.  It had come up as a deal of the day so I checked it out.  The price was amazing so I decided I would try it.  It arrived quickly, and with a sample of the HSI argon oil.  It has a temperature control which is great for different types of hair. It works quickly and leaves my hair very smooth and soft!  I would definitely do business with this seller again!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair feels great! This product has a professional quality and works great. I love the shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this worked really well! I used this when traveling abroad across multiple countries in Europe. It worked great with a voltage adapter.</li>
    <li> After having a 2\\&quot; CHI for a few years (which I loved) it stopped working and I got this one right away just because of the number of good reviews (and great price). Did not disappoint, works perfectly and I like it even better than the 2\\&quot; one, since it is also the perfect size for waves. If I could add something it would be some type of indicator when it reaches the desired temperature. It takes a little longer to heat up than my CHI, but nothing significant. Definitely a great buy!   11/21/14 Update: Had to add that I was wrong, it does indicate when it reaches the temperature, I hadn&#x27;t realized at first, but the light goes from red to green when its ready to use. Have been using it for weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a flat iron hair straightener it works very well.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I bought a chi but that was fake although claimed to be real. Returned it n luckily while searching found the reviews here. Thought of giving it a try although no straightener works on my hair. This one was magical.  Never had such silky hair in my life. I could have paid 100 $ for this product happily. N shipping too was super fast. Amazed.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron for a GREAT price!  Would buy again when the opportunity arises.  Thank you for the great offer!</li>
    <li> LOVE these flat irons, the best I ever had</li>
    <li> Fast heat up, easy to handle, good temperature choices. So much better than my big box store purchase. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I like the look and it works  great I would  recommend  this flat iron and great price  on Amazon so get it u will be satisfied</li>
    <li> I was happy with this product when I first received it, but then within 2-3 weeks, it stopped working. When I plug it in, the red &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; button pops out and won&#x27;t stay in if I try to push it. I tried it in multiple outlets around my home, and none of them worked.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, gives it bounce and curl and a little shine.  Well worth the price - I imagine I&#x27;ll have this thing for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Worked like a wonder on my first try :)  Heats up super fast, worked exactly like I expected! Great deal for a fantastic flat iron!</li>
    <li> I used HSI Professional 1 Ceramic&lt;br /&gt;tournaline Ionic Flat iron once.  So far I like it. It glides smoothly on the hair.  I am looking forward to using it on a regular basis. I am giving a 4 star rating because I have not been able to use it much.</li>
    <li> it is not heavy duty at all.  I have had T3&#x27;s and babyliss, this one said it was a good option if you&#x27;ve had the better ones and ....well...it&#x27;s not.  not that it doesn&#x27;t straighten but feels flimsy and the sample of argan is only a little envelope, a one time use whereas the listing and the box claim it is a small bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a really great hair straightener.  It will straighten or curl, both with ease.  The end result is always sleek and shiny.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I have very curly kinky hair and for the price of this iron I was very hesitant in buying this but let me tell you this thing really works ! My hair was straight in an hour (Usual time it takes to straighten my hair is 2-3 hours) It wasn&#x27;t stiff like other irons leave my hair and you can barely even see my split ends with the sample oil it came with loooovveee this lol</li>
    <li> Bought for step-daughter in school - great price and so far she really likes it!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Getting used to the fact that it is a bit bulkier feeling than my last one and I wish it had a two prong electrical cord.  Can&#x27;t complain too much because it gets the job done and cost me half as much as my last one!</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love the size of this iron. I have a larger one, but finally got the hair style I wanted that I couldn&#x27;t get with the blow dryer or the wide iron. Seems well made, fits in my hand, great idea for the the swivel cord.</li>
    <li> It works great for me--exactly as advertised! I like that it came with a sample of leave-in-hair treatment, it&#x27;s always fun to try to new products.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works pretty well but not what I was hoping for in a ceramic, tourmaline iron.  I decided to return it and elected to purchase the more expensive HSI 1-1/4&amp;#34; Salon Model and I am thrilled with my decision.  This new iron is FABULOUS!!  My hair is silky and shiny with not one split end showing.  It literally heats up in under 30 seconds.  I am SO pleased.  Look at it this way ... it&#x27;s an investment.  If you divide the price over a year, for just a little more than $1/day you&#x27;ll look and feel beautiful and isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re all striving for?  I promise you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the Salon Model - it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> For my daughter she loves it</li>
    <li> Love this product, especially the accompanying argan oil!</li>
    <li> did not like it at all, I had a chi and this one is far from chi quality, i am getting another chi, this is not smooth when goes thru hair, feels like i am pulling my hair out.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best straightening iron I&#x27;ve owned-- and I&#x27;ve owned several, including the CHI that everyone raves about. The HSI flat iron is by far the best. The plates give off the perfect amount of heat for the least amount of damage, and I&#x27;ve noticed a marked increase in the moisture that&#x27;s left in my hair after I use the iron. Totally recommend, and especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Dont really have anything negative to add. I was hesitant to buy with the price so low.  My daughter is biracial and has enough hair for 3 people..it straightened it pretty fast...and it stayed straight for a good week.  Very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Flat Irons I have ever purchased. Does not dry my hair out or make it frizzy. Very easy to use and light weight. This product diffidently met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice and love the results. Even recommended it to a relative who said she will definitely be purchasing one.</li>
    <li> Although I bought this for my daughter, I may have to buy myself one as well.  I rarely straighten my hair because I am mixed and it is so curly that it takes forever to flat iron.  I have an Instyler, but even that takes forever.  Well, I have made a new best friend in this flat iron!  It straightens my hair quickly and easily, and my hair is shiny and beautiful when I use it! I love it, and the price makes me love it even more.  My daughter wanted a Chi for her birthday, but after reading the reviews for this product, I decided to go with it figuring it would be worth it to try because of the great price.  My daughter loved it and is happy that I didn&#x27;t go with the Chi.  My advice is to get this flat iron before the price goes up!  It is worth well over what it costs!</li>
    <li> This flat iron was just what I was looking for. It is light weight, easy to use, and does a fantastic job. It straightens and smooths without drying out hair.</li>
    <li> Originally thought this was a fantastic iron but I have sense retracted the statement. My natural hair texture of 3C/4A is relaxer free. I normally per-stretch my hair my blow drying and then pressing with a hot comb before any flat ironing can begin. Although this is a really good iron that is much thinner than my previous, it can not hold a candle to it. The HSI iron didn&#x27;t keep my hair from reverting for as long as i was hoping. My old iron gave me results that lasted 3-7 days depending on care where as by day 3 after solely using the HSI my hair looked like a pure mess. I was expecting more given the highly rated iron.  In my photos the top left and bottom were photos I took when I used my old iron by Gold-N-Hot, the top right hand photo is after using my HSI iron. Bottom left hand photo was hair going on a week since it&#x27;s last pressing. I wasn&#x27;t able to get that far along with my press after using my HSI. It may be a good iron but it doesn&#x27;t work well enough for me to continue to use when ever I decide to press my natural hair again.  Edit: I have noted that is model is old, very old in fact. If your on HSI Professional&#x27;s website, you&#x27;ll see that the iron has been updated and can go up to 450 degrees and has an LCD temperature screen.  The current model can be found here http://www.hsiprofessional.com/collections/frontpage/products/1-digital-flat-iron-worldwide-edition for much more than what this model is being sold for. This iron works yes, but not as well as it&#x27;s more current sister. Ladies beware of what your buying, this is a very old model and older items don&#x27;t always work as well as current items.  Edit December 27,2015 This iron works poorly! I hate it. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it claims. I was wondering why this iron always left my hair frizzy as hell and not as smooth as I&#x27;d like and recently invested as to why. I pressed my hair today and did a temperature comparison to my gold-n-hot brand iron. In short, gold-n-hot is far hotter than this waste of money. It does work but it doesn&#x27;t get any where near as hot as I need for my hair to lay flat.</li>
    <li> I love my HSI flat iron! It heats up in seconds and is easy to use. It leaves my hair smooth and soft. I would highly recommend it! I have no complaints. Great customer service as well.</li>
    <li> works so good!! better than a chi! would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love everything except it pulls my hair as i straighten!</li>
    <li> This product arrived very fast. It came with a really cool case and a glove to prevent burning. In the past, it had taken me hours and hours to straighten my hair, with this HSI it only took 40 mins....which seems long, but my hair is VERY VERY long and very curly. I would recommend this product immensely!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on my super curly hair!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! My husband is a hair&lt;br /&gt;Stylist and he has worked with a variety of flat irons, this one being the best so far. I&#x27;ve had my hair flat ironed&lt;br /&gt;Many times before and I have never been so pleased with the results like I am now&lt;br /&gt;Using this brand. It&#x27;s great, it leaves my hair shiny, soft, and healthy believe it&lt;br /&gt;Or not. I Highly recommend it to anyone who&lt;br /&gt;Likes keeping their hair straight while having it&lt;br /&gt;Healthy when left with its natural wave .</li>
    <li> Better than chi!  I bought this flat iron a year ago and was very impressed with its performance and quality.  However I have always wanted to try a chi since it had such a great reputation.  So finally this year I decided to spend the money and invest in one.  Was I disappointed!  It seemed more cheaply made than the hsi, it didn&#x27;t get as hot, and it didn&#x27;t curl my hair as well as the hsi!  The only advantage of the chi over the hsi was it did glide more smoothly over my hair.  Needless to say I took the chi back and am still using the hsi I purchased last year.  It is still going strong.  So any of you who think price guarantees quality think again.  Sometimes you do get much more than you pay for and the hsi flat iron is proof of that!</li>
    <li> Very good hair straightener. The cost was also a plus since these can sometimes run in the hundreds of dollars. Really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this HSI 1\\&quot; Ceramic Hair Straightener for my granddaughter for Christmas.  It has really turned out to be her \\&quot;most favorite thing\\&quot; when she wants a different look, such as long straight hair, instead of her normal very curly hair.  It was a worth it, and now there aren&#x27;t any more complaints.  She threw the other relic in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is my first (and hopefully last) salon quality straightener.  I have straightened my hair since I was in my pre-teens, and could only afford the cheapy ones that didn&#x27;t do a very good job.  After awhile I gave up on straightening my hair because of it fried my hair, and the cheapy straightners didn&#x27;t even make it look that good.  After getting my hair highlighted and my stylist straightening my hair before I left, I was determined to find a salon quality straightner without paying a salon price.  I found this and TAH DAH!!! It has met or exceeded all of my expectations.  The first time I straightened my hair, my husband couldn&#x27;t stop complimenting me on how good it looked (he had never complimented my hair when it was straight previously).  HSI, thanks for giving me a little more self-confidence! : )</li>
    <li> Great product and great first hair straightener I actually bought myself.  No more hand-me-downs from my sister.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Best straighter keeps my hair straight all day!</li>
    <li> Wonderful seller! A real wow on service, delivery and follow up. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron, one of my daughters who is hip and cool said, anyone who&#x27;s anyone, knows this is the best flat iron and Mom, look at the price! I am so very happy with this product and seller, buy one, no two and have one handy for a last minute gift!</li>
    <li> I have normal, slightly wavy hair. I started straightening my hair with a wet-to-straight hand-me-down straightener, and it fried my hair even if I only used it once a month.  I thought all straighteners were like this; it made my hair coarse and icky, and my hair wouldn&#x27;t even stay straight for an hour.  I gave up on straightening, until my boyfriend insisted and offered to pay for a new one.  I started doing some research, and even though in all my searching I never heard of HSI, it had all the good qualities that I had heard people rave about, and the reviews were great, so I tried it.  It works FANTASTICALLY.  It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, it straightens without being at the max heat, my hair will STAY straight, and it actually leaves my hair SHINY.  I don&#x27;t know how it makes it shiny, but it does; I can even make crazy amazing, beautiful CURLS with it.  I seriously love this straightener.  It was the best decision I could have made, and it wasn&#x27;t insanely expensive. I would absolutely recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> This exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron based on good reviews, but found that it is not better than the Sedu I already own.  I leave it at this office for emergencies, but use the Sedu as my primary iron.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this falt iron !!! At first I felt the iron itself was a little heavy, but after a couple of uses I became accustom to it, works great. love the glove that comes with it and the argan oil is awesome. My hair feels great. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of flat irons on my hair and this one was even better than my Chi.  Love the adjustable temp and swivel cord and so far it hasn&#x27;t shorted out like my Chi eventually did.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my purchase. Great price and came quickly, super excited about that.. Used it a few times and it works awesome!</li>
    <li> With 3 females in the house we have many different tools that are used for hair design.  I bought this item at a very good price so everyone would have their own, no fighting.  that was a mistake as I shoulda bought 3 of these.  this one blows the others away.  this straightener seems to just do a better job thatn all the others.  your hair feels softer, smoother, less dry and brittle.  it doesnt seem to damage my hair like many of the others seem to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.  Only drawback we have seen is it isn&#x27;t in a 3 pack and it does seem to take a minute or 2 to warm up in comparison to other models(brands) we have.  but worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teen daughter and she LOVES it!! Thanks.</li>
    <li> This things are perfect for someone trying to go natural.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Tourmaline iron without knowing much about the product. It turned out to be one of my best buys. It works and looks great. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my find.</li>
    <li> Really like this flat iron.  Great for curling and very easy to hold. Haven&#x27;t burned myself once and I don&#x27;t use the glove.</li>
    <li> Great straightener... Using it for travel on 220v..keeps my hair feeling soft n silky straight.. Curls nicely too..no cons yet..:)</li>
    <li> With all the 5 star reviews I was pretty much set up for perfection.  I was especially looking for a flat iron that did NOT catch any hair in the sides!  Well, I&#x27;ve pulled plenty of hair out with this one, unfortunately.  The Chis have a wrap-around \\&quot;hot plate\\&quot;, and this one stops short at the sides, so perhaps this is the biggest reason why my daughter NEVER gets her hair stuck and pulled out with her Chi (I just didn&#x27;t want the higher price tag).  I find that combing my hair out to complete silkiness BEFORE using the flat iron helps it not get stuck in the sides quite so much.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice flat iron.  Nothing unusual or special, but it gets the job done, which is the point!  Next time, however, I believe I&#x27;ll bite the bullet and buy a Chi.</li>
    <li> After my cheap flat iron burned out I decided to buy a better quality one that would actually last. The reviews on the HSI professional flat iron were all in all very positive so I purchased it. It arrived quickly (thankfully since I need to flat iron my hair daily) and the packaging was intact. The iron itself came in a red drawstring bag for traveling and it came with a little jar of Argan Oil. I&#x27;ve never used it before but I have read how wonderful it is for dry and fly away hair. I use a dime sized amount in my long hair before I use the iron. It heats up quickly and has a thermostat you can dial up or down depending on hair type. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It does it&#x27;s job but it&#x27;s not super amazing or anything. I like the way that it feels in my hand. It closes nicely and heats up pretty fast</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flat iron. It arrived promptly, carefully packaged, and with the Argain Oil as promised. The straightener heats up very quickly and stays hot as you style your hair. This flat iron is ideal for both straightening and curling, even for those of us who have shorter hair. Similar products sold here on Amazon and elsewhere cost more and are not as highly rated.</li>
    <li> This is a first straighter that actually worked on my hair!!  I am East Indian with curly frizzy hair and have used many different flat irons but had to use  products to straighten my hair to look pretty.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 or more so I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!!  It is easy to use, comes with various heat level settings and a glove to protect your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks great after every use - straight without any products added.  I can even add waves by turning it during straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for every person that has thick, wavy or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this flat iron. It makes my hair shiny, straight and healthy looking. People always ask if I just got a blowout from the hair salon and I love telling them no. I&#x27;m a black woman and I haven&#x27;t relaxed my hair in almost 2 years and this flat iron really helps keep my hair smooth. I love the adjustable temperature, the heat glove and the argan oil. Definitely use the oil!!! Especially if you have dry hair like myself. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t order the iron directly from their website because the iron is like $110 maybe more. I found it on here for $39.99 with FREE shipping and it came with the glove and sample size argan oil. Also when you reorder the oil, a 4oz bottle is like $30. I used a coupon for 60% off (ARGANO60) so I bought 3 more only because of that coupon. Saved like $50 with it. You can buy different size oils but the best value was the 4oz with 60% off. Won&#x27;t be using any other iron!!!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. Bought it to use while we traveled to the UK and Italy, and it worked totally fine! Very powerful, and straightens my hair beautifully! I bought it to use only when I was abroad, but now I use it as my main straightener! Highly suggest!</li>
    <li> Works great. Wish it had a light on it to tell you if it was on or off. :)</li>
    <li> As a novice flat iron user, I found this very easy to use and I am very happy with the product.  I haven&#x27;t yet encountered any problems to complain about.  It heats up quickly, so is ready to use quickly.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, damaged, and biracial hair. I applied some of the argan oil from the tiny bottle that was included inside, on my hair. After straightening part by part, my hair felt smooth...it didn&#x27;t feel that different from my -Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener- so.. I can&#x27;t say I was super impressed. And after I got done straightening my hair, it ended up \\&quot;poofing\\&quot; out and felt dry..EVEN after I applied more of the oil to it. I would NOT recommend this to a friend and believe it&#x27;s a waste of the $60 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> It is hard to believe this flat iron is such a great price.  It heats fast, stays hot, and leaves my hair soft and straight.  I have thick, coarse, and unruly hair.  My hair has met its match!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is even more amazing is fact that at this price you also get a pouch to put it in while it&#x27;s still hot and you need to pack up.  This is a fantastic flat iron at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!!  It heats up fast, leaves my hair feeling smooth and has an extra long cord.  The shipping was very fast and the argain oil is amazing!</li>
    <li> Great product for an even better price. Works quite well as a straightener and produces amazing curls as the sides of the flat iron are rounded.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice starter to the more high end irons. It is ceramic and all that. I mean it&#x27;s a reasonably priced high end iron. It does snag the hair thought and that sucks. And the Argan oil they sent me spilled in the box all over my cute little pouch for the iron. I like it, and it&#x27;s held up well. It worked great when I did my BKT. It does make me want to by a CHI or FHI now to see how much greater it can get!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I love it so much!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener ! I prefer this over ANY thing. Including the chi. It makes my hair feel amazing &amp; I have long &amp; thick hair &amp; it works perfect. One word for this : Amazing.</li>
    <li> Nice product for my daughter&#x27;s hair. Straightens her hair as well as more expensive products. Saved $$ and paid about half the price for this product that seems well put together and works as well as the more pricey units.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have very wavy hair and I use this product for the first time it made my hair super straight. When I added the Aragon oil it gave it a great shine. Love this product:)</li>
    <li> Very good , I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and cNt beat the price.  It leaves your hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have owned.  Heats up quick, and works on my wavy hair like a professional iron.  It was shipped very fast, and customer service was wonderful.  Five stars!!</li>
    <li> Perfect product it&#x27;s everything previous reviews stated and more, very happy!</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter, she LOVES it!</li>
    <li> Very nice straightener that comes with a sleeve, hand glove, and straightening oil. Awesome value! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a high-quality straightener.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have thick course hair and it takes several times through to flatten it. I have not had to use the glove, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get that hot that I would use it. Once my hair is flat, it looks great! I thought it was going to be more professional grade...it does the job though.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment]] I researched for a while and decided on this product because of all the wonderful reviews. Now I know why there were so many. This is a great hair straightener, I have never been very handy when it comes to fixing my hair, but I wanted the same results as my hair dresser &amp; I got that THE FIRST Time I used this tool. I like it so much I bought two - one for my suitcase as I travel a lot on business. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> My wife love it...She think its better than CHI that she have for 2 years..She likes it coz theres heat adjustment..&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product..</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It the 3rd brand of flat iron that I have purchased and by far the best.  I have thicker hair and this straightens my hair with less effort than my previous flat irons, which means less damage to my hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Some times It&#x27;s just hard to find the right flat iron for my wavy hair.  The flat iron I&#x27;ve previously used was perfect and last 7years. But the plastic around the ceramic plate stared to crack.  So I decided to purchase a new one. I&#x27;ve compared lots of products, read the reviews and decided to get this HSI 1\\&quot; ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron . I really happy about the product.  It straighten my hair perfectly.  I would recommend this product to everyone who has wavy or curly hair</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! It heats up really quickly. I like that the plastic around the handle is thicker so I don&#x27;t feel the heat on my hand. I have really thick long hair and it takes me almost no time to stranighten my hair. I only have to go over a section once. Also comes with a handy travel bag and a heat glove.</li>
    <li> I love this hsi flat iron. And for the price it is even better! I have used a Chi for the past few years but I love the end product of this a lot.  Its a more silky and shiny. I have purchased 3 now as gifts and everyone loves it! My Chi was twice the price and has held up well despite the poor reviews. But I will def be purchasing a 4th for myself soon instead of using my moms part time!!</li>
    <li> It is very good hair straightener and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. I thought I would try something new since it had great reviews. No- it would turn on but not heat up. It would flash green that it was ready but the plates were barely warm. Guess I&#x27;ll stick to sedu</li>
    <li> This iron works well. I like the dial control. The argan oil leaves my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> My Chi died on me suddenly after only a year and approximately 10 uses.  So disappointing!  I saw this straightener had good reviews on Amazon so I decided to give it a try.  I have straight, fine hair and use this flat iron to curl it.  Heats up quickly and I love that there are different settings so I don&#x27;t fry my hair!  I am so happy I went with this instead of purchasing another Chi.</li>
    <li> Works great!  For the price it&#x27;s a great flat iron, and I love that it came with an Argon oil to use.</li>
    <li> Great product, my girl friend loved it</li>
    <li> Immediate delivery!  Great product.  Love the case and the glove.  It heats up really fast and works great!  I have thick curly/coarse hair and this flat iron worked better than others I&#x27;ve bought that cost 3-4 times more.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> The HSI flatiron is a good product.  Have only used a few times but it has met my expectations.  The one thing I really love is that the controls are inside and not outside on the grip which is what I had on my old one.  I have not used it enough to give it 5 stars but I would recommend it based on my experience so far.  The packaging is lovely and I do like the glove that comes with it.  I think every flatiron should come with a glove!</li>
    <li> Really good product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after my chi (which I loved for the 3 years I had it) stopped working properly. I thought I would give this one a try since it was so much more affordable and had great reviews. So far, I am very satisfied and think it works every bit as well as my $120 chi did.</li>
    <li> Works great,not the best but pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair, so it is most affective if I use a lot of product along with the flat iron.</li>
    <li> it took me a couple of months to fins the right setting for my hair. But it is a great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my kinky curly hair look professionally straightened.</li>
    <li> Great choice of flat iron if your looking to get a super straight hair look would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I normally buy the higher end flat irons but do to the reviews other customers had left I decided to try this one when my Chi flat iron died!  It works great and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Totally stinks and I missed the return window by 5 days.  I hate it. House is this professional. Doesnt get hot enough, you have to use very narrow strands of hair. must only be good on short hair. hate it</li>
    <li> A bit heavy, but its because its a better quality iron.  Used it all over Europe and works like a charm.  Good heat setting, not too hot, but enough to style hair without damaging.</li>
    <li> I love this except for the fact that the spring squeaks every single time I open and close the iron.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s a little background info, I have had a CHI hair straightener for about 8 years. It has worked fool proof with no problems for a long time. Rewind to last week, one of the plates dangles off and just falls with the supporting pieces behind it. I go onto Amazon to find another Chi and find this HSI instead. It is 1/3 of the price and the reviews seem to be good. I have been using it for about three weeks now and I really really like it! It is a little bit heavier than the CHI but the quality is there and the plates heat up quick and the final product is fabulous! Happy that I gave this HSI a try!!</li>
    <li> The straightener gets hot very fast and does a great job at straightening my hair. I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair too many times too (I usually do all my hair and not in layers).</li>
    <li> love the product! thank you!</li>
    <li> Straightens my natural curly 4b/4c hair very well with some heat protecting spray. Still be careful not to use too often because it will cause heat damage. I normally just use it on my &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was dual voltage and I had a business trip to Singapore.  No problems at all and it straightens great.  It also heats up really quickly.  I have curly hair, but straighten daily.</li>
    <li> Wow wow wow. This is such a powerful yet gentle flat iron. I used to use the chi but did not want to shell out 80-100.00 for a flat iron. I took a chance on this unit instead n honestly I like this unit over the chi. N at half the price!!!! Winning!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron!</li>
    <li> Great iron, Great price, highly recommended;)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good flat iron that I could take to Europe. I read lots of reviews and was impressed with what I read about this flat iron. I wondered if this $30. flat iron could really be as good as my $100 Chi. It is. It also has a temperature control, which the Chi does not have, and it automatically changes to accomodate the electrical current for the US and Europe.  I read reviewers say this flat iron is now their preferred every day flat iron. It is for me. I love it.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, it&#x27;s nice and comes with everything that&#x27;s mentioned, just not totally in love with it</li>
    <li> It did not heat up and  kept shutting off</li>
    <li> I have had my flat iron for over 4 years and I love it but I&#x27;m wondering has anybody had the problem of the ceramic plates falling out. At first it was just one but now they are both falling out. I was just wondering if anybody has had this problem. I take very good care of my flat iron it might be one of the most important things in life to me lol because I&#x27;m always playing with my hair ever since I was little girl.</li>
    <li> I love it is was perfect for my type of hair, i used on about 390F</li>
    <li> I purchased as gift for my daughter. she loves it.</li>
    <li> I never ordered this!!i</li>
    <li> Works great for straightening, curling.  Nice and hot, and a long cord!</li>
    <li> Really great straightener that also is great at curling. The only reason I gave it five stars is because my husband has had to fix the part that plugs into the outlet twice.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is magic. My hair is coarse and kinky. This flat iron makes it as smooth as glass! The price was fantastic too.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Its great! I looked around and searched alot (for two weeks) until I fell in love with this one! I definatky recommend it!</li>
    <li> It has been a good flat iron so far. I don&#x27;t use it too much because I have straight hair already, but when I use it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent and affordable !!!  Fast delivery. Works better then those expensive ones. Totally recommend it</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery and perfect packaging. Met all expectations!</li>
    <li> Purchased for travel to Poland. Works great with an adapter.</li>
    <li> Good product. Leaves my curly hair smooth without damaging it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love it</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough.  Pulls hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I love it!!!! Far exceeds my expectations!!!</li>
    <li> This product is really great! Works well, came in a nice package with protective case and glove, and is sleek for easy storage. Very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Great price and fast service!!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and This product is Very good👍.</li>
    <li> Returned it, it felt like the irons weren&#x27;t in alignment and I have thick hair, so that is a requirement.</li>
    <li> Great item that really does the job. I&#x27;ve only used it once but if it could straighten my very thick, frizzy hair it should work on anyone.</li>
    <li> Love love love it it&#x27;s amazing great with my hair I love it</li>
    <li> Very nice.  I don&#x27;t use daily but it suits my needs for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Came quick , but i must say its not the best flat iron , has nothing to do with seller i just don&#x27;t favor this flat iron</li>
    <li> Got on time. Haven&#x27;t used yet. Really like the exterior. Gets up to 410 degrees. Comes with a one year warranty which I&#x27;m excited about. Maybe 3 months. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll have to look at my paper work</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because I traveled to the UK and needed a dual voltage iron.  It worked so well on the trip that it has now become my go-to iron back here in the US.  I appreciate that it has an on-off button and adjustable temperatures.  And the ceramic plates feel great on my hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is working really well...heats up fast and does a great job! Love the thick bag it comes with (makes packing it very easy).</li>
    <li> Love this. I bought it primarily to curl my hair and it works so well! It works well to straighten, also. It used to take me about 5-10 minutes longer with my old straightener and that is a lot in the life of a busy mom!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of all the great reviews. I just ordered a Paul Mitchell flat iron for 125.00, because this one is not cutting it! Don&#x27;t waste your money just go ahead a purchase a good one. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have thick coarse hair and this flat iron works great on my hair. Other irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to really do the job but this one can handle it.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I needed to replace my GHD flat iron and decided to look at other brands. I read all the wonderful reviews and decided to purchase this one, and wow, I was blown away with this flat iron. Glad I didn&#x27;t go spend over $200 on another GHD!</li>
    <li> I am a huge Amazon fan ... I do read several reviews prior to any purchase I make!  Most reviews were positive .. There was 1 that said the flat iron did not get hot....that when the company was notified ... She received a new one ...well, I also received a defective flat iron !! It does not heat up well &amp; causes hair breakage ..I did notify the company when a received an email asking me for my review .. Unfortunately, I was never contacted by them!&lt;br /&gt;It was an inexpensive flat iron ... Unfortunately, you get what u pay for ... I am disappointed in the product!</li>
    <li> I love this Flat iron</li>
    <li> I am very thrilled with my decision to purchase this flatiron.  The positive reviews swayed me, and now I&#x27;m happy to recommend it to others. I especially love the temperature control, and the way the iron glides down my hair. it&#x27;s very gentle on my hair, unlike others I&#x27;ve used in the past that pull and snag. I definitely encourage others to try it!</li>
    <li> Nothing to brag on but the price here. Just your avg. ceramic curling iron</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Chi user for 10 years, but I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Bought Nov 2014 and would not work Feb 2015.  The warranty says it will cost me $19.95 shipping to fix or replace it.  Not worth another  almost $20.00 to send it back and wait.  I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great quality. Gifted it to my sister in India as it was dual voltage and works absolutely great.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! The additional oil is wonderful and leaves hair soft and silky. I may never relax my hair again.</li>
    <li> great straightener and great customer service!</li>
    <li> Great price and a stellar flat iron. Identical to one my husband got for me 8 yrs ago that I adored!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She is really happy with it and said that she will recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> The flat iron works very well and the price was great.  I needed it for a trip to Europe and arrived sooner than I thought, so glad!</li>
    <li> Works well, heats up quickly, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better straightener</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works great!! It leaves my hair soft and smooth with out burning it!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and loved the argan oil that was included.</li>
    <li> Good product, great shipping time!</li>
    <li> I love it. Great value; great product! would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This iron quickly reaches temperature.  The adjustable knob allowed me to practice to find the right temperature for my hair type. The argan oil is a nice bonus.  After using it and seeing the results, I ordered more.</li>
    <li> really goood one. my hair look really better. But at d same time i got lot of dandruf . i think irrespective of any hair styler that is same commom problem. for 39 bucks really worth deal .</li>
    <li> Heats fast, attractive thick carry case. I look forward to using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. It works great! Gets hot quickly and straightens my hair quickly-- don&#x27;t have to hold it in place for very long at all.</li>
    <li> Works as well as hair straighteners that cost 2 or 3 times as much.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with how quickly my order was filled.  I used a Crock Flattening Iron for years and absolutely LOVED it but when I traveled to Europe and used a plug converter it zapped the controls sadly and my iron died.  My Crock although awesome was very costly so I really was upset about having to replace it.  I saw so many reviews on this HSI and the cost was really very reasonable so I thought what the heck!  I would have to say that I still love my crock more but the HSI straightens my hair effectively and quickly.  What I liked more about my crock was that it seemed to glide through my hair a bit more smoothly and it had an automatic shut off for when I walked away from it and forgot about it.  As a new mom of twins this was really important to me since I forget things unfortunately pretty regularly.  I am pleased with the product though and don&#x27;t feel the need to invest in another expensive Crock Iron since the HSI does the job nicely and for a much more reasonable price.  I just need to make sure to make a concerted effort to turn it off.</li>
    <li> I love how it glides through my hair. Very good quality. Just like the expensive Salon Flat Irons.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Thanks  a lot Love It!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Leaves my hair shiny and straight with no frizz. Heats up fast. Was sad when my old straightner broke and they didn&#x27;t carry that brand anymore but couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this product</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I can also use it to curl my hair. I want to order more of the oil that came with it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It works better than her friends iron and hers cost a lot more. Great product for the cost.</li>
    <li> Love the product and excellent service</li>
    <li> It will do what it was made to do. It will also fry your hair in no time flat. I just had to cut 4 inches off. DO NOT buy this flat iron if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> When I straighten my hair with the HSI, it only stays straight for a few hours.  The reviews compared it to a chi, but I was disappointed.  When I straightened my hair with a Chi, it lasted for days.</li>
    <li> I am very happy! I have long and thick hair, and this flat iron works GREAT! My team at work noticed the difference when I came the next day with my hair all straightened! I will recommend this 100%.</li>
    <li> This straightener is incredible!. It does not damage my hair and leaves it so much smoother than my previous straighteners, and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Very pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great! The price was awesome for this level of product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition. The iron is very easy to use. It does everything it claims to do. My hair shines after using it. I can totally straighten, flip, and even curl with this. It is easy to hold on to and I have yet to burn myself with it, as I have done with other irons. Any time before when the slightest humidity occurs, my hair would start to frizz. After using this iron I have very little problem with humidity now and it lasts through the day. Very pleased and very pleased with how inexpensive it was.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised and I am please with my purchase.  The item was delivered timely and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Works like it should.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my granddaughter who has very curly hair.  She loves it!  My daughter is on her second one after having had one for some years.</li>
    <li> This flatiron is as good as irons that cost much more.It&#x27;s a great buy for a top of the line iron.</li>
    <li> Product came in fast and everything that is stated was with.  Absolutely love how the straightener and oil make my hair feel! I color my hair often so I need something to help protect my hair and the oil helps with the humidity of the beach. Thank you again!</li>
    <li> The flat iron is as advertised. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try 220 volts yet.</li>
    <li> This Flat iron is just great!</li>
    <li> Works great. Love all the extras it comes with! The satin case is very nice. The iron is very solid and does not look or feel cheap like my old one did. An excellent buy! Great price on amazon!</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping. The flat iron was everything it promised!</li>
    <li> Great Product NO complaint!</li>
    <li> Really does great job to maintain hair in flat design</li>
    <li> Wish it had an auto shut off otherwise great flat iron</li>
    <li> Great price for a ceramic hair iron. Previously I have had a GHD, which I personally think was better than this iron but is much more expensive. This is a great iron for the price! :)</li>
    <li> My daughters will be back from camp in a couple of weeks.  I assume that they will love this product.&lt;br /&gt;will write as soon as they open the box.  5 stars for hope.</li>
    <li> Good quality and reasonable price. Heat up really fast. Good protection from burning skin while also being able to reach the hair close to the skin. Great packing. Love the travel size Argan oil!</li>
    <li> I bought this for international travel.  I just got back from a trip to China where I was able to straighten my hair, even during the rainy season.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not dual voltage as it claims. I need to be able to use it in Asia so this is no use to me. Will return it. Please update the product title to reflect the true voltage specification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it looks decent.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron with temperature control. Came in the mail quickly.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointing when my other flat iron was discontinued, I tried three flat irons before receiving this one and was disappointed with all. I was a little optimistic when I placed my order but I quickly became a fan. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will definitely recommend it to others! THANK YOU</li>
    <li> It gets the job done !</li>
    <li> I have only been using this straightener for a week, but so far I am very pleased with it.  My hair is thick and wavy, but this straightener does the job.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> Great Price and Product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Awesome service! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it. My hair wouldn&#x27;t be straight without it. If you&#x27;re replacing your chi, this is awesome.</li>
    <li> Overall, the flat iron is good. I&#x27;m able to either straighten or curl my hair (which is thick, medium to long length).  My only dislike is the weight of the flat iron and the size of the plates. Bc the plates are a little smaller, I have to flat iron smaller sections at a time. However, the actual performance is good. When I take my time, my hair comes out just as I want it.</li>
    <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t go as smoothly through the hair like a chi does.</li>
    <li> unfortunately this was sent back right away, very cheaply made, I was very disappointed because of all the good reviews. it was not a smooth glide at all, thankfully the company was superb, credit was taken care of right away.</li>
    <li> I have been using the flat iron for a month now.  It does a great job, it gets hot enough for my type of hair.  My hair is medium to thick and mostly straight. It&#x27;s great for times I shower at night and wake up the next morning with bed head.  The oil leaves my hair smooth and shiny. The glove included is a plus. Overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excelent product for a very good price.</li>
    <li> great upgrade from what I had.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I was sad when my straightener died the other week, but this one arrived quickly and seems to be better than my last one. Two features I love are the LED indicator that lets you know when its hot and that the edges of this one are rounded, so if you want to curl the ends, it&#x27;s great. I ended up mistakenly buying a second one and I&#x27;m giving it to my sister since I&#x27;m impressed so far.</li>
    <li> Great straightener for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great service and great product.</li>
    <li> I like this product... it is very well made and gets the job done!!! They only dislike is that it kind of leaves my hair smelling burnt.....but that&#x27;s a straightening iron for you!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! Awesome product and even better price!</li>
    <li> Okay product.  Does the job, but kinda pricey and could have found one for less at target.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for my sister and she absoluty loves it! What a great deal!</li>
    <li> This flat iron din&#x27;t work on my thick hair. I had to use it on the highest heat setting, and it took me twice as long to do my hair as it normally takes me, and it&#x27;s still very frizzy... It also pulls my hair towards the end. It&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t return this item, as I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Product as I expected. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Very high quality with nice accessories you would not normally expect. Shipping was fast and the product was packed well. I have used it and all works well. I even love the box and will keep it to store in.</li>
    <li> One of the best flat irons I have ever used!  My hair is fine, wavy, and difficult to straighten.  I have spent hundreds on other flat irons that have worked okay but broken easily.  I thought I would give this HSI flat iron a try based on their good reviews and I am extremely impressed.  It was delivered when it was supposed to and has worked wonderfully so far.  The thermal glove, case, and argan oil was a great addition.</li>
    <li> A great product for the price!  The oil was a nice touch!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it worked for two months before it shorted out. It would turn on and off depending on the angle of the cord.  Do more searching, find something better.  Ultimately I had to return it, and was out the cost for shipping it back.</li>
    <li> My flat-iron is not getting hot. I am not able to use it. I may have to return it and get a new piece.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes on this model with soo many good reviews online.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best flat iron! I was using a Chi but every couple years I would have to replace it. I decided to try this one and will never go back to Chi. The HSI makes my hair feel softer and is easier to use. I can run it through each section just once which saves time. The customer service was great as well. I was sent a replacement when I let them know my iron did not heat properly on one side. They were very nice, sent a replacement and kept in touch. Everything about this purchase was 5 star!</li>
    <li> I love love love this straightener. I have very long naturally thick and curly hair. I can make it pin straight without blow drying it straight first. It is so shiny and manageable. I literally hadn&#x27;t straightened my hair in years because it was such a process and never would straighten all the way. This product makes my life so much easier. And for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Just ordered one for my sister.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, as it seemed to be a great value. Product arrived very quickly, as described, and I have been told it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but am extremely happy with it!  Good price also!</li>
    <li> I have never owned a flatiron, but read reviews for this one on your website.  It is easy to use (something I was worried about) and with reasonable care there is no danger of burning oneself.  I like the satin cover case and initially I used the glove too.  I am very happy with this product. JKM</li>
    <li> After having this for a month I am still LOVING this flat iron.  It is super hot and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, this is the perfect product your woman will love. My wifes broke and she was distraught about having to pay for another one because they are so expensive (my jaw dropped when i saw) I trusted the reviews on here and they were right. Great build quality and going strong after 2 years (because no complaints from my wife)</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this product. Doesn&#x27;t stay hot. You have to wait between hair strands for it to heat up.</li>
    <li> Quick Service and has worked great so far</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and the straightener straightens my hair with ease and fast.  Best straightener I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before, but my hair stylist uses one.  I went online to find the best and found this model.  I watched some videos on you tube on how to use this,  and I&#x27;ve gotten great results.</li>
    <li> Bought thus for my sister and she loves it.  Easy to use, smooth glide over hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works and is okay for the price, but there are a few things about it that bother me:&lt;br /&gt;1) My hair gets caught between the ceramic plate and the plastic frame.  It happens every time I use the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s not easy to read the temperature on the display screen, it&#x27;s at an awkward angle. It&#x27;s particularly hard to read if you&#x27;re in a room with natural light.&lt;br /&gt;3) The iron turns off or lowers in temperature while I am using the iron. But the flat iron always turns off, at least once, every time I straighten my hair. While I definitely appreciate the safety aspect, this feature is inconsistent. Sometimes it turns off all together, sometimes the temperature just starts to lower - and this happens after a different duration each time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this flat iron. I just got it today and as soon as I hopped out of the shower, I blow-dryed and put the argon oil that came with in my hair. Straightening was easy, and once I was finished, I was shocked at just how silky smooth my hair felt. The glove and pouch was a plus. Overall, I loved this flat iron and would buy it over and over again.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener for the price !</li>
    <li> This is the best money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time! Works fabulous and I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase! Thank you for making a steller product!</li>
    <li> My flat iron broke after 10 years.  Purchased this one to travel all over the world.  It works great.  Very happy with the Seller and Product.</li>
    <li> Sucked.  Bought this because all the rave reviews but purchased the HAI after trying this out for a couple months.  Hair does not glide easily through the blades.  Also hair gets stuck when trying to use it as a curling iron.  Hair did not feel soft and conditioned but rather dry, damaged, and frizzed....so unhappy I wasted money on this thing.</li>
    <li> I love it so far. Curls very nicely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the price</li>
    <li> I had given up on trying to look for a good flat iron that was not extremely pricey. I read the reviews and I am glad I bought my own HSI! My hair look great, takes half the time getting my hair done compared to the instyler and my hair looks even better! Great seller! I am very happy with my purchase  :)</li>
    <li> shipped someday as I order received before the date they gave me. looking forward to doing more business with them</li>
    <li> My daughter love&#x27;s it....said it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. The product arrived earlier than expected and works great.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever and the price cannot be beat!  Why women think they need a name brand flatiron for $150 to $200 is beyond me.  I have tried my daughter&#x27;s Chi and like this better.  Now she does too!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This product is as good as everyone says. I really did not believe a straightener that was so cheap could really work. It does. I have thin hair and even lost some hair from a medicine I was on, and so I keep this on a low temp., even still, it works well to straighten and curl. I am really happy with the product. Two things I wish it had, a real temp gauge, so I would know exactly the temp I am using and an automatic shut off, but ultimately.... it doesn&#x27;t matter. It is a great product, and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love my iron. I will definitely order again. Thank you so much for the wonderful service you provided.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!!!! My hair stayed straight and shiny even while sweating and getting generally grimy during a long day of traveling in this hot summer! It&#x27;s easy to use and straightening is quicker than with my last flat iron.</li>
    <li> I actually got this brand confused with another and accidentally bought this one. Think of it as a generic version. Its really a no-name brand sold here on Amazon, but for the price I was surprisingly pleased. I noticed the difference when I first started using it. My hair does feel different, its smoother and doesn&#x27;t feel as damaged. For my first ceramic straightener Im happy. Its good enough that I will wait until it breaks down to get a &#x27;higher end&#x27; one. It did come with a random HSI brand hair oil sample that was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I\\&quot;m a professional hair stylist,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The &#x27;HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron&#x27; is a high quality pro iron w/ a killer feel and great results !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;simply put, u will NOT find a better pro iron for the price ( $40.00 ) this thing list for 299.00....ppl buy it !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps&lt;br /&gt;my only regret is that i didnt buy 2</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought . . . the first one got caught up on my cupboard handle, and it dropped to the floor, completely cracking it apart :(  So, I knew I wanted another one just like it . . . it works for me!</li>
    <li> I ordered the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron after my previous (FHI) iron needed to be retired. I was considering re-buying the same item but the HSI iron was higher reviewed, reviewed by more people and at a cheaper price so I figured it was worth trying. So far I am glad that I did! I have only been using the product for a few weeks but it heats up quickly, has multiple temperature settings, and leaves my hair straight and soft! I am very happy I made the switch!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair straightener because I read that it&#x27;s so much better than a chi. And I&#x27;ve had a chi for 8 years. Well I do like this straightener but it makes my hair so staticy. My chi doesn&#x27;t do that. And it pulls at my hair. But other than that I like it..mostly because I can control the temperature on it.</li>
    <li> I have had at least 3 straighteners in the past and this one is by far my favorite. It heats up quickly and is very effective in getting rid of unmanagable hair. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have never needed to use a flat iron since I was born with naturally straight hair (which I never liked as a kid!) but since I have gotten older for some reason I now have \\&quot;bends\\&quot; as I call them and I have enough of them that I have to use a straightener (Bumble and Bumble Straight....love it!).  I always had to pay for \\&quot;bends\\&quot; or even curls but now I have what I always wanted as a kid.  My stylist has been using a flat iron on my hair and I love the way it looks!! So I bought this one after researching several irons and reading the reviews.  This one iron seemed to have the best reviews and the price was right!!  I have been using this for a week or so and I love it!  It gets nice and hot (I use a protectant on my hair....Aveda Brilliant Damage Control) and it straightens beautifully.  I have long hair and the plates are thin..1 inch... but do the job effortlessly. The price was great and the product is totally worth it. If you need a flat iron and not sure of which one.....THIS WORKS!</li>
    <li> This is a top of the line straightener at a fantastic low price. The seller was fast and efficient and did a great job to get the product to me quickly. It is definitely professional grade and the best straightener I have ever used. Fantastic product. Would recommend all to buy this. Phenomenal deal!</li>
    <li> I do love this! It has worked better than the straighteners I have bought that were 3 times the cost. It is sturdy and well made and is the only straightener I&#x27;ve ever used that has truly done away with the &amp;#34;frizzes&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great on curly hair</li>
    <li> I love the way this flatiron smoothes and straightens my hair. It heats up in no time. I also love the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the sides of the iron.</li>
    <li> This flat iron makes short work of my super long hair. It does a wonderful job straightening my hair in only one pass! I would recommend this awesome iron to anyone. It works just as good if not better than the high end variety. Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome hair straightener. Didn&#x27;t know what to expect, especially since I never heard of the brand. After reading reviews, I decided to try it out, especially since it was at such a reasonable price. After trying out for the first time, I was extremely pleased. The hair straightener heated up fairly quickly and retained its heat through majority of its time used. It did a wonderful job of straightening my hair...have no regrets of purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good hair straightener. Does what it is supposed to in an easy fashion. Warms up quite fast. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product due to my niece recommending me use a professional style flat iron instead of the cheaper brands I had been using resulting in frizzy unkept looking hair.  She indicated she had paid over $100 for a Chi Styler and how she has never regretted it.  I read the reviews on the HSI style and found most everyone to rate it above the Chi Styler and the price was fantastic.  After receiving the product, I was well pleased with the luxury packaging, the sturdiness of the styler and the temperature settings.  Was also impressed with the hair oil sample also enclosed.</li>
    <li> Excellent value--much nicer than the ,similarly priced iron I had previously.  Nice iron, variable temp settings, heats quickly, hair looks great!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works. It is true as other reviewers have said that the buttons are a little hard to get to, but they are on almost all straighteners. The shaft is a little shorter than I would have liked when I first pulled it out of the box and saw everything. You get a nice velvet bag to put it in and some gloves and oil for your hair. The oil is really nice. I put way too much on my hand and rubbed it into the ends my hair before bed and thought I would turn into a greasy mess by morning but I didn&#x27;t. Then I turned it on and started straightning my already straight hair and was impressed. Then my daughter came in who had gone to bed with a wet head and has natural curly-wavy hair that is hard to straighten with a blow dryer. We are not talking kinky curly but enough curl in the back to cause us frustration every time we straighten. I couldn&#x27;t believe this little straightener worked! She had totally straight hair and it didn&#x27;t take forever! I am very happy with my purchase and am floored this was only 40 dollars. Ya something that actually works and that I can afford.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly. This flat iron did an exceptional job of straightening my hair. It left it feeling silky and soft. Plus a bonus was to have a cover to store them in.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener after after sending back a brand new Chi because it didn&#x27;t heat well enough to do anything to my hair (and I have average thickness wavy hair). I love that this straightener has a varied heat setting so you can make it hotter or colder depending on YOUR hair. I also love that it heats fast and is easy to use. Would definitely buy again, even if this only lasts me 2 years!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after our new puppy chewed through the cord on her Farouk Chi. She was skeptical as we had never heard of the brand and the price seemed very low compared to other brands with the same features. After reading the reviews, we decided to give it a try. She absolutely loves it, it works better than her previous flat iron that cost twice as much. The iron gets to the desired temperature quickly. We have had it for almost two months now and she recommends it anytime anyone complements her on how beautiful her straight hair looks.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the straightener!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy, and hard to control hair. I am always looking for solutions and this happened to be one of them. I am happy with the product. It is built well and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> This straightener is perfect for thick wavy frizzy hair! I usually take about an hour to do my hair but this cut me down to half the time! SOO WORTH THE PURCHASE!I recieved it in the exact time expected!</li>
    <li> It is a great straightener, and I received it on time! They even sent me some Argan oil to use along with it! It is wonderful, and I am quite pleased!</li>
    <li> I ordered this having never heard of the brand. It got great reviews and the price was right, so I gave it a shot. It heats up well, but the indicator light doesn&#x27;t seem to work. The light went from red to green, back to red, and then turned off completely- all in my first use. I&#x27;m hoping this isn&#x27;t an indication of how the iron will work. It seems to work ok, I&#x27;m just a little nervous after the glitches. I also felt like the on/ off and heat buttons were in an awkward place.</li>
    <li> good straightener for the cost works decent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been spoiled with a ghd or chi straightener and currently overseas so needed to find a dial voltage and went with this one agree seeing the reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. I&#x27;m Asian with wavy hair and using this HSI, I ended up on the highest heat setting and it still takes a few run through my hair and it is still a bit coarse looking and not very straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*note, I am on an island right now, but using my old ghd via transformer, I had better results...straighter and smoother*</li>
    <li> The straightner is exactly as described.  I have owned many straightners over the years and this one is clearly the best.  Cuts down on the length of time that I spend doing my hair.  I don&#x27;t have any flyaways or burned hair.  I&#x27;m really glad I purchased this of the Chi because of its better price and quality and I have heard nothing but horror stories over the Chi ever since I purchased this.  Its just a great product.</li>
    <li> Wow! The HSi ceramic flatiron is the best flat iron I ever purchased. It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair out. When I am flat ironing my hair it doesn&#x27;t let off smoke. It glides along my hair smoothly and leaves my hair looking good. It heats up and cools down quickly. It only takes one time over your hair to straighten it. My hair is flowing and light. It&#x27;s healthy. Also make sure to get the HSi Argan oil that gives hair an extra shine.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a new straigtener, and afer reading all this good reviews I chose to buy this one. As hoped, service is good, shipment is fast and in top of all, my wife loved it. She liked the fact that this one is fast in getting hot and has tempreture adjustment option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this one for others...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> When I bought the hair straightener, to my daughter, she had nearly cried, she wanted as her friends bought, almost three times the price,&lt;br /&gt;But the first time I see such a huge amount of people who give good feedback to the product, I believed I buy Excellent product, and price insane,&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, after a while, her friends say that this product is much better than what they have, she is happy, I&#x27;m happy, all is well</li>
    <li> Ordered this straightener to have as an extra because of the great deal they were along them at. It works as great as the other reviews say. I love the carrying pouch and will use that this weekend when we travel. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great quality hair straightener. I personally would never pay full price but for under $40 it is a steal!</li>
    <li> Must say for the price put its a qood straightner ive only used it once so cant rate to much bht so far so good</li>
    <li> Works great! I am very happy with this straighter. Got it for a really good price too. I love how it came with a protective sleeve to put over it when you are traveling.</li>
    <li> Received my flat iron really quick. Works great! Pulls smooth through my hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for great price!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day, it does not damage my hair and works fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!! My man can&#x27;t stop touching my hair when they are so silky and soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on $200 irons when u can be as happy with this one!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener!!! It is easy to handle and works well. The price is fabulous and the product is professional!! So happy!!</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron and would recommend. It was a great value. Works great on thick frizzy hair. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I rarely use straightens since I have straigt hair to begin with. Didn&#x27;t want anything crazy expensive and works well.</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron.  I was able to straightened my hair quickly.  I like that it has a heat control button, easy to use, and the gloves are a plus.  It gets hot real quick.  I passed it through a small amount of hair and two passes was enough.  I also tried it with a bit of more hair it required more than two passes.  Overall, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> The Flat Iron was a gift for my daughter who did lots of homework before choosing this Flat Iron,when she got it on Christmas day she was very excited, in a nutshell that made my day,she uses it all the time,now were wondering how were going to get her out of the bathroom.... thanks for the awesome product and service.</li>
    <li> Happy i went with this brand! I just love it!!! It does it&#x27;s work, my hair looks Amazing.... So far I think this is the best flat iron I ever had, my 2 previous ones sucked! My sister just bought Chi flat iron, she hates it, and loves mine, So I&#x27;m very happy with it. And You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I promise you!:) Good price too, &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is the third one I bought!  Bought one for myself then for my two daughters!  We love it!!!  So much better than any other brand we have used --- and we have tried many higher priced ones!  This is the best!</li>
    <li> I found this HSI Flat Iron to be exactly what I was looking for.  It was important that it had an adjustable temp control and also have ceramic plates.  The price point fit in my budget and the iron came nicely packaged and ALSO with a padded satin-like storage bag.  I have fine hair and I use medium to medium high setting.  I mainly use the iron for smoothing my hair (I use a conditioning serum) and removing humidity frizz....works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and packed well.</li>
    <li> Hope not to speak too soon on satisfaction. Only had a couple wks now; so far it is a great professional iron. HUGE plus is how fast it arrived. Ordered on Fri&amp; it was here on Mon. That in itself is priceless. Works great. Having bought&amp;had to replace so many(2chi+2others) just in the past year that shorted out within months of purchase. (only time will tell.) I do recommend it. It performs every bit as well(if not better)than any popular brand name@ a near fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> this is amazing, i straightened my coarse dry hair and they came out to be PERFECT super straight hair.. i have tried paul mitchel, chi even herstyler, BUT this is by far the best..  its amazing im sold. i really recommend [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]this product to everybody..</li>
    <li> I purchased the Straightner because it had over 1200 reviews and all were great and a lot of people said they had thick hair and worked great for them. I have thick hair so figured it would work great for me. I was pretty Disapointed. I have always only used Paul Mitchell Straightners and the most recent one I have is a few years old so was purchasing this one as my main one but think I&#x27;ll just have as a back up. Value is great but just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Im sure it&#x27;s great for people with thin hair. I&#x27;ll keep device but use as back up. I really wanted to love it because of other reviews but just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> It does not heat up as you think didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> The straightener warms up fast, and glides smoothly over my hair. My chi stopped heating up properly after 2 years of use and as a college student I could not afford to buy another one. This HSI straightener is an awesome alternative.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this flat iron for my daughter.  She has very thick hair and it did a wonderful job.  Very sleek!  I&#x27;ve already purchased another one just for me!  Would definitely recommend this flat iron.  Also purchased at a great price, no shipping from Amazon</li>
    <li> I guess my hair is very dried, hard to use it to make it shine as I expected.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these for myself, when my coworkers saw what a great job this flatiron did for my hair (super soft and smooth) they had me order for them too. I have ordered 4 so far.</li>
    <li> I have owned a handful of great hair straighteners over the years and always I for quality because I have super thick hair and it isn&#x27;t easy to get it straight. I used this product for the first time yesterday and I was very pleased with the result. I only had to run it through my hair once to get the silky smooth straightness I wanted (this is a big deal, trust me!). I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high end hair straightener for a great price!</li>
    <li> Great product at a really great price. I will be ordering again. I have already advised friends and family where to shop :-)</li>
    <li> My go to straightener!! Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!!! As soon as I tried it, I loved it!! It doesn&#x27;t pull and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair</li>
    <li> Followed instructions by other users (even watched a youtube video) and got hair that was smooth and bouncy that lasted for 4 days (before I washed it). I do not know how long it will work this well but so far above satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be. I&#x27;m a former Chi user but I am extremely pleased with my HSI. The seller was extremely efficient, was delivered before I was expecting it which was great!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this flat iron. It is exactly as described by the seller. Hair feels like silk:)</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.  I purchased it after looking at all the reviews.  It heats up quickly, stays hot and does the job.  I brought it to work to finish my hair one day and the two girls I work with fell in love with it too.  I have fine strands but really thick hair.  One girl has thick, course, curly hair and the other has thick, fine hair as well.  It works on all of our hair.  I recommend it, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and straightens my wavy hair perfectly.  The packaging is very nice, with a silky red case and glove.  Comes with a sample of argon oil, which I love.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product!! Would definitely recommend this product to others!!!&lt;br /&gt;Mimigail</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!  My hair is so silky and shiny after I use it.  (which is almost everyday) it takes half the time to straighten my hair was my old straightener.  I love my HSI. flat iron!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron  Gets hot quick and works Great</li>
    <li> This produce was processed and shipped very quickly and packaged properly., It came with extras such as a flat iron case argan oil and a protective glove. The flat iron works great. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Received this for a birthday gift as I am trying to grow my hair out It heats up very quickly and only takes me a few minutes and my hair is done! I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time on getting ready in the morning as I have to be out the door by 530 so this a great product for me</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener, and when I received it, I tried it and was immediately impressed. Price was very good, for such a good product. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair, and even this made it pin straight and smooth. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> so far so good, really like it</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It works great.</li>
    <li> works great--love the price!</li>
    <li> I have thick, semi-curly hair that&#x27;s pretty unruly. I&#x27;ve used A LOT of straighteners over the years, and so far this is the best! It kept my hair straight all day (even with a little bit of rain off and on), and felt great. However, it really didn&#x27;t feel that hot, even at the max temp (410), it took me less time to straighten it than usual, but I still found myself having to re-straighten some of the thicker layers a bunch of times. It also heats up extremely quickly (huge time saver) and I got it for an awesome price (39.99 + free shipping) which was great, so overall I definitely recommend this product! My hair is just hard to tame, so I&#x27;m sure anyone with a little bit thinner hair than me will have a great experience.</li>
    <li> I received this earlier than it said when ordered. So shipping was fast. Everything was packaged nicely and in good condition. Using it works!! I love this flat iron and dont regret this purchase at all. Its easy to use.</li>
    <li> After my old flat iron broke, I decided to buy this based on the fact that it was highly rated by over 1400 people. I have to say it does it&#x27;s job, but not as well as I would have hoped for 40 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The temperature dial is very badly placed, making it hard to adjust the temperature. It was also loose and wobbly when turning it. Because of this I think the flat iron couldn&#x27;t hold a steady temperature. I noticed the light on the bottom kept turning red to reheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The plates meet at the tip, but separate towards the handle. This is common in a lot of flat irons, but I was hoping for 40 bucks this one would be better. I also noticed the plates don&#x27;t match up, (the top doesn&#x27;t align with the bottom plate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The ceramic plates have a nice finish on them, it&#x27;s smooth to the touch, but I found them to be the worse thing about the flat iron. When I pulled it over my hair it wasn&#x27;t smooth. It didn&#x27;t rip out my hair, it was just... sticky feeling.. or gritty. It wouldn&#x27;t glide over smoothly and this sometimes caused those horrible lines in my hair after straightening. I wasn&#x27;t pushing down too hard or anything.. just normal to light pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This is just a preference on my part, but I found it to be pretty heavy and bulky. I would rather have a flat iron on the lighter side. I will say it was a bit harder to curl my hair with this item since the end of it was bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great and works well. Though my Argan oil was broken and leaked all over. It did not damage the unit and I was able to wash the carrying case so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. I have had many before but this one is particularly good for the money. It has a very heavy construction and allows you to press the plates together completely which helps with the straightening process. It also gets very hot which is necessary for course hair like mine. Overall a great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I use a straightener daily mostly for curling under my hair. My hair is naturally thin and straight and I don&#x27;t like using curling irons because they can sometimes crease your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was just what I was looking for. My hair, though straight, has a difficult time holding a curl especially if I decide to flip my hair out. With this iron, I can change the heat settings appropriately to ensure the curl will be held. Since the iron is ceramic there is even heat distribution and the overall final hair style looks clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I do not like about the product is that the on/off switch and heat dial are on the inside next to the ceramic plates. It is sometimes awkward to turn the device on and off, but I guess it could be nice that you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off mid-use. That is really the only thing that I don&#x27;t care for about the product, which is essentially minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how this product would work on different hair textures and thicknesses, but from other reviews I read on here a lot of other customers seemed equally as pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I truly love this flat iron!! I&#x27;m a black woman with relaxed hair and this flat iron completely straightens my new growth and helps me extend the time before my next trip to the salon. It also makes my hair feel extremely soft and silky. Like I said this flat iron is a box full of AWESOMENESS and completely worth the money spent!!</li>
    <li> I like this straightener a lot.  Works well, doesn&#x27;t have any edges to snag hair like some do.  I love the glove that comes with it, really helps me to get through the straightening without burning my hands.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Let me just start off by saying that I am black with coiled hair. I&#x27;ve only ever gotten my hair done at the salon, but now that I am a college student, I&#x27;ve had to cut back. Well I first got the Remington purple ceramic flat iron, but it left my hair a bit poofy and the plates were only ceramic coats. So I tried my roommate&#x27;s hsi tourmaline straightener. My hair came out great! It looked just like the salon finish that i&#x27;m used to! However I used heat protectant on my hair while blow drying it. But besides that, it came out amazing, the ionic ceramic plates keep your hair smooth and shiny and it gives you that bounce that we all love! I just bought my own right now and it will be here in 2 days! I&#x27;m so excited to do my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this item and love it.  It works so well and just glides off my hair without damaging it.  Would recommend it to anyone who wants straight hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great - a lot of the reviews suggested that there are knockoffs out there, but I don&#x27;t believe this one is! It&#x27;s heavy duty, and came in great packaging, etc. I have SUPER thick and wavy hair. It does a great job in one pass! Couldn&#x27;t beat this for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener just a few days ago, and I was so excited to get it and use it for the first time! Shipping was really quick and I was pleasantly surprised that I got my item a day before the estimated date. So finally, I ripped open my package and pulled out my straightener, and it was defective. Everything looked ok and it may have even worked alright, but it has a loose part that was rattling underneath the barrel when I took it out. Who knows what exactly was making that noise, but I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be the best product if something on the inside was broken. I immediately got on amazon to fill out an exchange form so I could return the broken straightener for a new one when I realized that I could only get a refund because it wasn&#x27;t sold by amazon but just fulfilled by amazon. So now I have to return the item, wait for it to process, get my refund, then order and new one, and then hopefully the next one won&#x27;t be defective. :( and I was so excited.....</li>
    <li> There is nothing spectacular about this flat iron. I have owned much cheaper flat irons that produced the exact same result. I now plan on purchasing a CHI rather than continuing to waste my money on products that simply don&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> From the reviews I read I thought it would be better than my chi, but it isn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it&#x27;s heavier. I miss my chi!!!</li>
    <li> absolutely love it..best straighter i ever had.i would recommended this product to woman every where don&#x27;t hesitate buy 1 today</li>
    <li> Trying a new straightener is pretty scary for me. I have naturally very curly hair that is almost impossible to tame. Since it is winter and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the humidity, it was time to invest in a new straightener. I saw the crazy number of great reviews, I gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;My mom actually said to me \\&quot;how did you get your hair so straight??\\&quot; I knew then that I made the right choice. I was prepared to pay $150, but received the same quality for a student&#x27;s budget.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect purchase!</li>
    <li> This product worked great.  Easy to hold and easy to use.  The glove that comes with it helps so you do not burn your hand.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but so far so good! Just hope it doesn&#x27;t start giving split ends. Those suck! Wahoo</li>
    <li> I had never heard of HSI, but I&#x27;m glad I came across this product! This straightener is inexpensive and works much better than any I&#x27;ve had before.  It heats up quickly and leaves my hair silky, smooth, and straight without snagging or pulling my hair. It even smoothes out my frizzy split ends! Great product!!</li>
    <li> Nice straightener, heats quickly. But doesn&#x27;t glide over hair, you kind of have to pull it. Switched from a chi &amp; not sure I will keep it</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better!  I tried it for the price and was thrilled to see it was a good deal and good quality.</li>
    <li> I used to have a much bigger flat iron, which was hard to use.  This one is a nice, smaller size and lets me get closer to the roots.  I like that they include the glove.  I never would have thought of using a glove, but it&#x27;s great to have some protection from the heat, especially when I&#x27;m doing the back.</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener. I have thick curly hair and this straightened it with ease. It does not pull on the hair like some straighteners do and the traveling case, oil, and glove that came with the straightener are all really nice to have as well. Excellent product for an excellent price!</li>
    <li> So far so good! The iron heats really fast and left my hair completely straight with long duration!</li>
    <li> It takes a higher setting than I would normally use to smooth my thin head of hair, and the hair does not remain smooth.</li>
    <li> We purchased this to replace a Chi which had recently failed.  My wife was skeptical about purchasing this one due to the price, but it had great reviews, so I convinced her to try it with the promise I&#x27;d buy her a new Chi if this one didn&#x27;t perform.  I didn&#x27;t have to buy the Chi.  :)</li>
    <li> Love it!! A must buy!!</li>
    <li> Looks good, but hair doesn&#x27;t run through smoothly like high end irons.  You can hear your hair making a squeaking noise as you straighten.  And there are plastic pieces holding the corners of the plates down, and hair gets caught on them and pulls.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good iron.  I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the product. It has been a few months. It works well and I have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this Flat iron. Definitely a great price too. I would surely purchase again if I need too.</li>
    <li> I would have given a 5 star review if the iron had an automatic shut off.  It heats up quickly, has a long chord, and all in all is a very nice iron.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love the easy swivel cord.</li>
    <li> Love love love! Its by far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of straighteners in the past.  I thought I would give this one a try because it got so many great reviews.  When I first plugged it in the digital temperature display started showing how hot it was getting.  It climbed to 450 pretty quick.  I have thick hair and always use the hottest setting.  Once it got to 450 I started using it.  It didn&#x27;t seem as hot as my previous Bio Ionic which only goes to 400 degrees.  When I set it down to separate more hair I noticed the temp display said 404 meaning it had cooled down.  So I had to wait for it to heat up again.  It only took me 7-8 minutes with my previous iron to do my hair, this one took twice as long and didn&#x27;t seem as hot. I will be returning it and going back to my old faithful brands. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> I had no reason to get a new straightener as my old one still worked, but it was a 2&amp;#34; thick one, and I have cut my hair short (shoulder length) and I found it was a little too wide for my new hair cut, so I wanted to get a 1&amp;#34; as well.  This had great reviews so I went for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know where I am coming from... my old one is a cheap $25 one that I bought at Walmart and have been using for about 5 years.  This is definitely an upgrade from that.  I don&#x27;t know that I have seen any improvement in my hair from using it, as some reviews claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- FAST heat up! (I normally keep the setting about half way up)  It usually takes a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;- Smooth glide - rarely pulls on hair&lt;br /&gt;- Long cord if you don&#x27;t have an outlet conveniently located&lt;br /&gt;- Easy and comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- NO AUTO SHUT-OFF - I had read this and knew it when I bought it but I miss this feature SO much.  First off, the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light is not that bright, so you have to actually look to see if it is still on.  In the two months I have owned this I have accidentally left it on twice now.  Not the end of the world, but it makes me nervous! My old straightener had the auto-shut off so if I forgot then I didn&#x27;t have to worry.  I would have paid more just to have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;- The temp control and on/off switch is awkwardly placed on the inside of the straightener.  When it is on, you have to be careful to not burn yourself turning it off or adjusting the temp.  For safety, this would make more sense to go on the outside&lt;br /&gt;- The temp control is very vague - it shows the high/low temp and then just a blank range in between.  I know they sell a digital model so if you really want to know the temp you should look for that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product still warrants a 5 star review.  While the &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; I have listed would make excellent improvements in the straightener, it still works great and you definitely get your moneys worth.  I hope this review is helpful!efinitely get your moneys worth.  I hope this review is helpful!</li>
    <li> Works very well with natural African American hair, ie NON-relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It makes my hair super soft and silky. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it is damaging my hair at all. I love the little bag that it came with it. Would def recommend this straightener to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener due to its great reviews here on Amazon, and not only were the reviews great, but the price was as well.  The HSI straightener has worked great on my curly/wavy hair.  It straightens quickly and completely while leaving my hair shiny.  It has a light that turns green whenever it&#x27;s ready or needs to reheat which I find extremely convenient as I tend to do 3 or 4 things at the same time that I&#x27;m doing my hair.  I also really like the argon oil sample sent with the straightener.  I&#x27;d never tried argon oil before, but it works great in keeping my hair straight and manageable.  I will be recommending this flat iron to everyone who may be looking for a new one.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for about 2 months and I hate it!  It takes forever to heat up and then barely straightens my hair.  I wish I never bought this or could return it.</li>
    <li> I only give it 4 because I actually haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but the product was shipped quickly without damage. My biggest fear since it was so cheap was that the straightener was fake. Nope, the straightener is the real deal. Shipped with the oil, glove, and heat protected bag I love my purchase so far. Would do it again in a heartbeat. I&#x27;m really sick of buying cheaper straighteners again and again and again.</li>
    <li> It works really well for straightening my hair. It heats up quickly and has exceptional temperature control. I just cant seem to use it for curling my hair. This could be user error though.</li>
    <li> I bought the \\&quot;HSI 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER\\&quot; to replace my \\&quot;Remington Wet 2 Straight\\&quot; flat iron. The Remington one worked *okay*, but I was never able to get salon quality hair from it. I have used the HSI flat iron now 3x, and my hair is looking very straight, silky and shiny. (I use it along with Argan Oil) I am happy with my purchase. -- My only complaint is that it takes a few min to get fully hot, and then has to re-heat itself to max temp every few minutes.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and an a-line cut. This flat iron works just as great at the chi I previously used.</li>
    <li> Until I purchased the HSI I did not realize that the flat irons I have owned and borrowed in the past were pretty terrible. This thing glides through my hair like a knife through butter, even applying tension! The price versus the value make it a must have for any woman who frequently or occasionally wants smooth, straight, sleek hair!</li>
    <li> The flat iron works quite well.  I had a little problem at first, but realized I just needed to turn it up a little higher.  It heats up quickly and makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> you won&#x27;t find anything better at this price. even the packaging is incredible. the item is as described and works great. my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly 3b/3c/4b hair. I had been using the Babyliss Pro when I wanted to straighten my hair, and my hair would end up frizzy right after I got through straightening it. Someone used this iron on my hair in the mall and I was really impressed. What I like most about the product is how soft it made my hair. My hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy. Also, I work out at least three times a week, and I sweat a lot in my hair. Normally, after the workout, if I have straightened my hair, it can get really unruly like a straight fro. But....with the HSI iron, I noticed my hair did not respond like that after my workout. It was much calmer. The only reason why I am not giving this product 5 stars is because my stylist straightened my hair with an iron (her assistant would not give me the name of it so that I would have to depend on shop visits to get the results) that had much more dramatic silkening results then this one so I know there is another level of performance; however, this one gets a well-deserved 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter who straightens her hair everyday. She loves this iron says it makes her hair shiny without over drying. Also like the fact that she can wrap her hair around the iron to create soft curls. All in all very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great! Work really well heated up super fast. All you need :)&lt;br /&gt;X x x x x x x x x x x x x x x</li>
    <li> I am in love with the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch!!!  It heats up quickly and gets my hair straighter than any other flat iron that I have ever used.  I am absolutely thrilled that I bought this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted this hair straightener because my friend had it and she would straighten my hair and it would turn out great! Then i finally got my own and wowza it works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Time for a new flat iron since humid weather plus wavy/frizzy hair equals disaster!  After reading the reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try and so very happy I did.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much better this iron works at smoothing my hair than my old flat iron. The iron gets very hot and works quickly, there is a red \\&quot;on\\&quot; indicator light, the iron is hefty in weight and comfortable to hold and has a very long power cord.  I&#x27;m happy and non-frizzy haired! The huge plus of shopping with Amazon is their no-pain return policy.  I knew if the product didn&#x27;t work or wasn&#x27;t right for me, I could return it postage paid.</li>
    <li> It flat iron is light so your arms don&#x27;t hurt ,heats up fast and it doesn&#x27;t take long to straight your hair.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife. Good prioce, good quality, works great. My wife did some research on other irons &amp; she&#x27;s glad she chose this one. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had a CHI for 10 years until it finally broke.  I purchased this one and I&#x27;m just as happy with it.  Great product.  Great seller!</li>
    <li> My hair is super thick, long and coarse but with this flat iron. I can get my hair pin straight in under 30 minutes!! Only thing is your hair gets really hot so don&#x27;t forget to use the glove that comes with it so you don&#x27;t burn your hand.</li>
    <li> I have been using CHI for years and thought it was time for a change. My hairdresser actually told me about this iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl friend and she has never had a straightner that kept her hair straight for more the 4 hours, this kept it for 2 days!!! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  One swipe and hair is smooth and straight.  My only complaint is that the on/off and heat selections are on the innner side of the iron. Not very user friendly.  Other than that this is a great product with a great price.</li>
    <li> This styler works about the same as my old one, but is better in that I can put it up to my head without it burning and it makes my hair feel softer afterwards</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect but I thought I would take a chance on this straightener and I love it.  It makes my hair smooth, and doesn&#x27;t pull or catch on my hair.  It is a wonderful product.  It also came with a sample of Argan oil which is a wonderful product as well.  Overall, this is the best straightener I have ever owned.  I will now buy nothing else.</li>
    <li> Looks like CHI, straightens like a CHI, yet is not priced like a CHI.  I am so satisfied with this product!  Keeps heat well, has curved edges (so no hair pulls out), and comes with a nifty carrying case which works like a charm when traveling and needing to put a hot iron back in the bag or off a counter away from tiny hands.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have very ethnic hair and so does my daughter in law. We KNOW good irons and we KNOW crappy ones. I have had several Biolsilk and CHI irons in the past. CHI use to have an ethnic line of irons but they do not make them anymore--most newer irons do not get hot enough to straighten ethnic hair. I read the past reviews for this iron and decided to just give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am SO HAPPY!! Better than CHI--once you use it on a portion of hair your hair actually has that \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; look to it--like real hair :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So--as far as efficiency with thick course wired ethnic hair--this iron is a great tool!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the great reviews as a replacement for my Chi straightner. I am very happy with the quality and the performance of the straightner. I have very thick and long hair and it does a great job straightening it.</li>
    <li> This straightener is THE BEST you can ever find.  I was also unaware of this brand since you always here about Chi.  I am so glad I purchased this thing-it works better than any straightener that I have used myself or at the salon.  I have very thick, wavy hair and I have never been able to get a nice straight style that looks as good as it does after a salon visit.  My hair has never looked better after using this the first time and it stayed exactly the same for two days after so I didnt have to go back and touch up every morning like I normally have to with other products.  I paid $20 more for a lower brand straightener at Target but it never seems to get my hair as straight as anything used in a salon.  It also didnt take me an hour to go through all of my hair-I was done in 30 minutes.  It does go up to 400 degrees so it gets a little hot but they include a very nice heat glove for your protection (which works really well). Another bonus was the nice storage/travel case as well as the sample Aragon oil bottle.  I normally do not like to use any heat appliance for my hair too often since it can cause a lot of long term damage but my hair looks so good after using this I cannot help myself.  For anyone that has ever wished for your curls to be straight (at least for one full day) this is the best thing to buy!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made on Amazon.  I have fine, straight hair and have never used a flat iron on myself.  I did a lot of research with what would work best for me ie. ceramic tourmaline, adjustable heat seating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks great!  It has more body than I ever expected to get from doing my own hair.  This product is also easy to use.  The swivel cord makes life so much easier.  I have a tendency to turn this way and that when I&#x27;m styling my hair and with this cord I don&#x27;t end up like a contortionist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the pricing.  Like I said, I did a lot of research.  Compared buying online vs. going to a brick and mortar store and this is the best deal I found.  Especially being an Amazon Prime member and getting that 2 day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m even thinking about getting a new haircut that I&#x27;ve always wanted to try, but knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to style on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]--Great product...much better than a CHI if you ask me.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this flat iron twice since my purchase (3 days ago) and it works well, I&#x27;m not styling my hair regularly so it works for me, slim design, easy to use, the cable is of a suitable length, it comes with a glove and a soft pouch for storage. Previous comments said that it comes with an argan oil sample but not my kit, I don&#x27;t know if it was a limited edition gift or they just forgot include one on my purchase (one star less because of that). Anyway I like this hair flat iron so I recommend it.</li>
    <li> These are the best flat irons that I have had in my life. Compared to the chi flat iron I think they are the same, although the HSI is slightly better, and the price was unbeatable. I opened and flat ironed my hair the day I recieved the package, and its been humid and hot and my hair is still in the same straight, light, siilky soft state. These flat irons work on natural and weaves. I love it.  I encourage everyone to buy product, before the price goes up. Trust me it is worth everyone penny. I love my flat irons.</li>
    <li> After reading all the 5 star reviews I was super excited to try out my new HSI Flat Iron. I have medium length super thick Asian hair so I needed something that can heat up quick and stay hot. I like the fact that the flat iron heats up fairly quickly, but I am disappointed that it does not heat up to the 400+ degrees that is listed on the item (also the red light never turned green at the highest setting even after 30 minutes of heat up time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having difficulty with the iron I went back online and read the lower star reviews which leads me to believe that my flat iron maybe one of the defective units. I don&#x27;t want to return my flat iron but Amazon is telling me that I can&#x27;t replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know how I can get an replacement / exchange?</li>
    <li> My daughter has very very thick wavy hair.  It is usually not worth the time it takes to straighten her hair.  With this straightener we are able to straighten it fairly quickly in comparison.  It works great, heats up quickly and is easy to manage.</li>
    <li> The product looked promising when I first opened it, it didn&#x27;t exactly work as fast as i thought it would initially, but it was alright. Then a couple days later I noticed the plates were coming loose from the attachment and I could actually somewhat lift it off from the base. That was when I decided to return it. It cost me more than I thought it would to return it, and I only got it covered up to about $5. It was disappointing. Don&#x27;t know if I just happen to get a defective one, but I&#x27;d rather not go for the same brand again.</li>
    <li> hi works good,  but I still feel the chi is better quality. doesnt get as hot as advertised.  sometimes it feels its pulling the hair, doesnt iron really smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The straightener gets really hot but the outside isn&#x27;t hot to the touch. The item was shipped to me quickly. I am really happy with my purchase and I got a great deal on the item.</li>
    <li> This iron glides so smoothly over my hair I can barely tell that I am clamping it between the plates.  I am very pleased with this iron especially for $40!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a new straightener for a while, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price tag that comes with most professional style straighteners. When I saw this one for less than $40, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. It had more than met my expectations. It takes me half the time to do my hair and my hair is so smooth and stays that way all day. Another added perk is the 110-220 voltage which is great for European travel. I would highly recommend this product. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> i have probably used this iron approx. 10 times since i bought it. it heats up quickly and works well to straighten my hair. i should note that i have naturally straight hair to begin with, but the bottom half of my hair is damaged, so it&#x27;s very frizzy. that being said, the product straightens my hair nicely, without any frizz. it also looks much glossier when using the included argon oil it comes with. the only complaint i have so far is that the indicator light (which shows red while heating up and green once it&#x27;s ready) seems to go back to red once i start using the iron on my hair. i&#x27;m in the process of calling the company to see if that is normal or a defect. the other thing is that since it&#x27;s small in size and i have long hair, it takes me a while to get through all of my hair. on the whole though, i would recommend it, especially for the price i purchased it at.</li>
    <li> After reading the great reviews about this straightener I decided to give it a try. So far it has lived up to all the great reviews it received. I like the fact that you can adjust the temperature. It also works really well curling hair also. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> All though all the reviews were good I was skeptical because my hair does not cooperate with flat irons even with a CHI! I was amazed how my frizzy poofy curly hair was transformed into silky smooth straight strands without even blow drying my hair straight! I just brushed my hair and used the flat iron. The argan oil is amazing as well! Just a little goes a very long way and I have very long hair! This flat iron will be my go to flat iron for life! I hope my chi doesn&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s going into retirement ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after much research and comparison. I ended up choosing between the CHI, HSI and Baby Bliss. I chose HSI because of the awesome reviews and the great price. I received everything as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the Argon oil: I love the smell and it takes really well to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch and the glove: love them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual flat iron is heavenly. I have very curly hair. And I recently had it cut in a very short asymmetrical bob. I love the cut, it&#x27;s just so hard for me to make it look sleek and smooth like when I go see my hair dresser. I always found that blow drying only made my hair too bouncy and voluminous for this cut. I was using a Maxius Maxi Glide that I bought over 5 years ago, but that would just leave my hair bone straight and lookin sooo dry, no matter what oily product I put on. With the HSI my hair is so easy to style. The fact that it&#x27;s ceramic plate and not metal makes a world of difference. Oh! Also, I work out daily, so my hair curls right up during after my workouts. All I do is air dry the hair and run the HSI though the affected areas and my hair is shiny, silky and ready to face the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really, really like that this flat iron doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and that I can make my hair look like I just left the salon. Even my husband complimented me on making such a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I would caution you about is the heat settings. It can get really hot. Also, don&#x27;t put big/wide chunks of hair at a time because it can get caught on the edges.</li>
    <li> I recently got a new haircut and the stylist used a flat iron to style my hair.  I loved the way my hair looked.  The stylist suggested that I get a flat iron with ceramic plates.  After much searching around and reading the reviews I purchased the HSI Ceramic Ionic Flat Iron.  The first time I used it I knew I made a great decision.  It works wonderfully.  I have a slight natural wave in the back of my head that is practically impossible to straighten with a hair dryer and a round brush so it always looks like I missed a spot.  However, using the flat iron I was able to get rid of the wave no problem.  I have very thick hair and it takes a long time to blow dry it.  The flat iron cut the drying time in half and I didn&#x27;t even need to use the round brush.  I was concerned about frying my hair, but this iron comes with a temperature setting that allows you to control how hot you want it to be.  I used the middle setting and it was perfect.  My hair looks great and feels wonderful.  It&#x27;s very soft and shiny and not at all dried out.  I would highly recommend this flat iron for anyone who does not have a lot of time in the morning to get ready, but still wants to look their best.</li>
    <li> I received my flat iron today and I was so excited. I plugged it in and it heated up really fast. I was surprised that it straightened my hair. The only negative thing I can find with this flat iron is how heavy it is. I had the Solia 1 inch for about 4yrs and it stopped working so I bought this for the price.  I just don&#x27;t know if I can deal with how heavy and awkward it feels when I curl my own hair. I would probably buy another Solia when funds become available but until then I will have to cope with this. Don&#x27;t get me wrong for the price this flat iron is great but I&#x27;m use to curling my hair with a light weight iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after going through 2 CHIs in a few months. I&#x27;ve had the HSI flat iron for a few weeks and it does a really nice job on my hair. I am really pleased with it, especially for the price. I&#x27;ll definitely never buy a CHI again when I can get this item that (so far) works just as well for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical even after reading all the positive  reviews, but this flat iron didn&#x27;t disappoint.  My hair is silky straight. I love it.</li>
    <li> This iron is the best iron I have ever owned. I have very long curly 3b-c African American hair. This iron gives me the bone straight look like most professional grade irons, however it leaves the hair worlds shinier than all of my previous irons! With other irons I have had to push down on the plates very hard to get my hair bone straight but this one it does it in one or two simple passes. No more pressing down and burning my fingers! Not a fan of the oil that came with it but my hair is strange with products. But, the glove and satin travel case are an added bonus. Stop wasting money on expensive irons and just get this one! Now a huge fan of HSI! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI Ionic flat iron hair straightener because my wife dropped hers and broke it. She is now happy that she did because she say this is the best thing that could have happened, it&#x27;s a great product which saves time whenever she has to do her hair. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener!  This is the least amount of time that I have ever spent straightening my hair and with such great results!  I was worried because I had never heard of this company; but after reading the reviews, I went ahead and ordered it.  Definitely money well spent! Also, not important but a nice bonus, the packaging is amazing with the lovely travel pouch and glove to prevent burning your hand.  The argon oil was a nice bonus as well.  It is a tiny little bottle that goes a long way when used during straightening.  I have wanted to try argon oil for a while, but hate buying a container of product just to find out that I hate it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener!!</li>
    <li> The iron warms up very fast and works great! It comes with this neat glove to protect your hand from accidental burns and a pretty pouch to store the iron. This is the first time I bought a HSI brand item, but I would buy it again in a future with no hesiation. It is well worth it&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> Bought this product as a gift for my wife she loves it. She notice no damage to her hair like other spensive hair straighteners that she had bought. At soon as she started using it she trow away the other ones she had.</li>
    <li> When I bought this straightener, I had originally searched for a replacement CHI (which I had for 5+ years), but this came up in the results. It was discounted like 80% off, which is usually a huge sign for me to stay away, but the reviews were amazing, so I took a chance and bought this instead. It&#x27;s pretty good. I like the temperature control settings, and it feels very sturdy. However, for me personally, I feel that the CHI iron does a \\&quot;better\\&quot; job. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; this iron will straighten your hair, but it takes me between 5-7 minutes longer, which, if you&#x27;re just standing there waiting to finish your hair, is a little annoying. I also feel as if this iron takes longer to actually heat up, and to re-heat in the middle of straightening. For the huge difference in price, I&#x27;m not extremely disappointed I made this purchase, but I do miss my CHI.</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned, not recognizing the brand, but purchased based on other reviews and good price. Very pleasantly surprised! It came packaged nicely, even the storage pouch is VERY nice quality. Heats up extremely fast and the lower settings are perfect for my fine hair. The styler has a nice weight to it, sensible no slip grips and easy to use. So far, I am impressed. Its a much better product than other stylers I have paid alot more for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a flat iron before but a friend of mine convinced me to use one. She used her Chi flat iron on my hair and I liked it but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money so I looked on Amazon to find one. I came across the HSI and it works FABULOUSLY, just like all the reviews. I have dry, frizzy, curly, hair and I&#x27;m always afraid to damage it, but this flat iron makes my hair look and feel soft and silky! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a flat iron but not want to pay the high price. You will end up loving it.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice professional straightener! The cord is really long and the ceramic plates are really nice. It makes my hair so silky and soft after using it!</li>
    <li> I just recieved this, not only did it get here quick and as promised, it works great! I have very heavy, very curly hair and this iron straightened my hair like no other Iron I&#x27;ve ever used! Its a very well made, very sturdy product!</li>
    <li> I admit I bought this flat iron because the price was too great to not at least give it a try. I didn&#x27;t expect much from it... but it works great!! I love that it doesn&#x27;t grab my hair and it straightens my hair so fast!! I have lots of hair and usually hate dealing with straightening it because it takes so long but with this flat iron I actually feel like it is worth my time to style my hair!! The only thing this is missing is an auto shut off but otherwise it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Since moving to a humid climate, my hair has been uncontrollable.  Tired of having to wear it in a bun, I decided to try this HSI flat iron.  It&#x27;s simple to use and seems to be well-made.  It was effective in taking out the frizz/curls, but if your hair is at all dry, as mine is, I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day.  Make sure you also use some argan oil or coconut oil to help keep your hair in good condition.</li>
    <li> I received my HSI iron yesterday and used it last night.  I admit I was a bit skeptical because of the marked down price but it is the real deal.  I have had a CHI and my last iron was an FHI.  This iron straighten my has just as good for 3 times less the price.  I am considering buying another for a Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> I read numerous reviews before buying this product, so I was super excited that the price was so affordable for such a \\&quot;great\\&quot; product. I was thrilled to get this item &amp; tried it out immediately, but it took forever to heat up &amp; when it finally did, it kept snagging my hair &amp; it didn&#x27;t glide down smoothly. There are gaps in the ceramic plates where it would pinch my hair &amp; rip it out when I ran the iron down to the ends. I also had to run the iron down the same hair multiple times to get it to straighten the hair. In addition, it was heavier than the usual flat iron &amp; difficult to maneuver. I was pretty shocked to have such a horrible experience after reading so many good reviews. I am beginning to wonder if those people were actual customers, or if they were fake reviews... I have never had a single problem with a Chi, so I will go back to buying one of those.</li>
    <li> I am not one to write customer reviews, but this product was so amazing I felt I should. As soon a you open the box and feel it you can tell it&#x27;s a high quality product. It&#x27;s a little heavier than most flat irons, but its excellent quality! My hair has never look or felt this soft, shiny, and smooth! It gets hot really fast. It&#x27;s the best iron I have ever used hands down. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to love this straightener after reading all the great reviews,  but it just does not heat up And do the job that my Chi does. I&#x27;ve tried it 4 or 5 times now and end up switching back to my chi to get the heat settings and results that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> This is the best Flat iron I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;1.-The price is Great.&lt;br /&gt;2.-Leaves my hair Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;3.-Come with a sample of \\&quot;Argain Oil\\&quot; that Protects my Hair and leaves it Shiny.&lt;br /&gt;4.-They Have the most Amazing Customer Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will Buy Again.</li>
    <li> I for a long time thought flat ironing wasn&#x27;t for me.  I have wavy hair and I like it wavy.  The problem has been that over the years as my gray is coming in the waves don&#x27;t work together anymore and it ends up looking frizzy sometimes instead of controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist used a flat iron one day to put in a wavy flipped look and it blew my mind!  I had thought flat irons were just for stick straight hair.  I decided to get this item because I need to have a bit more control over my hair for work sometimes and look more polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quickly and the styling process is really smooth and easy.  I look really professional and well-groomed now as my hair is actually behaving itself.  I waited a long time to buy one because initially I thought I would have to get a really expensive one.  I was delighted to find this one that was so affordable.  It really works well and at a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using it a lot!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have only usedit twice since it arrived but so far i love it. It is exactly like the one i bought for my mother at he mall for like 90 dollars. Identical except for the name on it and the GFI plug.  I am going to make sure i register it just in case something happens but so far i like it.  the oil stuff is nice smells good, I am not using the glove i see no point in that.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this straightener I&#x27;ve used the chi for ten years and I was on to my 4th one I thought I would give something else a try. I&#x27;m very happy. My only complaint is it tugs t my hair a bit and some hair can get easily caught and pulled in it but overall great product for unruly hair</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my straightener that was broken in my luggage on a recent trip. I went to Amazon first since they always have so many options. I went with the HSI for two reasons first the amount of positive reviews it received and the price. It was delivered much faster than I expected which was great and also came with a sample bottle of Argon oil. The straightener heats up quickly and glides smoothly through my hair so I can get my hair done in no time at all. I must say that using this iron along with the oil has kept my hair straight and no more frizz!! Even with going out in the rain my hair stayed straight usually if it gets a little wet it gets curly and frizzy. I love this iron so much that I am going to buy another one for myself as a backup and order one for my daughter as well to replace her Chi since this one is so much nicer. The only con is that there is not an on light so you just have to make sure you turn it off or unplug it.</li>
    <li> It is very good and very light as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this. Its a worth.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to use. Able to get close to the root . Unlike other flat irons I have tried I am not sweating while trying to use it. Love this product sorry I waited so long to try.</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron is easy to use, makes my hair look fantastic and is just as good (if not better) than the $100 ceramic flat iron I bought my daughter a few months ago. Looks and feels sturdy and not too heavy. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener to replace one that I&#x27;d had for about 6 years that finally died on me.  I have extremely thick, frizzy, curly, dry, \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair and prior to my last iron I was continuously spending money trying to find an iron that would straighten my hair without burning it out. I considered buying a more expensive iron because many of my friends have one of two particular brands and love them, but I saw the rave reviews for the HSI on amazon and decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using this iron for a bit now and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how well it gets the job done; in my opinion, HSI straightens just as well as those \\&quot;good\\&quot; irons of my friends that I tried out.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It takes me an hour to straighten my hair usually. I was able to do it in 20 with this product. I can&#x27;t wait to start playing around with it and use it to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, makes my hair nice and silky... I&#x27;m African American and have really long hair, I also have two daughters with long hair and this iron did the wonders for us. I will be ordering two more for my girls, because they love it so much. Great product at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I have natural wavy hair and it is very difficult to keep it straight on humid or hot days.  The HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline ionic Flat Iron works better than my Chi.  I was a little weary about buying this flat iron because it was not an expensive iron.  It actually straightens my hair and leaves a nice shine.  My Chi usually straightened my hair but within an hour or two the waves came back.</li>
    <li> When my GHD died after 2 years of use, I didn&#x27;t feel like blowing another couple hundred dollars and decided to give the HSI a try based on all of the reviews. While I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price I paid, it&#x27;s not as good as my GHD was. My hair will often start to get waves an hour or two after I&#x27;ve straightened it with this HSI, which is something that did not happen with my previous GHD straightener. If you are looking for high quality results, I recommend the GHD. Otherwise, this is a cheaper alternative-- just know that the effect will not be the same.  ****UPDATE**** 3 years later and this is still working just as well as when it came out of the box. I&#x27;ve even used it in several countries without issue. Much more than I can say for higher end brands I&#x27;ve purchased, none of them lasted this long!</li>
    <li> I am so surprised! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but not only does it work great but it came with a case as well! Nice!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest flat iron I have owned. I have naturally stick straight hair that tends to frizz, but this flat iron really cuts down on the frizz. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Wow awesome iron for the price you pay..heats up fast and leaves my hair silky smooth ..so far I love it</li>
    <li> I took the plunge and bought a straightener from amazon. So glad I did. I love the product. I have a house full of girls who all use it along with me. very good product. described accurately. very pleased with the straightener.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased w/ this professional flatiron.  I like that I can control the temperature.  The construction seems quite durable and has a fuss-free swivel cord.  Compared to other irons I&#x27;ve handled, this one is on the heavier side but it doesn&#x27;t hinder its performance. Nicely packaged as it includes a nice velvet storage bag, a small bottle of argon oil, and protective glove.  Includes a one year mfg warranty.  I really cannot think of anything else I would want in an iron.  Thanks, HSI!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works great and was a great deal at the price.  Got this for my girlfriend who has extremely thick hair and it works great on it.</li>
    <li> This flatiron does not work. It does not close tightly which means it does not do a good job of ironing your hair at all.  You can not get a good sleek look with the product. Spend the extra money and buy a Chi flatiron.</li>
    <li> First time I have EVER left a review for a product but this deserves 5 stars! I have tried every top pf the line flat iron, Chi, Rusk, Heat Freak, you name it and this is by far the best flat Iron I have ever purchased, so happy :-D</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I bought it based on the good reviews.  I like that it came with its own case, and a glove.  I have a lot of gray hair that I color but it has made my hair corse and my hair is thick so I loved how my hairdresser transformed my hair into smooth and shiny flat hair with a flat iron.  I have only used this 3 times and I have been happy with the results.  The instruction pamphlet is a little basic so I went to you tube to look at videos of how to use the flat iron and they helped tremendously.  Very solid, professional flat iron and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have mostly straight hair but my ends tend to be pretty wavy and hard to straighten. This flat iron straightens my wavy ends in just one pass! It has significantly shortened the amount of time it takes to get my hair pin straight!&lt;br /&gt;This iron works better than other more expensive brands that I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The argan oil that was included makes my hair feel super soft. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> The product have good quality ang good price.This flat iron is a very good product and I am very satisfied with it.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> In the other reviews, people said its really good. The one that I recieved doesn&#x27;t stay hot. It will reach 410° and then it will cool down as you use it.</li>
    <li> I just received this HSI flat iron today. We are travelling in May and I need a dual voltage iron. I ordered this item based on previous reviews. I have not used the iron on my hair, just tested and was please at how fast it turned hot (hence the four stars). I am pleased with the speed of delivery, plus the way the items were presented. I will post some pictures. Oh I was pleasantly surprised to see the digital temperature display. I believe the older versions do not have this. I also payed a great price under $40!! What a deal!</li>
    <li> Gift for my Daughter  she loved it</li>
    <li> I have super coarse thick hair, with most irons I&#x27;d have to go over areas to straighten but not with this, it&#x27;s soooo powerful! It&#x27;s amazing. The price is amazing too! I bought this based on the ratings and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> The flat iron was really easy to use and heats up quickly. I like how you can change the temperature settings. I&#x27;m happy with the product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this flatiron. Works really well, heats up fast. Got one 9 months ago for my daughter and she uses it every day. Since hers worked so well for her, I got one for myself.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener it works really well. It heats up fast and it curls or straightens the hair easy.</li>
    <li> I previously had a GHD straightener for several years. The best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had, but I after it broke I couldn&#x27;t afford to shell out another $200 for a new one. I read the reviews on this HSI ceramic straightener so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m Asian so I have fine hair. My hair is also colored and a bit on the fragile side so I try not to straighten it often and I make sure I use good heat protection products when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, since my hair isn&#x27;t as thick and healthy, I tried to straighten my hair with the HSI using a lower heat setting. It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all and it ripped some of my hair out!! Every time I use this straightener, it doesn&#x27;t glide across my hair like the GHD did and at least 3 hairs get caught on the device and either break off or rip out... both painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried different heat settings to find the right one for my hair. The higher temperatures did straighten my hair, but it didn&#x27;t leave it smooth or silky looking like other straighteners do. I had a bunch of frizzy fly-aways and it looked like I had some serious static on the right side of my head. I will not use this straightener anymore because I am seriously concerned it will further damage the quality of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 1 star... but I guess it&#x27;s not horrible for it&#x27;s price. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have fine or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I seen many good reviews on this flat iron and decided to try it out. Tried this product out two times then it fell apart on me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and it works very well.  I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I am returning this product. First, the on/off and temp control buttons are in-between the straightening blades, making it difficult for my fingers to access and adjust. Second, the unit took a long time to heat up and did not heat up to stated temperature as compared to another flat iron I own also with temperature select and I assume this is either defective or not true to selected temps. Lastly, the travel pouch was not included.</li>
    <li> The plates are close  together which works well for my thin hair.  The power switch is somewhat remote and difficult to manipulate.  I expected the straightener to shut off after while if not manually accomplished.  I see that it doesn&#x27;t.  The pouch is nice and I like the Argon oil, a lot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for an overseas trip and so far so good. Note that this is a dual voltage appliance so it&#x27;ll come in handy for international travel. All I needed was a plug adapter to use this on a 220v outlet. This flat iron has a dial where you can adjust the heat settings. It heats up quickly and seems solidly built.  Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!!! LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY DAUGHTER USED THE FLAT IRON ON MY HAIR LAST WEEKEND, OMG!!! MY HAIR LOOKED LIKE I HAD WENT TO THE SALON...ALONG WITH MY SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER, AND OIL THAT I USE, THEN PRESS MY HAIR OUT WITH HSI, I WILL NEVER GO TO THE SALON AGAIN. BY THE WAY, MY DAUGHTERS LOVE IT TOO!!!!</li>
    <li> A great flat iron, easy to use, and the result is sleek shiny hair.</li>
    <li> Its okay. It seems like it might have a short in it because it goes off and on. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal.</li>
    <li> I just received my new HSI straightening iron today, a welcome surprise, considering order details had it arriving in 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed straightening/flat irons extensively before making my purchase. I had a cheapy one from Target that worked well &amp; lasted 4 years. Seriously. It was nice. And, oh sad day, it stopped working. So I asked for recommendations from friends. Everyone said not to get another Target replacement, to get a Chi or a Paul Mitchell. Well, I am too much of a cheap-o for that! I got on Amazon &amp; searched Chi flat/straightening iron. This HSI flat iron popped up on my search. After reading tons of reviews on it, I decided to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;And I love it!! According to the reviews I read, I was prepared to have to reset the plug before using it so there was no surprise there. After that, I applied the oil that was included. Love it too! My hair feels like silk. I have medium hair, not coarse or fine. Worked wonderfully. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I have short thick curly hair and this works great!  I love the price!  I was skeptical because of that but it works so well!  It heats up up quickly and easily leaves straight, smooth hair!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this! Very quick heat-up. Easy to use. Straightens with first pass. I really appreciate that! Nice, quality construction. A bit heavy, but not so much that your arms will hurt. All around amazing product. So glad I ordered this!</li>
    <li> Bought this a couple of Christmas ago.  My daughter still uses it.  Good product, great quality!</li>
    <li> Works really well with my natural curl. Heat up so fast.</li>
    <li> great - this is my second order of this item. I ordered one for my daughter in February and recently ordered one for my grand daughter for her birthday</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because the other reviews were really good, and because it is a ceramic tourmaline flat iron. I&#x27;ve had another flat iron for over 10 years that is also ceramic tourmaline (a Sedu), that has been really fabulous. It&#x27;s more expensive though and I thought I would give this brand a try, as I needed to purchase an additional one. What a difference! The HSI snags, pulls and tears your hair. I ended up with a bunch of hair pulled out. The Sedu never has done that and always glides nicely through my hair. The folks who have reviewed this must have never had a good flat iron before and this one is a major disappointment. I do have thick hair and maybe the HSI is okay for those with finer hair. If you have thick or coarse hair I recommend that you go with another brand.</li>
    <li> I finally found a flat iron that works perfectly. It heats up fast and works great on my thick hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> For all the good reviews,  I was disappointed.  But it&#x27;s not a bad straightener.  I straighten my hair everyday, and I&#x27;ve had the best for my hair (it.was called keritan??) And I loved it, but after a year it was becoming faulty.  So i this as a back up, and it&#x27;s a good straightener, i just know I&#x27;ve had better (said every girl)</li>
    <li> I was really excited because this was the first straightener I really spent more than $10 on. When I got it, it came with everything promised, but the straightener was just okay. It wasn&#x27;t worth all the money. I&#x27;ve had drugstore straighteners that work just as well as this. The only was I can get it to really straighten my hair with one pass is to put it on the highest setting- which isn&#x27;t that great for my hair. I would say this is a good straightener, but save your money and get a cheaper one at your local drugstore because it would work just as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these and after ~8 months it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the procedure for sending back to the manufacturer for a replacement.  After not hearing from them in several month I contacted them to see where my replacement unit was.  They denied getting the unit and after I provided as much information as I could about when and where I bought it, when and where I shipped it to them, they came back and denied my claim. They said the seller was not an authorized reseller.  They insinuated that the item I bought was a counterfeit unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased new, through Amazon, with an Amazon prime listing.  The seller was called &amp;#34;Trending&amp;#34; and no longer is listed as a seller of this product.</li>
    <li> Had high expectation but when I received it and my daughter started using it not so great.  She had long hair with a wave (not curly) and the iron get cool very quickly.  Only stays hot (even on the highest setting) for the first few passes.  Wanted to love it but just don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> All around a good hair straightner. Just don&#x27;t expect the free argan oil to look like the pic its a really small sample packet.</li>
    <li> I love that the temperature can be adjusted! Heats quickly....best flat iron I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Best. Flat. Iron. Ever.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron!  I have very fine hair and the fact that there is a temperature adjustment is important to me. It works very well for both straightening and curling. Great price...very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> One  of the best ion I ever own, make my hair so nice and straight. Love it</li>
    <li> It works like a charm on my very thick hair. I love that I can choose the temperature and that I can easily see the numbers. It&#x27;s got a nice heft- a perfect weight. And there&#x27;s more. Included is a glove that prevents you getting a burn, a beautiful thick quilted red holder, and a small sample of Argon oil. It&#x27;s a very beautifully presented great flatiron., and the price can not be beat.</li>
    <li> Have not heard any complaints from people at home who use it.  So, I guess it is good sign.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The item was perfect and exactly what we needed. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent flat iron: lightweight, styles smoothly, and heats thoroughly on low settings.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener and Blue Novelties has excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I ordered wasn&#x27;t working right - it was dragging through my hair and not really straightening. I messaged them and they responded within an hour, indicating they would send me a replacement.  The replacement arrived within 3 days, and it has worked great since I got it 2 weeks ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, fine brown, chest-length brown hair that is usually wavy-curly out of the shower if left to air dry.  When I blow dry, it gets poofy at the bottom, but there is very little volume at the roots. So my hair sits completely flat on my head (like a &amp;#34;limp noodle&amp;#34;), and then poofs out like a bunch of thin little wires at the bottom.  It gets so oily I have to wash it every day. But then....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this straightener, I had VOLUME at my roots! It literally picked up my hair from the top of my head, and smoothed out the extra poofiness at the bottom. It changed my messy hair to SHINY and SOFT hair in FIVE MINUTES! And get this -  I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair for 4 days!! My hair stayed clean, straight, non-oily, and shiny for 4 whole days, with just a couple 2- minute touch ups. I kept it about halfway between 170 and 410 degrees for straightening, and a little higher for curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any burning hair smell (which I have seen with other straighteners) and I have had zero problems with this new straightener. It heats up in 15 seconds flat. Did I mention it took only 5 minutes to straighten my hair that is ~18 inches from the roots?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also curl your hair with this straightener (check out youtube videos on this) and it works great with that as well.  Any questions, just post a comment!</li>
    <li> Product works great!! All the seals around the box were intact so I could be sure I was the first one opening the box. Came to me just like the</li>
    <li> The product shipped faster than expected and the flatiron produced quality results. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, who quickly upon receiving it, went to the bathroom, plugged it in and was SUPER happy with it.  The only drawback to the item is not having an automatic shut off.  But as long as you&#x27;re responsible, that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  Therefore, I still gave it 5 stars.  Not to mention, I was pleased to see the BS&amp;#34;D on the packaging.  Some of you will know what I mean.</li>
    <li> Judt as the stsrs ssid, buy it and you will have smooth salon hair</li>
    <li> Worthless - I bought this product to use on a trip to Italy.  I tested it here in the US and it worked fine.  I used it once in Italy and it worked as well.  The second time I used it in Italy the light came on but it never heated up.  I ditched it in Venice so it wouldn&#x27;t take up space in my luggage.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a back up to my CHI straightener and quickly became my REPLACEMENT for my CHI.  It is an excellent product at a very reasonable price.  Sadly, I accidentally dropped and shattered my 1 year old HSI straightener, so this was a replacement to that one.  I will be sticking with this product indefinitely!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! For the price I got it for, I had to get one for my daughter!</li>
    <li> great low cost alternative when searching for a truly hot hair straightener.  My girlfriend loves this as her travel straightener and claims it works just as well as her $100 one</li>
    <li> works well! wish it had an auto-off, but it heats up fast and gets hot!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice iron for the price, but it&#x27;s bulky and I have to run the iron through each piece twice.  I had a Hana Elite that I loved, but it finally died and was too pricey to replace.  Probably the best iron at such a low price..</li>
    <li> It dries up my hair, and it&#x27;s too big to do curl.</li>
    <li> The iron is great but gets very hot. I damaged my hair with this one, so just be careful to adjust the temp. Updated... As I said I had damaged my hair. Well even almost on the lowest setting, it has continued to damage my hair. I have been straightening my hair for years, but this is the only iron that has damaged my hair this way. I would recommend that if you have fine hair, do not use.</li>
    <li> Hair results are just as good as the $250 professional flat iron that I have used for years!  Bought a second one to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> This works great and is a great value for the money.  I like that it heats up quickly and easily makes my hair straight and frizz free.  I have long thick wavy/frizzy hair and this hair straightener works wonderfully.  It comes with a vial of &amp;#34;argon&amp;#34; oil that I am not impressed with, but for the price and quality of this flat iron, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener and fell in love with it. It worked so well. It broke after only a month of use. It will turn on for about 2 seconds and then shut off and will not get hot. I read such wonderful reviews about the great customer service and that they send you a new one when yours breaks, well I wrote an email to the seller and received no feedback whatsoever. Bad customer service. Such a disappointment because I loved using this product too.</li>
    <li> my hair never looked so good..........Love It!!!</li>
    <li> This works wonders. I was amazed by how smooth it made my hair. I have spent more money for other items that did not work nearly as well. I could see the difference immediately. I was disappointed when my shipment confirmation gave me a date that was nearly 3 weeks away, but it must have been a typo because I had it in a matter of days.</li>
    <li> This flat iron leaves my hair nice and shiny, and I like  that I can adjust the heat; however, it isn&#x27;t digital so it doesn&#x27;t display the heating temperature. Another thing is  the on and off switch is located inside the flat iron and not on the side as the majority of others do. Overall, I say it&#x27;s a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> I had a $150 flat iron that finally gave out after 7 years. I was reluctant to purchase a $40 product, but I love it. Very satisfied with the product so far.</li>
    <li> Works better than my old $100.00 flat iron.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, works great!  Love that it has floating plates!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Works great!</li>
    <li> Really great hair straightener!  I had always used CHI before and was a little nervous to spend less than $50 for a hair straightener.  I&#x27;ve usually spent around $100 in the past and almost went with HSI&#x27;s other version for that reason.  With all the great reviews, I decided to take a chance and try it out.  It takes a couple times of playing with the temperature (since you can control how hot it gets), but once I got it hot enough, it now works great and straightens my wavy hair in a couple easy swipes!</li>
    <li> works amazingly well - great product at great price</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this flat iron! Best purchase!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and great price.  Handy pretty case.  The little argan oil sample really does the trick too.  Would recommend this to anyone who does not want to spend $100 on a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Works really good, gives hair a nice shine when straightening. For the money its a great buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them. They make my hair very soft, silky, and lushis. These flat irons are amazing! Get them if you don&#x27;t have them already!</li>
    <li> Gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> absolutely love it, heats up quickly and is easy to use</li>
    <li> Great buy, works just as well as some of the pricier flat irons.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product that came with several extras, including a satin carrying case, a heat glove, and a bottle of leave-in conditioner. The iron works beautifully, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think there could be much of a difference in flat irons. I was WRONG. This is worlds away from a product I was using that is in the same price range. I set it to high and my hair is so smooth and looks healthy as opposed to &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34;. It heats up super fast and has a great little bag so you can put it directly away when done. I only wished it beeped when it was done heating. But hey I can always look at the dot.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and it sounded amazing. But it didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought. I thought maybe I had the heat too low so I put it on the highest setting, and it still didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as well as I expected. It also would tug on my hair when it got down towards the tips. I resorted back to my 3 year old Remington.</li>
    <li> This iron works great making my hair stick straight.  I had one before and it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair very well.  I thought it was my hair but I now know it was my iron.</li>
    <li> This is ok for the price, but it tends to drag my hair a little. I  preferred my Chi.</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener!  I really thought that with my super curly hair that I&#x27;d need an expensive Chi iron.  This one gets my hair very straight and without a lot of effort.  It also heats up very fast, which is great.  For under $40, you can&#x27;t go wrong!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Well...my daughter loves it. We have had it for 6 months now and it is holding together very well. The plastic and spring mechanism are sufficiently stout that it isn&#x27;t coming apart after what must be One Million straightening strokes.</li>
    <li> Arrive on time. Product as described. Great!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery &amp; works great!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  Heats up very quickly, easily manageable and has a temperature control that most others don&#x27;t. I have AA hair and the low setting works well on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!!!!!!!!! I use it everyday....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 expensive straighteners over the past three years, and all have had some type of issue. For the price and the outcome of the product, it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> That is a good product</li>
    <li> My sister and best friend are thrilled with these! Fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after two weeks. Did not turn on</li>
    <li> Handle has a pattern cut in the plastic that is a little rough on my hands while I&#x27;m turning iron to put curls in my hair.</li>
    <li> No impressed at all.  My old Nume is much better.  Wasted money.</li>
    <li> I was doing research on flat irons last week and came upon this. I couldn&#x27;t believe that a $40 flat iron could get such rave reviews. I read all of the amazing reviews and bought it-still thinking.....too good to be true! Then, I laughed at my impulsivity and started reading the negative reviews...after which I tried cancelling the order...but it was too late, because the order had already shipped.  I got this last week (came waaaayyyyyy earlier than anticipated) in a good quality packaging, with a glove, tiny bottle of argan oil and sateen pouch. The flat iron itself is built VERY well and it looks like a very good quality, professional flat iron. For those wondering about the size-it IS a FULL size flat iron. I was wondering that as well before I bought it.  Yesterday was the day...and I was shocked to discover that this iron performed the same as my hair dresser&#x27;s.  In fact my hair dresser warned me NOT TO buy this because she wasn&#x27;t familiar with this particular brand and couldn&#x27;t believe that I could get anything professional for under $100. Well......HSI proved her wrong!  I&#x27;ve read a few of the negative reviews and the majority of them complained that \\&quot;it tugs and pulls at the ends\\&quot;. Not true. If yours pulls or tugs at the ends you either press too hard, OR you need a trim. If your ends are frizzy and damaged-it&#x27;s natural for ANY flat iron to tug at your ends.  Also-word of advice-try to do this on freshly washed hair. Blow dry is as straight as you possibly can and then flat iron it. If you are doing it on dirty , greasy hair, no wonder you&#x27;re not getting results. My hair is very frizzy, very curly and pretty long and it looks like I just came out of a hair salon (and since I left the little bottle of argan oil at the office, I didn&#x27;t even use it!).  This is an amazing bang for your buck. Don&#x27;t even hesitate.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Well, I really couldn&#x27;t say how i like this straightener, but my daughter loves it</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Easy to use. BONUS - the cord is nice and long and where it attaches to the iron it swivels &#x3D; no more tangled mess of a cord.  Update...I dropped it and broke the ceramic plate but I loved it so much I immediately ordered another one! I still love it amd it does a great job without making my hair look dry!</li>
    <li> I liked the product. It flattened my hair without burning.It can also be used like a curling iron also. I thought it was great</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even heat up. Says that it is heating but never does, only gets warm. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love the straightener!</li>
    <li> This is a great 1\\&quot; straightener.  I wanted something smaller to travel with, perfect!  Great price, gets hot quickly.  Comes with a glove &amp; a nifty little carrying bag.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! After struggling with my Remington straightner on my thick wavy hair for a few years I decided to try a new one. There is a significant difference between the performance of my HSI straightner and my old one- the HSI straightens quickly and makes my hair really shiny! I would definatly recommend this straightner even at two times the price!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, who is very happy with this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dual voltage is an added plus since we travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron based on other reviews replacing a practically brand new Corolis that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about (fried my hair in places because of uneven heating). This is a great iron at a great price. Works great on my fine hair. I never owned a chi but feel this is a super alternative to their high prices and seemingly low durability product. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical on purchasing this product because I didn&#x27;t think anything could beat my Chi flat iron. Boy was I wrong! I took the chance, ordered it, got it in 2 days, tried it out and was surprised that my hair was silkier and straighter than what I usually get with my Chi. It heats up quickly and provides even amounts of heat throughout the heating plate. It is def. worth the $50 or so I spent on it compared to the $150+ that Chi goes for. It comes with a glove (I don&#x27;t really use it), a cute red pouch to keep the iron in, and some nice leave in oil treatment for your hair. The oil treatment smells really good and feels great.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews on this product I had high expectations. The first day I got it I tried it and wasnt all that impressed. The temp on the flat iron doesnt really get hot at all...and i had it on the highest setting. It took more than a couple times to go over a section of my hair for it to be straight. Also, the little light on the flat iron doesnt stay green when its ready to use...it kept switching from green to red so the temp was never really what I wanted. I have a feeling i might return this product and go for something of better quality!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, and the description.of it is to the &#x27; T&#x27;. Heats quick, easy to manage, lightweight, sleek and slim in your hands and cuts straightening time in HALF. Makes me feel like a pro, and be price is perfect. It leaves our hair soft and shiny just like you came from the salon. I have to keep others from taking it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good flat iron. As good as my Paul Mitchell iron at a 1/3 of the price. Would highly recommend this iron.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my new flat iron! I did so much research prior to selecting this (I am one of those way too analytical consumers), and I have to admit I was nervous I would end up disappointed. Much to my surprise, I have been nothing but completely happy with this product. It heats up at very fast and it does everything you would expect a flat iron to do and more. I have friends who have CHI irons who are very impressed with this and who seem to be regretting overpaying for theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos for the fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I only paid $40 for this and not what the original price was. It is horrible! Pulls my hair . I had much better luck with my Remington. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk.</li>
    <li> I had to get a new hair straightener after my old roommate used mine while I was on vacation and left loads of seared on hairspray on it that I couldn&#x27;t clean off. My old straightener can&#x27;t hold a candle to this one!&lt;br /&gt;This one has a much higher temperature range starting at 140 all the way up to 410F. My old one could only do 50-350F degrees. Not sure I&#x27;ll need to go as high as 410F but what the heck its nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried this straightener wouldn&#x27;t do the job since it was a brand Ive never heard of nor did I get to test it out before the buy. My old straightener I bought after having a similar one used on my hair at a salon. But I can definitely tell you this thing is a beast! And for half the cost or less of a CHI or some of the other high priced brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con, is that so far I don&#x27;t see any indicator lights to let you know it is on or has reached the desired heat limit. Not sure if I&#x27;m just blind and didn&#x27;t see it. Also it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off feature, so BE CAREFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little beast can give CHI a run for their money if you buy it from Amazon. I got it for about $40 at the time of this post. Well worth every penny and then some!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product because of all the great reviews. It came in 2 days (thanks, Prime). Immediately plugged it in to try it out.....and nothing. I waited 5, 10 minutes for it to heat up, but nothing. I tried different outlets, heat settings, changed around the on/off button. Maybe I just got unlucky and got the one defective product, BUT I AM RETURNING THIS ASAP. IT DOESN&#x27;T TURN ON/HEAT UP.</li>
    <li> I am very pleasantly surprised about the quality of this flat iron. I have another so I bought this for a back up iron because mine is a very expensive one, but this one is just as nice as the one I have.  I have not actually used it yet but will tomorrow as I have been too busy to actually spend much time working with it.  I am so glad I purchased it regardless!  Shipped was lightning fast also!</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law loves this product, easy to use, flattens her hair very quickly, leaves her hair more manageable. Would buy again. Great seller as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! This straightener gets rid of all my frizz and the oil it comes with is amazing! I recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the quality because i&#x27;d have to take several times to straighten the same bundle of hair for it to be straighter and still it doesnt not get the straight that i want. One thing that bothered me the most was how heavy it was, to the point where it became painful for my wrist and hand. Straighteners aren&#x27;t supposed to be like that. Definitely not the best as ppl say!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance to replace a NUME she dropped and broke (this is why we cant have nice things).  She states that it is at least as good, or better than the nume.  All I know is it makes her happy in the morning, a time when she is usually very angry.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron, works so much nicer than the last one I had.  Have purchased a second one for our weekend home.</li>
    <li> Wish it had worked! I was excited to receive this today - but it just didn&#x27;t work. Had a flashing red light and never did heat up. Try hitting the reset button, tried other outlets - nothing worked. Disappointed. Hesitant to re-order, returning this one.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this flat iron! She claims her hair is softer after straightening it!</li>
    <li> Product has exceeded expectations. Works flawlessly without any issues at a fraction of some of the other brands cost. This product is used nearly daily and I will update this comment in the future if the experience with this product changes. Great product thus far.</li>
    <li> This product works as well as a much more expensive flat iron my daughter has. It even came with a glove so I do t burn my hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener after reading the amazing reviews that it got. I also considered the huge discount I was receiving through amazon. I used this hair straightener for the first time for the holiday and my hair came out amazing! I am biracial so I have very course and extremely thick, curly hair. I used the argon oil provided by HSI and although the straightener did not reduce the time it took to do my hair, it definitely improved the quality!! Would recommend this hair straightener to anyone of any age or ethnic background. OUTSTANDING!!</li>
    <li> This thing is a gift from a God. It makes my hair straighter and shinier than any other flatiron has ever been able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For those who&#x27;re wondering, I have thick relaxed hair)</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I bought this for my sister.  She said that it makes her hair feel like it was done professionally.  Excellent product!!  Thank you</li>
    <li> easy to use and make my air smooth, use it everytime after shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener as a gift for my brother&#x27;s girlfriend.  It was a great deal and it had great reviews. The product arrived very fast. She loves this straightener and says it works very well. I may have to get one of my own too.</li>
    <li> I have had several Chi irons-that I loved. This one totally compares in ability-BUT WAY better on price! I am a fan and will buy HSI from NOW ON!!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this flat iron. Not only was it a great deal, it is so easy to use. I had tried one that a friend of mine had and was so clumsy with it, I decided that I should not even buy one.  Then, I read reviews on this product on Amazon and since the price was so good, I decided to go for it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Its the real thing for a down to earth price finally! My friends all have the expensive Chi straighteners and I just never felt that paying $100+ for a product like that was really worth it. Thank gosh I found this great deal on amazon. I use this straightener every day and its performing just as well as my friends straighteners that I always used to borrow.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love! Great for all hair types, including relaxed hair! It also comes with a complimentary SMALL bottle of argan oil that is AMAZING! Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is fairly straight to begin with. This straightener did the job but not extremely well. I returned it however because it pulled my hair. My hair seemed to catch on something, I&#x27;m not sure what.</li>
    <li> I do somewhat recommend this product, however, I purchased this product about 5 months ago, it worked well . However, it seems as though there is an issue with these HSI&#x27;s as I had seen reviews before suggesting that the product has a short lifespan, which is what happened to me. So if you are looking for something with a longer lifespan for your forty bucks this may not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, smooth plates and does not tug at hair while using! Great deal, works as well as more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Junk, burned out within 10 months.. Worked great though.</li>
    <li> Wearing these gloves made a huge difference in how dry my hands would become after using the UV nail dryer. They protected my hands well</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to write this review as I wanted to really give this product a good test. As a woman who has naturally curly hair, finding the right straightener has been a task. With previous straighteners after any type of moisture or humidity my hair would become a frizzy mess and unmanageable. I am SO happy to say, this straightener has been a game changer for me and the extra time it takes to straighten my hair is beyond worth it! I would give this 10 stars if I could</li>
    <li> I have natural corkscrew curls - very thick and very long.  I actually purchased this iron for my daughter but one day, had a &amp;#34;wild hair&amp;#34; to try it myself.  It had been 20+ years since I attempted to straighten my hair and I have to say...this little hair iron is miraculous!  I have never in my life had such smooth, shiny hair.  EVER.  Just flat out amazing, really.  Unlike the old flat plates in a crimping iron of yesteryear, my hair stays straight for days with only a touch up here and there.  I can&#x27;t even express how much I love this thing - I would give it 6 stars if I could.  I just ordered one for myself so my daughter can get hers back.</li>
    <li> Smells bad, doesn&#x27;t heat properly, pulls out many strands of hair with each use, cheap knockoff of Chi &amp; is not sold anywhere else so that says alot, pretty much feel I got scammed due to the outrageous original price.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this works as ir is a gift. The service was flawless as always. Will have to update when my niece lets me know how she likes it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter (Christmas gift).  I immediately tried it to make sure it worked well and was very happy how straight and shiny it left my hair.  At this price, it is definitely an excellent gift.  I am going to get another one for my teenage granddaughter!!</li>
    <li> These irons work when they want to I ordered these not to long ago and my light blinks on and off ... Since they only 30 bucks REMEMBER YOU GET WHAT U PAY FOR !</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron for this low price.  I bought it to replace my CHI and so far, I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product has got to be the biggest bang for your buck! I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She doesn&#x27;t know that I got it for such a low price and still thinks that I had spent hundreds  of dollars. Like I said, great product for an amazing price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron about two weeks ago and got it in, its a pretty decent product but i wouldnt say as good as a chi. but overall worked really good. I was really excited about trying the sample of arogon oil that came with it but when i recieved my package, the top was not even screwed on and it was spilt over my entire package. pretty disapointing.</li>
    <li> This works very well and the amazing price!  I had been using CHI Brandt&#x27;s one long time. But I wanted to save the money at this time. I have no regret so far.</li>
    <li> very nice looking product, love the packaging. I bought 2 of these for gifts and will probably get 2 more.</li>
    <li> I am replacing my $100.00 flat iron with this one!  Smooth hair!  Works better than any flat iron I have used.  My hair is shiney and beautiful!  Finally.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of the rave reviews it received and I have to admit that it take 3 times as long to straighten my hair as my old Chi Iron did.  I thought perhaps it was because was using Chi oil and not the HSI oil so I ordered a bottle and I regret to say I see no deference.  I have shoulder length, slightly course blonde hair so keeping my hair straight is generally not a problem.  I just have chalked this up to a lesson learned or bad experience and realize this product is not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this iron, it is basic, not complicated, and easy to use.  I was supprised at how fast it heats up, and it gets hotter than I need it to.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think there is anything better out there.</li>
    <li> My mixed-race curly unmanageable hair loves this iron!  I wish I would have gotten one sooner!  It&#x27;s so soft and shiney now.</li>
    <li> Hair didn&#x27;t straighten well</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]I have been using a ceramic Tourmaline flat iron for years on my hair to straighten it and last week mine died.  I went onto Amazon and found one that looked good so I purchased it.  After I used it I realized how my other one had aged.  My hair is much straighter and lasts longer with my new one.  They sent me a free bottle of oil to use with it but unfortunately the fragrance is too strong for me to use so I am just using it with my mousse.  I am chemically sensitive and work with many who also are so I can&#x27;t use strong fragrances or any for that matter.  Otherwise, I love the flat iron!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to replace my CHI flat iron, which I loved but stopped working after owning it for less than a year.  The best thing I can say about this iron is that it is OK.  I have very long hair, but very fine, so it shouldn&#x27;t take much to get it straight.  This iron does not get as hot as the CHI so it takes quite a bit longer to get through my hair.  It is also much heavier than I am used to, so by the time I am finished I feel like I&#x27;ve been through a weight lifting class.  It also does not glide through my hair as easily, and if I&#x27;m not careful it will pull out my hair.  So...long story short, I will keep it and use it because I paid for it, but I will certainly be on the look out for deals on other flat irons.</li>
    <li> The product is good.im purchases 3 time.because i love it but honestly  for quality i dont no yet, because im just purchases less then one month</li>
    <li> this is a great flat iron at a wonderful price.  you can&#x27;t go wrong. I will probably purchased two more for my daughters who also think its great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this HSI straightener in September of 2012 after years of buying straighteners from various brands that never lived up to my expectations. This product has never let me down. Ever. It leaves my naturally wavy, super fine hair as straight and shiny (and somehow still voluminous!) as I could possibly want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $50 this straightener is a STEAL!</li>
    <li> The straightener heats up quickly, and has an adjustable temperature knob. There is a glove provided which was to big for me, I have to let my hair settle a bit. This straightener does leave my hair silky and very smooth. I love it and can&#x27;t wait to fix my hair when I&#x27;m getting ready for my day.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly, does just what is says. My hair holds curl very well with this iron. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener ever made.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like other hair straightener do..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!  I can curl the ends or leave it straight with the twist of my hand.  Great quality!</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with this flat iron...it gets the job done as well as my last and was a good price.  It also came with a sample of argan oil, a glove and carrying case.</li>
    <li> I knew as soon as I opened it, it wasn&#x27;t going to match up to my Chi.  It had a cheap feel to it and the straightening capability to match.  It was promptly returned and a Chi was purchased.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I used to own a GHD flatiron but gave it to my mom and bought this one based on all the glorious reviews.  HSI flatiron is NOT as great as people make it out to be.  It does ok for the money, but really, you get what you paid for.  I should&#x27;ve know that.  Perhaps I&#x27;m biased since my expectation was where my $200 GHD flatiron was and wanted this $50 to perform just as good, but I was truly disappointed when it took twice as long to flatiron my hair and curled hair didn&#x27;t last half a day.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to others unless you are looking for something mediocre.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener! It straightens and curls very well. The only reason it is deducted a star, is because sometimes my hair get stuck. Sometimes. people make straightener where the plates kinda compresses when you straighten(or curls your hair) and your hair gets caught.. I wanted a hair straighter that wouldn&#x27;t get caught in my hair, since my hair is fine. MY hair got stuck a few times, which defeats the purpose of me spending several hours looking at reviews.... But there is a tactic I used so my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck... So it isn&#x27;t that bad. It has a dial so that you can change the temperature of it, for different hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does come with a lot of fun stuff. Like a glove, a red hair straightener bag and a trial size of oil for your hair to protect it from damage. So lots of fun goodies to look forward to!</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far, but it does what it is advertised to do.  Can&#x27;t complain.  I&#x27;d like to see how long it lasts though.  My old Chi&#x27;s always lasted several years.  I have high hopes for this one.  :)</li>
    <li> Wow! I love this flat iron. It&#x27;s amazing! I have always had such a hard time straightening my long, thick, wavy hair.  I have tried several different flat irons and have always wanted a Chi so this year I decided to spend the money on one and then I came across the HSI flat iron on Amazon and after reading the reviews and seeing the low price, I figured how can I go wrong? If it sucks, I am only out $40 but it doesn&#x27;t suck.  In fact, it&#x27;s amazing.  My hair look so straight and it did not take that long to achieve the look. It grips very tight so the hair stays in place and straightens well.  Also, I did not have to put it to the highest temp but I did put it almost to the hottest.  This is the best flat iron I have ever owned and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife. She opened the gift and immediately knew the brand and was extremely happy! Ran upstairs to wash her hair just so she could use it.</li>
    <li> This was the only flat iron that specified its working temp range.  My hairdresser suggested using a low temp 145 F on my hair  Most irons stated their max temp which did not help me. The HSI iron came beautifully packaged including a thick insulated storage bag and a protective glove.</li>
    <li> I have had a Chi hair straightener for 6 years and it has worked great, but was starting to get old and the plates were not aligning correctly anymore. I was afraid I would never find anything comparable to the Chi and I was soooo wrong!! This straightener performs better, has a thicker grip which I personally find makes it easier to control and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry and limp when I am done. I have very unruly,curly, frizzy hair and this straightener works magic on it.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I used to use the CHI, but after seeing the ratings on this, I had to try it. My hair is super course, thick, curly..just really un-tamable, this straightener works AMAZING it takes me about 2-3 hours with a normal straightener, bout an hour with the chi, and about 20-30 mins with the HSI, I LOVE IT!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated: five months after purchase:&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago my iron stopped getting so hot, now when I use it my hair does not stay straight.....its back to my old straightener I guess</li>
    <li> i ordered this because they had a great deal running on it but wasn&#x27;t really sure it was a good product or not. but i am in love with it. this is my first hair straightner and i can&#x27;t believe how easy it is too use. And fast. my freind who is a hairdresser was impressed with it and with what i paid for it. I highly recomend it. never has my hair been so soft and straight :)</li>
    <li> I have went through a few hair straightener in my time. I have very long curly hair that Id rather have straight. This straightener is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. It gets very hot and that&#x27;s a plus because it means faster straightening time. It also has the heat daily on inside of handles so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn heat down as your hands on handle. I love heat dial is on inside between handles because I&#x27;ve turned down heat on a few straighteners before when it&#x27;s on outside of handles. This straightener heats up fast stays hot and my hair looks like silk when  I&#x27;m done. I love this product! I&#x27;d recommend this straightener to everyone who&#x27;s looking to buy one.</li>
    <li> I loved it.Great price for a wonderful product.  It&#x27;s easy to work with and heats up in now time at all.</li>
    <li> It looks and feels good for use once a week better than others in the marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;I don´t know if &amp;#34;Professional Salon Model&amp;#34; claim is right.&lt;br /&gt;I will review it later on next months.</li>
    <li> I liked the flat iron - results were great.&lt;br /&gt;The Argan oil is good quality, howver it is a small portion.</li>
    <li> I got rid of my curling iron because I truly didn&#x27;t need it once I got this. I do wish though I would have gotten a larger one because of how think my hair is; otherwise, I really like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener for my girlfriend since hers broke and she absolutely loves it. Since getting it she straightens her hair all the time now and is always thanking me for it. And the service was fantastic. I had it gift wrapped and shipped to her house and it actually arrived about a week early. Overall, i am a very happy customer with a very happy girlfriend</li>
    <li> This flat iron died after 2 1/2 years of light use.  That being said, I plan to get another one since I really like how it works on my hair and I am used to it.  Especially nice to be able to add a curl or wave of any tightness with the curved edges.  Just tried to use a regular curling iron and it was very difficult to achieve the same effect.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like the size, style, etc of the HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron BUT there is NO WAY it got to 400+ degrees! I really liked the moveable plates and really wish it had gotten hotter. I have full, straight hair and use a flat iron daily to flatten and compact and de-wrinkle my hair. The HSI didn&#x27;t do much to my hair but when my CROC died I thought I would try this one out. No go. I cannot believe the number of good ratings though! Perhaps I got a dud?</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I ordered this thanks to all the great reviews and the price. I have long (6 if not more inches past the shoulders) really wavy and VERY THICK hair. My other straightener is a cheap Remington wet to dry and I honestly reach for that more often because it allows me to straighten larger pieces of hair. I only really use this to go over my hair when it&#x27;s already straight using that straightener. This might work if you have short or thin hair that is easily manageable. If you have hair like mine that is long, thick, and wavy, might want to try something else or stick to your current tool if it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it! I almost bought the infamous CHI for more than twice the price, but glad I didn&#x27;t. This thing works just as good.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this hair straightener for its ease of use. It was easy to adjust the temperature and she really likes how evenly it leaves her hair. She tried the HSI Argan Oil sample and likes the soft sheen left behind. When I ordered the HSI Hair Straightener, I seen the full bottle of HSI Argan Oil for sale on Amazon&#x27;s Web Site but decided to wait until she tried the sample.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughters super thick curls the chi didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten her hair but this flat iron does</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and works great.  The reason I only give it 4 stars is that the plates are short lengthwise - add another inch and it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used! It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or seem to create heat damage. It&#x27;s very effective at straightening a section of hair with only 1 to 2 \\&quot;runs\\&quot; over that section of hair. I&#x27;m VERY pleased with this product &amp; recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Received a different item than pictured.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, whose previous one (which was decent) died.  She borrowed one that made it take even longer to get ready, so she was very happy to get this one - It works better (and faster) than both of the previous ones.  I didn&#x27;t have to go into a salon to figure out which super-expensive model would be worth the price tag, so I&#x27;m happy.  This one had the features I was looking for, such as the ceramic plates and the temperature control, and the packaging and extras made it look pretty sharp when she opened it.</li>
    <li> I had been using a budget model straightener and saw this item on sale so I decided to upgrade. Glad I did. Now I know what a real straightener is like. Works great!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a 23 year old Caucasian male with fine hair.  I use a flat iron everyday to straighten my hair as I have a Mohawk.  I previously used a Paul Mitchell flat iron which was  so so but nothing special.  Decided to replace the flat iron and stumbled across this one.  This flat iron is AWESOME!!!  My hair is softer, shinier, straighter, easier to style all with less effort.  The iron comes with a very nice carry case so to speak, argon oil sample (amazing as well), and the manual all nicely packaged.  Arrived on time in perfect condition, will DEFINITELY reccommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this, and it does get really hot. I have had no problems with this product. The bag and the hair oil that comes with it is nice. I have not tired to used the glove yet. I suppose it would be helpful to use the glove if you sensitive to heat and have more time on your hand. I like to quickly straighten my hair and go on with my day. I have not used this to curl my hair yet. No time to experiment with that right now, but I suppose it would be curl your hair well too.</li>
    <li> It is not hot enough to straighten my hair, I am not sure if its defective..I am not happy with it at all</li>
    <li> I had a Chi flat iron before this flat iron and I have to say I prefer the chi. The HSI does not run throught my hair as smoothly nor does it leave my hair soft as the CHI. The HSI works and it is a decent product but I&#x27;ll go back to the chi product.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love the flat iron...high quality...great price...good service!  It was shipped very fast!  Brand new!  Love it!  Great hairdressing quality.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever had and I have had lots of them. Love the heat adjuster and straightens on the first go through!!</li>
    <li> I had have around 10 or maybe more iron straightens since Ii was a teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first one that gives me the results I been looking for, quick and easy, and with the oil that comes with it, it makes the whole process a lot faster, and my hair looks beautiful afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick wavy hair, so I know how things can be. I really recommend this product, I&#x27;m a happy costumer, the service was great and it arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, for this price, you won&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
    <li> I wish I had ordered this flat iron a long time ago! I had no idea what I was missing.  I would rate it as \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; - it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. It comes with a beautiful travel bag and a very nice heat resistant glove, but I haven&#x27;t had to use it because I&#x27;ve yet to burn myself while using it.  My hair finally looks as straight and shiny as when my stylist does it.  And it stays that way all day long, no matter what the weather.  With my old straightener, my hair would already be frizzing and waving a little on humid days before I could even get out of the house.  Not with this one!  It still looks good when I wake up in the morning, too.  I am very, very happy with this product and feel that its an excellent value for the money!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron that would work on my hair as well as my daughters hair.  We both have different texture hair but need an iron that gets pretty hot.  I had an FHI for a little over a year.  We loved that iron.  We also paid over $100 for that flat iron.  After a year it got a short in it and wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I was upset and was not willing to pay that price again only to have it for a year.  A few weeks later on one of the coupon sites I frequent (hip2save) she said there was a flat iron on amazon for 40 and it had over 2000 reviews with like 4 1/2 stars. I decided to give it a try. I am extremely happy with it.  Its just like my FHI but it doesn&#x27;t go up to 450 degrees but 410 is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has thick, wavy, natural (NOT RELAXED) semi-coarse hair.  Once we use the flat iron her hair with no relaxer is silky, bouncey and full of life.  My hair is kind of fine But extremely curly.  I have very tight spiral curls.  My hair is more than halfway down my back about three inches from my behind when it is straight.  When my hair is curly it is just a little past my shoulders.  Just so you can understand how curly it is.  Alot of flat irons are not able to straighten out my mega curls so if I can find one that can do the job I&#x27;m extremely happy.  I am thinking about buying another one so I don&#x27;t have to share with my daughter.  We brought this iron back in August 2012 and I&#x27;m still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely say buy it.  It really works on ethnic hair (even non relaxed), spanish hair and curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is great if you have curly hair and wish to straighten it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this straightener.  I was skeptical because if a product is that good, why take 75% off the price?!  It is worth the $200.  My hair looks like I had it professionally done everytime I use this and people tell me everyday how great my hair looks.  Would recommend a thousand times over!!</li>
    <li> Then I decided to try this one out.  It works just as good as my other 4 chis I&#x27;ve owner, and thus far, I love it.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll last me longer than the chi - those always gave out on me after 1-2 years.  I like this one too because it comes with a little bag to put it in...good for storage and traveling!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair and I use a straightener daily to completely straighten my hair.  I have worn out several straighteners over the last ten years, most of them being CHIs, but more recently I have switched to a GHD.  With that in mind, my feelings about this straightener is that it is very close, but not quite the quality of a GHD.  It doesn&#x27;t clamp down on your hair just right, making it pull your hair a little as you straighten.  I also think it is a little bit heavier than the CHI or GHD, which can be uncomfortable if you spend much time straightening every morning.  I like the dial that allows you to adjust the heat setting, something none of my previous straighteners had.  Once finished, my hair was just as straight using the HSI as it is using the CHI or GHD and it lasted all day.  I purchased this as a back up to my GHD, and I think it is great for that purpose.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t expect to get a better straightener.  I can&#x27;t speak for the durability of it, since I haven&#x27;t had it that long.</li>
    <li> it sucks . You can tell its made with  Cheap materials</li>
    <li> This flat iron leaves my hair looking very silky and soft. It only goes up to 410 degrees F which is great but does not get my hair as straight, so for a extreme straight look I would have to use my Remington which goes up to 430 degrees. Keep in mind my hair is very curly and wavy in some spots and even coarse in others so I typically need to use a high amount of heat to get it very straight. Overall I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. And the sample of Argan oil was amazing it made my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! It is nice that there are different heat levels. Very happy with it and it was very fairly priced!</li>
    <li> Was so happy to find this for my girlfriend. It was the same thing as she had been using but much cheaper and she likes it even more than the last product. Months later it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Amazing straightens beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;Also gives amazing curls that last all day :)&lt;br /&gt;And to top it off I got an amazing deal at 75% off!</li>
    <li> i wanted to try this iron after having many different irons, including the chi. this is nothing out of the ordinary, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles on your hair, it simple irons it- O.K. just as any other new iron, i suppose. it was not too bad for the price i paid. i rather pay double and buy a chi. next time..</li>
    <li> I  received it a few weeks ago and unfortunately just missed my return deadline. The straightener does not heat up. It just stays at a luke warm temperature with the light flashing and randomly staying solid. I&#x27;m not sure if they sent me a malfunctioning straightener but I don&#x27;t want to spend another $20 shipping and handling just to have them fix it, so it basically was just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got this for wife. She really likes it. Works better than her Chi for a fraction of the price. She appreciates the glove it comes with to keep your hand from burning on the hot hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife and she loves it, seems to help her get ready a little faster.</li>
    <li> got this for my girlfriend and she says is the best one she has ever had.</li>
    <li> It pulls my hair. My Sedu flatiron is much better.</li>
    <li> Good straightener for the price. Only issue is with the manufacturing of it. The red light turns off sometimes, which makes me think I already turned the straightener off, when in fact it is left on. My curling iron has a timer you can set, so it will turn off whenever the number of minutes goes by. If this had  that feature, I would for sure give it 5 stars! As like most women, as we get ready we easily forget to turn these appliances off. But I may be asking for too much. The price was very inexpensive so I have to say it is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick curly hair, and i must say, this thing can get it straighter than any other iron I&#x27;ve ever used and in way less time. Usually it takes at least 30 minutes with my old flat iron, but it only took me 10 to 15 with this product. I also reccomend using the argan oil product that you can also buy on amazon. It makes my hair feel like silk and adds great shine without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> It Was Okay. Not The Best Ive Tried But Defenately Worth The $40 And More</li>
    <li> have natural curly hair which is course also. have to pass the iron through couple times but lasts long time. humid in az now which makes hair worse. did have issue with price week I got this was $50 next week dropped to $40. what gives?</li>
    <li> Got this for an amazing deal and I needed a new straightener, so I figured why not. It works faster than my Chi that I used before, but I noticed that it hurt my hand a little since clamping down is a little less smooth than the Chi. Overall, though, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to heat up.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! Great price for the quality of it!! I will definitely refer to my friends!!</li>
    <li> It slides well, and I love the finish style, it brings up your natural oils and look really professional. I have African hair.</li>
    <li> Love this, I wish I had purchased this earlier.</li>
    <li> Love it would have given a 5 star but no auto shut off</li>
    <li> I bought thos as a gift for my  18 year old daughter. She had an expensive Chi straightener and was not happy with it. She loves this HSI!  She is able to straighten her full thick head of hair in half the time as the Chi.</li>
    <li> This is a Great flat iron in my opinion.... Works very fast so shortens the time it takes to get ready.. Leaves your hair shiny!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product and my wife uses every morning. This is the second one we have bought.</li>
    <li> Awesome flatiron. Really happy with this purchase and at a realistic price (very affordable). Haven&#x27;t had any problems. Straightens my hair easily.</li>
    <li> The multitude of great positive reviews for this flat iron are for very good reason! I am thoroughly happy with the results when using it. There is a definite difference between this and drugstore brand flat irons. My hair was straighter and yet took less time. My hair felt healthier &amp; softer, was shinier &amp; bouncier than with the other brands I have tried. The Argan oil is fabulous too. I feel it definitely protected my fine hair &amp; added shine without a heavy oily after feel.  I DIDN&#x27;T find it too heavy as some said in their reviews. The included HEAT resistant glove &amp; iron sleeve are a major bonus &amp; The price is also a bonus for such a quality Ceramic Tourmaline flat iron. Do yourself a favor, give this iron a try! I am so impressed that I will be looking into more HSI products!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever! Slap a little argan oil in your hair and let it rip. And a really great price! Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay extra money for a popular name brand when I know I can get the same quality for less! THIS IS IT! Works great!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product and it was half the price of my Chi! I have only had it a few months though and it already has a short. It will still heat up, but the light rarely turns green like it&#x27;s supposed to. The Argan oil is the best though!</li>
    <li> perfect! I have only run it through my hair once, and leaves it very soft</li>
    <li> I lost my $100 flat iron on vacation and finally decided to buy a new one. After a week of using it in love it more than the old one. It does the job perfectly. I have thick hair and it straightens it quickly and flawlessly. My daughter has a short pixy that we straighten just to get the bangs perfect and she loves that it doesn&#x27;t burn her for head like the other one did. My old one seared parts of my hair off and I thought it was just too powerful for my needs. This one is awesome. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> outstanding customer service!  Love, Love this flatiron.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks salon great every day.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> HSI flat Iron, Defective out of the box! First time I plugged it in didn&#x27;t work until I reset it and I thought it&#x27;s normal! Then I used it once again I didn&#x27;t reset it but the third time It didn&#x27;t work again until I reset it!!! What a piece of junk! Each time I want to use I have to reset it!! Amazon shouldn&#x27;t sell junk proudcts! I returned the flat iron today I&#x27;m done with HSI!</li>
    <li> I prefer a wider plate because I have so much hair so I find the 1&amp;#34; to be more time consuming. Just like all other straighteners I&#x27;ve used my hair will get stuck in the space around the ceramic plate &amp; it yanks my hair out. Other than that it is a very nice product, I use it with the sample HSI oil that came with it &amp; I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Did not get very hot even when turned to highest setting, and took a long time to get warm.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair really smoothe, unlike the other flat irons i own. I also like the quality and so far I dont have any heat damage. Its a great flat iron for its price :)</li>
    <li> It straightens my hair but it also pulls it.  I don&#x27;t know if others experience this pulling but it&#x27;s super annoying.  I will keep it as it works better than my old Chi but I am not completely in love with it.</li>
    <li> Returned . Fried my hairl. Got too hot.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what all the hype about this straightener is about. It pulls your hair when you straighten it and try to curl with it. It can get really hot but for some reason my style never stays put throughout the day. I cant get my hair straight with one smooth pass. I just expected more from this product after reading the reviews but I only got it for about 38 bucks so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know any hair styling tool could make my hair look so nice!</li>
    <li> So much better than my cheap conair (&amp; it&#x27;s affordabke!). Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased expensive straighteners in the past (Chi, Solia, etc) and this lives up to the quality of those brands. I&#x27;m so happy with my $38 purchase! Also came with a tiny bottle of argan oil, but I didn&#x27;t use it since my hair is so thin.</li>
    <li> Love it, easy to use!</li>
    <li> Its a good iron for the price your paying</li>
    <li> Love that I can use as flat iron or curl hair with it. Would prefer control in easier, safer position to turn off/on.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. There is a dial with heat settings that range from hot to hotter, so you can adjust it depending on what your hair needs. It&#x27;s also a great deal. This is a salon quality flat iron and comparable to a chi which I previously owned, but at a much better price. My hair looks shiny and smooth once I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> Love it, the only thing I would like for it to have is an auto shut off.</li>
    <li> My favorite flat iron ever! I have owned this same model for 2 years and it is awesome.  I knew when the previous one broke (only because I dropped it on the tile floor!) that I was going to replace it with the same model.  It heats up really fast making it very convenient to use.  I love the swivel cord that keeps it from becoming tangled up.</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;First flat iron I received had a manufacturer defect which HSI promptly and courteously took care of. Replacement iron is perfect; I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks and I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the temperature control! I have fine hair and my old flat iron seemed to fry it but now that I can control the heat, my hair is much happier.</li>
    <li> This straightener works fabulously!  I love that it comes with the little extras like the glove, the pouch and especially the argan oil!  It works great and is a great price!</li>
    <li> This one is far better than other more expensive flat irons.</li>
    <li> My daughters has very thick curly hair. The unit heats up fast and works well for her. I would not go as far as calling this unit professional grade. But for a middle school girl with thick hair it works fine.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, as a men since I have shorter hair I should have bought half inches one though i think but if you have long hair this the best product out there.</li>
    <li> excellent,,,nice, awesome,,,&lt;br /&gt;when i use HSI PROFESSIONAL my hair is perfect</li>
    <li> Very nice product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Good quality  for that price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Definetly works just as good as a much more expensive high-end straightener! Also works good for curling hair. Shipped fast and got here before expected. And comes with a nice red travel bag!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Wish I got the bigger one.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I bought this for a vacation house but like it better than my old one!</li>
    <li> Got this for a trip. Dual voltage is a big plus. Tried it out yesterday and it works great. The pretty bag and argan oil sample are nice bonuses.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome!!!!  Price is great and works even better than the more expensive Chi.</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about it so far.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well and fast.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because so many people had rave reviews, but I was still sceptical, coming from being a Chi user for 10 years! I have to say, I LOVE it! It straightens and curls my hair perfectly. I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this, love it!!</li>
    <li> Works great for the money.</li>
    <li> This works as well as a Chi.  The two things I don&#x27;t like are the weight and color.  It is heavier than a Chi, and the color is a dull, industrial black.  I wish it was at least shiny black.  (That&#x27;s just a woman thing, I guess.) But it does come with a pink satin case which is nice. :-)  It does the job nicely, and for the price, it is a close second to a Chi.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! Does her hair in 5 to 10 mins. Note it heats up very fast!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter with super kinky curly hair, I had bought her a 2 inch flat iron but it didn&#x27;t heat enough nor did it straighten her hair. So after reading the reviews for this one, I knew it was the one for her. She&#x27;s 14 and wants straight hair, but was not born with it and Japanese straightening is just not within our budget. I didn&#x27;t want to use chemicals on her young hair. We were skeptical of a new iron, but we had hoped. There is a mitt inside so not to burn your hand, the iron got somewhat hot, but we didn&#x27;t have to use the mitt. My granddaughter is now one of the happiest kids on the block because her hair is not straight and not at the cost of 109. here in MA. Very happy with this Flat Iron</li>
    <li> Disclaimer - I don&#x27;t straighten my hair every day like some. That being said... I love this straightener. Prior to this I owned a Chi and to me this works so much better. I have VERY thick hair that is impossible to wear without doing something with. This straightener greatly cut down the amount of time I spent straightening my hair. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. Once it does go out on me (which it inevitably will) I will absolutely buy again!</li>
    <li> gift for my daughter, she raves about it.</li>
    <li> Heats up nice. But it doesn&#x27;t go through your hair as smoothly as a chi</li>
    <li> I really question if these products are brand-new or not. My package came on schedule, but the free pouch that the flat iron was in was badly stained. Furthermore, it did not seem as if the flat iron was 100% brand-new, and the bottle containing the oil was very scratched as if it had been used before.</li>
    <li> a waste of money! i have only used it less than 5 times and now it&#x27;s broken !!! SO DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> This is great hair iron. It works great. I am glad I bought it. If you want a hair iron that works on hard to straighten waves this is the one.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is exactly what I needed! It is very easy to use, the size is great and since I recently went from very long hair to a short &amp;#34;Bob&amp;#34; a good quality flat iron is what I need now! Thank you too for the glove and travel pouch!</li>
    <li> Love this Flat iron! It heats up very quickly and works great! I usually have to use a flat iron on the hottest setting, but not with this one. I only have to have it about half way up and it does an excellent job of straightening my hair. I would highly recommend it. An added bonus was it was much more affordable that the last one I bought.</li>
    <li> The order arrived promptly and I am very pleased, it has met my expectations and I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. No pulling or tugging just smooth hair.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does exactly what I want it to, Ave a bag of chips! Now if only my hair wasn&#x27;t so unruly and would actually stay how I style it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 13 year old daughter.  She has very thick long hair and usually gets too frustrated with doing her hair to do more than put it in a pony tail.  Day one of using this product not only did she see a huge difference but so did everyone she ran in to.  This was a gift for her birthday but now I am wanting one for myself!</li>
    <li> I had an old flat iron that i replaced and i am very happy that I did. The HSI flat iron gets much hotter and works much better.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I read so many good reviews on Amazon, but I did pay attention to few reviews where reviewers said it died after 3-4 months, so I&#x27;ll do an updated review after a year. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and it works fine. I have a pretty fine hair so it&#x27;s not like I needed industrial-strength straighter. I really liked the price although the price wasn&#x27;t as great as it could&#x27;ve been with shipping + duty to Canada. Anyway it&#x27;s a reliable product that arrived earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these and I love it. I have very fine hair and love that you can adjust the temperature. This second one seems like it might be of slightly inferior quality in materials, but I have no problem with the performance. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy/frizzy hair that usually takes at least 45 minute to straighten...but this straightener is AMAZING!  One swoop through and my hair is smooth, soft and shiney!!  The straightener gets hot quickly and is super easy to use!  It came with a sample of oil that I haven&#x27;t tried yet and also comes with a very pretty red satin bag that will come in handy when traveling.  Very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast.  Nice, even, consistent heat.  Leaves hair with nice feel and body.  I like that it also makes pretty ribbon like curls in my hair. Good on my African American hair.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t even worth one star in my opinion. The absolute worst straightener I&#x27;ve used. I wish I could get my money back! It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it claims, it snags my hair while I&#x27;m straightening, and my hair won&#x27;t stay \\&quot;straight\\&quot; for more than 20 minutes after I just spent 40 doing it. I dont recommend it and I&#x27;m not sure how they can claim it&#x27;s \\&quot;worth\\&quot; $299.99 because there is NO way it&#x27;s worth that. I almost feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed. :(</li>
    <li> This flat iron was a at a great price.  I got it for my 13 year old sister.  She loves it.  Just a bonus that it came with the extra pouch and argan oil.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and this works great for me. I also wear my hair in a ponytail often and this gets rid of the bump from that. The indicator light is great so you know the iron is hot enough before you start straightening. Great price for a great value.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s easy and very fast.&lt;br /&gt;it takes less than 20 sec to heat up to my desired temperature.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using my flat iron for a few months now and I have to say I am very impressed! My Chi died on me and I certainly did not want to shell out another hundred bucks to buy one when I hadn&#x27;t even had mine for a year. I looked on Amazon and the HSI had wonderful reviews, and for the price I thought, why not? It came quickly, and with a free sample of Biosilk hair serum, as promised. It works just as well as the more expensive flat irons, but for such a much more reasonable price! I will certainly purchase from this seller, and definitely from this brand again.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to replace a CHI, that broke.  I have to say, I was a devoted CHI user, but after using the HSI a couple of times, I have a found a new favorite.  I have gotten several comments on how great my hair looks, and I have noticed that even on the second day after I flat iron, I need to run over my hair again just minimally.  I love that it has a temperature control.  I received a sample of Argon oil, instead of the Biosilk, but since it was a free sample, that was fine with me.  I also had a glove included in the box.  I&#x27;m guessing it is a heat protection glove, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything about it in the paperwork that came with the iron.  I have not needed to use it, as the flat iron does a great job of keeping the heat on the plates.  I would definitely recommend this brand to anyone looking for a great flat iron at a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> Love this flattening iron! After 6 faithfulness years, my salon purchased iron finally quit. I had a tough time replacing it for my very naturally curly hair, until I found this one. So glad for the previous reviews, because they were right on.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. This heats up pretty quickly and is able to straighten a lot of hair at once.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I had the chi for many years when it stopped working.  The first time I used this flat iron, my hair was perfect - something I haven&#x27;t seen since I had my hair styled professionally.  This iron is hot which I need for my thick, frizzy hair.  The Bio Silk sample was great.  I have been using the chi serum for a while, and it worked just as well without the strong smell.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Straightener 5 years ago and it was a Conair. I had never used a straightener before and at the time, it seems to do well. But after years of using it, it felt like it would straighten my hair but hours later my hair would not be that straight anymore. And after I straightened it, my hair seems oily or not soft. My friend has the in-styler and my hair felt better with that but I did not want to pay that much for a straightener. I found this on amazon and saw many videos and read many reviews. My hair is damaged from heat so I had stopped straightening it for a while. My friend recommended using Argon oil. I have been using Argon oil for months. I use Organix. So I decided on buying this straightener because everyone said it was amazing and better then chi and the in-styler. When it came, it did come with a heat glove, the straightener in the red sleeve, and little Argon Oil packet. I thought when it said \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; that you could use it maybe about 5 times and it had a lid. But it is a packet you cut or tear. The oil does make my hair really soft! I plugged in the HSI and it took about 5 minutes to heat. I was so excited to use it because every time i straighten my hair, it never stays or it does not even straighten all the way. After straightening, I noticed that my hair is softer feeling then my old straightener. That is a plus. But it still does not straighten the ends of my hair. It curves. I am not sure if that is because my hair is semi-dead or not. It still takes a few tries to straighten one part of my hair. I was hoping like one stroke through. I guess you can curl your hair with this straightener too but Have not figured that out yet. I do recommend this straightener but I feel like it is like every other straightener out there. Nothing special. I have only used it 3 times. I will update more if something comes up. My hair is a medium length curly, wavy, frizzy hair if you are wondering. :)</li>
    <li> so far this straightner is perfect, i have long hair wavy hair and it took less then 10 minutes to straighten my hair..my hair felt silky smooth...i would definitely recommend this to anyone especially for the price..</li>
    <li> I was super excited about the great reviews for this product. First, it made my hair dry. I thought maybe it was just me but I don&#x27;t know... anyway, it fell off my 3 foot tall counter and just split right in half. I&#x27;ve only had it about 2 months! Cheap plastic! Worst product I&#x27;ve bought. Ugh.</li>
    <li> Purchased these irons after looking at all the wonderful reviews on amazon. My hair is very thick and frizzy. The irons don&#x27;t manage to straighten my hair that well though they do manage to get rid of some of the frizz. With previous irons I could go without using heat until the next wash, but not with these. I have to use them everyday, even between washes.  Also, they are incredibly heavy and I find them rather cumbersome. my hands start to ache after using them.  I used to use a babyliss a few years ago. I think I might go back to them.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, so I have always avoided any curling or straightening because it takes so long to do all of my hair. This iron is hot enough that I can go much faster than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s really nice that it doesn&#x27;t take half an hour to straighten, but just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> HSI flat iron is more than I expected. As I age, my hair started to not only thin out, but became fine and frizzy. As a result, I had see through scalp with flat and frizzy hair. My main goal for making the purchase is to straighten the frizziness. However, it did much more than that. It styles my hair however I want it. I used it to add volume on top near the roots, straighten the mid section and finish by curling the ends. By doing this, my hair looks fuller, shiny and stylish. In short, I like this flat iron because, it ables me control the styles of my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the HSI Straightner!! Recently purchased this product because I wanted to try something new and it has already replaced my many Chi straighteners and for a fraction of the price! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I just bought this flat iron after owning three Chi irons.  So far, I think it is just as good as the Chi.</li>
    <li> Love my new straightner! Its affordable and works great...my hair gets really straight, smooth and shiny.  Even my coworkers noticed a difference with my hair. I am so happy I chose this product.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on flat irons and am delighted with my choice. This iron is of light weight, heats quickly and extremely easy to use. I love the shine it leaves on my hair. It&#x27;s a powerful iron and at the right price.</li>
    <li> Dual voltage is always challenging - I used this flat iron every day for two weeks without any issues.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these to replace 2 chi straighteners. I like the adjustable heat setting and the auto shut off. Works Great! Very happy.</li>
    <li> The product is very comparable to the chi I bought a year ago. I think I liked the chi better, functionality wise, but it got fried, so I would prefer to spend much less money on a product that does the job just great(only complaint is that is smells strange when hot and doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast as a chi). Otherwise, I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice presentation, able to adjust desired heat. Good quality product. Definitely recommend this product. Free bio silk sample included. Glove and storage in silk included as well.</li>
    <li> As described . Straightens without damaging. My hair looks smoothe and it doesn&#x27; take too long to style. For the price- this is superior- no need to break the bank with designer names.</li>
    <li> This flat Iron is fantastic.  I have very long, thick wavy hair and this iron turns my hair into perfectly straight shiny hair.  I love it and the price is great.  Heat&#x27;s up quickly and seriously  does a great job.  Truly professional salon quality</li>
    <li> Since this was my first flat iron purchase, I did some research before purchasing.  I am very happy with the quality and performance of this product.  Definitely worth it and it arrived earlier than promised. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a flat iron to replace my Chi and really didn&#x27;t want to spend the bigger dollars for a Chi.  Bought an inexpensive flat iron to get by, but my daughter was NOT happy with it.  So when I was browing through Amazon, I came across the HSI&#x27;s great price but thought I better read the reviews first.  The majority of the reviews were exceptional, so I ordered.  Received it within the timeframe.  It works as well or better than the Chi.  I was a little intimidated by the high heat volume, so I started on the low end.  My daughter and I use it for basic straightening; we do not have thick, wavy hair so will probably never use on the very high heat.  I am extremely happy with this product and even happier with the price.  (My Chi lasted 2 years, so hoping this one lasts as long.)</li>
    <li> I have used it once, very satisfied and easy to use and light weight.  I do recommend this product and very good price too</li>
    <li> After spending $100 on a different flat iron that had similar reviews it was hard to imagine that I could get this great of a product for this low of a price. I&#x27;ve had this for quite some time now and still find that it works just as great as when I first got it. In fact, anytime anyone I know is asking about flat irons, I provide them this link and encourage them to get this one. Definitely worth the money, plus some.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly impressed with the product.  I use it everyday and it straightens my hair very well.  I like the temp. settings and the tangle free cord.  Everyone should own one!</li>
    <li> well packaged, arrived on time, but quality is not the best - i know how to use this flat iron and results were not very satisfactory. DO NOT BUY IT -- cheers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works really well. I have a lot of hair so the ceramic plate is not as long as I would like it to be. Regardless, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Great flat iron - love that I can control the amount of heat so my hair never \\&quot;cooks\\&quot;.  Very easy to use, quick to heat and my hair finishes smooth.  Easy to curl hair under or with a flip.</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up incredibly fast, and keeps its heat long enough for me to flatten by 34\\&quot; long hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron because it has an adjustable heat control.  I have fine hair so being able to control the amount of heat is important.  As a bonus it comes with a nice travel bag and glove sample of Bio Silk treatment.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new straightener when I ran across this one.  After reading the reviews, I knew this was the one for me.  This is, hands down, the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ve tried several, and my most recent one before the beloved HSI, was a cheapy from good ol&#x27; Walmart, which left my hair full of static.  The HSI, however, leaves my hair so soft and shiny, with no static.  Plus, it straightens the first time.  It heats up super fast, so I can go from bed head to super sleek in 10 minutes flat.</li>
    <li> This product works great and I have had no complaints. Also bought at a great price. I would most definitely recommend .</li>
    <li> This flat Iron heats up very quickly and makes my hair silky smooth! It is a great deal, and I will purchase another for a gift for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Thrilled to see so many people are happy with this flat iron. It did absolutely nothing for me but frustrate the heck out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to replace a 450 degree flat iron that died after a tragic bathroom fall after a year of great productivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product barely worked on my hair. I would call my hair light frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks I gave up and replaced this with the more expensive brand I was using before which is working perfectly.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS BEEN SO FAR THE BEST FLAT IRON EVER I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AT FIRST SIGHT I CAN ALSO DO CURLS WITH IT TOO IM IN LOVE BEST YOU CAN BUY !!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener i have ever had.Shipping was very fast.Highly recommended .It is light weight and heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> This straightener was a great price for what I was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like others that I have had. Works well for straightening and curling.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair.  This straightener works great with my Uberliss hair products.  You can find these products here [...]</li>
    <li> Bought this product based on reviews and for the price it did a terrific job. My hair is very kinky and this product made it very straight.  Received lots of complement on how my hair looked and it was very soft.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my new flat iron...it heats up really quickly!!!! The carrying case is an added bonus.  This was a great deal....</li>
    <li> I was a loyal buyer of Chi flat irons, but I wanted to try this one because it can be used in Europe, the reviews were so good, and the price was so much better. I&#x27;m so glad I did! This flat iron glides through my hair better than the chi, and I love the adjustable heat setting. It truly straightens with one pass and leaves my hair looking glossy and frizz-free.</li>
    <li> i love it it works great got it fast and came with extra equipment in the pachaging was awesome  thanksss</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY SATISFACTORY FLAT IRON. I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THE ABILITY TO SET THE TEMPERATURE..IT SEEMS LESS DAMAGING TO THE HAIR..MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE WEIGHT..I FIND IT HEAVIER THAN MOST, BUT SAVING THE HAIR MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
    <li> It heats well and stays at temperature and is not heavy. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t turn off after a period of time. I have to be sure to check it every time before I leave home. I know it&#x27;s a professional iron and that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t shut off.</li>
    <li> You will not be disappointed. It&#x27;s great and heats up fast.  Professional level. Smooths and makes hair shiny, with only little work required.</li>
    <li> The product we purchased was the HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  This was bought as a present for our granddaughter.  She has found the product to easy to use and works very well.</li>
    <li> I had a CHI for 5 years, but it blew up when I tried to use it in Ireland. Not the CHI&#x27;s fault. I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it so I began looking for other options. I read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a try. It works AMAZING! It is absolutely a steal. I have very thick wavy hair and most straighteners don&#x27;t work well for it. This one does the trick. I hope it will last me 5 years like the CHI.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical about this at first because the price was too good to be true but Great straightener! Heats up fast and straightens great, love it.</li>
    <li> Daughter Loves it! She got this last year for Christmas, and its still living up to her daily use. It gets plenty how, she does have to use the glove but it doesnt get in the way while using it. very happy with this product:)</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this straightener since the reviews were fabulous.... Unfortunately I am not overly impressed.  I have owned many different flat irons, they all seem to work the same :( not sure why I expected more from this iron... I guess I was just hopeful. I have medium&lt;br /&gt;Thickness hair that is wavy ~ my hair still seems frizzy after I iron it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I paid about double as everyone in the States because I had it sent abroad. The shipping was about 30$... which is fair enough if I can get an awesome straightener for about 70$. When I opened the box, I was a little disappointed about the free argan oil. I thought that I would be getting a small sample sized bottle, but it was just a small bag for one time use. For the straightener itself, it heats up really quickly, and straights the hair really well. However, I like to use a straightener to curl my hair too. This product claims that it can flip and curl. It&#x27;s just not very good for curling at all. I get some really lame waves with this one. I really had high expectations. I think I wouldn&#x27;t be as disappointed if I lived a place where I didn&#x27;t pay so much for shipping. And just FYI, before this I purchased this one, I had a Babyliss ionic 230 that eventually died on me after 5 years - that one made awesome curls!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product.  Usually it takes forever to straighten my thick, long hair; but this works so quickly.  The ability to set different temperature levels is very nice, however I have only used it on full.  It heats up quickly and leaves my hair silky.  I recommend buying the holder for it because it really is a nice addition and makes the process and the storage much easier.  I actually prefer this over my old Chi. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have used a Paul Mitchell straightener for about 2 years-love it....but it finally died. I bought 2 others and had to take them back-they ripped and pulled my hair and just did not get hot. this one though is amazing! I have thick naturally curly hair and this straightener does the trick! It is very comfy to use and gets super hot-hair is shiny and sleek. I cannot say enough good things about it and the price was just unbeatable!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and was what my wife was looking for. She is happy with this flatten-er / straightener.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for a trip to Italy. While it works both domestically and internationally, the straightening is just so-so. The plates don&#x27;t glide through my hair like my conair does.</li>
    <li> Works as described. And you get what you pay for as it does not literally straighten your hair but may be 60-65%</li>
    <li> Received the product and it was a great addition to my collection. I would recommend this item too my fellow stylist.</li>
    <li> I stopped \\&quot;relaxing\\&quot; my hair several years ago in favor of my natural kinky-curl. This product gives me the option of straight hair that is just as silky-shiny and can hold a style every bit as well as chemically relaxed hair</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3RQXOMOR5ZVJ1]]Amazing Flat Iron.. Don&#x27;t Let The Price Fool You.. It works better than most 300 dollar irons.. Don&#x27;t hesitate hit the buy button and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money and very comparable to CHI.  I would recommend getting the stand that goes along with it.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally manageable straight hair.  Pros:  - Straightens, curls, flips, and creates waves beautifully.  - Goes up to 410F.  - Comes with a glove and carrying case; great for traveling.  - Floating plates so my hair never gets caught or tugged.  - Swivel cord  - Green light when ready, red when not.  Cons:  - It takes 2-3 minutes, more or less, to heat up to the highest setting.  - Does not automatically turn off... which is bad for those of you that are forgetful</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews for this product. The free stuff is nice, but it feels like my hair is sticking to the plates. My daughter hated it so much she just gave it away.</li>
    <li> This iron is easy to operate and works quite well.  Like the adjustable heat setting.  Comes with a travel bag, too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the CHI that I had, but couldn&#x27;t afford a CHI at this time...</li>
    <li> This product was for my daughter and she loves it. She says it heats up fast, the glove and oil was a great bonus and it straightens great!</li>
    <li> My sister and I have two different hair textures. Her hair is more of a fine texture with loose curls. My hair is definitely thicker with tighter curls. We are both natural which means no relaxers. The flat iron works very well for different types of hair and I&#x27;m impressed with the outcome every time. My hair is shinier and has a bounce to it that it never did with other flat irons. It&#x27;s not expensive and works as if you just came from a salon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron after reading the reviews and deciding to part with a 10-year old, unweildy 3-inch iron. So glad I did! This iron is so much better than I thought any iron could be. It talkes no time to heat up, is easy to maneuver, and works great. I love that the switches are not on the handle right where you hold it, as they are on my curling iron. I have thick curly hair that is frizzy daily. This iron takes so much less time to straighten my hair than my last one and leaves it looking like it is naturally straight--definitely a professional grade tool. Great purchase at a great price!</li>
    <li> I was using a chi iron but it was only 1/2 inch so I wanted to buy one that was a little bigger so that it would not take so long to do my hair. This iron is great! It is very easy to use and does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the positive reviews, the price, and the claim that it is \\&quot;professional\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it and went to plug it in, I was surprised by how cheap the plastic is on the plug. Like a cheap dollar store toy. It heated up pretty quickly and I used it on my daughters hair. I was pleased with how straight and smooth it turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I few days later, I went to use it again. I plugged it in and turned it on. I blow dried my hair, which takes at least 10 to 15 minutes. The flat iron still wasn&#x27;t hot! It did heat up till the red light turned green shortly after but that&#x27;s way too long to wait. Also, as I was using it, it kept cooling off so the light would change back to red. Ridiculous. I&#x27;m&#x27; returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is NO WAY this thing is worth $200. My Conair from Wal-Mart is superior to this.</li>
    <li> Great product...made my hair so smooth...and I have tried many products...thank you! Would recommend to my friends. Used it for the first time yesterday and enjoyed how quick it smoothed my hair</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that drives me nuts, so most days I use a straightener.  My old straightener was worn out, so I read reviews and settled on the HSI Tourmaline model.  I am very pleased with the quality of this straightener, especially for the cost.  It has easy-to-use temperature controls, sturdy handle with good grip, and it comes with a nice case.  It works great on my hair, and can even be used to curl the ends.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron as a gift for my wife &amp; she keeps raving about how well it works!  There is a noticeable difference in the softness &amp; sheen of her hair since using it vs. the cheap model she had before.  I think she would agree that this is a very recommendable &amp; quality product.</li>
    <li> I liked it very much until it suddenly stopped turning on after just a couple of months. I assume that it&#x27;s just a problem at the plug, but pushing the reset button does nothing. I&#x27;ll be sending it back to the manufacturer for repair or replacement under warranty, since it&#x27;s cheaper than buying a different new one, but I&#x27;m very frustrated to have to pay the $20 for the service and not to have it to use in the meantime. Besides the fact that I won&#x27;t trust it again. I really like the concept of it being usable internationally, but if that&#x27;s the reason for its unreliability, I&#x27;d recommend getting one with just a basic plug instead.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this flat iron for Christmas.  She could not be happier that she got one.  I like the fact it has an automatic shutoff just in case you forget to turn it off for any reason.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the dial to turn the setting is in a hard place to reach; otherwise it has been a great present.</li>
    <li> I have thin asian hair. I use it to straighten my hair on a low setting. And, I&#x27;ve curled my hair with it on a medium setting. The curls lasted for a day and a half without any additional hair products added. It&#x27;s a really good flat iron. I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends and they all love it. Got it for a great price after black friday sale.</li>
    <li> This was the first flat iron I purchased and I wish I&#x27;d bought it earlier! I recently got a bob haircut and needed a straightening tool to keep my hair from flying all over the place. The salon recommended a $275 GHD iron and after doing some research I decided on the HSI. I only wish I had bought it when my hair was still long. I highly recommend this product! It arrived quickly and the red pouch is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a gift &amp; seems to be perfect.  Arrived on time, easy to use, packaged nicely.Had read all the reviews &amp; this seemed to be a top performer.</li>
    <li> What a great flat iron! i mean its professional grade.. it gets hot super fast and works great.  love the heat glove and pretty pink pouch it comes with.  you can adjust the temp and straightens my hair in a flash, i have to run it through just once and its perfect!  cant beat it for the price, there is no way you can get this quality at this price anywere else def recommend!</li>
    <li> I love my new HSI straightener!!! I have very curly course hair and it leaves my hair straight and soft to the touch. I have been very happy with this product. It shipped quick and the packaging was very nice. It came with a satin pouch for storage and travel.  I would definitely recommend buying the holder like I did. I have it suctioned to the mirror and it keeps my HSI straightener neat and out of the way.</li>
    <li> Why do they insist on increasing the price of products that are in my cart while I am still shopping.  This went up 5$ from one minute to the next. Congrats on no sale since I removed it from my cart!  I don&#x27;t care that it was only $5 difference. This happened to me on 2 different products in the same day. It feels like they are trying to trick me into spending more than what I initially intended.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I was looking for a CHI when I read the reviews for the HSI. Upon its arrival I washed and dried my hair( I usually go to my stylist for a wash and style every two weeks) rubbed a little of the oil sample in my hair and was truly amazed at the results. As I said I don&#x27;t normally do my hair other than daily hair styles in between appts. I love my flat iron and intend on purchasing another for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly what is listed. Wanted a dual voltage appliance to be used abroad (Paris) &amp; it worked just fine. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have recently gotten my hair cut very short (a bob just below the chin) and it looks better straightened, however my regular one wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I have very thick, wavy, stubborn hair and this worked great. Unlike the chi this has a temp. setting knob. For my hair I keep it about 400 degrees or so and it straightens with one swipe!  I will agree with some reviewers about the red/green light, I&#x27;m not sure what it means either, however I&#x27;ve noticed it usually changes color when I have it clamped shut on my hair and when I let go. Maybe it&#x27;s a temp thing? Either way it doesn&#x27;t hurt the performance.</li>
    <li> I have a short bob and I was looking for a good 1 inch flat iron for less than $100. This one had good reviews and I am very happy with it. Extras included in the box are a heat glove and an argon oil sample. Great deal, great flat iron.</li>
    <li> so far this product has been great its hot enough for my hair (i have long medium - fine hair it has cut down the time i have to spend straightening it and would def recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I ordered this item just a few days ago. I had a cheap flat iron and it really didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my hair like I wanted, plus it pulled my hair at times.  I love the price of this one!!! What a bargain. It heats up super fast. It doesn&#x27;t take but just a few minutes now to be done with straightening my hair. I tried the sample of the argan oil and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it made my coarse hair feel.  I will definitely be buying a bottle of the HSI argan oil and soon as my sample runs out.</li>
    <li> I researched alot of flat irons before making the decision to purchase this one. In my opinion, this iron gives you the best value for your dollars.  It&#x27;s just as good as the more pricey ones, and in some ways even better.  It comes with a nice drawstring pouch, that you can use for carrying or storage - a nice touch.  It looks sleek and stylish, heats up quick and evenly.  Nice product, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was in need of a good quality straightener. I currently have a cheap one from the grocery store. I started with this product on the lowest setting as I have fine and thin hair. It was no where near warm enough. I ended up with it on the hottest setting but wasn&#x27;t happy with the finished product at all. For this being a \\&quot; professional grade\\&quot; it sure did a lousy job. I don&#x27;t like the way it opens and closes either. Save your money and get a cheap one. My $20 one works much better than this \\&quot;professional\\&quot; one. Disappointed for sure!</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional flat iron is, I think, just as good or better than the Chi.  It left my very curly hair silky and smooth.  I liked that you don&#x27;t get burned by the handle like some other flat irons.</li>
    <li> This straightener is worth every penny. It is very sturdy and is able to straighten my fairly thick and wavy hair easily. I would definitely recommended, especially considering the great price.</li>
    <li> The HSI Flat Iron is my favorite flat iron.  I&#x27;ve purchased two others over the past 5 years, but this one is my favorite by far.  I have very thick wavy hair and the HSI flat iron really does the job.  I don&#x27;t have to flat iron the same sections over and over, which is really nice.  The flat iron is very well made.  It has a good grip and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch from Blue Novelties. I LOVE this straightener!! I have had a CHI straightener and ProLiss, but this one is by far the best I have owned. I like that there is a dial with the degrees on it and I can set it to the temperature I need. I also was impressed with the storage pouch that came with the straightener. This is a great product that you can buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> I just bought this straightener - got it in the mail yesterday, and it&#x27;s absolutely not working. I turn it on -- no light comes on, it&#x27;s not heating up. Can someone help me? Who should I contact to get a replacement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter-in-law and she loves it!  She has thick hair and the iron grips it with just the right amount of tension and straightens it well.  It&#x27;s just the right size, and the price was great! I don&#x27;t know what else you could ask from a flat iron, but this one does exactly what she wants it to.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a anniversary gift for my wife (6th Anniversary and Iron is one of the traditional gifts, so obviously I got her Hair Irons). She has used them a couple of times so far and had no issues with them. Infact she stated that these are the best hair irons she has ever used! She has thick wavy hair and this glides over (wet and dry) and straightens a treat! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I am usually a no-muss, no-fuss kind of person.  My hair is is in a ponytail at least 6 days a week - purely out of laziness.  But I bought this on a whim because of those occasional days I want to do my hair.  It is sooo easy to use and my hair is done quickly.  My hair is long (mid-back), wavy, and of average thickness.  It takes me only about 10 minutes to straighten it out - and it stays straight all day.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that i found very nice Hair Straighter! First of all price is great , second i resived in very short time. And most important it works greate , my hair lools shine and straigh it is amazing product!</li>
    <li> I have just a wave in my long hair but this product straightens it in no time and really gets the frizz out.  Easy to use and great for the price, have reccomended to my curley haired girls and friends!!!  It comes with oil, love it.</li>
    <li> OKAY SO I TRIED AND IT WAS GREAT!! SO I HAVE BLEACHED BLONDE HAIR AND THAT IS A WHOLE LOT OF DAMAGE IN ITSELF. SO USING HEATING PRODUCTS ARE DANGER!! LOL BUT I SAW THIS WON READ THE REVIEWS AND DECIDED TO PURCHASE.. AND I AM GLAD I DID LEAVES MY HEAR STRAIGHT AND SOFT.. IT ALSO CAME WITH A SMALL BOTTLE OF ARGAN OIL AND IT IS GREAT BOUGHT MORE!! EVERY GIRL NEEDS THIS FLAT IRON!!</li>
    <li> What is this project for my wife for her birthday and she could not be happier. It does exactly what it says and the best thing of all is the time it saves, what used to take her an hour to straighten her hair now she accomplish in about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love how quickly this iron heats up. It&#x27;s done a super job and us a gear price! Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have honestly never owned such an amazing straightener! I have really thick hair and the reason I ordered it was because of the good reviews I read, especially from people who have thick hair and they said it works perfect. It honestly only takes me 10 minutes to straighten my hair now but if I used any of the other straighteners I owned before it would take at least half an hour. Best money I have ever spent!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  It works great for my semi-wavy, fine hair!  It leaves my hair soft and smooth.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. I couldnt wait to give it to her, as she wanted to use my daughters, but she was away. Heats up quick, did exactly as she wanted it to do. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron in hopes it would just as good as the CHI if not better. I have gone through 2 CHIs in two years which seems a little ridiculous for as much as you spend on them to break a year after the purchase. This flat iron works amazingly and makes my hair look silky smooth. Exactly what I was looking for.I would buy more from HSI in terms of hair care.</li>
    <li> Bought this flat iron for my daughters Birthday and she loves it! Highly recommend.. looking to to buy more for Christmas!!</li>
    <li> I dont think this straightener is the best as many people are saying here, I found that the Remington one is almost the same price and does a better job. This starightenener does not make my hair straight until I pass through the hair section at least five or six times knowing that my hair is not even kinky, I have wavy hair( middle eastern hair), I wont recommend it to anyone because you can get the remington for few bucks more and expect better results in less time</li>
    <li> This straightener is really great. I have very thick hair and a little worried about how well it would work but Im very impressed. Im buying one for my daughter and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this straightner and it came as promised on time.  The packaging was perfect. I kept it for myself but would have been pleased to give or receive as a gift.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> These irons heat up really quickly, they also have a dial to set the desired temperature.  They are light and easy to use.  I have short hair and the first day I used them, around 10 people commented on how great my hair looked that day :)</li>
    <li> This is my first \\&quot;real\\&quot; flat iron (I&#x27;ve only had a mini flat iron before) and I have to say that it&#x27;s a  great product! I&#x27;ve tried a ghd, which IS a hundred times better than this, but also WAY more expensive. For the money, I think this is the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;ll start out with the things I loved about this product. I like that it has a quilted texture, making it easier to grip when styling. The swivel cord is also quite useful. I like that you can easily adjust the temperature. It heats up pretty fast, and has a nice indicator light that tells you when the iron has gotten to your desired temperature. As for the actual styling, it does a good job, but not amazing. I naturally have quite straight, thin-ish hair (it just gets sort of wavy near the ends) so it straightens very easily on me (but only on the highest heat setting; I do use heat protectant). However, when my mom (who has thicker, coarser, and more unruly hair than I do) tried it, it didn&#x27;t do basically anything to make her hair straighter, and it was on the highest temp. Another thing I don&#x27;t like are the size and quality of the plates. They don&#x27;t really seem like real or high-quality ceramic, and are on the shortish side. And speaking of quality, overall it isn&#x27;t top notch in terms of outward appearance. It looks even worse than a $20 flat iron; it has some small scratches and scuffs and the plastic it&#x27;s made of doesn&#x27;t seem like the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually quite wary about ordering anything that&#x27;s not directly sold by Amazon, but this seller, Blue Novelties, had great service. The packaging for the flat iron was great, and it comes with a protective sleeve for the iron, a heat-resistant glove, a sample size of HSI&#x27;s argan oil, and a 20% off coupon for HSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, if you are looking for a good flat iron that&#x27;s on the cheaper side, this will be great for you. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people with super curly and thick hair.</li>
    <li> The adjustable heat setting is beneficial. Straightening my hair is must faster than flat iron I had without the heat adjustment. I actually enjoy straightening my hair now. Can&#x27;t beat the value for this price.</li>
    <li> I read many of the reviews for this flat iron, as well as others before purchasing. The control for this is on the inside of the iron. But this is not a problem at all. It is easy to turn off and on and unlike other flat irons, I am not constantly hitting the on/off button. Also people reported that the iron was hot to the touch and it made their hands hot. I have not experienced this at all. The flat iron works magic for my hair, leaving it silky and shiney. It also straightens but gives body as well. I would never purchase any other brand of flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> My gf was complaining about how she hated her hair straightener to her friend. I over heard the convo and decided to hunt for one for Xmas. I got this one and she can&#x27;t stop raving about how great it is. How well it works. How shiny it makes her hair. Now  the best bd ever! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi for 4 years and really enjoyed it.  It was hot for my thick hair, it was lightweight, it glided smoothly through my hair, and it did the job perfectly.  It did break but honestly it was my fault because I yanked it out of the plug and the GFI box cracked.  I was desperate for a new flat iron but it was around the holidays and I simply did not have time for additional shopping.  I came to my favorite shopping place, Amazon, and saw that the highest rated, best- selling flat iron was this HSI.  I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand but it isn&#x27;t something I keep up to date with so given the excellent reviews and good price I went ahead and place the order even though I had a nagging feeling I should stick with what works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat iron arrives and I&#x27;m excited to try a new product.  I plug it in and adjust the heat setting to the highest.  Immediately I notice the temperature dial is flimsy and rotates too easily.  If you brush against the dial while using the product I feel certain it would move, changing the temp without your meaning to do so.  I had a Clairol many years ago and it&#x27;s temp dial was firmly in place so I know the difference.  There is a nice light on the outside, red indicating that it is warming up and changing to green once it reaches temp.  You might notice it switching from red and green with use but that is simply the product maintaining it&#x27;s temperature.  I saw that this bothered some reviewers, especially those coming from a Chi which does not have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s all the setup needed,of course, and now I&#x27;m ready to do my first test.  I grab a section of hair and immediately OUCH!  It felt like someone yanked my hair and it ran very very rough through my hair like my hair was made of wire or something.  I thought maybe I simply didn&#x27;t brush my hair smooth enough (which is a silly thought considering the purpose of this product!!) and tried again.  Same thing.  After some examination I noticed that the floating plateswere not mounted properly.  One was set flat but the top plate was set crooked with the bottom corner raised enough the the sharp metal edges were exposed and my hair was catching underneath.  Also this created a situation where I though I was releasing the hair but any hair in the bottom corner was still clamped.  I tried to push the plate down thinking it might snap into place but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a pain in the rear end to use.  And very heavy compared with the Chi and my Clairol of years ago.  I&#x27;ve contacted the company since that is Amazon&#x27;s policy and am waiting reply.  Given it&#x27;s the end of the year I&#x27;m really not sure what to expect but I&#x27;m bracing myself for being out $40.  I&#x27;ll update when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are many reviews for this product and maybe mine will be lost in the mix but if anyone reads this PLEASE PLEASE do not buy this product.  You can spend $40 on a Remington or other medium grade flat iron with similar if not better quality assurance.  Those 5 star reviews are either staged or maybe people who have never used a better flat iron.  And if you take the time to look around (which I didn&#x27;t until after my purchase) you&#x27;ll see that no one else ANYWHERE sells this product except Amazon and HSIprofessional.com.  Their own website doesn&#x27;t even sell it for $299!!!  It sorta reminds me of the email chain years ago about ELF makeup...</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and cools down quickly. Swivel cord and length is great. Use it to straight, curls, or flip for body. My hair looks good!!! Sweet red silk carry case too.</li>
    <li> I bought into all the great reviews and purchased it. It kept catching my GF&#x27;s hair and ripping it out.  The ceramic plates weren&#x27;t as smooth as her nearly broken down Chi (which this was intended to replace).  We returned it and got a very fast reply/refund.  Great service, product wasn&#x27;t as good as we thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna go and buy a new Chi instead...</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener as a back up and thought I would give it a shot after reading all the great reviews and I was not dissapointed!  I have a chi and I love this one way more than the chi!  Needless to say the chi will be my backup and I will using this as my main one now!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter for Christmas. She wanted a Chi but I read the reviews on the HSI and thought it was a much better buy. My daughter loves the iron and says it is the best one she has used.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I purchased this through Amazon as I got a heck of a price for a great product!</li>
    <li> great product my daughters got these for christmas presents and love them..they can get very hot so I would recommend supervision if for young girls.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new flat irons, got them with a great bargain. Item shipped fast. My hair was straight in minutes. I&#x27;m also thinking about buying the curlers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend thinking that it would be a good straightener for her since her old one had a short in the cable. She has tried to give it a chance but regardless of what heat setting it is on, the temperature is not consistent and never reaches the temperature it is set at. The heat consistence is dramatic, going from fairly hot to being warm to the touch while set at the max temperature. Since receiving it, she has gone back to using her old broken one over this product. After reading other reviews, this seems like a common problem.</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick, wavy-curly-frizzy hair.  This iron tames it well, whether I blow-dry first or not.  I like the argan oil that comes with it, and a little goes a long way.  The one-ounce (I think) bottle is still about a quarter full after two months of 1-2 uses weekly.  Between the oil and the iron, my hair comes out sleek and with just enough shine.  I have even been able to style some controlled, loose curls with it. The cord is really long, and the non-plate parts of the iron stay relatively cool even on the highest temperature - I have never burned myself.  Although there is no &#x27;ready&#x27; light to indicate that the iron is hot, I&#x27;d say it takes less than 5 min. to reach a workable temperature - pretty much, as soon as I try it, it&#x27;s ready.  I almost never have to go over a strand of hair more than once with this iron (unless it&#x27;s the next day, after I&#x27;ve slept on it).  Two months and no complaints.  As long as it keeps working this way, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as I needed a flat iron since mine stopped working. It was a great price so I thought, why not? I received it and it did wonders for my hair. My hair is very difficult to straighten and sure enough, within minutes it was done! Not hours!!! I LOVE this!</li>
    <li> I have been straightening my hair for years and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Cheap ones and straighteners up to $100+. This one is the best deal I have ever got on a straightner. Works just as good, if not better than the most expensive of straightners I&#x27;ve owned. It comes with a heat glove, a nice bag and a sample of their argon oil which is also amazing. Best deal I&#x27;ve got on something useful in a long time! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter so she would have one of her own to use.  I wanted to get one that would last her more than a year, and this is it.  It heats up very quickly, and she likes that it doesn&#x27;t catch on her hair.  I think that it is a great value for the quality.</li>
    <li> I went to the mall, and one of the foreign men at the kiosks was trying to sell this exact same straightener to me for $300!  I&#x27;m not a cheap person but that price just seemed astronomical!!  So I decided to wait and research the straightener before I invested so much money in it.  I ended up finding it here for a fraction of the cost!  I am able to do my hair faster and this leaves my hair shiny all day.  Ps, never buy stuff at the kiosks at the malls, or anywhere, they&#x27;re a total rip off.</li>
    <li> Packaging was impressive, it was a pretty good deal for all that&#x27;s in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, this worked like a charm. It heated up fast, and made my hair look totally pin straight in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days, however, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well, it took a bit longer to straighten my hair like it would with a normal straightener, and took a bit longer to heat up (45 seconds?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks, it began to turn on and off, switching from a red light to green light. It wasn&#x27;t much to complain about since the iron would still remain hot for the few seconds it turned off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the time issues (taking a  while to heat up and turning on and off, and the length of time it takes to do my hair compared to the first try), it&#x27;s a decent hair straightener. Much better than Revlon&#x27;s. It&#x27;s good for the price, but if you want a truly good iron, I recommend spending more on a higher end brand.</li>
    <li> My sister bought me one of these a couple years ago, and after some tough treatment, it finally broke. So while looking around for a new flat iron I saw this and got all excited because it was an amazing tool, just small children and alot of traveling and my own clumsiness took its toll.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of hair and this product gets hot quickly and stays hot.  I am able to get my hair straightened in less than half the time it took with my old straightener.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wife said it works great! I haven&#x27;t got a chance to use it on my 1/4\\&quot; long hair yet :P</li>
    <li> Folks, CHI used be the item to buy sadly the quality of CHI has diminished. They are now simply a famous name however no longer a worthwhile product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have doubts about HSI have no more. It&#x27;s an amazing price for such an amazing flat iron. HSI is fabulous. I purchased this for my picky daughter who has some of the thickest hair I&#x27;ve ever seen. Her hair is curly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I gave her the HSI iron, I said to her try it and let me know how it works for you. She has a CHI too. Well when she finished, and much quicker than with the other iron, she said she LOVED it! She only had to pass it by her thick hair twice and folks it was very sleek and looked like natural straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have any hesitation. I realize we all work harder to save where we can yet we do not want to sacrafice quality. You will get a quality iron for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a blessed 2013 folks!!</li>
    <li> The iron machine is easy to use and gets hot very fast...&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is, I have a long hair and is taking me a long time to finish to straight out my hair, because the iron machine is small for my hair size.&lt;br /&gt;But is a great machine for the price I paid for :)</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works just as good as my Chi did but for half the price.  I have had 3 Chi flat irons in the last few years and they are the only flat iron that would straighten my hair. I won&#x27;t go as far as to say that it is better than my Chi but it is definitely just as good. My hair is thick, coarse and curly, horrible to straighten nut this product works. I will be checking out more HSI products in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product I would recommend it to anyone! I really enjoyed what I received. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year</li>
    <li> I bought it about a month ago really good price and I like it .It&#x27;s a nice ceramic straigntner for the price .</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI ceramic flat iron after watching how-to videos on YouTube, on how to straighten and curl your hair with a flat iron. It looks SOOOO much better than how I ever styled my hair before.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this straightener definitely makes my hair straight without having to go over a section till I smell burning hair. I use it with the Argan oil and it makes my hair very soft with minimum frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping the product was defected. It did not get very hot and the rough edges broke my hair off</li>
    <li> She raves about how well this thing works.  I know her hair looks much better now than when she used the cheaper type.  She also uses Tea Tree Oil which I believes helps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATED 11/3/17**&lt;br /&gt;Daughter(s) have used for 5 years and apparently it is still running. My oldest girl took it when she moved out. My youngest daughter says that it was suffering from &amp;#34;lower heat&amp;#34;, but they just cranked up the temp dial to compensate.</li>
    <li> This product is better than I expected! Reasonably priced, works great on my hair. And the overall look and feel of this flat iron is sleek and easy to handle. I wouls definately reccomend this flat iron to another customer!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It gets hot quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair funny. I get great results with it and it&#x27;s very compact.</li>
    <li> meet all my expectations. I will recommended to any body. Thank you so much. there for I will give five star.</li>
    <li> I bought this for 15 yr old. She seems to like it but her hair doesn&#x27;t stay very straight in our Louisiana humidity. But for the price &amp; she likes it I guess that&#x27;s all that matters</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She loves it! I originally set out to buy a CHI, but at half the price and reading numerous positive reviews I decided to buy the HSI. No regrets. They&#x27;re essentially the same straighter (I have used both). The only difference is that the HSI lacks the auto shut off feature. So, save your money and buy this straighter instead.</li>
    <li> The item shipped fast. nice quality flat iron at a great price. I would do buisness again. A + +</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Love it! Tried out other straightners but this one so far is a keeper, its a great product.</li>
    <li> I saw the good reviews and was excited to try this flat iron.  I doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other flat iron you can get at any discount store.  It takes awhile to heat up and I still have fly aways after I use the iron.</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;up scale&amp;#34; straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up more slowly than I would have expected, but that&#x27;s not really a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the other reviews, I hope it doesn&#x27;t break down the line.</li>
    <li> I just recently this straightner because of all the great reviews it recieved but when I opened it the knob was not working properly so I couldn&#x27;t get the temp I need it to be..</li>
    <li> This product, like I said above, does the job. Sometimes though when I turn it on it doesn&#x27;t heat up. I&#x27;ve actually touched the plates without getting burned when this happened. However, once you turn it off and then back on it then heats up. It can be annoying when you are in a hurry but other than that it does alright. It&#x27;s an affordable flat iron which is a positive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on the positive reviews left by other buyers. I&#x27;ve always used a CHI straightener and it just so happened that mine stopped working a few days before this HSI was a lightning deal. I was so excited when it arrived that I immediately took it from the box to try it out. The first thing I noticed was how long it took to reach temperature. I tested it several times before the light turned green to see if maybe the setting were a little wonky, It wasn&#x27;t, so I waited some more. After 10 minuets of heating the light finally turned green. It took FOREVER to straighten my hair with this thing. It never got hot enough and after 2 or 3 passes through my hair the light signaled that it was back in the heating stage.  I&#x27;m Caucasian and my hair is of medium thickness with very little curl.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the product I received must be faulty so I contacted Amazon and received another two day later. I took it from the box, plugged it in and again had to wait about 10 minuets to get the go ahead from this thing.  Same disappointment from the new one. I decided to keep it simply because I would have felt bad returning the same product back to Amazon twice. I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a few months now and as long as I make sure I let it heat up while I&#x27;m blow drying my hair and do my make up it will reach a temperature that will straighten my hair. It still takes forever to use and It still losses heat after a few passes through my hair. I cant wait until I can find a CHI on sale to replace this thing, If I had to compare it&#x27;s performance to another straightener I would say it works about as good as the Conair I had in high school 15 years ago. I gave it two stars simply because it will turn on and after about 30 minuets of use plus 10 minuets of heating It does leave my hair straight. I also like the glove that came with the product as it protects my hand from the unusually hot temperature of the plastic casing while I&#x27;m using it. The packaging was nice also and the travel bag is useful.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I received two bad straighteners but I doubt it.</li>
    <li> Use this flat iron daily.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for this one, you can iron and curl with the same tool&lt;br /&gt;Gets hot quick and comes with glove, storage bag and sample of Argon Oil</li>
    <li> We received the product right on time and for the price it was more than I was expecting. Very happy with my flat iron hair...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but even at the high setting it isn&#x27;t very hot.  I had expected much more.</li>
    <li> This flat iron leaves my hair dull, dry and frizzy. I am not happy with this purchase and would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This seems like a great straightener from the reviews, but in reality it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not believe the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type of GF:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asian straight hair&lt;br /&gt;Long&lt;br /&gt;Not really thick, just a lot of hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener gets really hot but as soon as you start to straighten the temperature drops significantly. It does not straighten, and leads to 1 hr to straighten all your hair...</li>
    <li> I BROUGHT THESE FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS. WHEN MY DAUGHTER OPEN THE FLAT IRON AND PLUG THEM IN THE WALL, THEY DID NOT WORK. THEN THEY STARTED WORKING. THE FLAT IRONS WORKED FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THEN THEY STOP AGAIN. THE BOTTOM PLATE WAS ALSO LOOSE.</li>
    <li> The best,fast super hot shiny hair,from 199 to 49 and now to 39,i bought it for 49 but yeah its a very good deal,grab it now while its 39.the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I was debating between this flat iron and the Chi one.  I&#x27;m so happy with the HSI and thrilled that I didn&#x27;t spend more money for a big name and no warranty.  The HSI has been awesome.</li>
    <li> The product works well but it does not have a auto shut off. The dial is a bit awkward to get to but at least it doesn&#x27;t shut off every time I use it like a previous flat iron I had.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best flat iron I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve used at least a dozen different brands at all price points, and this one is my favorite.  I normally use 2&amp;#34; plus, so was skeptical to try this one, but am so glad I did.  Works great on my long, thick, somewhat curly hair.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> this is my first straightener.So not able to compare with others. But this product seems to work as expected. No complains.</li>
    <li> I have had a CHI flat iron - after a few years, it made my hair look like straw and frizzy ends.  I ordered this flat iron on a Tues. afternoon and received it on Fri..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes about 5 min. now to straighten my hair. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I had to replace a great flat iron that I accidentally fried (note when traveling abroad -- make sure the power converter is set to the right voltage!). I was going to buy a Chi, then started to read reviews. After seeing everyone glowing about this straightener, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing. I have long, curly hair, and it can be a time consuming process to get it straight. This works as well as a Chi. It feels solid, heats up quickly, and glides nicely. The packaging is great -- I haven&#x27;t used the glove or case, but hey, nice touches. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After owning many name brand irons, and having them die on me after 1-2 years, I decided to save a few bucks and buy this one based on reviews. I figured even if it only lasted a few months, or even a year, I&#x27;d get my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you, this thing has impressed me. I have used it daily, for about 8 months now and it is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the adjustable heat setting, some basic brand names only have on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;I have really course, thick, and mostly unmanageable hair and this thing is able to tackle it into shape, quickly, smoothly and efficiently :)&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a neat carry bag (which I don&#x27;t use, but nice any way), a small sample of Argan oil, which smells marvelous, works wonderfully, and is just basically super great!, and a styling glove so you wont burn your hand while styling.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has an automatic safety &amp;#34;shut-off&amp;#34; after 10 ( or 15?) mins of no use! What an awesome feature! I know I have always left mine plugged in and worried if i left it on...? Now, thats not a problem :)&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, a GREAT buy, definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this Straightener for my wife because i couldn&#x27;t afford anything expensive.  I Honestly was going to spend the original price for this Straightener at the mall until I saw it here on Amazon.  Once my wife used it for the first time, I couldn&#x27;t keep my fingers off her hair.  I really love this straightener.  I also bought the conditioner for this straightener.. I would recommend this straightener to anyone....As a gift or for yourself.  Its really awesome...and I&#x27;m Pretty sure I won&#x27;t be spending any more money on a straightener for a while. 8-D</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading over 50 reviews. I researched several irons and this one seemed the best. Two areas I think are important are how easily it pulls through the hair and how long the hair stays straight. It is not good in either aspect. In my opinion, this is no better than any other iron. I tried it out on my hair, which is normal, wavy/straight hair, and it felt like it was pulling my hair out. My hair kept getting caught in the blades. I had to turn it up all the way up, over 400 degrees, to get it to work on my hair. I have average hair strands, not too thick and not coarse, so it should not have had to be that hot. My two girls said the iron felt fine, but they hair very thick, coarse, very curly hair. However, their hair was frizzy when they came home from school, less than 24hrs later. It also took 25 minutes to do one head of hair. I bought it to replace my generic CHI brand, and I will be returning it. My old iron actually works better. I never write reviews, but these are two area I think are important when using a flat iron. Please read ALL the reviews.</li>
    <li> I researched and compared this particular Flat Iron with others on the market before I decided to purchase it and found it to rate very high among its competitors.  I received it in new condition as promised by the seller in a very efficient and timely manner.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this flat iron. Mine was defective, and if you read through recent reviews, many many customers received defective irons that had to be replaced. The irons do not heat up sufficiently and do nothing to straighten hair (and mine isn&#x27;t even very curly). It seems many of these irons must be fake since there are so many customers who had the same experience as me--and this would explain the low price. Too shady for me--I&#x27;ve returned the HSI and am forking over some more money for a Solano, a brand I trust.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why this wasn&#x27;t invented years ago, or if it was, why it took me so long to find it. Protects your hand when using a curling iron and only interferes with dexterity a tiny bit. It is a knit of some sort, and stretchy. This one is \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; but if they are made in sizes for a better fit, it would be 5 stars. Now, if someone would invent something for my forehead, I would be a happy duck,</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality flat iron when I came upon this iron.  After doing some research and comparing the reviews, I chose this one for a relative.  She loved how it made her hair sleek compared to her old store bought flat irons which had no temperature control.  It worked so well that she received many compliments from her friends and they wanted to get the same iron.  So, I bought some more for all of them and they all love it!</li>
    <li> This item is awesome! It has an adjustable temperature so you can very it based on your hair type (mine being curly) and it works phenomenally. The cord rotates on the end so you can adjust it to allow it to lay level on any surface.&lt;br /&gt;It does come with a drawstring bag to store it in (obviously when it is cool) and protective gloves so you don&#x27;t burn your hands as it can get very hot.</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron. Rounded plate edges don&#x27;t snag hair and allow to use as curling tool, as well.&lt;br /&gt;Came with glove and carrying bag.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good product</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this product. it&#x27;s not the same as the girl in the salon uses, but she says it works just as well and she doesn&#x27;t have to go to the salon every time she needs to straighten her hair.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a week now and works as well as my daughter&#x27;s straightner which she paid 200 dollars for. Was and is pleasantly suprised. Straightnes great and curls great.</li>
    <li> I bought the PRO brand hair straightener from walmart a few months ago and it works pretty good. I bought this one because I thought it worked better but it did not work any better then the one I already have. It works pretty good but not any better then something I can buy at walmart for less money.</li>
    <li> This product is as good if not even better that some of the models sold at top end stores. It is used daily and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times since I&#x27;ve received it. I have a lot and thick dark hair, so I&#x27;m pleased how this product makes my hair look so far for it&#x27;s price. It leaves it shiny too, and I haven&#x27;t even tried the gloss it comes with yet.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing...and price \\&quot;unbeatable\\&quot;....I have had a CHI for a few years, but it got broken recently in my luggage (thank you Southwest Airlines).....this is as good or better....!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price for a professional straightener! I think I will have this one for a very long time! I am going to order more of these for gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has thick, coarse hair.  It heated quickly, and straightened in one pass leaving her hair with a really nice silky finish.  She usually has to do a couple passes with her old one.  We got this for an amazing price too.  About 80% off the usual retail.  It everything plus more than we expected.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this iron! Works better than my old name brand, incredibly expensive flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and can say confidently that I am extremely satisfied with the HSI in performance and its ease of use. It does such an amazing job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any flat iron protective oil will do but HSI&#x27;s Argan oil tops any, leaving hair silky shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS for such a quality product.</li>
    <li> I have always used a Chi so I was hesitant to try an unfamiliar brand but with the great price I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am very glad that I did! It works just as well as the Chi and it came with a glove and a small bottle of oil for your hair and a pouch to carry it in. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a good flat iron[[ASIN:B004VWCEDE HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE HEAT CASE &amp; GLOVE. DUAL VOLTAGE 110/220V.]].</li>
    <li> Wow!  Super sturdy and well made!</li>
    <li> This did not get hot enough to straighten my thick wavy hair (and I had already blow dried it as straight as I could get it using a round brush). I still had lots of kinks and frizz. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron...it is easy to use and has many heat settings for different varieties of hair.  I like how easy it is to straighten my hair or to flip it up on the ends.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I was excited to use this straightner. I&#x27;m a hairdresser, so I referred many clients to buy it also. I was disappointed when I used it. It slightly pulls the hair when you straighten and curl. It seems cheap. I&#x27;ll stick with my Amika&amp; Ghd. Just bought this as a back up because of the great price.</li>
    <li> -After reading the reviews on this flat iron I knew I had to get it, especially with the cost being so reasonable.  I got it for my daughter and I to share, since hers is a wet-to-dry one that isn&#x27;t the best quality and mine died.&lt;br /&gt;-The package arrived a day early, which was great because we were due to go on vacation the next day.  I plugged it in and what do you know, there IS a light that goes from red to green when the iron is up to temperature.  It&#x27;s on the outside, on the diamond pattern about halfway down on the one side.  It does work on my unit.  I used the sample of argon oil, you don&#x27;t need much so I still have some left.  I may order that too, not sure on that.&lt;br /&gt;-Aware of other reviews mentioning it, I looked for but didn&#x27;t see that you&#x27;re not supposed to put it on any surface.  But to be safe I just layed it on the glove that was also included.  If you keep your hands on the textured pattern of the unit you won&#x27;t need to wear the glove.  If you feel the need to grab the end to help curl your hair, for example, then yes use it.  It does stay hot for quite a while so if you&#x27;re not traveling just let it cool off before putting it away.  I have a heat-resistant cover from my last flat iron that I use when I travel and need to put it away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Regarding the adjustable temperature, I&#x27;m very glad on that.  But I&#x27;m in a bit of a catch-22 because I have curly hair that&#x27;s also colored.  For colored hair you&#x27;re supposed to keep the temperature lower, but since it&#x27;s also curly I chose to turn it up to medium-high so I don&#x27;t have to make so many passes over my hair which would be damaging as well.&lt;br /&gt;-I needed no more than 2 passes to make my hair straight, smooth and shiny.  It does help to section your hair and use small sections too, it seems time consuming but it actually saves time in the long run.  I can easily get 2 days of straight hair from this unit, just need to touch it up.&lt;br /&gt;-This is why I only gave it 4 stars: I used it on a humid day and curled my hair with it...it looked great for about 10 minutes then drooped and got a bit frizzy, in spite of using 2 products that are supposed to prevent that.  So on humid days I&#x27;ll just go curly or put it up :)&lt;br /&gt;-My daughter, who has thick, slightly wavy hair, LOVES it and would probably give it 5 stars.  She also doesn&#x27;t have to do multiple passes over her hair which saves time and lessens damage.&lt;br /&gt;--Overall the HSI gets 4.5 stars!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of buying a new straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I have had my CHI for 4 years with out a single problem.&lt;br /&gt;I read all of the reviews for this product, and for the price I decided I didn&#x27;t want to miss this offer.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, a lot.&lt;br /&gt;If the price were to increase, I think I would still stick with a CHI, but this is good competition.&lt;br /&gt;I just like CHI better, because the plates inside \\&quot;glide\\&quot; smoother across my hair. Or at least it feels like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The better thing about this straightener is that the heat is adjustable. On my CHI it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am newer to this straightener world, but with my new hair cut, I need a good one! After throwing out my cheap, crappy straightener, I went on Amazon in search of a good straightener with a reasonable price.  My friends have told me of their horror stories of spending hundreds of dollars on those expensive straighteners to only have them break a few months later.  After searching for the highest rating and lowest price, I stumble on the HSI professional straightener and was surprised by the great reviews.  Could it be that there is a good straightener with a reasonable price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is! When I got this straightener I was immediately impressed with the packaging which included extra goodies like a case, burn glove, and argon oil.  When I tried the straightener out I was shocked of how great it was!  It gets really hot and does the same job as those expensive straighteners for a quarter of the price.  My only criticism is that there is no automatic shutoff.  Despite this, I have told my family and friends about the product and will be back to buy more products from HSI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/2/13:  I ended up getting rid of this straightener.  It developed a horrible burned build up (from hair products) on it that I have not see with other straighteners and I was unable to get it off.  I replaced it with a new brand and would not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works flawlessly. I have natural hair and it straightens my hair perfectly. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I found this item at a great price so I was willing to take a chance based on other great reviews.  I am happy to say that I love my new flat iron and it definitely lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightner for my younger daughter after my older daughter left for college and took the straightner they shared with her.  My younger daughter LOVES it and said it works \\&quot;Way better than the Chi and she&#x27;s so glad her sister took the Chi with her\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how amazing this straightener this is! It leaves my hair very smooth and silky and stays straight until I wash it again. Even my boyfriend has made so many compliments on how nice my hair looks like. And for the price, this product is a no-brainer!</li>
    <li> Have been using my new hsi straightener everyday and absolutely love it. Would recommend it to anyone searching or a good straightener.</li>
    <li> I love having the ability to control the temperature. I had a chi before and loved it, but it was brutal on my hair. I am able to use this one on my 4 year old who has very fine and thin hair. It also comes with a glove, case, and argan oil. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love it. This flat iron works better than I ever expected! I have owned a chi, and several other brands and this, by far, beats them all.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a great product. Works as expected, heats up fast, and gets hot enough to smooth my curly hair!</li>
    <li> The product is great. Heats up fast and its great for styling in different ways. You can go straight or curl it up. I love it. I am 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Only 2 weeks and I turn it on it won&#x27;t turn on . 3 1/2 stars</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron.  It performs better than my expectations and the results are just as described.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Chi with the HSI and my hair looks like I just left the salon after each use!  It is easy on my ends too:)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  The price was excellent and the product is great.  I bought this to replace my Chi.  The only issue I have with this product is that the temperature control is on the inside of the clamps by the base which makes adjusting temp down a little awkward.</li>
    <li> Soft, shiny and sensational is how I would describe my hair after using the HSI flat iron. Everyone kept telling how shiny my hair looked and how straight my hair was. My hair was also soft and silky smooth thanks to the small argan sample. I have curly hair and sometimes with other straighteners it would kinda leave my hair wavy, but with HSI flat iron my hair was STRAIGHT. I love the HSI flat iron and for such a low price its definitely worth the buy. If your thinking about buying the HSI flat iron I say DO IT! You won&#x27;t regret it, I sure don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron less than a month ago. I have used it maybe 8 times when it just stopped working. I tried to resect it and tried other outlet it just will not get hot. When it worked I loved it! Luckly i can still return it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do Not purchase this item</li>
    <li> the girl I purchased for told me it was the best iron she ahs ever used its very well made and is a great value for your money</li>
    <li> When I got this flat iron I plugged it in and it immediately heated up fast and I could see that it was working.  I decided to try this on my daughters hair first.  We have really coarse thick hair and so I was curious how it would compare to our CHI.  It has a smooth pull down like the CHI with no pulling of the hair.  As fair as the straightening part it is a step down from the CHI.  We still use this weekly and will continue to use it.  It is a great flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, just what I ordered and at a completely reasonable price. Very happy with my purchase! I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian with a thick long frizzy black hair. It has always been a challenge fixing my crazy frizzy hair. Every morning when I get ready for work, I normally spend about 45 minutes ironing my hair straight. With HSI, believe it or not it only takes me 15 minutes at most. It saved me time and my hair is not just straight but soft too. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. I am a very happy and satisfied customer!&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, HSI customer service is awesome too. I sent an email inquiry and got back to me that same day. Great product plus great customer service- can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> To start this review, let me say that I was VERY brainwashed by the raving reviews. They sure set the precedence for this product, which I was certain would be better than everyone boasted. Well, how disappointed was I during the first pull through my hair. I use the word &#x27;pull&#x27; as that is EXACTLY what it did. It yanked on my hair and pulled it out at the root. VERY painful. Not only did it hurt while using it, but it damaged my hair. I now have split ends where there weren&#x27;t any before.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t get past the first few painful chunks of hair that I tried to pass through the HSI, and immediately cranked up my computer to return this piece of garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product. I guess that&#x27;s why it was SO CHEAP!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, you get what you pay for.... and you aren&#x27;t paying much for this product.</li>
    <li> It came in quickly and works wonders with my hair. I also love the argan oil that came with it. It smells so good!</li>
    <li> This left my hair SO soft! Heated up super quick, and is so easy to use. Much better than the flat iron by a popular name that I paid nearly $100 for. I&#x27;ll never go back to that one again after using this!</li>
    <li> I had owned and used the same CHI iron for almost 11 years when it finally was damaged (in my luggage) beyond further use. I immediately started looking to replace it with another CHI when I came across the HSI styler. The price was attracitve and I figured if it didn&#x27;t work out, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted too much money before buying another CHI. The HSI styler came on time and was packaged very well. I like the red cloth bag it came in for storing. The styler feels sturdy, heats up quickly and does the job very well, leaving my hair just as straight and smooth as my old CHI. I am satisfied with the results and if it lasts even half as long as my old (beloved) CHI iron, it will have been money well spent.</li>
    <li> Recently my old flat iron broke (it was a cheap one from walmart) and I decided to splurge on a quality iron. I purchased this one at such a reduced price that I was worried that it would not be as nice as I wanted. After receiving it, I can happily say that I was wrong. It heats up very fast and makes my hair as smooth as silk. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a cheap one. This iron has spoiled me for all others. My only complaint is that it does not shut down on its own.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing and smooth. It heats up super fast and leaves my hair silky smooth:) I love that it comes with a storage pouch and glove! Also the oil  that comes in the little bottle is great for adding shine to your hair. I am very happy with this flat iron and it was a great value.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair not as smooth as a chi</li>
    <li> I got this straightner for my girlfriend after her last one melted, she loves it. Nothing bad to say about it but that its a great straightner</li>
    <li> I really really really tried to love this product. It was inexpensive and had so many positive reviews, that I had to buy it. The first time I tried it I have to go over my hair many times and granted I have thin/fine hair. I ramped it up to highest setting, which I have never had to do with a flat iron, and still had to go over my hair more than three times. I&#x27;ve had it for quite a bit and I just can&#x27;t keep this. I am going to have to spend some money on a Chi. : (</li>
    <li> Works Great! Well worth the money! all the added accessory are nice. The plates seem smaller then my old one, but it works just as well on my super thick hair. I would totally recommend this flat iron. very happy!&lt;br /&gt;Plus I received it 2 days earlier then i expected, so great shipping to!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering a product that I had not heard a lot about. I last owned a CHI that I used for 2 years and paid 130.00. I recently cracked the electrical box unit that plugs in to the wall. I bought one at a mall kiosk a couple of weeks ago, brand name \\&quot;Royale\\&quot;, was as good as my Chi, but 2nd time I used did not heat at all. I sent back and they will be sending me a new one, however I thought I would get a less expensive back up meanwhile til it came in. I found your flat iron  \\&quot;HSI \\&quot; on Amazon and read a lot of good ratings, so I ordered.  After receiving it is by far better quality than either my Chi or the Royale, and works on my hair as good or better than my previous irons.....not to mention the value was fantastic! I would recommend this product to anyone and the satin case it came in will make it great for traveling as well! [[ASIN:B004VWCEDE HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE HEAT CASE &amp; GLOVE. DUAL VOLTAGE 110/220V.]]</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY curly hair. They&#x27;re bouncy and everywhere. Recently, I got a hair cut. And sadly, this stylist cut my hair TOO short. It looked terrible. So I tried straightening it. It looks beautiful this way. However, I didn&#x27;t have a straightener of my own. So being an online shopper I decided to buy one off amazon. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and I love it. I use it at least 3 times a week, and it gives the same awesome performance, every time. I look forward to continuously using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good flat iron but didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a another brand that has a lot of name recognition.  I saw the HSI straightener on Amazon with fantastic reviews and a much more attractive price and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m sure happy I did!  My hair is about shoulder length, medium thickness, and has random waves at the ends (none in the same direction!).  The flat iron heated up very quickly and I was able to straighten my hair in 5-10 minutes. All those little fly-aways that drive me nuts were nowhere in sight.  I headed out to pick up the kids from school and received many compliments on how great my hair looked!  Several even asked if I just came from the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the flat iron has a heat setting so when I do \\&quot;beauty shop\\&quot; with the kids, I can set it at a lower heat level that&#x27;s more comfortable for them.  I did not need to use the highest setting - only about 2/3 of the dial (only max number is printed).</li>
    <li> I hesitated to purchase this but since it was such a good deal, I decided to go ahead and try it. I have only used the Chi flat irons before this. The first one I got, did not heat up all the way, I contacted Amazon and they shipped out a replacement one that same day and I had it the next day. It has worked WONDERFULLY! Like another reviewer, I purchased this to use as my back-up, but now use it as my primary and have my Chi as my backup. My hair does not get caught in the plates and it&#x27;s so easy to use. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 11/13/12***&lt;br /&gt;I have been using my HSI flat iron since I purchased it in August. This past weekend, it fell off the counter in my bathroom and onto my wood floors. Unfortunately, the fall caused one of the plates to break in half so I can no longer use it :( I know this is a possibility with any flat iron but I have also dropped my Chi a few times before (I&#x27;m not the most graceful person, especially early in the mornings) and never had this happen. That being said, I think this flat iron is a lot more fragile than the Chi. On a more positive note, since it broke, I pulled my Chi back out and used it. I can DEFINITLY see a difference. The HSI gets much hotter (which I like) and does a much better job faster. It is a bit heavier than the Chi as well but not too much.  All in all, I still recommend this flat iron; just don&#x27;t drop it like I did.</li>
    <li> The iron heats up quickly and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same few spots as many times as I did with my old iron. The only complaint I have is I wish the iron opened a little bit more, but it&#x27;s really not that bad, it just took some getting used to for me. Another weird thing is if you have it sitting on your counter so you can see the heat adjustment dial, the red/green light indicating that the iron is on would be facing your counter (not visible). I adjust my heat a few times while doing my hair because some of my hair is more unruly than other parts, so I like to have the adjustment readily available, but I also like to see the \\&quot;on\\&quot; light to know when it&#x27;s ready, or to ensure I turned it off. So that&#x27;s a quirky part of the design to me. But over all it&#x27;s a great iron for the price.</li>
    <li> I loved this flat iron because it is light weight and works great. Doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and it comes with a glove so you don&#x27;t burn your other hand. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this great in a long time. Appreciated the sample of argon oil too.</li>
    <li> I have very course but fine hair (crazy mixture but it&#x27;s true) that is hard to style.  Add to that I live in Florida where the humidity is a  style killer most of the year.  I have purchased every flat iron i can get my hands on and most of them are okay, but the HSI is the only on that has made my hair smooth and soft for the entire day.  I even wake up with better looking hair the day after I flat iron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several irons (conair, chi, gamma...) and this was my first experience with HSI. What I can say is that this iron is great quality and price. I love it! I don&#x27;t regret have bought it. I have wavy hair and in just some minutes I can get my hair done, pretty and shinny. And you can also use it to get curls and waves. Absolutely worth buying product! And I love that the cable doesn&#x27;t entangles easily as other irons do.</li>
    <li> This straightens hair like a charm! I paid 3x more for a different product and this does the same thing! Super pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday present for my daughter. She loves it! Great quality and comes with a sample of Argon oil and a nice carrying case.</li>
    <li> My HSI flat iron is such an improvement from my last flatiron. Not only is my hair even more silky and smooth, it takes half the time to get the results that I am looking for! The iron heats up in approximately 20-30 seconds, has the ability to heat up to 410 degrees, and gives my thick hair a smooth and silky shine. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The description for this item gives the impression that it comes with oil, mine did not. I like that it the it works at 110 and 240 V, but was surprised that the transformer is not labeled that way, and only the package. My first test indicates that  it works as described.</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons. The weight is just right!  The flat iron gives my hair such a gloss as if I used some kind of sheen. I will most likely buy another pair as I like to have two of everything and I have two daughters who may want to use them!</li>
    <li> I had been buying inexpensive flat irons, and none of them gave me the results I always got when I went to the salon.  However I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 - $200 on a decent flat iron.  After reading the reviews of the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron, and saw it&#x27;s low price, I decided to give it a shot.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  I have long hair, medium thickness, wavy hair.  I didn&#x27;t have to turn this iron onto it&#x27;s highest heat setting to get smooth, sleek, frizz free hair.  And where other irons made my hair feel and look like straw after using them, this iron only gave me beautiful, shiny hair.  An added bonus:  my hair stays beautiful for days, even after sleeping on it, so I don&#x27;t have to iron it everyday.  I feel like I&#x27;ve won the hair lottery.  One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this, especially after reading all of the great reviews.  It works as well as everyone says it does.  This is now my favorite flat iron.  I have very thick, curly hair, but it  damages easily.  I&#x27;m able to get straight hair without the breakage, when I use this!!</li>
    <li> I loveeeee these flat irons they are wonderful everytime i do my hair it looks like i came for the salon they are just perfect.HSI are they flat irons too buy believe me</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace an old CHI 1\\&quot; flat iron that I had for about 5 years. I was a little worried when it felt lighter then my previous flat iron, but  was impressed by how well it handled. I have very thick wavy hair and the HSI flat iron did the trick. I love that I can adjust the heat. Just be patient during warm ups or cool downs when changing temps for different sections of hair. This product is spot on.  Also love the travel bag that was included.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are very impressed with HSI&#x27;s The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron 1\\&quot; Hair Straightener! This flat iron is just as good if not better than the Professional Paul Mitchell flat iron we are replacing it with, which cost me almost $200.00. I highly recommend this quality, fabulously priced item.</li>
    <li> My old Flat Iron recently quit working and I was wanting a new one with great reviews but affordable. I found this one on Amazon and I am so glad that I did. It is not as wide as my old one but it gets hotter so the width doesn&#x27;t make a difference. I am very happy with my purchase. I have long thick curly hair and I am able to straighten it in a reasonable amount of time with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES it!  She said it works AWESOME! It works like it said it would.  Leaves her hair nice and straight.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I had bought a chi the last time and paid #100.00 for it.  It burned out quickly.  Love this one.</li>
    <li> This was one of the gifts I bought for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she really loves it.&lt;br /&gt;She uses this every morning and she looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! A lot better than the one I had before, and it&#x27;s a great price for the quality! It made my hair pin straight and soft. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product -would recommend if</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener! It works quickly and really smooths and takes the frizz out. I love that you can adjust the temperature depending on the texture of your hair. My hair is long and wavy to curly (loose curls) and it smooths it in about 5 minutes. I have used cheap hair straighteners, but now I have learned it is worth it to spend more on a salon-quality product!</li>
    <li> I bought this based off the reviews, I never heard of this company but I took a chance. So glad I did! First, props to amazon for shipping this in under 3 days, I didn&#x27;t expect this to arrive for another week and a half. I used it right away and I cut my straightening time down to 25 minutes! That&#x27;s a pretty big deal for me considering it normally takes me over an hour and my hair can only be described as (Troy polamalu) Samoan hair. The price of this straightener caused me to be skeptical because I figured if it was cheap that it didn&#x27;t work well. Wrong! This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve owned and far surpasses my chi models. Take a chance on this product, you won&#x27;t regret it!  UPDATE: OVER THREE YEARS LATER, and my straightener still works as well as ever.  I have the first generation and cannot say enough good things about it.  None of my high dollar straighteners ever came close to lasting this long or working so well.  I use it about 3-4 times a week and am very impressed that it has held up considering it was such a cheap purchase.  If you are still on the fence about this product based off the little known brand, make the purchase.  It is well worth it!</li>
    <li> A true professional product in every aspect.  Well accessorized and sturdily packaged.  Equal to those found in high end salons.</li>
    <li> There is no digital temp screen - so you never actually know what the temp of the iron. It&#x27;s also weirdly heavy, but it handles smooth. It&#x27;s a thin design which is nice for getting your own back of the head and the cord is nice and long.</li>
    <li> This straightener gets the job done but I wish it came with some additional features. With the original retail price, you would think this high quality straightener could even open a can or sing to you. I wish it had some sort of locking feature for when you want to close iron after use. It would be less susceptible to burns or scratches. Additionally, it would help save space. I also wish it had a safety feature so that it automatically shuts off after a certain amount of time. Will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> My hair is not thick, nor curly.  It is of a medium thickness and is wavy (the severity of the waves increases the shorter my hair is).  This iron does a great job flattening the waves in a short amount of time at the highest temperature.</li>
    <li> The quality is not as good as I expected after reading the previous reviews. My hair gets stuck pretty easily, and the on/off switch is not so well designed that I forget to turn it off many times. Pro: it heats up pretty quickly</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair and it&#x27;s very thick with natural wave. Straightening usually takes a long time and I was hoping this straightener would cut the time and eliminate the little wave that&#x27;s left to be perfectly straight and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to my old straightener, I keep it on a medium setting to not fry the fine hair. I take small sections and try to go slow, but still have to run over them repeatedly. (And it never goes salon-straight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m really in the same position I was in before, but with a newer straightener. Oh well.</li>
    <li> It is a great hair straightener for the price. I got it because my cheap one basically stopped working. My hair is very thick, and just soaks up the heat. This one definitely does the job and completely straightens my hair. And it stays straight too.</li>
    <li> I have had the same ceramic flat iron for nearly 10 years so I thought I would update to something newer.  My old one has been dropped a few times and had seen better days.  This one had pretty good reviews and was $40 so I thought, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;  It just does not work that well and it pulls so much!  Do yourself a favor and look for another one.  Even a 10 year old one works better than this one!</li>
    <li> Great on the hair with little work.  Keeps the wave out of hair and makes it straight. Good for any hair length.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! It has kept my hair flat, silky, and soft for the past 5 day! I was very impressed when I tried the product. I recommened this to people with thick or curly hair! But it works great on my friend who has stright hair as well. I also love the plates on the iron because it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and it is a easy, smooth glide between the plates and my hair! If you are looking to buy this product, I totaly would recommended this to you! Over all this is a super amazing flat iron, and maybe a little bit better than my CHI... (:</li>
    <li> By far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve hard. It actually gets my hair really straight and the little bottle that comes with it makes my hair shiny and smooth :). Be careful with the heat though, cause I&#x27;ve burned my hand multiple times lol.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It reaches an extremely high temperature (410º I believe) which is hard to find in most flat irons. I comes in attractive packaging with a heat-resistant glove and a product called Argan oil, which I use as thermal protection for my hair. It arrived as estimated, just as described. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It gets very hot and does a great job with curly hair. I would recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money, and in no way does it pull your hair. Plus I have curly hair so it does the job great!</li>
    <li> This has been the best straightner I have used so far... Not only does it straighten my hair but I&#x27;m also able to curl it too and the curls last all day.... My hair always comes out really straight and frizz free.. i love this product</li>
    <li> I have only been using this flat iron for a month or so after my Paul Mitchell flat iron died from many years of usage, and so far, I think it is doing just as good of a job as my Paul Mitchell.  I would give this a try before shelling out the money for a CHI.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It heats up quickly and you can control the temperature. This is a replacement for a CHI that i had. One con is you don&#x27;t know the exact temperature. It straightens nicely I have thick and hair that is half way down my back and I have no problem with this straightener. I also can curl easily with this flat iron! Great product and even better price</li>
    <li> I am not really sure how I feel about this flat iron yet, I have used it a total of about 3 times already. Overall though I wouldn&#x27;t say the purchase was a waste of time or anything. I am a Black American with natural 4b hair. I suppose it straightens it very well, for the most part I think it is just because I am not pleased with the products that I use along with it. We&#x27;ll see when I get a better hang of straightening my natural hair.</li>
    <li> This is a classy looking hair straightener and works great!. I love how smooth and shiny it makes my hair look. Definitely recommended</li>
    <li> Works great on all hair types!!! I have African American hair and this iron works excellent!!! As good as top brands!</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener! Makes my hair so easy to style! Easy to use, I can straighten and curl my hair fast!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and i dont like too much heat. This worked very well on my hair with warm setting</li>
    <li> Great value.  Item exactly as described.  Good quality &amp; prompt shipping,</li>
    <li> Great for kinky hair too.. Used it after going natural on a twa and was happy with the results. Gave it four stars instead of 5 to see how it holds up. Packaging was very cute and arrived fast even without prime. Attached picture, see the difference!!</li>
    <li> This Hair Iron is made with great quality and does a good job.  It is definitely worth the $39.99 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> The product was good and i am satisfied. The best part was it is suitable for both 110 v and 220v, for which i can send it to my country. Thanks HSI for providing such a good product</li>
    <li> Works really well! Only draw backs are my hair gets snagged a little more than I&#x27;d like and wish it got a little hotter.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Easy transaction!</li>
    <li> It was just as described, quick delivery and I love this flat iron. Great quality - professional level indeed. I would buy from this seller again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nothing beats Chi that I toasted while on in NZ (different voltage). I&#x27;m keeping it but wish I went a little spendy and bought Chi again.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Love being able to adjust the temperature so it&#x27;s not too hot. Needed dual voltage for travel to Europe.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is excellent! You get a professional iron at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron!  Does great on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;And I got it in a few days!</li>
    <li> Love this iron, with the adjustable settings it works well.</li>
    <li> I was quite pleased with the presentation of the product when I opened it. It comes so beautifully packaged, it looks like a gift. Then, when using  it, it makes your hair smooth and flat, even glossy when used with the sample argon oil enclosed.  I would definitely recommend this iron to others, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have used it for a few months now and it leaves amazing results each time. I do not use the glove it came with although it was convenient. This straightener leaves amazing results in my hair that I do not have to use it as often as I used to with lesser quality products.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This iron heats up fast, very smooth results, no snagging/pulling problems, and an awesome price.  However, I wish this product had an auto-off.  The only other issue I encountered was a screw was missing at the base of the iron which caused the power cord to fall out from time to time.  Some packing tape seemed to solve the issue, but would have expected better quality, given the &#x27;retail&#x27; price.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this flat iron.  The purchase was a success!  I loved the way it gets rid of my frizzies and straightens my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It is everything that was advertised. It works great and I have enjoyed using it.  It came right on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Very bad product ! The hot plates do not connect therefore cannot do the job . I want to return that product but there is no invoice in the package. . Where should I return that sheap and horrible product ? I give one star because it won&#x27;t allow me to do zero .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many flat irons in the past but the HSI is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune. I&#x27;ve been using the flat iron twice a week for almost a month and my hair is not dry or brittle. I have very thick, curly hair and this flat iron does a quick job straightening my hair. I would recommend this product and would buy an HSI again if I had the need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat iron included accessories:&lt;br /&gt;* Nice traveling bag&lt;br /&gt;* Flat iron&lt;br /&gt;* Heat glove&lt;br /&gt;* User instruction manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Features:&lt;br /&gt;* Adjustable temperature from 140° to 410° F to suit your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;* Smooth ceramic plates that easily slide through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;* 1 inch wide plates to work with any hair type and style and also allow you to straighten your bangs.&lt;br /&gt;* Power cord is 7 feet long with built in circuit breaker&lt;br /&gt;* On/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;* Heat indicating LED light.&lt;br /&gt;* Fast and easy to use with professional results.&lt;br /&gt;* Comes with protective heat glove if you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;* Swivel power cord to eliminate the power cord from twisting.&lt;br /&gt;* Operates on 110 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great value.</li>
    <li> This flat iron didn&#x27;t heat evenly and fried my ends. It did not pull my hair and I liked the design.</li>
    <li> First iron that has actually had the desired effect on (daughter&#x27;s) hair without damaging it.</li>
    <li> Loved it so much, I bought 2.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned and the argon oil is great.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works better than any other straightener I have owned. The glove is great.</li>
    <li> prompt arrival, great packaging and product - thank you!</li>
    <li> It certainly did the job of straightening my hair, but it also fried my hair.</li>
    <li> Great price and does a great job! Hair looks healthy after use. Would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I really love this straight iron.  It is much better than my old Chi!  The price was great.  It heats up faster and the heat is adjustable.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, brittle hair and am always hesitant to use any heating tools on it. This straightener has been fantastic and has not damaged my hair and leaves it silky without fly-aways.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, as she needed the dual voltage feature for travel.  She has been using flat irons for years and said this one worked fine for her 10 day trip.  It will most likely be the one she takes on all future travel.  Her everyday iron has a higher stated maximum temperature and wider plates that the HSI, but again the HSI performed great and for the price, she is very happy.</li>
    <li> Absolutley  LOVE  the Touramaline Ionic Flat Iron!!! Will and have told alot of mt friend about it. One friend already purchase the Flat Iron.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, great price!</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price! The dual voltage was the big seller for me. So far I&#x27;ve only used the iron in the US, but I travel a lot, so I can&#x27;t wait to see how it does overseas.</li>
    <li> This straightner makes the chi look like a wimp! my hair has never felt softer or been in such great shape!!! love this and have told many friends who also have bought it!</li>
    <li> I love the product!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very smooth, better than my CHI.. I really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Overall, it is decent, works pretty well, but damaged my hair. Recommend not to use too often</li>
    <li> This is a very nice flat iron.  The oil didn&#x27;t come with the iron.  Not sure why.</li>
    <li> Great product for blonde damaged hair. Second one I&#x27;ve had and only had to get a new one because I dropped my first.</li>
    <li> I used to love this iron but I&#x27;ve had it less than a year and it already broke. Definitely would not purchase again,  poor quality apparently.</li>
    <li> Received it quite fast and works great</li>
    <li> Worthless thing I have ever ordered. It is only good for the trash!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, flattens really smooths out my hair. I looked at the most expensive flat irons and finally settled on this one.  I am really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I was quite skeptical because of the low price point compared to other models which are double the price or more but this straightener is amazing! I have thick wavy hair and hair extensions and it straightens to perfection!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and fairly priced!</li>
    <li> DONT USE IT!!! I&#x27;VE USED IT FOR 2 YEARS NOW AND MY HAIR IS FRIED!!! MY HAIR DRESSER TOLD ME THE CHI MADE OF METAL AND IT&#x27;S JUST CERAMIC COATED! SHE&#x27;S RIGHT CAUSE NOW WHEN IM LOOKING AT IT IT&#x27;S ALL SCRATCHED AND I CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE METAL... 450° METAL PLATES JUST THINK ABOUT IT.</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived extremely quickly after the order was placed!</li>
    <li> Overall the product works well. Definitely not the best but good for the price.</li>
    <li> I had a Amika and loved it, this isn&#x27;t a bad iron for the price, just miss my Amika</li>
    <li> I like the flat iron for how it straightens my thick hair. But, it doesn&#x27;t have automatic shut off so I am going to have to get a different one, as I can&#x27;t seem to remember to turn mine off!</li>
    <li> The HSI Pro flat iron is pure quality.  I have used flat irons for years and found that my hair was left very dry, more prone to split ends  and fly-away like with my other flat irons.  The HSI heats up very fast, works well with my curly, coarse hair, and does not over dry my hair.  After using HSI flat iron, my hair is left very soft without being overly dry each and every time.  This was such a bargain for a high quality hair appliance.  I will keep this one forever! Thank you Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> I really liked this flat iron. the long cord was so easy for me to move around. only faulty it had was that it gets hot on the outside. it&#x27;s hard to lay it down on anything. I know it&#x27;s made to curl as well, but it&#x27;s still a problem. but overall I loved this product. also, I didn&#x27;t receive my travel size aragan oil</li>
    <li> The postage of door to door within 6 working days was incredible - I reside in rural Australia (postage service must be good in USA because it take me 3 - working days for delivery to Sydney).  The voltage correct to adapt to Australian voltage - just converted with travel plug and the iron is working fine.  Good product - I have long wavy hair and I only have to pull the iron once through my hair with (no tugging) - I would recommend this product and the price of approx $50 AUD makes it even better.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is excellent!  It heats well and maintains its heat throughout the whole process of straightening my hair.  Also, my hair feels great, not dried out, when I&#x27;m done.  The pouch for storing it is a bonus and came in handy when I traveled to Norway.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. But no better than my cheap, walmart hair straighter. I&#x27;m only keeping it because it&#x27;s not as heavy and bulky as my other one.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned.  It helped straightened my hair back after I went out in the humidity the next day. Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had hoped</li>
    <li> This hair straightener really surprised me. It heats up quickly, leaves my hair silky smooth, is really light (it almost feels like a toy - but in a good way haha). I don&#x27;t know how long it will last me but so far, it&#x27;s amazing an a GREAT deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Brush is well constructed. Fits curve of your head nicely. Ventilation assists with drying hair quickly</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the results, so I purchased another one, just in case.</li>
    <li> I really love it! It really gives my hair a staightened look. The argon oil works well with this product.  I will probably purchase more. My other hair straightener was a cheep drug store one so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to more expensive brands. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Its the best flat iron I have ever used and I have very frizzy and kinky hair.  This flat iron with some coconut oil makes it not only straight but it moves and flows and does not lie stiff.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase it after my GHD flat iron decided to die...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now and so far I am very pleased. I really hope it will have a long &amp;#34;shelf life&amp;#34;. It does a great job and the price is a steal. My hair is curly, full and very thick. I use the high degrees to combat this challenge. if your hair isn&#x27;t as thick you can use lower degrees.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Great product and got it at a great price!</li>
    <li> I needed a dual voltage flat iron for my trip to Europe.  I have always used a Chi and loved it.  This one is almost comparable, and much less expensive.  It just doesn&#x27;t flash reheat the way the Chi does.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the hair straightener.  It far surpasses her expectations!  Very efficicient and smooth.</li>
    <li> The best...I tried others, and there&#x27;s no comparison! Gave one to my son, and he loved too. It was recommended to me by my wise daughter!</li>
    <li> Better than a Chi for half the price, couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good cheaper alternative. It&#x27;s not. I kind of liked it at first, but then I avoided using it because I just wasn&#x27;t happy with it. it has a nasty smell to it when I turn it on. When I use it my hair doesn&#x27;t straighten well (does fine with a drugstore Remington though). Last straw was when I went to unplug it today the whole plug broke into pieces. I didn&#x27;t even pull it. Save your money, don&#x27;t settle!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Works great and my hair is fairly hard to straighten. Cord is super long and heats up fast. Only con is there is not an auto shut off. I&#x27;ve had this for almost two years and still works as well as it did the first day I got it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this iron twice, but i found that my hair goes a little straight,not as straight as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron; I would have given it 5 stars if it was a little wider.</li>
    <li> We bought the iron a few weeks ago and so far we like it.  My daughter uses it almost daily and she likes the fast warm up time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to straighteners. But even this newbie can tell this is an excellent straightener for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product - especially considering the price!!  It performs beautifully and I love the great bag that comes with it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Was a little hesitant due to the price because EVERYONE knows if you want a quality flat iron, you have to pay $100+ for it right?  (At least that was my understanding living in a house full of females...)  Anyway, I read the positive reviews and decided to get it for my wife since hers broke.  It came in and she has used it for several weeks.  I asked her one day how she liked it and she replied, &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well there you go.  Straight from a woman&#x27;s mouth... :)</li>
    <li> Love love this product! Highly recommend to anyone who needs to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with gloves and pretty travel pouch. Shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> The settings on this product is great and it was packaged really well.  Love the carrying case, it was unexpected.</li>
    <li> The hair straightener heats up within seconds and leaves my hair with a shiny smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> The flatiron works great. Shipping was very quick and accurate.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned. I have semi thick wavy hair and it does a great job getting it smooth and sleek. It does the job of more expensive irons for less than half the price. It is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Very good product! The heating is a little slow sometimes but other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought a CHI when they first came out 10-15 years ago.  Loved it.  When it stopped working after 4 or 5 years, I could not afford another CHI, so I purchased a big box special Hot Tools brand straightening iron with metal plates.  It worked quite well, and I have used it for about 9 years, but in the last few months, I can tell that it wasn&#x27;t heating as well, and the finish had long ago rubbed off the metal plates, so it did pull a bit in my hair, so I decided to buy myself a new iron.  I have slightly wavy and fine Caucasian hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get it nice and straight.  Knowing this, I opted for this iron based off the reviews rather than putting out the money for another CHI or other similarly priced iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron feels great in my hand, gets nice and hot and it does get my hair nice and straight, but it takes forever.  With both my CHI and my cheapo Hot Tools iron, I could iron out much larger sections and get great results.  With this one, to get my hair truly straight, I have to take much smaller sections.  In fairness, the section of hair I can iron in one pass is probably on par with what the manufacturer recommends, so the iron probably works exactly as it is intended, but I only give it 3 stars because it does not perform up to the level of my much cheaper metal iron.  I will keep it, and I will continue to use it regularly, but I sure wish it worked as well as my last two.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron! It heats up in a few seconds and makes my hair really straight, smooth, and shiny. My last flat iron took more than 2 minutes to get hot, so I was pleasantly surprised to see how quickly this iron heated up. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;The temperature is adjustable, which is important since there are many different hair types, and I think the highest setting would fry my fine hair. Although I have fine hair, I have a lot of it, so it&#x27;s important to me to be able to straighten/smooth with only one pass over each section of hair. This iron does just that. It&#x27;s also easy to curl my hair under or flip it up when I don&#x27;t want it totally straight.&lt;br /&gt;And I love the Argan oil sample. Makes my hair soft and shiny! And I feel like it gives some protection from the heat. All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron, leaves hair soft and shiny not damaged</li>
    <li> Very high quality! Buy it...</li>
    <li> I used to have a $200 Chi hair straightener that was my absolute favorite hair straightener. Had it for 5 years until it pooped on me. Probably because I dropped it so many times. I went on a search for a new comparable one including expensive and cheap hair straightener&#x27;s. None compared until I invested only $30 some dollars on this hair straightener. Love love LOVE it. Makes my hair beautiful every time. Straightens my hair and curls the bottom or does loose curls all over. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> This straightner works well but not as great as I was expecting.  It heats up quickly which is nice but there seems to always be parts of my hair that it doesn&#x27;t get straight.</li>
    <li> Heats well, cord is a little stiffer than my last flat iron.  Overall a good value for the price</li>
    <li> Love this Iron.  Have used it more recently.  It&#x27;s great.  Burns my hands at time lol.  Had for 3-4 years now still in good condition.  I don&#x27;t know about those negatives reviews but this FI is THE BOMB!!!!!!</li>
    <li> it like it makes your hair all new and great looking evrytime. i like the temp feature even tho i dont hv them on super high.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a QUALITY flat iron for years, and I have bought and returned countless irons in many retail stores. I always figured there was a diamond in the rough and something cheaper and better than that famous maker I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend $100 or more on (and that is when they are on sale) . . . I was skeptical and afraid that I would need to return this one too - but I noticed a few good reviews and thought I would give it a chance.  Well, the verdict is in, and I&#x27;&#x27;ll be buying more for gifts, this iron is THAT damn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that is heavily processed - it is difficult to get good results even in a salon, but with this iron at home, I&#x27;m doing better than the gal at the salon who keeps begging me to buy the more famous brand (I&#x27;m sure she is on commission) . . . save a little of your hard earned dollars ladies (or gentlemen as the case may be) and splurge on yourself - buy this iron. You&#x27;ll be happy you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT / UPDATE - I really do love this flat iron but I was incredibly disappointed with the seller with the constant change in price.  I paid a full $10 more only a day before the price changed, seller has said they would refund the difference - AND THEY DID.  NOW THAT is how AMAZON should work.  Thank you Blue Novelties ! ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> I love almost everything about it, but there is one pretty major thing that is wrong: it won&#x27;t sit flat on any surface! It is somewhat rounded on the top and bottom and with the way the cord hangs off the end it is very difficult to get it to balance without the heated elements dangerously close to touching my countertop.</li>
    <li> This is my first ceramic tourmaline flat iron and I must say that I am very impressed with the results. I can now save on hair salon costs because I can achieve the same straightness as my hair stylist using this flat iron. There is no frizz when I curl my hair. Only silk, straight, and shiny curls. I also love the HSI oil that comes with it which I will be ordering more of. It smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny. The is a great flat-iron for a great price and achieves the same results as a CHI iron or any kind of high-priced iron that would be used in a hair salon. This item also shipped and was delivered very shortly. I recommend to anyone to try for a lower-priced flat iron that achieves the same results as a high prices flat iron</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron so much that I bought an extra one just in case something ever happens to this one!  It is the first flat iron I have ever owned that works so great! I have been through a lot of flat irons that have either burned my hair or did not work!  This one is perfect!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron was a fail. It goes up to over 400 degrees, and even with me not putting it as hot as it could go, it left a serious burnt smell in my hair, which was my greatest fear realized. It also doesn&#x27;t get and KEEP my hair straight beyond the day I initially use it; by day 3, my hair somewhat frizzy and not hanging properly. I have naturally curly, mixed race hair.  I also found the edge of the ceramic plates snagged my hair when I ran it through from root to tip. I&#x27;ll be purchasing and FHI next. I think I should have shelled out the money in the first place, and avoided this disappointment.</li>
    <li> More than satisfied with the purchase. This is model is well built and very high quality. If you need a flat iron, you can&#x27;t do wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener is a fantastic product. I have never owned a flat iron before because I always believed they would be hard to handle and difficult to use. This product is easy to handle and easy to use. It gives me perfect straight and smooth hair. It has a great variety of heat settings and is safe to use and the handle is always cool to the touch. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I almost bought a new Chi, but after other reviews of the newer ones, I went with this one instead. It&#x27;s cheaper and works just as well as a Chi, if not better. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure whether to choose 3 or 4 stars. This straightener is not bad, but it&#x27;s definitely no professional styler. You do seem to get what you pay for in *most* cases. I decided to purchase this one on Amazon after reading reviews. I wanted to see if a cheaper flat iron could do the job okay. I&#x27;d previously had a T3 and a Chi from ebay. The T3 worked really well. I&#x27;m not sure if it was legit or not, but I don&#x27;t think it was b/c when I sent in the warranty card it came back as undeliverable. The problem with the T3 was that the hinge was really weak and kept breaking. I gorilla glued it 3 times, but after the 4th it just wouldn&#x27;t hold anymore. The Chi worked decently as well, but definitely was not legit. After those experiences with ebay and not being able to afford full price for a legit straightener I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;It works better on my hair when I&#x27;ve let it air dry for some reason. I don&#x27;t really like the edges that grip b/c it feels like it&#x27;s damaging my hair. The nice part about the gripping edges is that the hair doesn&#x27;t slip out easily as it did with the T3. I pretty much had to put the HSI on the hottest setting to straighten my hair, but it still wasn&#x27;t as good as the T3 in getting nice, sleek tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently got my hair cut and I could not for the life of me get the HSI to do what my stylist did with her flat iron. I&#x27;m not sure what kind she had--I&#x27;ll find out--and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just her expertise that helped??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I&#x27;ve just ordered a GHD from Amazon as I&#x27;m expecting my tax return soon. The GHD will be the first &amp;#34;full price&amp;#34; styler I&#x27;ve bought, though Amazon had quite a decent discount on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review after I receive it and compare the two.</li>
    <li> I thought it was ok .. Dissapointed I have to go over the hair multiple times before it gets straight. Wish I would of bought I higher quality iron .</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, thick, wavy hair and this straightener really tames it and makes my hair so smooth. Also, it usually takes about 30-45, sometimes even an hour normally to straighten my hair, but with the HSI straightener, i am seriously done with my hair in 15 minutes. I highly recommend this! best $40 investment!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.  I was extremely disappointed when it broke, but I loved it so much and it&#x27;s so affordable I was going to buy a new one.  I decided to contact the seller first and ask if there was anything they could do.  To my surprise, they sent me a brand new one, free of charge!  I love that you can straighten or curl with it.  Just perfect!</li>
    <li> Recently my CHI Turbo broke down after many years of use.  I purchased the HSI Straightener because of the great reviews I read and the great price.  I can say after using it only a couple times that I do love it much more than my old straightener.  I have fine but thick (quantity) hair with a wavy and sometimes coarse or frizzy texture.  My old straightener would leave the ends a little fuzzy, but this smoothes my hair all the way to the end.  The main difference I noticed between the CHI and HSI was the plates.  The CHI claims to have ceramic plates, but now being able to compare it to another brand, it seems like they were metal with a painted or coated surface (maybe ceramic?).  My hair seems to glide much smoother through the HSI plates.&lt;br /&gt;This is the straightener that my hair stylist uses and I always wondered how she was able to make my hair so much straighter and smoother than I could myself.  Now I know why!&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I agree with some of the reviews that said it doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up very hot, but it is enough to do the job (I have it on the hottest setting).  I am thinking this is also due to the ceramic plates (maybe it doesn&#x27;t conduct heat as well).  I have not yet tried the pouch of argan oil that came with it.  Overall, I am very pleased!  The product does everything it claims to do!</li>
    <li> I did a significant amount of research before I bought this straightener but had never seen or used one before. I have never been one to buy a name brand straightener due to their cost but looked forward to trying this one after so many positive reviews comparing it to famous name brands. I absolutely love this straightener! I love how my hair looks and feels after using it. It is worthy to note that my hair is extremely thick and unruly and this straightener makes it smooth and soft. I will recommend this straightener to my friends and family the next time they are in the market.</li>
    <li> After several years of considering getting a flat iron, I finally took the leap and purchased the HSI one after reading such positive reviews about it.  I am so pleased with it. First of all, I feel like they really thought of everything.  I was pretty delighted with the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; that came with it.  I thought it seemed silly to have a glove, but after feeling how hot my hair gets when using the flat iron, I realize that it is a very good thing!  I love that there is a travel bag to carrying it in and protect it when taking it places.  I also love the Argan oil that came with.  It smells lovely and gives my hair a nice sheen!  The iron itself is very easy to use and does a very good job on my naturally curly hair.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to get one!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new flat iron as the ones that I owned (numerous brands) just didn&#x27;t seem to work for my hair.  They either left my hair frizzy and dull, the temps were not hot enough, the plates did not have ceramic or tourmaline technology or pulled my hair.  It wasn&#x27;t until I started researching flat irons on Amazon.com that I came across the HSI Flat Iron.  From what I read, the flat iron had everything that I was looking for, and after reading the reviews of various other flat irons on the market, I was impressed with the HSI and decided to purchase it - and I am happy with my purchase.  First and foremost, it is a ceramic AND tourmaline flat iron, which is better and heats more evenly for smoother, healthier looking hair. The flat iron does heat up quickly and has heat settings from 210F all the way to 410F, which is great if you have wavy or curly hair.  Also, I really like how smooth the plates are, and the fact that they don&#x27;t pull my hair like some others I&#x27;ve used. Additionally, the flat iron is ergonomical and the cord swivels too.  All in all, a great professional flat iron.  Currently, I am looking at the HSI 1 1/4\\&quot; inch digital LCD model and hope to purchase that model soon.</li>
    <li> Based on the sheer volume of positive reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try these straighteners. I have straight, thick hair and I use straighteners simply to smooth out my hair and put a little flick at the bottom. Even the cheapest of straighteners normally do a decent job. My experience makes me wonder whether Blue Novelties have self-generated some of these reviews to boost their rating on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I plugged in the HSI straighteners, I noticed immediately that it took a very long time for them to heat up. Once they FINALLY got hot and the red light turned green, I found that it kept flicking off, and then on again, from red to green. I tried straightening my hair and got the weakest of flicks at the bottom of my hair. Those sections that I did REALLY slowly got a little curl that fell out after 24hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to their customer service and told them what had happened. In their curt response they said it sounded faulty and eventually offered to send a replacement. A week later, the replacement is almost exactly the same. They heated up a little faster, but the light kept flicking off and the irons, even at their hottest setting, did a very poor job on my easy-to-style hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wrote to them again today to ask about getting a refund I got a very blunt, poorly written response with an address of where to ship the items. Frankly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right that I should have to pay for return shipping on both items when they are clearly faulty. I also think that better manners and a more friendly approach to customer service would go a long way. I&#x27;ve never written a review online before but this experience annoyed me enough that I felt I should.</li>
    <li> After reading so many wonderful reviews about the combination of the argon oil and the iron combined, I was very disappointed to find that my package did not include the argon oil. The iron is OK, but I&#x27;m frustrated by receiving an incomplete order.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money! Straightens effortlessly. I have very long, thick hair and this straightener cut the time in half that it takes to get it looking smooth.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does a great job of straightening even the most thick tight curly hair (caucasian) such as my daughter&#x27;s in conjunction with the argon oil as a conditioning protectant. She only needs to pass the hair through 2 times to have a segment completely straight. She wears her hair curly 80% of the time and straightens it for a change of pace and this flat iron does the job easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed with this straightener. I&#x27;ve used a variety of high end flat irons and never had a problem. When I saw this was so highly rated I thought it was worth checking it out for that price. Unfortunately, it really is cheap and doesn&#x27;t work to flat iron my wavy hair. I will be returning it. Too bad that you truly do get what you pay for! :(</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. My two before this one were Paul Browns and had paid over two hundred for each one. Both of the Paul Browns never lasted more than 2 yrs. This time I thought I would try something different. I am very pleased with the way it straightens my hair. I have very wavy/curly hair and it is hard to straighten. This one does the job just as good as the Paul Brown if not better and best is it is a fraction of the cost. Don&#x27;t know how long it is going to last but at this price I don&#x27;t mind having to replace it if needed. Have to say it seems very well built.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener and I love it. It has different temps on it to set it to the temp you want.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This flatiron works as well as my CHI turbo did at half the price. I have thick, wavy hair, and it easily straightened my strands and left them silky and shiny--even when I&#x27;d forgotten to use conditioner on them. I definitely recommend that anyone looking for a new flatiron that works well but doesn&#x27;t break the bank take advantage of this deal.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy the HSI after my CHI started acting up by not always wanting to heat up.  I was excited about all the rave reviews about this flat iron it sounded pretty darn good maybe even to good to be true.  The HSI does heat up well and does in fact straighten my hair, however, Im thinking i may have received a defective flat iron.  I say this because as im pulling the flat iron down my hair its not a smooth pull.  Its hard to describe but with my CHI, there was no pulling of my hair this flat iron actually grips my hair and pulls some of my hair out almost like there is some rubber on the plates of the flat iron.  Its almost like a bumpy pull.  Sounds odd but its the best way to describe it.</li>
    <li> Terrible! It didn&#x27;t come packaged well, and when I plugged it in, it didn&#x27;t even turn on. I won&#x27;t be buying this ever again.</li>
    <li> Like the flat iron a lot. I have straight fine layered hair, but like to use the flat iron to add volume and I use them on the ends. I use a low temperature. Works great, shipped out fast and also liked the oil. They send the oil separate and I never received it, they sent me a replacement packet right away.</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old and new to this technology, so I&#x27;m still learning how to use the flat iron.  I do like it but need some \\&quot;one on one\\&quot; aid as the videos on the web are not so helpful as I&#x27;d like for short hair.  The ones available are all with long flowing tresses.  All my life I&#x27;ve put up with my hair doing what it wants to do as I have natural curly hair, and you live with what you&#x27;ve got.  Now I find out that I can have straight hair, and I&#x27;m so happy about it but need some professional help to \\&quot;iron out the kinks\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a few flat irons over the years including 2 Chi&#x27;s and overtime they just stop working. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often but I need something that works well because my hair is pretty wavy. The first time I used this flat iron it worked amazingly well. It took less time than with any other brand I have ever used and it heats up extremely fast. I haven&#x27;t had it very long but so far I love it. I am so glad I tried something new rather than going back to a CHI.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t always tell when it is on.  The light does not come on right away.  I find it difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, like the product but only used it once so far</li>
    <li> This straightener is just okay. It doesn&#x27;t work as quick or seem to get as hot as the straightener it was replacing, but it will do for now.</li>
    <li> Love to do my hair.  So easy.</li>
    <li> This product melted 3rd time I used it... Almost burned me. Then they told me it was going to be $40 to send in for a replacement</li>
    <li> Works very professionally, easy to use. Great price for the styler, very happy with results.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Flat Iron ahead of projected time.</li>
    <li> So I never write reviews because I hardly ever love something so much that I am compelled to do so. But this flat iron is exactly what I was looking for and I had to share! I have med length fine hair. I waned to find a flat iron that could straighten but also curl and create waves without my hair looking poofy or frizzy or like Shirley temple. This is it!! I have never been able to do my hair like I can with this flat iron! I&#x27;ve tried other flat irons, different curling irons, blow drying with different brushes, the list goes on...if u are looking for a styling tool that can give you straight hair, wavy hair or curly hair BUY THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> I was excited about getting this. But when I used it it would not stay hot long enough to strighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved all the things that came with it. Just wished it stayed hot.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron! My hair has always been an issue when trying to straighten it, it never lasts longer than a day or two, and frizzes up easily. This iron has amazing results, leaving my hair straight for an entire week before I had to wash it, although I am sure it would have lasted longer. Never thought my hair could be this straight!</li>
    <li> Wow!!  So much better than my old reliable Chi.  I found that this makes my hair softer and easier to handle.  I also found I don&#x27;t have nearly as much breakage of my hair.  I would buy this HSI again and again</li>
    <li> My wife has been very impressed!!!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this aI the best flat iron I have ever used. Seems to protect my hair.</li>
    <li> Worked great at first, but after a few weeks, it seemed that it wasn&#x27;t working as well or as efficiently.  It didn&#x27;t seem as hot at the same temperature--I had to keep turning it up to get the same effect.  It also seemed I was having to reset it all the time.  The \\&quot;actual retail price\\&quot; on this item is so ridiculously inflated, and the $50 I spent was a waste.  Now the window of time has expired to return it to Amazon and the company wants $20 in s &amp; h simply to repair/replace the faulty model that was sent to  me.  Buyer beware!  NOT a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Just received brand new flat iron in the mail, without having to request from the seller.  Was sent free of charge, buyer stating that they stand behind their product.  Very trustworthy seller, would recommend!</li>
    <li> My straightener broke and I was in a panic so I looked on amazon and found this amazing deal. It was cheap and there was nothing bad said about it. I got the product before the estimated date of arrival and I was so excited. I wanted to test it out so I just straightened a piece of my hair and it worked tremendously.  I had a good straightener before for 7 years and it worked, but not nearly as good as this one.  It used to take me and hour to straighten my hair and it almost cut the time in half.  There is adjustable temperatures so one can change it depending on their hair. This straightener is my new favorite thing!</li>
    <li> I had a CHI before this and I loved it. I purchased this flat iron because the caption stated it was the #1 best seller. It is OK however i feel it is a downgrade from my CHI I wish I would have went with a herstyler or CHI. I have only used the HSI once. The delivery of the product was prompt, thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I already have pretty naturally straight hair so i don&#x27;t need anything too intense, however, at the high heat setting the HSI works just as well as my $100 Made In America CHI ever did. Over three months in and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it whatsoever. If you have really, dense/ super curly hair, i still might recommend one of the super expensive straighteners if you are looking to get your whole head straightened in a really short amount of time, but for regular, everyday straightening and styling, there is nothing like this product for the value.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this flat iron. It works very well from how it feels in my hand to how it straightens my hair.  I like that it has an adjustable heat setting too .</li>
    <li> I love my new HSI flat iron.  I can get the natural looking waves I&#x27;ve wanted in less than 10 mins.  This iron is easy to use - since it was my first time using a flat iron, it took me a few minutes to get the hang of it, but then presto - perfect, loose, easy, curls!  It comes with a nice satin pouch, heat protecting glove &amp; a free sample of HSI Argan oil.  The oil smells divine and is great for smoothing out frizz or conditioning split ends.  I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the end of December.  Within 3 weeks, it started to just heat up to the max, no matter what setting.  I returned it to Amazon and ordered a new one.  About a month and a half later, it stopped heating up.  I won&#x27;t be getting a third one, going to try something different!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! What used to take me two hours to straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair now only takes me 45 minutes.  It leaves her hair feeling smooth and looking healthy. Best one I&#x27;ve purchased so far!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Straightens my hair beautifully and leaves it soft and shiny. No frizzies.</li>
    <li> It does not get hot enough and therefore it takes a long time to straighten the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to avoid buying this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item about 2 weeks ago, but I held off on reviewing until I had some good use out of it.  When I first opened it, I was unsure about the temperature control and how easily it would be to use it, but after using it, it&#x27;s so easy to control you almost forget it&#x27;s on the inner part of the flat iron.  I always use this product with John Frieda Thermal Protecting Serum, and I am so pleased with how well this flat iron works!  It glides so smoothly over my hair (partially due to the smooth protecting serum), and so far I have not had any snags either.  I use mine with the temperature control turned up about 3/4 of the way, and it heats up for use in about 20 seconds, maybe less?  I have no comparison for this product against the CHI, other than the fact that I completely ignored the CHI when shopping for a flat iron because I can&#x27;t justify spending $100 on a flat iron with no way of controlling the heat.  So, I purchased what seemed to be the next best thing with temperature controls - the HSI.  I am beyond happy with this flat iron, and for the price, it is such an excellent product.  I definitely recommend this - and I do so assuming that others reading this will use it properly and with heat protecting serum (as not using it can cause snags and damaged hair that you&#x27;ll probably blame on the flat iron).</li>
    <li> I love it and the the oil that came with it! It was so worth the price! :D</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons I have ever bought. I used to use another one that I bought at a pharmacy and it would take a little over 2 hours to straighten my thick curly hair. With this one, I finish doing my hair within an hour and it does a great job! Leaves hair shiny and the Argan oil smells good and leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this iron several months ago.  At first I hated it and was ready to send it back after using it for two weeks.  However, as I kept using the product, I noticed my hair getting softer and straighter after every use.  I normally go to the salon for regular straightening every 3 to 4 weeks, but in this case, I have not been to the salon for over 6 months, and my hair still looks so soft and shiny!  There are a lot of reviews that they feel that the product &amp;#34;does not heat up enough.&amp;#34;  I initially thought this too, but trust me, this is a GOOD thing!  You don&#x27;t want to burn up your hair, like many others tend to think you have to have a super hot iron in order for it to work.  The iron I received has a little LED light that glows red when it&#x27;s on, and then turns green when the product is heated to the temperature you set it on.  Throughout the styling process, you will notice that the led light will turn from green to red several times.  This is because it is maintaining the heating temperature.  Just keep this in mind when you do see it flicker from green to red.  The temperature is still set and you can still proceed with styling as usual.  With all of this being said, this is a great iron that gets your hair better with every use.  Do not get discouraged if you don&#x27;t see immediate results!  Give this product a chance and you will love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife and she has been completed satisfied</li>
    <li> Great product! It works very well. Vendor has quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I could not be happier with this iron. I&#x27;ve tried lots of them in the past and this is by far, the best one!</li>
    <li> The delivery was spot on and my overall buying experience was great. I would not hesitate to buy from this company again. The HSI Professional flat iron has so far been really good. My only, kind of small, complaint would be the pouch/storage bag that it comes with. I can&#x27;t figure out how to store the flat iron in it with the cord, usually it&#x27;s the plug part sticking out. As I&#x27;m traveling a lot it would be nice if it just easily fitted into it. But other than that the product has been very good especially for the price. The oil that comes with it is tiny, it really is just a very small sample size, but I didn&#x27;t buy the flat iron for the oil.</li>
    <li> This iron is better than average but doesn&#x27;t provide as smooth a look as my Chi, which I prefer. Service was great tho - received the item very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money!!  Works great!! I&#x27;m new to the whole flat iron thing.  Easy to use and it has a tempature dial!!  What a surprise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good straightner and heats up fast.  I like it more than the Chi and other straightners I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife, the hair stylist came to do her hair, gave it a try and provided very good feedback on it. Said it was very good quality.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for!  The item came with a cool carring case and a &amp;#34;HOT GLOVE&amp;#34; so I dont burn my pretty little hands.  Everyone should own this!</li>
    <li> It works so I&#x27;ll use it but I wish that I had purchased something else.  As I run the iron down a chunk of my hair I can feel the plate pulling my hair.  It feels like it catches on one hair at a time - ouch!  It&#x27;s kind of difficult for me to describe, but it feels like someone just plucks my hair out one strand at a time.  It doesn&#x27;t happen every time, but often enough to make me wish I had my old iron back.</li>
    <li> Great styler at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this straightener.  The quality and heat settings are great which makes the process of straightening my hair quick.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a very good straightener that&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron 3 months ago to replace my old conair. Pros: comes with sample argon oil, heats up to 400° in under 30seconds. Leaves hair shiny. Cons: takes me 30minutes or more to straighten my long curly hair. Some people said running the iron over their hair once did the trick, but that&#x27;s not the case for me. My hair isn&#x27;t very thick nor do i have tight curls, so it&#x27;s a bit dissapointing. Sometimes i need to touch up my hair to rid it of waves that develop throughout the day. However, for the price i cant really complain. If you&#x27;re looking for a solid iron and you dont mind spending some extra time on your hair this is a good deal. If speedy straightening is what youre looking for look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I gotta say the way it leaves my hair is pretty flawless!!! I got medium thick long hair and the end result is so silky smooth... ive had this flat iron for 1.5 yrs and it just didn&#x27;t turn on today!! So devastated!!! 😢Just thought it would last longer... so ordering the babyliss hopefully the lifetime of it is longer...</li>
    <li> Great Flatirons! I am really glad I discovered these through Amazon! Better than any really expensive ones. Worth the price</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She says it works better than irons she&#x27;s paid 3x more for. It&#x27;s only been a week, so can&#x27;t attest to longevity. Seems well built. Can&#x27;t really go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> Great iron, heats up fast and really straightens. Love the sleeve that comes with it. Haven&#x27;t used the glove, but what a great idea because I&#x27;m always burning my hands (maybe I should use the glove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great, arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Great price!  I highly recommend this straightener!! Most bang for your buck, my hair never felt so smooth!</li>
    <li> This iron gets really hot and works great. Leaves my thick hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> love it... read all the reviews before i got it, and they we all ring  I love how it leaves my hair soo soft... love it .. and very happy with the product,</li>
    <li> Very Good as Per My 21 YO daughter who has been the one and only user, check back in a few months</li>
    <li> This HSI Professional Flat Iron changed my life.  I had been using flat irons that were all less than $20 and were definitely non-professional for about 7-8 years, and I could never really get my frizzy hair really straight.  With this flat iron I get my hair straight every single morning.  The flat iron works so well.  I think it is partly because of the material that it is made out of, and also the fact that it gets really hot. I do recommend straightening after you first wash and dry your hair, and also putting some moisturizing lotion on your hair every day when you use the Hot Iron.&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this Hot Iron.  If there were more than 5 stars I would click on those also.</li>
    <li> Great product for an incredible price :) works great on my thick and curly hair, so I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got my item extremely fast.  It was just as described. Thinking about ordering more as future gifts to give for this price.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron heats up faster than any other flat iron that i have used, even though it&#x27;s more for straightening hair i use use to curl my hair and it curls it the best than any other and i have short hair my hair barley passes my eyebrows totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she says it is the best straightener she has used. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping by reading all of the reviews that I would absolutely LOVE this flat iron. When I got it and plugged it in I was disappointed. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hot enough..in order for your hair to get perfectly straight and smooth you have to hold it on to your hair for awhile and I&#x27;m not used to that. I have average/thicker hair and I didn&#x27;t feel like this was as great as everyone said it was.</li>
    <li> I am an african american woman with dry coarse hair that is very hard to maintain. Because of this i was convinced that no straightner could hell me.My hair poofs and frizzes in contact with any moisture.. but with these straightners ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. They seriously locked moisture in my hair and left it feeling full of life.  I highly recommend these!!</li>
    <li> excellent product.  Great service and shipping.  It works very well for curling.  Who would have thought that a flat iron could curl???</li>
    <li> It was fantastic the one time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this straightener!! I have thick long hair and this really works great!  Leaves hair feeling soft and shiny. Came with the extras but dont usually use them so I won&#x27;t be able to comment on them, nice to have though. Had my concerns because it was only an inch and I&#x27;ve always had a two inch one, since I have so much hair.  This one works so awesome that its not even a factor to me anymore. Also, was concerned because of all the great reviews it got on here and is only 40 bucks! Totally believe all the reviews now!! Won&#x27;t be buying anything else!</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great. Gets nice and hot for my coarse thick hair. I absolutely love it. It arrived on time and packaging was solid.</li>
    <li> Well I received my hsi flat iron with the plate chipped.  I emailed amazon about my purchase and have yet to get a response.  I must say this is the first time I&#x27;ve had an issue. The iron now seems to not get as hot, the first use was pretty amazing but now not so much.  Update, well they sent me a new one and I just had to throw that one away. My plate chipped again. My plug was breaking into pieces. I will never purchase another. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this flat iron!  It stays hotter consistently vs. the less expensive one she had... and this one was pretty reasonable, too.  She has very thick hair and says this one doesn&#x27;t cool down and have to re-heat itself as she&#x27;s using it like some do.  It just does a better job.  The seller shipped it very quickly, always a plus!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this straightener, it is the best one I have ever had or used. Heats up quickly and straightens instantly and my hair looks so pretty and shiny when I&#x27;m done. I have long thick curly hair so it used to take me a good hour to straighten it, it took me 20 minutes with this.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It came recommended to me by my sister, who borrowed my old flat iron and commented on how terrible it was. My old flat iron was very inexpensive but I thought it was good enough because my hair is relatively thin and straight already. She, however, commented on how it just wasn&#x27;t hot enough, and how she had to take multiple passes over her thick, coarse hair. I confessed to having to wet my hair, letting it dry, and then straightening for my old flat iron to work, and that&#x27;s when she recommended this to me. This flat iron is like night and day compared to my old cheapie. I can shower the night before and straighten out the bird&#x27;s nest in the morning with no problems. My hair looks fabulous, in fact. Another major difference that I noticed was how much longer the flat lasted. With the HSI, I straighten my hair and it&#x27;s immediately flat and glossy. And when I step outside: still flat and glossy. Throughout the day: still flat and glossy. I absolutely cannot say the same for the old cheapie. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the different temperatures and have determined that the iron has to be very hot even for my thin straight hair. If I turn the dial down to medium, even, the performance of the HSI is just like my old cheap flat iron. I love that I can change the temperature, I love that there&#x27;s a tiny little light indicator to signal to me that the iron is on and when it&#x27;s ready for use, I love that the cord swivels, and I love that it came with a heat satchel. When I&#x27;m done with it, I just throw it into the heat satchel and throw it all in the drawer. I constantly left the old flat iron out because I didn&#x27;t want to put it into my drawer while it was still hot. I also love the price for the HSI. I&#x27;ve never had one of the more expensive irons but I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to after this. (And for what it&#x27;s worth, the sister who recommended this to me had had a $100 iron. I don&#x27;t know what happened to it but I think it says a lot that she switched to the HSI and didn&#x27;t re-purchase.) The only ding that I can think of is that I can think of on this thing is that the power switch is inside a little close to the plates. But I just unplug when I&#x27;m done, so even that is moot. This flat iron arrived quickly and my interactions with the seller were nonexistent in a good way - I simply placed the order and then it showed up a few days later.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t turn out quite as I expected it to. After reading previous reviews, I thought it would work well for me. I have thicker hair, which I think is part of the problem...the 1&amp;#34; diameter of the iron isn&#x27;t quite wide enough for me &amp; I didn&#x27;t feel as if it got as hot as the old iron I am trying to replace (which led to me having to go over the same section of hair several times trying to get my desired results). I think this iron may work well for someone with shorter/ less hair, but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped to me within a week. And that&#x27;s great because I shipped it to Puerto Rico. The item heats up within a minute but it take pretty long to get cooled down. I love the travel case and sample argon oil that came with it. I do recommend this product for anyone on a budget. But of course, if you can afford a Chi flat iron I would go for it. This HSI Flat iron is worth the price and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it in my mom&#x27;s hair and was surprise that it went straight with just one pass. It is a great product. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I left the chi for this flatiron. I have had three CHIs and all have broken at some point. This flatiron straightens just by going through hair and curls 10 times better the CHI</li>
    <li> Good quality flat iron for a good price. My 12 year old daughter uses this flat iron with no problems and excellent results; she likes it very much. I recommend purchasing this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I use this on my natural African American hair and I love this flat iron and not to mention the sale price works wonder definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this gift for my wife for her birthday. As I knew next to nothing about Hair Straighteners, I went off the review of the other Amazon purchasers when making this purchase. They couldn&#x27;t have steered me in a better direction. As a guy, the adjectives that my wife uses to describe the bounce and volume of her hair after using this are quite foreign to me, but the results speak for themselves. If you are thinking about purchasing a Chi, or any of the other brands out there, please seriously give HSI a good portion of your time and go with them. From what I understand, they are the best straightener manufacturer out there. I would 100% make this purchase again, but after witnessing the quality fo the product they&#x27;ve made, I have a feeling that I won&#x27;t have to for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because it was the highest rated on on amazon. I am pleased with my purchase- no issues at all!</li>
    <li> Enjoy my new flat iron. Very fast deliver</li>
    <li> This ceramic straightener leave my hair shine, healthy, cheap from what I pay for and easy to used, won&#x27;t damage my hair</li>
    <li> Nice and great iron I and my husband we&#x27;re both loving it the way it goes on our hair that really gives us a super straight hair👍</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Ok product.  Comes with travel bag. Bought it for my wife for Christmas and it pulls her hair. I don&#x27;t think it should for this price that&#x27;s why is only getting two stars. Should of got a Chi.</li>
    <li> IN A NUT SHELL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this, and I DID. ONE drop to my wood floors. ONE, and it was all over. NEVER turned on again.&lt;br /&gt;I have other flat irons that can hold up to falls more that ONCE :(</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! Didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot to get great results. I have curly hair and I find myself spending less time getting it straight. My daughter has even curlier hair and we have been able to cut the amount of time it takes to do her hair in half. She can even do her own hairnow because it only takes once or twice through to get a good straight result.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron as a back up for my Chi.  It has been a wonderful experience.  I now keep this one&lt;br /&gt;as my main flat iron and my Chi is the back up.  I do wish it has an automatic shut off on it.  That would be&lt;br /&gt;quite helpful.  Other than that I am very satisfied with my new HSI.</li>
    <li> Dropped it ones, on carpet, ceramic plates shatter. It comes with a one year warranty but apparently warranty does not cover that. Very disappointed with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this so much more the CHI I used for years. Great product for an amazing price! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for travel!  I have ruined 3 expensive (salon priced) flat irons on trips overseas.  I finally took the time to order one that is dual voltage.  I found that this flat iron works best in Europe (its gets hotter), but it works great in the US as well.  I don&#x27;t like it as well as my more expensive flat iron for everyday use, but for this price its a great buy to keep for travel.</li>
    <li> Wishing I would have spent more $ to get a better iron. It wasn&#x27;t smooth and it just didn&#x27;t feel right. Didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny and sleek like I wanted. The reviews are stellar, and it&#x27;s not a bad iron. But I&#x27;m used to top of the line irons, and this one just isn&#x27;t that. For the money, it&#x27;s great. But you gotta spend $100 or more to get a great one. I returned this one and got a Sedu.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Works great and it was super cheap for a flat iron.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is insanely curly and this straightened it in minutes!</li>
    <li> my hair is straight and shines. I use it almost every day and my hair is better than ever. I no longer need to go all the time I comb</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t that great. I had to return it because the moment I used it, it began to cut my hair. It made my hair even look frizzy! I&#x27;m giving it two stars since it was so easy to return it. NO HASSLE.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this straightener and This item had a grove near the plate which pulled hair. The awesome people at this company contacted me after I posted my review and sent me a new one stating mine was probably a bad one. The new one is amazing! I have super thick curly hair that is to my mid back so very high expectations. I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the product since receiving the new one. The sellers are amazing people who really stand behind their products! I&#x27;m so thankful for them reaching out proactively. The product heats up super fast to 450 degrees. You can adjust it easily on the digital read out. It feels great in your hand and also has a great storage pouch for travel. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> The flat doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would for the professional rating that it has. I am disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results! I wish I would have it sooner!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  This was a replacement for one I&#x27;ve had for years.  I have thick frizzy hair and straightened it perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a bad flat iron, my 2 main issues were that the green/red light for temperature indicator is always red, so you take forever to straighten your hair waiting for the light to turn green. Also the plates are misaligned so your hair keeps getting stuck and the plates pull the hair out !! HORRIBLE - I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I really like It. It heats quickly and well. I used to use a two inch width because I have long thick hair, and thought I needed that. But my two inch sits in the cabinet now. This works well for short bangs and long hair. Also arrived quickly. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a year now and it works better than my chi, highly recommend to anyone. great product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I absolutely love it more than the chi! It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> Truly is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I have been using it regularly for over two months now and have experience no breakage. If anything, it makes my natural curly/kinky hair look like a fresh perm (relaxer). My only regret is not buying it sooner.</li>
    <li> Just Ok. Doesn&#x27;t work any better than the $15.00 drug store one I bought and that one had automatic shut off. The on light is too small. Why would they make this product with no automatic shut off, doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
    <li> Pinches my hair. Nowhere near the level of professional straighteners.</li>
    <li> Really was on the fence about ordering this iron or CHI. My daughter bought a CHI, so I had the opportunity to use both.  In my opinion it is  right up there with CHI. Loved the extras, now I need to see it staying around power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some minor flaws, HSI has small light that is hard to see if it is on (I&#x27;m always leaving it on). The on switch and temperature dial in awkward place on inside.  Other than that, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I was hesitating buying this due to some of the reviews but tried it out anyways. I use to have a chi until it broke but the HSI works just as well. I have very thick hair, I&#x27;m half black and Mexican so it&#x27;s pretty kinky as well. I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for almost 2 years and it is fabulous!  The very best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Flattens beautifully smooth.  I use it to curl my hair as well and my flat, naturally straight, hard-to-curl hair stays curly all day.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron for Christmas and I absolutely love it. It leaves my hair silky, shiny and soft. My hair has a tendency to get very frizzy very quickly but not with this flat iron. And it was delivered way sooner than expected. Overall I would recommend this flat iron to anyone. Very happy we made the investment, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price. For years I had a flat iron that was just perfect, I use flat iron on a regular basis (2-3 times a week) but unfortunately after 7 years of usage it was time for me to buy a new one (the cord was broken) I was reluctant to buy a new one because i did&#x27;t want to spend $150 in one at Sephora (ghd). My husband pointed out that amazon had a one with great reviews. Eligible for prime I decided to give it a shot, even though I was extremely doubtful because of the price. To me was too cheap to be any good.&lt;br /&gt;I was so wrong!!! THE BEST FLAT IRON, AS GOOD AS MY GHD THAT COST $150 FOR LESS THAN $40!!! You must give this a shot, I promise you you won&#x27;t regret it. The only problem I had is the oil bottle was open and spilled on the pouch, the flat iron was intact due to bubble wrap. No big deal at all. SO WORTH IT!!!</li>
    <li> I use this flat iron almost every day and it works great.  It heats up quick, it straightens fast, and the temperature adjustment is great.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It was delivered on time and in good condition.  (:</li>
    <li> This straightener is great! i love that you can change the heat setting on it. It heats up fast, so no waiting around for it to get hot. I actually pefer using this straightener then using my chi, which was more than double the price.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair (not like people who say they have curly hair but really it&#x27;s just frizzy or wavy). And this flat iron works great! I also bought one for my sister who has thick thick hair and it works very well for her too. Heats up quickly and it&#x27;s not heavy at all. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works very well, excellent quality.  Heats quickly,  indicates when heated, thin size is easier to handle.  No problem with first time user burning.  Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it gets really hot! The price is great.  I will not hesitate to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice straightner for the price, but it&#x27;s not as great as people say. It takes longer for me to straighten my hair then my walmart $20 hair straightner.</li>
    <li> The product works just fine to straighten thick hair.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t glide as well as my other ceramic straightener does (there is a slight dragging/pulling feel when sliding through my hair).</li>
    <li> The iron both curls and straightens and leaves the hair smooth and silky. The argan oil adds just a hint of fragrance and leaves my hair silky. The best iron I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Does wonders to smooth my hair. Much better than cheap brands and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; flat iron and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ridiculous amount of money. This was the first one I saw, and after reading just a few reviews, I went for it. The price was right and everyone was happy, and so am I! It&#x27;s exactly the same as a flat iron I paid over $100 nearly ten years ago that finally gave out on me. Now I am just hoping it lasts as long as the last one!</li>
    <li> 5 star rating given for because it come with a cooling bag.  The heat dial allows you to set temperature for the thickness of your hair.  This flat iron does not damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I wish that the width was a bit bigger. Maybe a 2 inch, but it does it job well enough.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener because my old one, which I swore by for years, finally died.  Now that I have this, I have to say that I couldn&#x27;t be happier that it did!  My hair is naturally very curly and can be frizzy even when blown out and straightened. This straightener virtually eliminates frizz and allows me to sometimes go a second day with the same blowout, which I was never previously able to do, because it helps hair to stay sleek and calm.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The look and the feel are what you would expect for $50. It&#x27;s not a bad iron, but the sides of the ceramic plates are not coated...this causes more friction to the hair and less shiny/silkiness. I&#x27;m returning this model because I did not get the results I normally get from other brands.</li>
    <li> This straightner is amazing! They are way better than the popular brand CHI. It was a great purchase. Im very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Right away I loved using my new HSI Flat Iron! It has high enough temperature for my extra thick hair! Love it!</li>
    <li> Very Happy with delivery and the flat iron looks well made. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet so can&#x27;t comment on how&lt;br /&gt;well it works.</li>
    <li> Works great the only reason I did not give it a 5 is that is takes some time to warm up and I don&#x27;t like that the on/off switch is on the inside of the device next to heating plate. Great price and works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the good reviews, but don&#x27;t think it worked any better than my old cheap one.  I do have really course frizzy hair though.</li>
    <li> I bought into the hype about this product, but I am NOT satisfied. In fact, I will probably be returning it. It gets hot enough, but is not comfortable to hold. Gets hot on outside (although they send you a nice little glove with it), and has ridges that hurt my thumbs.  I don&#x27;t believe it has ceramic plates either. It does not slide on my hair like a CHI does.  Probably will just stick with the original (CHI)!</li>
    <li> I have very naturally curly hair and have tried many straighteners and this one by far is the BEST!!!! Especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if something was specifically wrong with this one or all of them are like this. This leaves a weird texture on my hair, and its not a soft silky straight like the solia. I thought i&#x27;ll save money and get this because of the great reviews but I am not happy with it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is one of the best I have ever used. Worked wonderful on my super curly hair. Had a friend help straighten my hair and she loved it as well. Left my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks to review this product but it is absolutely amazing. It is a great product and the price is unbelievable. I have ethnic hair and it gets my hair very smooth and sleek. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product !  It didn&#x27;t work any better than my $20.00 model and it didn&#x27;t seem to stay at maximum temperature on a constant basis.</li>
    <li> I researched this item before I purchased it and it&#x27;s a living proof of all the reviews I seen. And for a great price</li>
    <li> Present for my daughter.  She says it works great.  The product limits the frizz and does not burn her hair.  she likes the 1 inch size because she does not burn herself like the larger ones can do becasue of their size.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best straightners I have ever had. My only woe is that it takes a few minutes to heat up to thehighest setting-but that is understandable. Other than that I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product!! It gets hot enough to straighten but not so hot where it catches in your hair and leaves that crease. This glides smoothly and I find myself being done with my hair in half the time!! This is a wonderful product and came with more extras then I ever expected!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after my Chi of 6 years died. I read all the reviews saying it was just like a Chi, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close!  I wake up with relatively straight hair, decide to touch it up with this straightener and 10 minutes later it looks like a frizzy mess! The plates don&#x27;t even resemble ceramic and look more like metal. Also, this thing pulls on my hair like crazy! My sink is full of hair after using this. I waited a couple of months before writing this thinking I would give it a chance, but I am not satisfied.</li>
    <li> My wife had a not really good impression on this kind of product from years ago. We recently got this type of product recommended from a barber, and searched on Amazon and found this one. My wife is very satisfied with it. It can both straighten and curve her hair and keep in shape for a week or more. Nice product!</li>
    <li> I have never spent more than $40 on a flat iron before, but when my last one was dying, I had to try this one.  The reviews were phenomenal and now I know why.  I have never owned a Chi or any other high end flat iron, so I cannot compare it to them.  I love this flat iron and it is well worth the money I paid.  I am getting one for my sister as a gift as soon as the next holiday/birthday comes around!</li>
    <li> The straighter works great. It gets hot fast and has no problem straightening or curling my hair. It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as my previous sedu, but it&#x27;s also 1/4 the cost. I dont know about the $200 list price, but for the amazon price it&#x27;s a solid straightener that gets the jobs done. Now it doesnt always turn the light green when it&#x27;s hot, but it&#x27;s still hot enough to straighten or curl my hair, so I dont really care about that. Overall, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to my friends. Heats up incredibly fast and seems to be gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is much nicer than the CHI I was using before.  It isn&#x27;t quite as smooth as I was expecting but it gets very hot and straightens my very curly hair well.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener I have ever used. I highly recommend this to anyone. The price is right and this is just as good if not better than a chi.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron. I have very thick hair and it works beautifully.  The storage pouch , oil and hand glove are very nice extras. The purchasing experience was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this flat iron after reading all the reviews, I may have been expecting miracles.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t meet all the hype,  its not that great.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a long time to heat up and it loses its heat easily.  I have thick, wavy, medium length hair,  I need to use it at its hottest setting. After using it on a few strands it loses its heat and i need to wait for it to each that temperature again.&lt;br /&gt;Another negative is its a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a straightener expert, I had one $20(vidal sasson) flat iron for almost 10 years and it finally needed replacing.  I was hoping to find something like that,  this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for $40 on amazon,  I would not pay more than that for this straightener.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday.  She loves the straightener so guess this was a good choice. Thanks</li>
    <li> This flat iron is cheaper than the one I used to have and it&#x27;s so much better! It came with a heat protectant glove, a little bottle or argan oil and a pouch to store it in. I am very pleased with my purchase and would definetly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I have previously purchased cheaper models, and although they worked okay, this one is by far faster to heat up and seems to be gentler on my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking it had rounded plate edges.  It doesn&#x27;t and is pretty much the same iron I currently own, so I returned it.  With that said, its a VERY nice iron and the price is unbeatable.  I have a Hot Tools iron that I paid about $90 for and I could kick myself ;)&lt;br /&gt;The iron arrived on time and my return authorization was sent to me very quickly, zero hassle.</li>
    <li> I read mixed reviews about this Straightener. I ordered it from Amazon Fullfillment. After waiting almost 2 weeks the product finally arrived. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. I noticed this week that it started shorting out. Almost like it was over heating. It would make a small noise and shut off. I unplugged it and turned it back on. It started working again. I&#x27;m hoping this isn&#x27;t the start of it already wearing it. I did pay around $45 with shipping. Overall it straightens my really curly hair very well. Leaves it very straight and soft. I get tons of compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  Just hope it the straigtener holds up!</li>
    <li> I broke my cheap flat iron and was looking for a better one. Happened upon this iron and thought I would give it a shot. Man was I glad I did!! It is VERY easy to use and it does a great job on making my bone straight hair take a curl and hold it all day. I know most people use flat irons to straighten their hair but this is the best product for curling in the new styles. When my blow dryer gives up I will be buying an HSI product again! It really should be well over $100. for this!!!</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better! Not only is it silky smooth after using the flat iron, but my color pops instead of dulls under the heat.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! The very first time this flatiron was great and then it stopped working! Doesn&#x27;t even get hot anymore. Waste of money, should&#x27;ve put the money on this towards a better quality flatiron.</li>
    <li> This is completely worth the price. It heats up within 30 sec to a minute.  straightens great. hair stays straight all day. c:&lt;br /&gt;Only thing i noticed i don&#x27;t like about it is it pulls your hair if you grab to less of a strand. but other than that its a great flat iron !</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works really well and I like the presentation it comes in making it perfect for gift giving.  I plan on coming back for another one along with some argan oil to go with it.  The shipping was really fast and the service was friendly.  Nice transaction!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener after reading all the wonderful reviews on it! Very glad I did! The product came in a nice neat package and I loved the results. It doesn&#x27;t pull or damage the hair at all--doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re using a straightener since it glides so smoothly. Five star rating!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever had better than chi n way cheaper!! Love it. Specially argan oil that comes with it !!</li>
    <li> I loved this product, I thought that it did an amazing job. Then one day (today) I went to plug it in and the reset button popped on the plug. Well I can&#x27;t reset it and now it will not work. I am beyond upset and can&#x27;t return it. I paid 60.00 for the flat iron in Feb. and the Amazon return policy was done on the 31st of March. I use a flat iron every day and now I do not have one to use. And I can&#x27;t seem to contact Amazon about this either.. Not a happy shopper at all!!!</li>
    <li> The flat iron straightens my hair with a single pass over my hair.  I have curly hair and the flat iron I replaced took several times over to get my hair straight.  It was a great price and customer service was good.</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and I love that I can adjust the temperature on it.  I have wavy caucasian hair and don&#x27;t need it turned all the way up.  My hair stays sleek and shiny until I wash it two or three days later.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I purchased this product after needing to replace my existing hair iron and after reading all the good reviews, went with HSI...and certainly was NOT disappointed. This is a very neat product, has the flexibility to adjust the settings and LOVE the argan oil that came with this, I will be purchasing the oil for sure. Leaves the hair straight and smooth and I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This arrived promptly (as expected with awesome Amazon!) and I loved the packaging and presentation of the iron. It comes with a glove, oil sample and red velvet carrying case, and I like the temperature control (my last iron was an FSI and did not have that feature). Really pleased with my purchase and feel like $39 was a STEAL for this iron. LOVE and HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> Not what i expected. Burned my hair left a horrible after smell and didnt curl as it said it would. Save your money go to walmart atleast returning it there wont be such an issue and can be done within 1 day.</li>
    <li> Good flat iron, nicely packaged, quick shipment! Works as stated in description! Easy to use and does an overall good job!</li>
    <li> I have a patch of gray hair on my temple which is unruly and does not fit in with my idea of a sleek, smooth bob hair style.  I tried a curling iron but that did not work so well.  I tried this flat iron based on the recommendations and I am super pleased with the results.  It is easier to use than a curling iron and the results are much better.  I use a bit of the oil provided, which also enhances the look.  Good results, good value, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was going to notice a difference from one flat iron to the next.  Clearly, I was wrong.  HSI is so much faster, smoother, and overall much better than the ordinary flat iron.  A good friend of mine, whom is also a professional hair &amp; makeup stylist agreed that this is a great flat iron.  Her coworkers also agreed and recommended I get it.  And with the offered price - you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Works Great! I love how it actually flips my hair at the ends unlike several other straighteners I have tried. And keeps it straight all day!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to use my new straightener and to my surprise when I oped the package I noticed that the plate of the iron was chipped and the top handle was scratched, it looked used and not new, I will never purchase a product from this company again. This is my first review and I have to make sure that other merchants don&#x27;t waste their time and money on useless products that are sold as new, I guess I learned my lesson. Good day!</li>
    <li> Its sleek, super quick heating, efficient, inexpensive. Can be used as a curler and straightner. I loved it . Doing my long hair is super easy now.</li>
    <li> They expeditiously sent me a new one after the first one&#x27;s plates cracked. It has been working fine. The plates heat well and turn my uber curly hair to straight without frizzing.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about buying a straightening iron over the internet because of the high volume of counterfeits sold through a second party (like Amazon). So, the first thing I did was register my product via the manufacturer&#x27;s website - no issues, it is indeed an HSI! There were a few issues with shipping: The first one I ordered never arrived, however, the seller (Blue Novelties) contacted ME to make sure everything went smoothly and shipped a replacement via priority mail. Would happpily do business with Blue Novelties again. I appreciated their attention and I recieved a genuine product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself does exactly what it advertizes - heats up quickly, makes my hair sleek and shiny and, after several weeks, doesnt seem to be exascerbating the damage done to my hair by other devices. It&#x27;s rather easy to use and lightweight. I am very pleased all around - both with the product and the seller. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The iron works better than the other cheap one I owned but it still does not work at making your hair smooth and shiny...a little frizzy is what I got for the results</li>
    <li> This was the #1 flat iron and I got it for 80% off.  I had it in my cart for days so I could wait until my daughter&#x27;s birthday to get it.  I decided to purchase it and got a great discount.  My daughter was excited to open and she used it the same day.  This is a great product and while flat ironing damages hair no matter what, the ceramic plates make her hair feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Iron surface is really nice and just lets the hair glide through.  Gets plenty hot very quickly, with a textured handle that makes it easy to hold and hang on to.  The only thing that would make this product outstanding would be an automatic shut off.</li>
    <li> I defintely like this better than my old ceramic straightener.  I purchased this one b/c it said ionic, and I figured that was better for my hair.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was great... It comes with a pouch and a glove and a little bottle of argan oil treatment.  The first time I used it, it was amazing. It straightened my hair in 1-2 tries. I have thick asian hair. I also tried doing curls and it curls wonderfully. The reason why I only gave it 2 stars is because today I wanted to use it, but it won&#x27;t turn on. I tried plugging in different outlets and it still doesn&#x27;t work. I have only used it 4 times now since I&#x27;ve bought it. So it was great while it lasted. So not happy about it.</li>
    <li> I will compare this to the CHI. It&#x27;s a little heavier and takes an extra couple if minutes to heat up BUT it gets hotter which is awesome I ou have curly hair and expose it to humidity. I find my hair stays straighter longer. Also the free trial of the argan oil is bananas. Reason enough to buy the iron. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I just got my HSI flatiron(through a Groupon).  Amazon is my all time favorite online seller store so I wanted to review it here.  Does anyone else notice that this flatiron has the exact same construction as the Herstyler?  It has a safety cord but other than that it looks exactly like my Herstyler Classic Forever.  Does anyone know why?  Anyway, it is a very good flatiron.  It heats up differently than the Herstyler, the plates are smoother and it seems to perform a little better.  I  like the Herstyler as well (can&#x27;t beat the price).  This flatiron gets very hot at the highest temperature so I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  Once you figure out your temperature, it just glides through your hair. I do notice that you have to use a heat serum with this one otherwise it may snag your hair but the results are excellent if you do. I took off one star just because it doesn&#x27;t have the look of a high end iron(its kind of basic). I think this flat iron is superb and a good deal.  I am happy to have it.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to judge the temperature.  I should have gotten a digital one instead.  It doesn&#x27;t get very hot but it may be that I am not turning it up high enough.  I am a bit hesitant because I don&#x27;t want to burn my hair.  I have it set almost to it&#x27;s limit.  I have gone back to using my old jade plated Migo flat iron for now.</li>
    <li> My wife thought that this flat iron was very ergonomic and easy to handle!  It arrived ahead of schedule which was great, and was well packaged.  She&#x27;s enjoyed using it very much.  She had not heard of the HSI brand prior, but pleased with this product..</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair I would recommend something wider than 1&amp;#34;.  Straightener works well, but takes a long time if you have a lot of hair</li>
    <li> This iron is the best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Great quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;I like that it straightens and flips my hair.</li>
    <li> Heats great. 2 cons... edges get caught in my hair and there is no auto shut off. Wish I hadn&#x27;t purched.</li>
    <li> I have a big, 2 inch flat iron when I want my hair straight.  However, my one inch flat iron which I used to use to give my hair curls broke a few weeks ago.  I bought this one as a replacement.  I did not pay attention to the fact that it only heats to 410 degrees.  My old one heated up to 450 which was just right.    This one is great, but those 40 degrees make a big difference!  My hair looks good, but the curls take longer to create, and they do not seem to last the same as my old hot iron.  (My hair is VERY thick, so that is a factor I am sure.)    Not that it&#x27;s a big deal, but this one also takes at least 5 minutes to thoroughly heat up.  My other one took maybe 2 minutes tops.    Overall, I am happy with this hot iron.  It was less than half the price of my other one which only lasted a few years.    On another note... I was THRILLED with the argon oil which came with the hot iron, though.  Thanks so much for the sample.  I have bought all sorts of products to heat my hair from bio silk to who knows what is recommended to me from friends and stylists.  The argon oil is the best.  It smelled great and my hair did not feel greasy like when I use other sprays or oils in conjunction to using the hot iron.  I will definitely order argon oil to use once I use up all of my current product.    **August 2014, the hot iron no longer heats very well.  In less than a year and a half, I am looking for a new hot iron.  I would not buy this brand again.  Two of us used the hot iron regularly, so I am not sure if it was too much wear and tear or not.  It still looks new... I guess I will spend a little more money and see if I can get another hot iron that lasts.</li>
    <li> I have tried several hair straighteners that friends had (including a Chii) and nothing compares to this one.  I have very fine hair and the adjustable temperature setting is great to not fry my hair.  The swivel cord is nice too so I am not getting wrapped up in it.  Great features and I&#x27;m telling all my friends about this one!</li>
    <li> ok let me start off by saying that my wife has blown through a million and a half hair straighteners and this one worked awesome shes got real thick long hair and this straightener heats up quick and gets the job done quick. Thank you HSI for saving me about another couple hundred bucks on straighteners. will it work you bet your butt it will</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this straightener after reading all the great reviews. It heats up quickly, came with a little bottle of argan oil and heating glove. Then the performance sharply dropped. One of the plates simply stopped heating up. Of course, that meant curls/straightening barely held and I&#x27;d have to go over the same section multiple times which was laborious. Unfortunately, the return window has passed but there&#x27;s no frayed cords or anything, half the straightener just stopped working for no apparent reason. How disappointing.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a non-slip product for our deck stairs. Nothing seemed to work until I found these self-adhesive treads. Honestly we have not used them yet due to the cold weather, but look forward to trying them out for longevity.  They will get much sun! Probably will do the whole house exterior steps with these as I like the look also!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand reviews and prices of flat irons. There seems to be no correlation between reviews, cost and performance. I had a $15 flat iron for years that I loved. It was my first one so I didn&#x27;t know it would be hard to replace. This is my third attempt at a replacement. It works well enough and I will keep it, but it is nothing special. Seems to require multiple passes to get the effect and it seems to tangle my hair. Not sure why. I&#x27;ve just started using it. I say go cheap on flat irons. I don&#x27;t think there is any rocket science behind their performance--despite all the marketing ploys. I don&#x27;t think I would have spent the money on this if I knew then what I know now.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that the quality would be much better than the thirty dollar supermarket one I had purchased years ago and had the ceramic coating wearing off. Granted, the supermarket one was the wide style, which probably straightens hair more efficiently, but I wanted a narrow one so I could also do some waves in my hair with it. That said, I&#x27;m not super impressed with this one. It does the job but no better than the Remington Wet-to-Straight that I previously owned. Being able to do waves is a nice touch. I have hair on the thicker side but not super thick.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this flat iron! I ordered because of the \\&quot;great deal\\&quot; of $150 below list value and the \\&quot;best-seller\\&quot; label. I was immediately disappointed with the quality of the iron. The iron pulls on my hair like a cheap drugstore appliance, and I can tell that after continued use, my hair would be damaged. I use a Paul Mitchell flat iron now that leaves my hair soft an shiny, compared to the brittle, rough feeling after using this HSI flat iron. Do not buy- a complete waste of time/ money. Hopefully the return goes through smoothly!</li>
    <li> I read all the good reviews and decided the price was reasonable so why not. I was impressed with the first use until I used titanium flat irons from a fellow beautician. Needless they put these to shame and I ended up just spending the money on my own babybliss titaniums.</li>
    <li> A great buy for the price...haven&#x27;t used it much but the times I did, it worked great!  I would recommend</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT... WILL RECOMEND..</li>
    <li> Works much better than the flat iron I paid a lot more for.&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair straight much more often now that I use this iron.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! I have used over ten hair straighteners and this one really takes the cake. It&#x27;s small enough for short styles and doing your bangs, but provides enough power so people like me with thick, long hair can straighten fast. It also has curved edges, making it extremely easy to curl your hair with it as well. Definitely a quality product.</li>
    <li> I think this is just like other ordinary straighter.  I bought it because of a lot of great reviews but after using it, I don&#x27;t feel like this is as amazing like other reviews said..</li>
    <li> This definitely gets the job done and I love the carrying case. It does, however, sometimes rip my hair, and the red light stays on for long periods of time and I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
    <li> The product worked few times after I got it. After which it didn&#x27;t heat up. I tried resetting it, and it seemed to fix the problem. Recently it stopped heating again, like 1 week after the return window expired and now the Reset isn&#x27;t working either. It&#x27;s a good product as long as it works.. which for we was like less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do understand that it&#x27;s a electrical product and might be defective sometimes.. but that&#x27;s why you have \\&quot;WARRANTIES\\&quot; on electrical products right? Well.. guess not..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it a three star as the product was good when it worked.. I guess you can blame the Seller named &#x27;Trending&#x27;.. I&#x27;d suggest buying it from HSI or Amazon.com rather than 3rd parties..</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! ITS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!I was so exited to receive my flat iron because i have had the same flat iron for the past 5 years so i wanted to make a change and i thought this one would be better for my hair since its ceramic.... I was sooooo WRONG!!! i got my packaged opened it and i was all nicely packed i couldn&#x27;t wait so i tried it right away. My hair was already straightened so i thought this thing was a miracle when i tried it on my hair. The next day after i showered and dried my hair i was exited to use my new flat iron. (Im a mexican-american female with thick black hair) this thing was at its highest setting and it was not straightening my hair!!!! i was so PISSED bc it didn&#x27;t work and i was running late so i pulled out my flat iron of 5 years and did my hair i couldn&#x27;t believe my Remington wet to straight flat iron was better then this piece of crap!!! i also realized that when you use a heat protectant serum it burns onto the plates of the iron and it looks yucky and brown!! the plates also looked like they were about to fall off!!! til this day my 5 year old flat iron is still working for me!!!!!</li>
    <li> I.S.O. Professional is cheaper and great. I&#x27;ve been using same one for 2+ years and love it, thought I would try out something new. Really regret it. I tried to straighten my hair with this... It did not straighten it. It may have made it less curly but still wavy, and also ripped out my hair. I returned it next day.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking for a new straightener should try the I.S.O. professional. It is cheaper and works fantastic!</li>
    <li> I bought two for each daughter knowing the HSI brand is a good brand.  But both flat iron do not work well.  It does not heat up need to do hair way to many times to get hair smooth and straight.</li>
    <li> With so many positive reviews I was hoping it was all they said it was but unfortunatly it wasn&#x27;t for me.. doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly and tugs at my hair....wish it worked for me but it just didn&#x27;t:(</li>
    <li> Straighter is very nice. Heats up quickly, and works great. Item gets a little hot on the handle but otherwise no complaints.</li>
    <li> We got one for my Grand daughter and then my wife needed one. They both use it and like it.</li>
    <li> Actually went through the reviews and researched this product and love it. Great! Prompt, safely packaged. Works great on thick, curly or kinky long hair and especially with the argan hair treatment too.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST flat iron I have ever laid eyes(and hands) on!!! And the Argan Oil that came with it was amazing!! I am seconds away from ordering a larger one now!&lt;br /&gt;Being African-American with natural hair, I didn&#x27;t think that my hair would turn out so straight and silky but it did and I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Recieved this fast n results were amazing! Will stick with this brand flat iron n argan oil was amazing. Highly rate this product.</li>
    <li> I received the product earlier than I expected! I have yet to straighten my hair with it because so far I love how it can also curl my hair and the first time I tried it, the curls lasted two days! I love this product and would highly recommend it to others. :)</li>
    <li> I Love this straightner. Heats up fast does a great job. Use it every other day. Love the glove too that comes with but it isnt heat resistant but it does protect your hand to a degree.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Chi straightener. It didn&#x27;t straighten my curly hair very well nor did it last long, so when it came time to buy a new straightener I wasn&#x27;t sure what to purchase. Apparently more money for a product doesn&#x27;t mean quality. I bought the HSI after a friend recommendation. I&#x27;m so glad I did! I love it and it was such a good price!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my kinky curly hair and it smoothed it out like butter to a warm knife. It heats up fast and the LCD indicator is very helpful. The flat iron has an auto shut off feature that can be helpful for those forgetful days but worrisome during the styling process. Overall, I&#x27;m loving the product and I hope it stays around for some years to come.</li>
    <li> This straightener was not what I expected for the price.  Very heavy and does not run smoothly through hair.  Takes longer to heat up than most, dial for temperature does not turn easily and on and off switch it positioned horizontally rather than vertically which is odd. I would not recommend this to anyone. My Chi was way better.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I dropped my Chi, and it broke in half. I figured I would take a chance on a less expensive flat iron, and save some money. I was hoping (and after reading other reviews) expecting this flat iron to compare with my Chi flat iron. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It is much heavier, and does not work nearly as well. My hair is semi coarse, and wavy, and this iron is just bulky, and added at LEAST 10 minutes to my styling time. As a working mom, I just don&#x27;t have the extra time. I would say for the money it is a good buy, but I personally returned it, and will be spending the xtra $30 to purchase another Chi</li>
    <li> Great flat iron the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Glides so smooth with no pulling. straitens in one move no kidding so worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It is the complete bomb dot com. It regulates heat perfectly. I use it on my human hair wigs and my synthetics. I also use it on my hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was sick when my Chi died - they aren&#x27;t cheap!  So, I really didn&#x27;t want to have to spend that kind of money on a new flat iron.  I shopped around on Amazon and this one sounded good and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while now and it use it regularly.  Honestly, if works as well as the Chi, if not better.  Very good purchase for me - very happy I didn&#x27;t spend the money another another Chi.</li>
    <li> I had used an old revlon flat iron for many years. I had high hopes for this HSI flat iron and it has met my expectations! The first time I used it, I let my curly hair dry naturally into a curly, frizzy mess. I then sectioned it and used the flat iron to really test whether it could straighten out the curls and frizz. Sure enough, it did and left my hair straight and silky! Since then, I typically use the iron to smooth out my hair after I blow it dry. It always looks silky now and it stays straight for a few days without my having to flat iron it. I also love that it has a temperature setting. My hair is thin and fine, so I keep it lower on the temperature dial, not even halfway, and it works well to straighten my hair without it getting burned. The tourmaline and ceramic also make the plates very smooth, so I have not pulled my hair or had any tugging, which is a plus given my hair is easily damaged. The product came within about 2-3 days with a pouch to store it. The iron heats up and cools down quickly as well!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this new flat iron once it arrived. It was packaged very nicely and came with some bonus accessories. Upon first inspection, the flat iron feels very sturdy and does have a nice long cord and reset button. I was impressed until I began to actually use the flat iron to fix my hair. I quickly became very disappointed! Although sturdy, the unit is heavier than others I&#x27;ve had in the past. With the use of some good product, adjusting the temperature, and sectioning off my hair, I still found myself passing through each strand of my hair several times to get a nice look. After a few weeks of use my hair dresser warned me passing over the same strands of hair several times like I was with this iron, could be very damaging to my hair. As badly as I wanted to love this iron and as excited as I was to receive it, it&#x27;s just NOT that great!  I&#x27;m going to shop for something different. I&#x27;ve had other flat irons in the past that worked much better and I will be shopping for something similar to those models.</li>
    <li> I really like this straightner. It works well on my curly hair. I have used straighteners in the past but none have worked as well as this one. It takes me no time at all to flat iron my hair. I use the glove with it to keep from burning my hand while straightening.</li>
    <li> I tried it right when I received it and my cheaper straightener works better than this. It didn&#x27;t heat up high enough. I had to go over the same strand of hair more than I should have and it still didn&#x27;t get straight enough.</li>
    <li> love this flat iron, makes my wavy hair pin straight and even can create curls. works just as good as my old straightener that i paid 150 for.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, perfect condition, love the flat iron, highly recommend it. Great to straighten hair quickly before a date or for work, any occasion.</li>
    <li> Glad I spent the money! This is the only flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used that gets my natural hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice iron. Not too heavy. Not too light. Works great. Comes with a nice thick silky cover for traveling. I&#x27;ve used costly irons and cheaper irons. This is best so far. My hair is a medium thickness, slightly wavey and not coarse. (So I can&#x27;t attest to the effectiveness if you have thicker, coarse hair.) This was a great buy. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love my iron, is the perfect size and in just few minutes I get my hair done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just love it :)</li>
    <li> The seller is awesome and ships very quickly. The item is exactly as described by the seller. I only left 4 stars due to the product itself. I have only had it for a little bit and already the sides of the ceramic plates are chipping. Not very happy about that but again it is not the sellers fault. I cannot complain too much though as the price was pretty cheap for a decent hair straightener.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for the price. I normally purchase the FHI straightener but it was just getting too expensive. This comes with a great travel pouch bag and hair treatment oil. Only con is that it takes a little longer to heat up, but otherwise and so far this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product. It came early, was brand new, super awesome to buy as a gift for someone. Good for your wallet great for your hair. I suggest you get one!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and daughter, but it is so easy to handle, my wife is calling her friends to straighten their hair! She is crazy about this product. So far, straightening hair seems to be very simple and straight forward. They still need to get used to curling their hair. I hope she wont convert my house to a salon.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item over the CHI because I had read there are a lot of CHI knock-offs being sold online.  This iron DID NOT WORK; when I plugged it in, the on off switch did not work, the light did not light up, and the iron only heated a couple of degrees (it was hardly perceptible that it was generating heat at all).  Returned for a refund :(</li>
    <li> I, like many of you are reading reviews to see if this product is worth purchasing. I ordered the HSI on line and was skeptical.  The price was great 39.99 and I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping and handling.  When I recieved the product, I immediately tryed it out.  I can tell you that I was amazed. I only had to go thru my hair ONE time and the best part of it is that there was no fly aways.  Don&#x27;t know about you but my past flat iron experience is that althought the iron can get my hair straight, it left fly aways strands.  This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I saw a special of flat irons, I have used it a few times. Everything works as recommended. I did like that included with the Flat Iron, they had included instructions on how to use the Iron. As someone who is new to using products for hair straightening it was helpful.</li>
    <li> It doesnt stay hot very long...when it cools it pulls at my hair when i straighten it.  Should have realized that it wouldnt be great based on price...you get what you pay for with this product.</li>
    <li> I had been using a very expensive flat iron for the last couple of years, and it recently went out on me. I looked up the reviews from Amazon on this flat iron and thought I would give it a try. Not only did it work just as great as my $150 flat iron, but it also only cost me 1/3 of what I would have had to pay to get the same flat iron that I was previously using. They also threw in a great leave in hair treatment that I have been using loyaly. The treatment gives you that awesome,  shiny, clean look to your hair without making it oily. I would definitely reccommend this product to ANYONE &amp; EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several items off Amazon but this is the FIRST time I&#x27;ve felt the need to write a review..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend&#x27;s hair straightener broke and she was worried about finding and spending a good chunk of money on another solid straightener.  We found this product, the 1 1/4\\&quot; version, through Blue Novelties and she couldn&#x27;t be happier!  With her 1st straightener it took her \\&quot;30-45 min\\&quot; to flatten her thick Arab hair.  Now she said it takes her \\&quot;15-20 min\\&quot;!  I love it because it&#x27;s less time I have to wait for her to get ready so we can leave to the bar earlier.  Her older sis tried out this product yesterday and wants one now..no joke!  I highly recommend this product to anybody looking for a strong, safe, and fast hair straightener.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. I have 4a hair and it would straighten it with one glide. My hair is shiny.  The women at my job thought I got a relaxer and didn&#x27;t believe I got my hair straight with just a flat iron. It&#x27;s a lot better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used on my hair before.</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was on sale, very happy with my purchase. It works great leaves my hair very smooth and I have very thick long hair. Heats up good and the oil that it came with works great, will be purchasing more it</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron.  I have been skeptical about using one for years.  I am so glad that I did because when I use the HSI Argan Oil with my flat iron (everyday now), it makes my hair look healthier than it has in a long while.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This straightener lasted exactly 2 months before quitting on me - the light blinks and the pads don&#x27;t heat up. Because the return policy is limited to 30 days, there is no recourse for me to even replace it. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I ordered this! It was SOOOOOOO Cheap!!!! It works GREAT!! I would totally recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This flat iron didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. I bought it due to strong reviews but it felt rough on my hair compared to other higher-end irons I have used in the past. I ended up buying a different one but kept this only for international travel.</li>
    <li> Works well, good price.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and works well.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great. It heats up fast, indicates when it needs a bit of time to reheat itself if you&#x27;re straightening wet hair, and works really well. Also, when I received my package, it was missing a trial hair oil bag, which I didn&#x27;t even noticed but the company emailed me later and said that one is in the mail for me as promised because it didn&#x27;t make it into my package for some reason and so I really value their honesty and keeping their words when they promised to give a trial hair oil bag. Anyways, great service and product 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it to straighten my hair a few times a week and it&#x27;s been working good.  It works great for the price.</li>
    <li> Heating is really quick. You only need 10-15 min and your hair is done! Amazing product! No regrets and price is the best!</li>
    <li> I shipped fast and works great! Gets hot fast! I like how small it is. Good for traveling with the carrying case!</li>
    <li> This is not only a 5 star product, but an AWSOME product. U wont be disappointed,it will meet your expectations,highly recommend.....</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why turning this on and keeping it on is such a difficult task. After purchasing this from another retailer, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on, even after following the directions. Returned it and reordered from Amazon and so far it has turned on, although with difficulty. It has to do with pushing the reset button. Other reviews indicate this to be a common problem so time will tell. But the price is excellent for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 24, 2013... This works very well now that I&#x27;ve used it and know its quirks. One side seems to get hotter than the other so I have to use it then turn it over to use the other side. No big deal, I think I&#x27;m just putting too much hair into the iron. I love it!</li>
    <li> This straightener stopped working 8 months after purchase. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The flat iron itself works great, there is a slight malfunction with the indicator light. It goes out occasionally when in use.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the service from HSI Professional.  Product was received before expected date.  Flat iron works wonderfully every time - quick to heat and great to experiment with the multiple settings.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron a few months ago to replace my 4 year old CHI that finally broke. I was considering buying another CHI but I chose this due to the good reviews and lower price. However, after using this product I wish I had bought a CHI. First off, this flat iron seems to clamp onto my hair on the edges and pull some strands out if I&#x27;m not careful. Secondly, this flat iron doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough, even on the highest heat setting, and it doesn&#x27;t stay hot either. The temperature knob also spins all the way around, it doesn&#x27;t stop at the two extreme temperatures. Overall, I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it. Works better than the Chi I had but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as others I&#x27;ve tried. The price was right, however, and made up for my mild disappointment.</li>
    <li> It straighten the hair and thins it all in one.:{ I would love this product if it didn&#x27;t pull out my hair when I was using it. I am probably going to have to send it back and look for a different one.</li>
    <li> Received product very quickly! I always used to use chi flat irons but decided to give this a try and it was worth it! Leaves my hair very soft. I also love the argon oil sample. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I am totally satisified with my purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.  It arrivied exactly when it was suppose to and was brand new in package with authinication certification and useful how to use DVD, and all at 1/4 of the price I would have paid from the Brand Name web site.  I am a very happy customer and will definitely be returning to Amazon for future purchases!</li>
    <li> I have had 2 Chi flat irons in the last 4 years. I love the Chi; However, my Chi flat irons only work for about 2 years. When my Chi broke, I did some research and found the HSI. I&#x27;ve used it twice and can&#x27;t even tell a difference in how the Chi and HSI straighten my crazy hair. This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve found for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many straighteners in the past that I&#x27;ve loved, and this one is definitely in the rankings.  I feel like it doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair as much as I&#x27;d like it to, but maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> So pleased with it, love it!!! Nothing was wrong with it. Exactly what I had expected. It works great my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy when I straighten it or anything great for think hair</li>
    <li> The price is right for this hair straightener -- I do not have to take multiple passes to get my hair to lie flat. My only complaint is that there is no automatic shut-off, which means I must be extra attentive after each use.</li>
    <li> Not very hot or powerful. Should have saved my money for the chi I wanted at ulta 3. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a straightener to replace the mini conair I had. This is a great replacement. I honestly haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but I can tell a difference! It heats up much faster and is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Works well Pleased with purchAse</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t agree with a lot of these reviews saying that it&#x27;s the best flat iron ever, etc.  It is decent, but pulls my hair here and there.  It does straighten my very wavy hair pretty well and stays all day.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice so far but so far so good. Hair comes out nice and smooth. I have to figure out the right temp to use as I think I have it too low so I have to pass it thru my hair a few times.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener when had originally wanted a chi but all the chi reviews said they we&#x27;re probably counterfeit. This was the number one ordered straightener on Amazon and it was a GREAT price! I got it within 2 days which is not normal with a non Amazon seller. I used my product for a few days and then it stopped getting hot. I was very dissapointed and immediately emailed the company that sold it to me. I had read this happened to someone else as well. The company replied to y email within minutes and I had a new straightener within two days (at no cost to me). I was very happy with Blue novelties customer service and how quickly they fixed my issue! I also ordered the HSI hair oil from them as well and love that (it is also a great price!) I will defiantly be using this company again!! My new straightener works great and I love it! I don&#x27;t know what happened with the first one but overall it was worth it!</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this flat iron. Used it once, and it pulled my hair. Never had that happen, even with the cheaper irons. If it truly made my hair look better, I would have kept it hair pulling or not. But, nothing better than my cheapie flat iron. So back it went.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron, trusting the reviews listed. I am so happy I bought it!!! It is great quality, stylish and does an excellent job! This iron helps keep my hair sleek, even in humid Georgia.  Like many reviewers ahead of me, I am very happy with this iron.</li>
    <li> I have owned several straighteners from a lower end, all the way up to a higher end Chi. I was in need of a new iron, badly. The one we have now is starting to pull your hair, you know, the one single short hair that happens to always be at the knapp of your neck? WTH? I was a bit skeptical at first as the price was so low. I just kept saying to myself, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for!&amp;#34; BUT, I read all of the comments and almost every single one was good. So, I figured what the heck let&#x27;s see what all the fuss was about, and ordered it. It arrived on time as it stated. When I removed it from the box, I knew just by handling it, it was well made and was going to be an amazing straightener. It also came with a hot glove, a sample of HSI Argon Oil and a pretty red carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;  I was finally able to sit down and get some one on one time and I was very, very satisfied. It straightens my hair with one stroke. It leaves my hair feeling like silk and looking even better!  Thank you for making such a wonderful product and making it affordable! I&#x27;m going to order some Argon Oil and now I&#x27;m thinking about a blow dryer!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend, neighbor or a stranger on the street that needed a good straighten!!</li>
    <li> A great flat iron for a reasonable price. Gets just as hot as the more expensive irons and works great.</li>
    <li> This straightener worked great but after less than a year developed a crack in one of the ceramic plates.  Making it pull your hair when using it.  Needless to say it is useless now.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use. Heats up immediately. Comes with a glove but I don&#x27;t even need to use it. Makes your hair shiny and straight without a blowout. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my older model flat iron.  Didn&#x27;t realize that it has a test/reset button and had a &#x27;duh moment&#x27; when it didn&#x27;t heat up the first time I wanted to use it.  It heats up very quickly and does have a light on it which is red while heating to the temperature and it turns green when ready.  Mine did come with a carrying pouch, glove (which I don&#x27;t think I will use) and a sample of the Argan Oil.  I have been using the iron for just over a week and am very happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron met my expectations.  This is the first I&#x27;ve owned, so I cannot compare the quality to another brand.  It seems to do a good job (I&#x27;m still learning the art of flat-ironing hair, so it still feels a little awkward).</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  For me a flat iron is an essential everyday tool.  I&#x27;m very happy to have found this one.</li>
    <li> Larger than I thought out would be but works great</li>
    <li> Ive used chi flat irons for the past couple years, which I loved.. however they always gave out on me (and at the worst times!) so I decided to try this product because of the great reviews and I hightly recommend. Leaves hair looking great without any damages. Fast shipping,good price,great product.</li>
    <li> Order received as promised.  Item is good quality. The pouch is nice and I love the travel size oil! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This really only worked for 3 months and then just stopped working out of nowhere, its a shame because it actually worked very well. It straightened my hair like a dream but then one day the light made a crazy popping sound and then it wouldnt work anymore. Any one looking to purchase this, do your research and find a better one that will last longer than a few months</li>
    <li> Love this straightener, leaves my hair straight and shiny. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> does what it says it does, works very well! i have hard to straiten hair and it only takes a half an hour to do my hair.  my hair is way down my back and frizzy/curly</li>
    <li> This straightener smooths my hair better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. I typically don&#x27;t actually straighten, but curl/wave my hair to tame this mixed textured mess that is my hair. :) The only changes I would make is the time it takes to heat (I have to use almost the hottest setting, which has always been typical of my hair) and I wish it had a built in prop so it could sit up off the counter between passes.</li>
    <li> I received the iron very quickly. It came well packaged and with a glove and satin case.&lt;br /&gt;I had read reviews about these products, so im glad I spent the extra few dollars and got the higher quality. It heats up quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave crease marks on my hair. My hair comes out nice and smooth and shiny. It takes the frizz right out very quickly.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received my flat iron in the mail that I tried it right after opening it.It wroked fantastic! My hair was smooth, flat and shiny! I especially love the thermostat control feature. You are able to control just how much heat your hair may need at the time. You can set it hotter for the initial styling and lighter for touch ups later. What a great product at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> The HSI straightening iron does work very well.  Though I will say, it does not work as well as my Chi, but what can I say - it was a fraction of the cost.  For the price, it is perfect.  If it lasts as long as my Chi did, I will definitely be buying another when needed.  Definitely recommend if you are not wanting to pay a ton of money for an iron!</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener! I love it and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth! I purchased a very expensive one a while back and this one is much better than the expensive one!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased--and for the price, you simply can&#x27;t beat it. Better than the Chi.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she is very satisfied with it! It come with a glove and a bag which she said was cool but she really liked the Argan oil that comes with it! She has very long hair and she said the oil made her hair silky but not greasy like another product that she had been using- She also said she likes the smell of the oil- It was a great combination- Great gift idea- I can&#x27;t wait to get home from this deployment so I can feel and smell for myself- Very satisfied overall!</li>
    <li> In a nutshell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not get hot enough (even on highest setting)So it takes too many passes to get frizzy hair straight. I have wavy, semi-course hair.&lt;br /&gt;Too hard to squeeze (cramps hand)(not noticeable at first but because it takes so long to use, your hand will definitely get sore)&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a GFCI plug which won&#x27;t fit in same outlet at the same time as the hair dryer (annoying if you only have one outlet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pull hair out like other straighteners I have used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, disappointed and I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product. I had ordered a straightener from Groupon that was suppose to be a good deal, but it ended up not being the quality product I had anticipated.I was not disappointed with straightener at all. I used it on my little girls extremely curly hair and didn&#x27;t have to use any product to make her hair keep the straight longer.</li>
    <li> iam soo happy with this flat iron  for only 38.00 it was a good deal&lt;br /&gt;iam goin to buy another one</li>
    <li> There are some small plastic pieces on the end that catch and pull out hair.</li>
    <li> Very average hair straightener. If you are used to the 20-30 dollar ones then this is a step up. If you are used to the 50-120 dollar ones then this is a step down. I unfortunately took a chance based on the reviews and am not impressed. I will keep it as a spare but will stick with my 80 dollar one. This one takes many tries to get my hair straight (I have thin to medium hair). It also pulls on my hair more than I expected. I like the design though at least it looks good in my hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because of its economical price and based on good reviews.  It was a little slow in coming but had many extra goodies when it did arrive.  [heat protection glove, argan oil, storage pouch]  I was using a Chi styler but needed a new appliance but could swing Chi&#x27;s price at the time.  The HSI professional heats up well, but the green light changes to red several times during a 8 minute styling session.&lt;br /&gt;When I buy another flat iron, it will be a Chi.</li>
    <li> LOVE this flat iron! I love the fact that you can control the temperature so your not frying your hair. Plus the flat iron came with safety gloves and a sample bottle of argan oil. Overall it&#x27;s worth the money and the shipping was FAST.</li>
    <li> My sister was actually the one to purchase this item and she liked it!&lt;br /&gt;She thought it was cheap compared to other items.</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift to my mother and she let me know that she absolutely loves it! It arrived fast and with no problems. It works great! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> got it for my girlfriend, she loves it...works great! the oil that came with it also worked perfectly. she hasn&#x27;t given me any bad reviews, hope it stays that way</li>
    <li> I can only post my wife&#x27;s reaction to this product since I don&#x27;t use.  But, she loves it!  She was impressed with what all came with the flat iron.  She also said she believes this is the same one her stylist uses.  She told me to keep an eye out for another sale on this so she can buy her mom and sister one.</li>
    <li> My nine year twin daughters hate it. Said it pulls their hair, makes it frizzy, stacticy, and smell like coffee beans lol. I tried it and don&#x27;t care for it either. Gonna just spend the extra money and get them a legitimate straighter like the Paul Mitchell one. Now that&#x27;s an awesome straighter,  not this POS.</li>
    <li> It certainly did not live up to the online reviews.  It had no temperature control, and did not do an adequate job.  I would rate it less than the drug store brands.</li>
    <li> feels cheap.. inconsistant heat distribution.. I returned it. Quick and easy return</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a gift just for christmas and i found this item at such a lower price at the beginning i thought it might not be a good one because of their price but it ended being a really good one. My mom it&#x27;s in love with this iron, she defenately its happy with the result of using it. I will spread the word so other people can order this item. Btw it was a really fast shipping. Great !!!</li>
    <li> Based on the positive reviews of the HSI flat iron, I decided to purchase and try it out. Unfortunately, it did not work for my hair. I have don&#x27;t have thick or very thin hair but the temperature setting was just not enough. I ran the straightener thru my  hair 3 times very slowly and did not get the straight affect as I should&#x27;ve. Also, the box said I would have a free bottle of argan oil but it did not contain anything but a heat protectant glove. Oh well, back to my quest for the perfect straightener.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron hair straightener.</li>
    <li> i have curly hair and this straightener is good with straightening for the most part but with the high heat settings i feel like it is way too hyped up because it isn&#x27;t that much like a professional styling tool but it still gets the job done</li>
    <li> I just received this a few days ago so I have only used it a couple times but it does heat up very quickly and seems very smooth gliding over my hair. I am still adjusting to the 1\\&quot; size because my old one was 1 1/2\\&quot; but I think I will take a liking to it well. I do like that the cord on it swivels as my last one was having issues because of the way I wrapped the cord but this one that can&#x27;t happen to because it does swivel. All in all it was definitely worth $50 and the seller shipped very quickly. I gave it 4 stars due to not having used it but a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I just got this straighter in the mail today. It was supposed to be my x-mas gift, but it doesn&#x27;t even heat up. The product says the heating goes all the way up to 410 F, but mine was barely warm. My $30.00 straighter from target works better. I&#x27;ll be returning this product as soon as I get a chance. It&#x27;s already packed into the box at the house, just waiting to be mailed out.</li>
    <li> Excellent device great results on the hair Plain and simple in use Best results when the hair is dry is moistened with water</li>
    <li> It was really a toss up between 2 or 3 stars. I think for a professional flat iron, it should be better. The plates are uneven, they don&#x27;t touch together when not applying pressure, and it seems to be getting worse, it also tugs my hair, I was just expecting so much more based on the reviews, Really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;****edited&lt;br /&gt;I took away stars. After using the thing, 3 times max, it won&#x27;t even stay hot. So disappointing and it will be returned!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this purchase. Switched from a chi since mine died on me and am very happy with the quality of the product. Gets hot pretty quickly and I think it does a great job straightening my hair. The price is also awesome! Would definitely recommend. I have thin/medium hair that usually gets frizzy/wavy on its own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the inStyler, you know the flat iron with a roller. Very nice, but I&#x27;ve gone through 2 and decided to go for a ceramic flat iron for my long long hair. This is terrific. It&#x27;s my first ionic straightener and it leaves my hair smooth and pretty. Be sure to use the argon oil if you&#x27;re hair tends to be dry or you&#x27;re using color. I ordered the argon oil from Camden-Grey.com and got a lot for a little - pure and it&#x27;s really good for skin, so I use it in place of moisturizer, too.</li>
    <li> Wife tried it with great results. She was apprehensive earlier with doing it herself (usually gets in done in salon). But this gives salon results and in 2 uses pays for itself.&lt;br /&gt;Temperature control is great. The glove and the carry bag are wonderful extras.</li>
    <li> Love it! great product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron, especially in comparison to my previous one.  It is pretty heavy and works very well on my fairly thin, fine hair.  It does a great job smoothing my naturally wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener based on Amazon popularity, excellent reviews and low price. It is an ok product, probably worth the price but not at all what I was looking for. My great salon grade straightener died after 4 years of usage and the HSI is nowhere near as good. It does not get hot enough (even in the highest setting), it keeps getting cool after every strand of hair I iron which is super annoying and it takes at least 3 times to straighten one strand of hair (and my hair is NOT curly) and it&#x27;s still not perfectly smooth and silky like with my old one. My old one was way more expensive (closer to $80) but since I haven&#x27;t bought one for 4 years I thought the new ones are same quality but less expensive now.</li>
    <li> Works perfect...couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat Iron for my 17 year old daughter as a Christmas present.  She has had irons in the past and been ok with them.  She was very excited about this iron, as it leaves her hair smooth and shiny! She has very thin and fine hair which damages easily and most irons tend to dry it out and make it look frizzy.  This one made her hair look sleek and shiny.  It is an amazing deal and very well constructed.  Much better quality then the store models that cost more.</li>
    <li> (I have type 4 hair w/ some extensions and a keratin treatment:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this flat iron due to the fact that it was&lt;br /&gt;considerably &#x27;marked down&#x27; and I was in desperate need for one.&lt;br /&gt;However, it struck me as odd how this item is only sold on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and is able to maintain an almost 5 star rating with over 2,000 reviews, and it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;dirt cheap&#x27; considering it was $300 but is now $40 weird...but, I took the chance and I&#x27;m here to say I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I had bought the InStyler a few years back for around $100, but I&#x27;m surprised to say&lt;br /&gt;that this HSI is MUCH better! I did notice my hair was very soft and had some shine&lt;br /&gt;after straightening it, but I think that has to do with the fact&lt;br /&gt;that I got a keratin treatment more than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Buy it, it&#x27;s a good straightener that can also flip and curl. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas after her Chi nano (2 years old) quit working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was more than pleased just to have a new iron, but the presentation of the packing of the iron made it all worth while in forgetting the name chi rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a great buy and great quality!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome! It heats up quickly and straightens my very thick curly hair in just one pass. The swivel cord is terrific, no getting tangled up! Highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> This ceramic straightener leaves hair smooth and straight. It warms up quickly too. We are very happy and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality flat iron.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best! It tames even my wild, thick, frizzy hair into straight , smooth and sleek hair. By far, the best hair styling product purchase I ever made!</li>
    <li> I checked the reviews, I checked prices and ended up with the HSI  The styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. My daughter has a CHI and we paid twice what I did for the HSI. It works great, I like the temperature control and the product is just easier to use. I would recommend the HSI Flat Iron. A great product and a great value.</li>
    <li> I just got my flat iron &amp; it doesn&#x27;t even turn on :( I was sooooo excited to use this but now I cant. I also can&#x27;t find a costumer service number.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this straightener makes my locks satiny smooth and shiny.  Will never use another brand!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little about myself: I&#x27;m hair challenged. I never learned how to use a curling iron (I can&#x27;t, for the life of me, understand how people can use those without burning their hands and ears), and I don&#x27;t even really know how to blow dry and style my bangs. I&#x27;m also Asian, with very straight hair that can&#x27;t usually hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this straightener changed everything. In 15 minutes I can create beachy waves. In about 25 minutes I can create tighter curls. And when I just need to smooth out some flyaways or odd creases in my hair, I&#x27;m ready to go in under 5 minutes. This straightener heats up in 3-5 minutes, is easy to use (the clamping mechanism isn&#x27;t so tight that it makes your hand tired from squeezing) and the clamp exterior doesn&#x27;t get unbearably hot -- meaning, if you accidentally touch it, you won&#x27;t burn yourself easily. When I&#x27;m done styling, I don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray or other product to keep it in place! By the following day, I still have loose waves. The next-day hair isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s good for an easy-going, relaxed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular order also comes with a carrying pouch, glove (I don&#x27;t use it but it&#x27;s a nice option) and sample-sized bottle of argon oil. It&#x27;s a generous little package that is well-worth the $50-or-so that I paid for it. And I&#x27;ve tried $100 hair straighteners that yield the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too long; didn&#x27;t read: Heats up quickly, easy to use, clamp exterior doesn&#x27;t get TOO hot, very reasonably priced, and your hairdo actually stays the whole day (and then some) without needing hairspray.</li>
    <li> Thanks. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I was Leary buying this for my daughter over Chi, but it was a great price with great reviews. I have since used it myself and think it&#x27;s a great product. I would and may buy another for myself!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! I read a lot of comments before I decided to buy this product. And it didn&#x27;t disappoint me at all. It&#x27;s a great hair straightener. I plan to buy one more for my younger sister. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this! It leaves my color treated hair soft and silky. Salon results. No frizz&#x27;</li>
    <li> This is just an average straightener. I was hoping it would do a better job, but i have to say that it is only so-so. It doesn&#x27;t get super hot.</li>
    <li> This was my first &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; flat iron purchase and I wasn&#x27;t pleased. No matter how careful I was it pulled out pieces of my hair with every stroke. I didn&#x27;t like the 3 pronged electrical cord as it meant I couldn&#x27;t be preheating the iron while blow drying my hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> Love it work wonderful with my long frizzy thick curls :) get a keratin treatment next week this is exactly what I needed with a great price</li>
    <li> Bought for my gf, she couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Was highly disappointed with this flat iron. I purchased this because of the great reviews it got and was trying to save some money but not purchasing one of the more expensive products on the market. Big mistake!  All this flat iron did the entire time I used it was pull at my hair. It was painful. So grateful that Amazon makes returns soooo easy.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I recieved this product. It came very quick, which was exactly what I needed. I didn&#x27;t realize it would come with all the extras. Needless to say, 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so hard to find a decent straightener anywhere! And the price was great too!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works well and inexpensive. Like it better than my chi. Curls well too.</li>
    <li> I have had this for several years (3-4) and it is still going strong. Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, does it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
    <li> the plates pulled my hair horribly when I first used it, but It did a great job! after a few uses it seemed to no longer pull at my hair. overall, happy with this product, and the price.</li>
    <li> This has been the best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased in years. I have thick hair and it gives my hair the sleek shiny look I want. It can also curl my hair better than my curling iron.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is solid and heats up very hot.  It says ceramic tourmaline but does not feel like it keeps the moisture in my hair the way other ceramic tourmaline straighteners have.  It works well, but I think it&#x27;s damaging my hair a bit more than one that keeps the moisture in a bit better.  Next time I think I will look for a higher quality flat iron.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife and daughter. The both have used several times in the past 3 weeks. My wife had an older model and this one is far superior. Heats up fast and does a great job straightening tight curls.My daughter can use this herself and she is 12, her hair is not really curly but has waves. Does a wonderful job and has not burnt anyone yet. Neither of them has tried the free sample oil but they are extremely happy with product as is.</li>
    <li> The product meets expectation!ðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> Works very well, however the bottle of Argan oil that came with it wasn&#x27;t tightened. When we opened the packaging the oil was leaked all over the pouch that the straightener comes in.</li>
    <li> Bought mine through Amazon and instead of 2-4 wks it got here surprisingly fast within a week.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it yesterday and love how quickly it heats up and yes it definitely does work very well&lt;br /&gt;great flat iron for the price :)</li>
    <li> I ultimately purchased this flat iron because other reviewers were ranting and raving about its comparison to CHI flat irons. Sadly, that is not the case in my opinion. I have used so many flat irons ranging in price, and while this one does beat out any others within ITS price range, it surely doesn&#x27;t compare to a CHI. With that said, it is a nice piece of equipment; it straightens my hair just as promised but I find one thing terribly annoying. Once the iron fully heats up and the light changes from red to green, I will begin to straighten my hair. Throughout the process it will flicker back and forth from green to flashing red (signaling its heating up... again?). So basically what I have come to realize is, for it to work at its peak potential (maintaining my desired temp) it requires breaks in between to re&#x27;heat up. This is annoying but not a deal breaker for me because I am a stay at home mom and nap time is my allotted free time to work on my hair as long as I please... although if I did have a job to get to I would find this feature ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because for its price range it does a wonderful job. But don&#x27;t purchase with CHI expectations or else you will be sadly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this straightener but it didn&#x27;t work out for me. I got it today in the mail and gave it a try. The box and packing is all authentic I believe. I had an anti-frizz cream in my hair and when I used this iron it totally scraped the product out of my hair and caked on to the iron. The main problem was that it kept snagging on my hair and the plates did not feel as if they were gliding on my hair. Also, the plates do not touch so I don&#x27;t know if this is the problem or if the hair iron is just like that. But my hair snagged a lot and the product I had in my hair came off on the iron. When trying to clean the iron, it took me a while to scrap off the burnt product. I also tried putting waves in my hair but that didn&#x27;t really work either. I was trying not to take the temperature too high as I have thin hair. The hair iron awkwardly just flipped my hair out. It wouldn&#x27;t even give me a nice inward curve, it would do this weird looking flip. I am not an amateur at using a hair iron, I was looking for a new iron to replace the Chi one I have. Unfortunately, this hair iron just did not work for me. :(</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived an time.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I love it! Good pricing and fast shipping</li>
    <li> After reading all the raving reviews I decided to give it a shot after my cheapo Revlon brand stopped working after a couple of years.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so disappointed in such a hyped up product!  I have fine, easy to straighten hair and this iron leaves it frizzy and not straight.  Even on the highest heat it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten, I can actually touch my fingers to the plates!  Also, the light flickers constantly between red - green--red--green.  Anyway, I&#x27;m done with it and will be returning it.  Bummer!</li>
    <li> This HSI flat iron did NOT iron ANYTHING flat!  It heated up, but even after multiple reps, did not even begin to straighten my fine hair.  Then, my daughter, who has curly hair, verified my thoughts when she tried it for 3 minutes and basically said, \\&quot;This is Pointless!\\&quot; I&#x27;m off to Ulta for a replacement.  So sad, cause based on the reviews, I had high hopes for an amazing product.  :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but i am very disappointed in the quality of this straightener...doesn&#x27;t straighten my wavy thin hair on first or second go. Okay fine. But then I really got upset when the plate completely broke off after a drop from only about 3 ft above the ground. It was the first time I had dropped it and it&#x27;s completely unusable now. I had other much cheaper hair straighteners that I dropped from the counter many times and they still work years later....</li>
    <li> It works well, but it had a weird smell when I used the first times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is good, the product arrived fast,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product is ok, no as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised eith this prouduct didnt think itd be good straightens fast and my hair is shiny and smooth n lasts for 3 days love it :)</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener as I don&#x27;t need strength to straighten my hair like with the one I had before. It&#x27;s good it came with accessories such as a glove and a cover. I received it earlier than the estimated delivery time, which is nice.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE ! Great early delivery too . Hopefully it will last me for 6 years like my other flat iron</li>
    <li> It&#x27;&#x27;s really good for the price.  Only four stars because I wish that it left my hair just a little more silky feeling.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I bought it because of all the great reviews and it has lived up to the reviews. It heats up quickly, works great, and gets the job done. The great price is a bonus!</li>
    <li> great service and seems to be working well.  I&#x27;m still learning how to use it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the one I received don&#x27;t close properly to actually hold the hair to be straight the handles are loose, and it seems like it was use (WEIRD )very disappointed ,but I know is a GREAT Iron ,I just wasn&#x27;t very lucky with the order. AMAZON REFUND THE MONEY. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
    <li> My HS1 straightener arrived on time. I have been using it for about a week now, I straighten my hair daily and I love this product. It is leaving my hair smooth and straight. It&#x27;s not trying my hair. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron based on review. It&#x27;s by far amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice Quality and hasn&#x27;t fried my hair. Really only need a few strokes to get it straight.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick. High quality product. Argan oil smells really nice.</li>
    <li> Good product - as advertised (note: this is a standard size iron, not a travel size, but it works on 110 AND 220 V).&lt;br /&gt;Heats very quickly - i use it to flatten my wavy hair and it works very well. It came with a nice storage pouch, which is very convenient.</li>
    <li> No issues, gets the job done. Product heats very quickly, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> Good iron for a good price! Works perfectly on African American hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron s very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Provides a nice shiny result and since I have finer hair I only have to use the temp on about 350.  Heat &amp; cools quickly. Exceptional product and service.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.  She is very pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> Good flat iron for the price!!</li>
    <li> I do love this hot iron, however it does have a tendency to drag or pull my hair.  The Argan oil is the key to styling my baby fine hair though. I did drop my hot iron on my vinyl floor and it chipped the plate. I can work around I believe for the most part,  I am not for sure because I just broke it! My hair does remain frizzy until I pass over the same area 2 to 3 times. Compared to other hot irons I have puchased in the past, this one is decent!</li>
    <li> It seems to work as expected. And it came early! Overall happy experience.</li>
    <li> Great iron.  Very easy to use.  Leaves hair shiny.  This includes a glove to handle the heat but that depends on your settings.  Also comes with a small bottle of Argan oil and satin storage case.  Great company to do business with!</li>
    <li> Order this for my daughter who had given her other straightener to her sister.  She LOVES it.  She said its like we paid a million bucks for it.  Its a gem and worth every penny and beyond.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> It does what it days, really good, especially if used with the serum. Really pleased with results, although is not to use every day/week because then it will damage the hair for sure.</li>
    <li> Delivery was very quick - product exactly as advertised and I love using it. Am very pleased with entire experience!</li>
    <li> Gets super hot, super fast. It works very well. I have naturally curly hair and this product keeps my hair straightened for days.  Nothing usually works for me, I had a Chi in mind but I didn&#x27;t want to spend 100 plus dollars. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste the money on a Chi,  this  works just as well.</li>
    <li> Great straightening iron. Slides through my hair so easily.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for another one that broke (different brand).  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this one!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I have used a CHI for years, and when it finally quit on me I ordered this straightener based on good reviews I read and I definitely was not disappointed. So far it works just as well as my CHI, and for only $40 it was definitely a great value.</li>
    <li> Really good flat iron that lasted me along time before the plates started to wear out.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a flat iron and I wanted to find the one I used when I was visiting a friend as I had left my curing iron at home.This is my birthday month so I treated myself to this curling iron after using hers.  I was very impressed with the softness and the way  my hair felt and looked after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I now use it at home instead of my curling iron. It gets rid of the frizzes and looks natural when styling my hair. I live in Florida so this is a biggy for me! It comes with its own traveling case and I thought I d mention that it heats up instantly, which is a plus also. It has a full range of heat and I lowered my setting to mid for use on my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Love it! LEaves my hair smooth and straight, not frizzy.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie</li>
    <li> its a good product, hope the damage from the heat is minimal due to the ceramic on this.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job quite well for straightening, still figuring out the curling part</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and HSI PROFESSIONAL  was very nice, they contacted me shortly after purchase to make sure it was everything I wanted. Has multiple heat settings and heats up quick.</li>
    <li> Note that these are not digital. They were hard to use and kept catching my hair. Ended up getting a pair of remington brand from target and liked them much better. But I did like the heat glove and the free oil sample that came with itm</li>
    <li> Great tool and includes a glove that I use on my left hand to prevent burns.</li>
    <li> Works well, professional grade!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very good affordable professional flat iron!</li>
    <li> works great heats up quick and I love the long cord! just wish it&#x27;d heat up a little bit hotter</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron. It&#x27;s simple, no frills. I don&#x27;t like that there&#x27;s no auto shut off. That scares me a bit. But the iron itself is good, does a nice job and the Argan oil is really nice. That&#x27;s why I felt compelled to leave this review, in order to get the additional free bottle of the oil. The oil smells great and really takes the frizz out. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This model may not be the one that has been receiving all the great reviews. I bought this flat iron based on the reviews. The way it is designed is a problem it has on both sides at the tip plastic holders for the plate that snags, pulls and breaks your hair. I thought that was why the price is so low. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am complete ecstatic about this straightener! I usually just buy a cheap one at Target or Walmart when my straightener enevitably dies but I thought maybe I should try something a little more expensive hoping the price difference would make a difference in performance and boy am I glad I did. I have extremely curly hair that never seems to straighten or even stay straight once I&#x27;m done but with this professional straightener it takes me half the time to do my hair. It&#x27;s also managed to keep my hair straight long after I&#x27;m done, even with the crazy humidity! My hair feels better than ever and extremely smooth without all the extra heat damage from other brand straighteners where I have to repeatedly go over sections. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this one instead of another cheap one from walmart. If you&#x27;re debating on getting this, just go on and do it. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Great iron! Very portable and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> For being an older person and using a flat iron for the first time, it&#x27;s so easy, plus it handles very well.  Glad I purchased it.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this iron I got a glove with it but have never used it it has never burned me. It has it&#x27;s own bag also. Going on vacation this month and am very excited I only have to take one thing because it curls or straightens :)</li>
    <li> Good quality and value</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a week, but so far it is nice. It feels good in the hand. It has a temperature setting which is a must for me. I like that the light turns red when it&#x27;s on and green when it&#x27;s ready. It doesn&#x27;t appear to  be damaging on the low setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it has snagged my hair a couple times. But I think I&#x27;ll get better at using it so that this won&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Argan oil it comes with. It smells very nice; usually I can&#x27;t stand scented hair products but this one is low-key and natural.</li>
    <li> Not really sure about its worldwide dual voltage abilities. I am in Europe and I have noticed that once I plug it in, it starts heating up. Turning it on or off at this point doesn&#x27;t really make any difference because it just stays really hot. So it&#x27;s a no for me.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant purchasing yet another flat iron but was immediately amazed at the results..!!! I have dry coarse hair and it actually made it feel softer..Truly a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Love love love this flat iron! I have extremely thick hair and I am actually able to straighten my hair with a lower heat setting and in less time with the HSI Professional Flat Iron Hair Straightener. I do not usually write reviews, but this product truly deserves it. I will definitely recommend to all of my friends. Thanks Amazon for bringing this amazing product at such an affordable cost.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and great value!</li>
    <li> Works great...never seems too hot.</li>
    <li> No auto shut off so make sure you can live with that.  I also don&#x27;t feel it is as good as the $40 one I purchased from the box store.  Just average and would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I had an old cheap hair straightener that was purple and made by Revlon before I decided to buy this one. My old straightener was wider and got the job done and lasted years, but the main reason I had to replace it was because the wires were starting to be exposed, and slowly falling apart. I did some research and everybody seemed to love this straightener and it wasn&#x27;t expensive. It works, and I like that it has the auto turn off, but wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for. Maybe because it isn&#x27;t wider, or the temperature doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like it to.      UPDATE:  Have had this product for over 6mths now, and wish I got a different straightener. Tried one at the mall for $50 and it made my hair look amazing! This thing is not worth the money. A $20 straightener would do the same or better.</li>
    <li> So far I have really loved this straightener. Leaves hair smooth and straight. Doesn&#x27;t fry your ends and the argon oil they give you with it is great!</li>
    <li> Does what it says. The Argon Oil sample is actually really small -- not what you&#x27;d expect from the product description.</li>
    <li> excellent flat iron, works fabulous,I am very pleased with my purchase thank you very much I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great iron. It works well and I would suggest to anyone.</li>
    <li> For years I had a Hot Tools straightener that had cost me about $70-$75 dollars that I picked up at our local Ulta beauty supply. It got very hot, was approved for use for keratin treatments (which I did not have, but I thought hm, I guess that means it&#x27;s a good one), and it was...like the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. When that one died, I thought I would look for a deal on Amazon on the same straightener, and when I typed in Hot Tools, this HSI model popped up. Everyone rated it very well, so for the price I thought it was definitely worth a try. I do like it-it gets very hot, but I will say this: my hot tools got hotter faster, and my old one listed the temperatures on the heat dial, whereas this model just has a crank with a picture illustration that indicates hotter and cooler. This straightener also seems to have less of a surface area for straightening than my old one (even though it&#x27;s the same width in inches, the straightening area isn&#x27;t very long). All said and done, I loved my old one and I &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; this one. It does the job-gets very hot and I don&#x27;t find it necessary to get a different one even though I liked my last one better. For the money I would say it performs really well, and I do like it better than the Chi brand. This brand does not catch your hair like the Chi&#x27;s do when you glide the straightener through your hair.</li>
    <li> The product works great. Very easy to maneuver and leaves hair looking shiny.</li>
    <li> Great product I have wavey hair that can get very frizzy but this flat iron  straightens my hair extremely well and leaves it smooth all day. Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long to do my hair(medium length)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works very well</li>
    <li> Snags my hair causing breakage and frayed ends.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this flat iron!!  Also, the free trial argan oil is great too!  I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I got these 2 items!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, well packed, and works like a charm! Can&#x27;t imagine that a more expensive product could work better than this!</li>
    <li> This is the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon. This straightener has worked moderately with some days getting really hot and others just luke warm. Today I turned it on and it is completely cold after 20 minutes of being on. What a waste of money! I have used MANY straighteners over the years and they have all lasted at least 2-3 years. This one did not even last a full year. How disappointing!!!</li>
    <li> Worked out preety good.</li>
    <li> Works very well for me... love it!</li>
    <li> I really thought with all of the positive reviews I would love this but I have really thick hair and it just does not do the job! I guess I will go back to my $20 Wal Mart striaghtner</li>
    <li> I heard it was pretty good. Bought it as a gift for someone.</li>
    <li> Flat iron works great.</li>
    <li> I have had so many compliments on my hair since purchasing this product.  It works better than my old flat iron which cost 3 times as much!  I can style my hair more quickly too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a week now and have had no issues.  The ability to control the temperature is great.  I have been able to use it to curl my hair and it works better than any straight iron I&#x27;ve ever had.  I love it so much that I have ordered another one for my sister.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works wonderfully. I like the temp control feature. The iron is light weight but durable, heats up quickly and maintains temp.</li>
    <li> Excellent, works better than my Solia, and a great value. Hair type 4a,  texlaxed I am very glad I purchased this flat iron.</li>
    <li> The HSI 1 inch straightener is overall awesome and for the price too! I was surprised that it even came with the hand glove, a storage pouch and a small bottle of argan oil. The straightener does great for my hair. I have thick and long hair and when I used the straightener, it completely softened my hair and was straight as ever. Better than other straighteners I&#x27;ve used. Doesn&#x27;t seem to kill my hair either. I just hope it lasts forever. So don&#x27;t waste your money on those expensive straighteners, just get the HSI!</li>
    <li> love love love this straightener. perfect for curling or straightening. gets VERY hot. im a hair stylist and its amazing. reccomend.</li>
    <li> It comes with a little free sample of oil. I have very wavy hair and it glides right through my hair. I would definitely recommend this product to friends, it works the same as a CHI if you&#x27;re deciding between the two.</li>
    <li> It reminded me of a made in china toy I used to play with when I was little and play dress up on my sleep overs. Made me be late for work two days in a row and my hair had frizz like it never before!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved it she wanted a different brand however after opening and using this one she said it was perfect</li>
    <li> This flat iron makes my hair look so soft and shiny! I had spiral curls in my hair the other day and decided I didn&#x27;t like the way it looks so I got my new straightener out, it was like my hair was never curled!! I have already recommended this to all the women in my family and all my girlfriends! Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and does a good job straightening my hair. The argan oil works well to protect hair without making my hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister. She told me It&#x27;s not as great as GHD(around $300) that I currently use but pretty good compared to the price!</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair. THis does work but you have to go over it a few times. I wish I just had to use it one on my hair and I&#x27;m done but not with this one. But it does its job. I think if my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick it would be fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace a CHI that lasted 7 years. It heats up fast. My main complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t glide over my hair as smoothly as the CHI. I also have to take much smaller sections through it, so it takes a lot longer to straighten my hair. After a week, I ended up purchasing a CHI and will be keeping this as a backup. Bummer!</li>
    <li> Great flat iorn. Same one my styalist uses! Love better than my CHI!</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. It does a really great job at getting my hair really straight.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi before and this was my go-to because of the good reviews once that broke. It works well!</li>
    <li> It is so good. I totally recommend it. It is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had a Sedu Revolution 1&amp;#34; flat iron for years which unfortunately broke in my suitcase during a trip. I was so sad since it was amazing and EXPENSIVE. I decided to try something a little more affordable and after reading a lot of reviews I went with the HSI. Unfortunately I have been spoiled with the Sedu and the HSI does not even compare. I&#x27;m actually surprised at the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - The temp on the HSI is adjustable but there&#x27;s no degree reading. The gauge is small and it&#x27;s difficult to see how high or low I&#x27;m turning it. So I have to run it through my hair to figure out how hot it is. My previous iron&#x27;s adjustable temp showed me the precise degree. I knew exactly what temp to use based on how I wanted my hair to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - My hair snagged at times as I ran it through. This was maddening. That should be a basic requirement of a flat iron no matter what you pay. It felt like I was damaging my hair. My hair is not particularly coarse so I was surprised. I tried to hold it different ways, go slower/faster, hold it looser then tighter. But I haven&#x27;t been able to find the sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 - The edges are not curved enough to give my hair a good curl. It worked ok to straighten and I was able to get a decent wave, but the curl was tough. And it took twice as long as it did with my previous iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were fine. Smooth enough when I straightened and gave a nice wave if I worked at it. But I&#x27;ll be returning this and will drop the cash on a better quality iron. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Loves the straight iron. It passes through the hair without snagging... Very smooth. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got this on sale through Amazon, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.  Does not work quite as well as I had hoped, even on the highest heat setting.  It does heat quickly, and cools pretty quickly, too.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best flatiron for the price. Although I&#x27;ve even used Chi irons that were 4X the money and I don&#x27;t see a comparable difference. I love this flatiron! It&#x27;s the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought only because the first was destroyed by my dog :-/ You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. Also, the Argan oil absolutely rocks too.</li>
    <li> This tool is a good price and was just what I was looking for. Only downside is that the plug is large, so I can&#x27;t plug in both my blow dryer and straightener at the same time. But it works well and heats fast.</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair is pretty damaged from the cheap straightener I was using but this one makes my hair so soft and smooth. The oil included really helps with all my split ends, really smoothed it all out.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. The cord turns so that it never bends and it makes it so much easier to do my hair when I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord. The iron gets hot very quickly, which is awesome because I&#x27;m always in a hurry too. I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it at all. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a month now, but I have no complaints so far! It came quickly, brand new, and it heats up super fast and my hair looks great! Will definitely buy from this seller again :)</li>
    <li> Only for people with straight hair. Not for people who actually need the product. I have wavy hair, not curly or straight and it did not straighten my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I am soo happy with the purchased product I bought! Amazing flat iron. Very fast and efficient for its price.</li>
    <li> used the product and it worked great. i loved the end results. I will def continue to use this product and try other products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair that I like to wear straight.  My coveted Chi broke after only 4 years, so I set out find a reasonbly priced, but decent flat iron.  I researched several different types, but this one kept coming up as one of the highest rated and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat. As soon as it came in, I plugged it in and was pleased to see that it straightened my curls without any problems.  My only complaint is that it does tend to pull a little bit, but I like the temperature controls and the fact that it straightens on the first pass.  And the Argan Oil treatment leaves my hair smooth &amp; shiny.  I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> After reading so many reviews of this product, I purchased it.  The day I got it, I accidentally touched the plate and let go of the iron, it fell to the floor and the plates broke.  I was so upset.  I didn&#x27;t return it because it was my fault it fell. Now I think I could have.  Too bad I threw it away. All  I can say,  it got really hot.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent flat iron for my curly, frizzy hair. And, I received it several days before I expected it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought one for my daughter as a gift and tried hers out and decided to purchase one for myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, it pulls my hair and causes breakage. Sedus are much better straightners.&lt;br /&gt;It does an alright job at straightening my hair, I have long thick hair, so it can a little challenging.</li>
    <li> I have owned this flat iron for only a month, but am extremely happy with it.  Having hair that is flyaway with little sheen, I was surprised that it was so easy to duplicate hair salon styles.  In the 25 years I&#x27;ve been going to a hair salon, not one stylist had used a flat iron on my hair, nor had suggested that I try one.  Boy have I been missing out all these years!</li>
    <li> Everything the product informaiton indicated it is and all of the positive reviews.  Theperformance + the price make this a definite keeper.  I also purchased a CHI (way more expensive) for my daughter; and frankly, for the price variation I do not see any significant differentiation betwen the two flat irons.  This is a great purchase for the price. It could be much more expensive for its perofmrance delivery.</li>
    <li> the only reason i bought this flat iron was because mine was starting to get this burning rubber smell to it and nothing could help, it was clean just smelled. so i looked up flat irons and this one was one that caught my eye, i received it in nice packaging except for the fact that it does not get as i thought it would. i was expecting much more with the heat, and also as soon as i turned it on it began to have the same smell as my other straightener.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for less than 5 months, and 2 weeks ago the thermostat stopped working. No matter how low I set the temperature, the indicator light never turns from red to green, and it continues to heat so hot that it has damaged my hair. It is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. It arrived quickly as promised. When I opened the box every item was present except the Argan oil sample which was stated as included in the box. I felt like someone might have used the item and returned the box without the oil. Any way I thought we will use the iron and see if it is okay. The iron woks well and so we thought of keeping it. We bought it to use in our upcoming vacation where the voltage is 220v. I will update if it works well in that situation later.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter who has owned \\&quot;many\\&quot;.  The HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron is by far the best one she has ever used.  I heard her raving so much that I had to use it myself.  I have never used a flat iron and was surprised that it didn&#x27;t just straighten my hair but I was able to add curl and wave to it as well.  Now, I am going to order one for myself. Great product and value!</li>
    <li> On time delivery. Product exactly as described. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have only had my flat irons about a month and they are not working when i got them i used them a couple times and they work great so now i have to send them back</li>
    <li> At first I want to mention that the customer service of this company is in the highest level. They respond me during few hours and I&#x27;m very satisfied with flat iron and with customer service. I have very very thick and frizzy hair the iron does its job perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for low price and professional iron.</li>
    <li> My teenager loves this.  Very easy for her to use.  Lightweight and the travel pouch is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I love that the controls are in between the handles so you don&#x27;t accidentally change the settings or turn it off while you are using it.  I was always shutting off my old one accidentally.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. This is a good flat iron for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I bought my daughter the GHD hair straightener and she loves it but since I don&#x27;t straighten my hair nearly as much I thought I would try a lower priced hair straightener. I read the reviews of this straightener and thought I would give it a whirl. My old straightener was burning and splitting my ends so it really couldn&#x27;t have done more damage then what I had. I received the straightener...went and got a hair cut ridding all the damaged ends...then starting using the straightener. I kept inspecting my ends for damage and found none. I have been using this straightener for a few months now and I love it! It leaves my hair smooth and healthy. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great price for a very long-lasting hair straightener. I got one more than five years ago and have bought a second a couple of years ago. This heats up extremely quickly, can make some pretty curls, and is very nicely packaged. The one thing that gets me is that there&#x27;s no switch to automatically turn this off after a certain time frame. I&#x27;ve left this on by accident for whole days, which is my own fault, but I know that the auto-off feature is standard to some of the pricier hair straighteners. I highly recommend this to all, thank you HSI!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my straightener ! Got to my house on the correct day and have had no problems at all. Makes my head air super silky too ! I would DEFINITELY invest in this hair straightener !</li>
    <li> I never realized how much a flat iron could help my unruly curling/frizzy hair.  Glad I finally broke down and bought one.  I also didn&#x27;t realize how hot my hair would get and very glad this came with a glove.</li>
    <li> EDITED: I was reviewing my amazon reviews, and I saw this so I thought I would post a quick update.  This thing is still going strong.  I can&#x27;t remember ever having a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; flat iron last more than 12 months, but this thing is a work horse.  Hardly any signs of wear.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!  I was skeptical about this product to say the least, but I figured for $40.00, I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  I&#x27;m happy I took the risk, because this flat iron is amazing, especially for the price!  I&#x27;ve used numerous top of the line flat irons in the past, and this one is comparable to them all--it may even be better.  My one complaint is that the whole thing is rather bulky, but for the price, I can get over it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old ceramic flat iron.  It does not straighten or curl good and my hair was still friZzy. The only good thing was the argan oil it came with</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased hair straightener (model HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment. WORLDWIDE DUAL VOLTAGE 110v-220v) and am very disappointed with it. Confident that I&#x27;m gonna get one of the best straighteners out there, I was very disappointed to see the results. The device barely hits up and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair straight at all. I have a very easy to handle hair and usually mid to low heat range are enough for me. But with your device, even when I set the max temp it&#x27;s not enough. I have to redo 100 times Each piece of hair to make it straight and it is still not straight.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with my new HSI.  I have been a CHI user for many years.  I like the temperature control of the HSI.</li>
    <li> Works great, does what it&#x27;s suppossed too! I have used a lot flatteners, this one is awesome!</li>
    <li> This flat iron came with a small bottle of heat protecting oil and a glove to protect my hand from the extreme heat of the flat iron, however this flat iron never seems to get hot enough to use the glove. I kept it because I don&#x27;t need THAT much heat in my hair to begin with, but I was somewhat disappointed with the purchase. If I ever want a super shiny straight look- I will be unable to achieve that look with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Flat iron does not have an automatic shut off. Had I known this I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. I haven&#x27;t had a iron in the last 25 years that didn&#x27;t come with one. This is a huge safety concern as 400 degrees left unattended could cause a fire.</li>
    <li> Great iron!! Very pleased.  Was missing the argon oil but they checked in with me and had if sent out immediately</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect! I would recomend this product. Heats up well. Has control button. Leaves hair soft amd silky. I will buy HSI products again! Make sure to use this wth the HSI oil</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly which was great since my old flat iron was no longer working.  I&#x27;ve been using my new flat iron for a couple of weeks now with good results.  This iron feels well made, is working fine and was much less expensive than my old Chi which I had to replace annually.  I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled that I can use this in the US and abroad.  To me that&#x27;s HUGE!!  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  The results of using this flat iron was well worth spending a little extra on a great product.  The argan oil is amazing as well - I already puchased 2 more bottles so I never run out!</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fair. Certainly doesn&#x27;t reduce damage at all like some of the more expensive irons do. Good price, fair product. As good as my 5 year old CHI.</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener because of the heat control and the look... I really like the heat protector cover it comes with too so when it is hot you can still put it away when you are finished with it. Only problem is when it came to me it had some marks on the ceramic plates which so far have not caused a problem but I hope aren&#x27;t damaging my hair... I would have ordered another one but I didn&#x27;t want to have to send it back and wait for it to get back to me. Really good brand. Love it!</li>
    <li> This straightener really is great!! It is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that was able to make my frizzy hair smooth and silky looking. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice straightener, and for $40, I can&#x27;t complain.  It straightens my curly hair without making it look stiff.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It is light weight and the heat is adjustable.  It heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron.  Sturdy and gets plenty hot.  It heats up quickly and glides on the hair very smoothly.  The price point is great for the quality flat iron you are receiving.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron last November when my CHI died. I didn&#x27;t want to fork out the big bucks for another flat iron, so after some extensive research, I decided on this HSI flat iron. At 40$ bucks, I figured why not? It works really well and the only minor complaint ( thus my reasoning for not giving it 5 stars), is that it kind of pulls my hair while I&#x27;m flat ironing. But I am very pleased for the most part. It comes with a travel bag and a sample of the Argan oil, which I highly recommend using before flat ironing. I would recommend this product because it works, it has ceramic plates and it is inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, frizzy, curly hair. This flat iron works great on my hair! I got it because it was a great price and had so many good reviews-highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointed.  Did not seem to get very hot. Not sure if the one I got was just a lemon.</li>
    <li> The flat iron was not what I expected, I had better results from a more inexpensive flat iron. My hair tends to hold water very well, and even while sitting under a hair dryer for a hour my hair still, in most cases, remains damp. Most ceramic ionic flat irons work on my hair, this one just did not.</li>
    <li> Works well, got it on a good deal.. I didnt realize it was ceramic when I bought it, pulls my hair at times, it&#x27;s annoying. But over all its alright For the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener. I&#x27;m a person that REQUIRES time with a flat iron before going out anywhere or I will just tell you to leave without me. The first two times I used the HSI the temperature was turned to around medium high and to be honest I wasn&#x27;t really impressed. I expected silky smooth results and got average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I noticed later was that it took less time and my hair didn&#x27;t do the steam effect (is that a good or bad thing?) and my hands weren&#x27;t cramping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The third time I decided to try with the oil and on high. This made me worry since I don&#x27;t like things weighing down my hair or oil irritating my face (serums itch!) In addition my hair was somewhat dry so I didn&#x27;t want to really damage it for real. It became the &amp;#34;Oh, okay. AWESOME.&amp;#34; moment because it took so little time, there were barely any fly always, my hair was light, and straight yet so soft and silky. I&#x27;ve since been using the high setting and it&#x27;s given great results, the oil does add the extra umpf though. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin if I have my hair down and most importantly it doesn&#x27;t turn tacky at the end of the day. It just makes you have baby-like hair, half my volume is gone (good thing for me since I have thick hair and twice as much as most people.)&lt;br /&gt; The glove is also nice, saves time and prevents static from when I used to shake out my hair to cool it down. So overall great package!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener at an amazing price. It heats up quickly, You can very the heat setting and it works great. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron based on all the great reviews but it is not a good flat iron and I am returning it.  I used to have a HAI flat iron which is a little more expensive and I loved it and had it for 3+ years.  This one feels like a cheap flat iron and it pulled my hair as I tried to use it instead of just sliding through.  I would not recommend this flat iron unless you only want to spend a little bit and don&#x27;t mind it ripping at your hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this straightener for my daughter so she could have her own. Heats up quickly &amp; works well. Great price! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing!!! I love the feel of my hair after using it. My hair is long and extremely curly, this did an amazing job!!</li>
    <li> Ok so what I love sooooo much about this is that it doesn&#x27;t burn your hands like the chi air does!!! SOOO AWESOME</li>
    <li> Easy to handle, light weight. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is where the setting on on/off button is. On the outside would be easier.</li>
    <li> Great product. Hears fast. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic!  My thick coarse silver hair went from witchy-frizzy to sexy straight after a few quick passes of this magic wand.  The Aran oil smells like a taxi cab, but disappates quickly, leaving your hair hydrated.</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron.  Couldn&#x27;t be any better.</li>
    <li> This straightener is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. I was disappointed to find that this straightener pulls out my hair and doesn&#x27;t do the best job straightening. My hair is frizzy/wavy, but my $20 straightener that I bought at the local Marshalls does a much better job.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have bought this exact flat iron! They work better than the CHI I had and last for YEARS even with daily use! Don&#x27;t hesitate about this one ... I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I let my hair air dry every day and run this through it right before I go out at night to crate a smooth beachy wave look.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly!  Good deal!</li>
    <li> I needed a flat iron because the texture of my hair has changed with age and I was tired of looking like I had just stuck my finger in a light socket. I researched flat irons online and almost went with a top name brand that has worked well for my daughter. But then I found the HSI iron for sale on Amazonon for almost half the price of what I was going to pay for the other brand. The reviews were good, so I decided to give the HSI Turmaline Flat Iron a try. It came packaged up very nicely and arrived quickly. I like the digital readout and can see when the iron has reached my desired temperature which only took about 30 seconds. My hair goes through the iron smoothly and is nice and straight after one pass. I have had the iron for over a week now and so far, it is has lived up to its expectations.</li>
    <li> Works great. Daughter and wife use it and love it.</li>
    <li> Good product but nothing better than the one I already had and pay $30 for it !!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is by far the best I have ever owned!  It straightens my hair easily with just one swipe through.  The only negative is that there is no auto shutoff, which can be an issue.  However, I don&#x27;t think you will find a better flat iron for the price!  I have been using mine for about 2 years now and it is still going strong, but will definitely buy another when mine eventually conks out!</li>
    <li> Just as I was contemplating that I was going to need a new flat iron soon, it fell apart on me. Like literally the iron broke off the wand and was hanging there pitifully. Not wanting to spend 90+ $$ on a CHI flat iron from Ulta I took to Amazon and Voilà I came across this flat iron from HSI. I have used it a couple times since it arrived and found that although it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my old cortex flat iron, it still managed to straighten my wavy hair into a sleek style. I also love that a case, heat glove and argon oil was all included! I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality flat iron!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener, definitely better than anything you could by at Walmart. Straightens my hair as fast as my chi did. It&#x27;s a lot more durable than a chi too. The only reason is got 4 stars is because my hair sometimes gets stuck in it and since it&#x27;s so durable your hand get tired of clamping it</li>
    <li> Not super high quality, but gets the job done. I have rather curly, dry hair so I need a pretty powerful straightener. I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection from this but it works and I have had no problems thus far. The sample product, glove and travel pouch were a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron for a trip to Europe (because of its dual voltage capability). Overall, I am impressed with the quality of construction, weight (it&#x27;s a bit heavier than other irons I&#x27;ve used, which lends to the feeling of better construction), and accessories provided (glove, carrying bag, and argan oil -- which I haven&#x27;t used yet, but it&#x27;s a nice touch). It heats up quickly and turns itself off. The only con here is that the flat iron is less smooth than others I have owned; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the plates of if perhaps I am using too high of a heat setting (my hair is quite thick), but this is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve owned that has made my hair frizzy. Outside of that, it is a great product at a great price, and it meets my needs.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very sturdy. Feels comfortable in my hand. My hair is curly and it comes out straight as a pin and shiny. Will be buying one for my niece in the near future. Oh and the price is awesome.  I have owned flatirons that were over $100 and there is no reason to spend that kind of money. Great product!</li>
    <li> I like this straightener much better than my $120 Chi Turbo.  Fewer split ends and shinier hair.  the first uses it definitely pulled my hair a little but that seemed to break in.  I briefly though I left mine in a hotel and was definitely planning to repurchase.  Have had about a year now and still works great.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love the size, the heat settings, and the bag. Haven&#x27;t used the glove, but nice to have if I need it. Love the price! Would recommend!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Have had it for two years now, still perfect!</li>
    <li> I am in love with my new flat iron! ! Works great, and the Argan oil is a miracle!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and the flat iron works great</li>
    <li> HSI&#x27;s ionic flat iron works great, just as described. I have extremely crinkle curly hair and being able to smooth it out was a treat. The device heats very quickly. Temperatures ranged as stated. Nice long cord, beautifully packaged, nice glove that came with it, but it never bothered my skin and I used it at top setting... size very workable...great product, very pleased.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a dual voltage flatiron so that I could take it when I travel abroad. This one fit the bill and because it is ceramic tourmaline I was pretty confident it would be good. It comes with a nice travel bag, a heat protective glove, and a sample of the company&#x27;s argan oil, which I was happy with. The iron itself is nice, easy to handle with a swiveling cord and easy to grip. As far as how it straightens my hair, it&#x27;s good except for the ends of my hair snag on the plates as I&#x27;m styling it. I&#x27;m not quite sure why this happens because the plates look and feel very smooth but it happens every time I use this iron, however, I have only used it twice.&lt;br /&gt;My old iron, which I love, is a sedu ceramic tourmaline. I still use it but it is not dual voltage and the company recommends to not use a voltage converter with it so I cannot take it abroad.</li>
    <li> Love it!! The best for thick hair.</li>
    <li> This works well - no snags when pulling through your hair and adequate heat to straighten hair with just one try,  There are drawbacks in the design - small opening to adjust heat and access on/off contol, no power indiction light and heat level has only 2 marked adjustments (140 or 410) - you have to guess for the heat settings in between.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my flat iron which recently broke.  Not wanting to spend close to $100.00 for a replacement, I looked through many offered on Amazon, and after reading so many positive reviews, I chose this one.  It&#x27;s only been a week, but I love this flat iron more than the one it was replacing.  It glides across my very fine hair leaving it light and smooth with zero frizzies.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as my roommate&#x27;s Chi.</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron! I have fine thin hair and it works wonderful with my hair. I can even use it to curl my hair!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good... although I don&#x27;t like that the power on/off switch and the heat set knob is between the blades.  Update : The power won&#x27;t turn on suddenly.... Bought it in Jan 2014 and it died suddenly few months back. So total life was around 18-20 months.</li>
    <li> hair is at an awkward growing point from a chop job, and this size is great! Not too small that takes hours to use.</li>
    <li> Very please with this product</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I have long, thick, curly hair but the HSI had no problem making it straight!  Another plus is it is reasonably priced. GREAT product.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best!!</li>
    <li> Perfection !  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent and quick transaction. I love the accessories that came with the iron, especially the hair serum.</li>
    <li> For me, this flat iron is just okay. I don&#x27;t like it as well as the one I used to have (an old, cheap one). It doesn&#x27;t seem to give me the soft roll for my bob as my old iron. I even had more fullness in my hair with my old iron. In the past, I was able to let my hair dry naturally (overnight) then just style the next morning with the flat iron. Took 5-10 minutes tops. I find that because I&#x27;m not as pleased with the look, I actually wet my hair down and blow dry it to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the oil, so I cannot comment on that.</li>
    <li> SLEEK AND AMAZING PRODUCT FOR NATURAL HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this straightener as it promised to be high quality, but I was disappointed. The irons don&#x27;t get very hot, even at the highest setting, and it catches the hair instead of gliding smoothly over it. My hair is only wavy but sometimes it takes several passes to get it straight. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> works pretty good so far. But I have only used it 2 times. :)</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my friend, and he loved this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for her 14th birthday.  She loves it.  For those looking at this, it comes with a small package of leave in conditioner (which is great), but I recommend you find one that you want to purchase to have on hand.  These flat irons get extremely hot and can fry the hair if not conditioned properly.  We were warned about that ahead of time, so were prepared.</li>
    <li> Works well, good price.</li>
    <li> plates don&#x27;t close even when squeezed, only front bit touches. disappointing because the seller answered a buyer question and stated that it did in fact close all the at. problem with uneven plates is it means it&#x27;s heating the hair unevenly which causes more damage, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The flat iron works well but I did not get the Argon Oil I was promised in the order.</li>
    <li> I love the HSI flat iron hair straightener which worked beyond my expectations on my granddaughter&#x27;s very thick and coarse hair as well as my hair.  I was also extremely with how quickly I received my straightener and would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Straightener works well and arrived promptly.  However, the little bottle of free oil had leaked all over the pouch and made quite a mess!!</li>
    <li> Truly a life saver. My 4c texlaxed hair loves it. I use twice a week. Great product!</li>
    <li> super nice, very hot! Does not have a &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; mechanism to hold it together so if you have kids or are prone to mishaps be careful! It works really well and takes me a fraction if the time to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my hair than with other irons.</li>
    <li> Wow I love this thing I have never owned a flat iron before and the argan oil sample smells divine...High quality product brand new fast shipping</li>
    <li> I was beginning to wonder if my hair during pregnancy was just crappy or if it was my Babyliss straightener that wasn&#x27;t working. After using this HSI straightener for a few days I now know it was the other straightener that was making my hair not work the way I wanted.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than my 2 inch flat iron. Great product!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  Was looking for a new flat iron for everyday use and for traveling overseas.  Read the reviews and compared to other (higher priced) products.  Didn&#x27;t want to spend more than $50.  Received in a timely manner and took it on a recent trip to Europe.  Worked just great.  Used the included sample of argan oil and my hair was silky smooth.  Good size for traveling and included case was good to protect it in luggage.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> best curling Iron ever.I can do my hair in  minutes perfectly. I love the glove so fingers are protected while handling the hot hair.</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron...</li>
    <li> Love all the items I received!</li>
    <li> Arrived amazingly fast! Heats up so quickly and does a great job at straightening and taming frizz. Love it!</li>
    <li> I think this is the best flatiron I have ever had.  I bought this for overseas traveling.  I don&#x27;t know if it works overseas yet but I do know that since I have used it here in the US, it is an amazing hair tool.  I have a flatiron that my stylist recommended that I really like but this one is far better.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and it makes it flat, silky, and shiny.  I didn&#x27;t really expect this since I was only buying it for traveling.  I will be using this one for everyday now too.  Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> holy cow, i love it! great product, i have very thick hair, and very wavy (Hispanic wave) I only had to do a once through and voilà perfectly straight!</li>
    <li> Very good iron. No pulling out hair any more!</li>
    <li> I love these straighteners. I spent over twice as much on other straighteners but burned my hair badly. HSI leaves my hair straight, silky and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Not great, but gets the job done.  Takes a while to warm up.  Takes even longer to straighten each lock of hair.  The temperature dial is not very conveniently located inside the handle, and the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light is not visible right away, as it is located on the bottom of the iron.  I have to turn is over to see if it&#x27;s on (it is not always; sometimes I have to push the reset button to get the iron working).  OK for the price.</li>
    <li> So nice to take on international trips! No need to deal with converters!</li>
    <li> I love it!! My hair is long thick and wavy. It takes about five minutes to straighten it and it looks great. Have gotten many compliments and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair getting frizzy or looking all thick and frumpy. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! The best I&#x27;ve ever used. I especially like the results using &amp;#34;low heat&amp;#34;. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I needed a dual-voltage hair straightener for an international trip and this did the trick. You can set the temperature but it still fried my hair a little.</li>
    <li> Works very well and heats up quickly! Only thing I don&#x27;t like is when it&#x27;s all the way heated up the button turns from red to green and sometimes I think it&#x27;s off when really it&#x27;s very hot</li>
    <li> Would not buy again, I should have returned but I used it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair but gets hot enough to straighten it bone-straight. I also appreciate the glove and small oil sample that comes with the package.</li>
    <li> Great experience, product delivered on time and works great!!!</li>
    <li> Nope... The better brand that costs too much is worth it... Sorry</li>
    <li> Thank you!!!!! This flat iron is amazing and really works effectively and quickly. Also love the argan oil and makes my dry frizzy curly hair so soft and has absolutely no greasy feel. Highly recommend. So so happy with my purchase as so many seem to be as well. Always skeptical of reviews, but this product is the real deal as everyone claims and you will not be disappointed. Again thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product! Traveled to Europe with it, very portable.</li>
    <li> Great seller good quality product</li>
    <li> It was a good purchase until it broke 6 months after owning it what a disappointment</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to use! Perfect low setting for my thin hair!</li>
    <li> It heats up very quickly and straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to post this review on purpose. The first one of these that I got stopped working after a couple of uses and I threw it away and wrote it off as a loss. I&#x27;ve never had great experiences with flat irons anyway so I just shrugged and moved on. But, the company contacted me to ask about my experience so I told them that the iron stopped working. I was so surprised that not only did they respond back quickly but THEY SENT ME A NEW ONE. No extra charge, no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this iron for going on a year now and I could not be happier with it. My general experience has been that after a few months, most irons seem to lose their heat. They don&#x27;t get as hot anymore and they don&#x27;t work as well as they did when new. Not so with this iron. It heats up very quickly and gets quite hot. My hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl so I need the iron to get very hot and stay that way in order to get any shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only change I would make is to add an automatic shut-off. It doesn&#x27;t happen often but I have forgotten to shut it off a time or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been useing this iron to curl my hair almost every day for the last ten months and I know I&#x27;ll continue to use it fro years to come.</li>
    <li> Very smooth iron doesn&#x27;t get hair caught in between the irons and further damage hair. It also has an adjustable dial that isn&#x27;t available even on the more expensive Chi options. Well worth the money - you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> It works well and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Works very well for both straightening and curling. Takes a little longer than anticipated to heat up. Works well!</li>
    <li> Love theses flat irons! Leaves your hair super shiny</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like it. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t use it and can&#x27;t speak for the quality of it. To think of it, I need to check if my wife uses it. Good Lord, we paid for it and she better be using it :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good..the only issue z the temperature control z in between the plates..so u have to be little careful....</li>
    <li> I bought this for international travel.  What I love is that it automatically switches voltage.  I don&#x27;t have to manually do this.  It is also a very nice straight iron and has temperature selections.  I would even use it daily at home except I already have one.</li>
    <li> My cousin needed a new hair straightener and we were looking at Chi and whatnot, but we found that this had so many good reviews and decided to try it. Not disappointed so far it leaves your hair perfectly straight and smooth and she has a lot of hair! And it lasts for days... You should take a shower and all but I&#x27;m just letting you know!! Highly recommended. And the oil it came with left her hair sleek shiny smooth and not greasy. Buy it! Less expensive than others with big brand names, and with better reviews with reason. Fabulous.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! Stays hot and works well with my thick hair. The only issue I have is the on/off switch is small, and there is not a light that illuminates to remind you that it is on.</li>
    <li> I was just disappointed that this flat iron does not have an auto-shut off feature.  I thought they all did.  Otherwise it seemed to be a great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing straightener. I&#x27;ve had for only a week, but it has already proved as an amazing purchase. I have very curly hair and this works perfectly on it!</li>
    <li> Love love love this!!!!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife she says it&#x27;s literally pulls her hair. It&#x27;s not a smooth transition from top of hair to bottom</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, you plug it in and it heats up, no more is needed to be said.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice.  My only concern is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other irons I had in the past.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! Better than the Chi or Sedu. Awesome price. Highly recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener.  I have been using it for a few month now and I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s trip to Paris &amp; London. She used with EU and UK electrical adapters and had no issues. In fact, she said the flat iron worked better than her unit at home. It automatically switches between US and EU current, no need to switch manually. The heat was excellent &amp; more than enough to straighten her very thick, coarse hair ... quickly! Excellent purchase ... highly recommend</li>
    <li> Nice straightening iron, works well on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I am incredibly impressed at the HSI professional 1 ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener (try to say that five times fast). Having been cursed with thick, unruly, weirdly wavy, coarse hair, hair straighteners have been my best friend for at least 15 years. This one definitely holds up to all the previous ones I&#x27;ve owned, including stupidly expensive ones that ended up dying on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s significantly better than my last, which I used for a year or two until I saw this one. For the price, I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews &amp; ratings don&#x27;t lie. For the price, or even twice the price, this straightener is AMAZING. Seriously, just buy one! You will not regret it. My hair seems to respond very well to it. I usually do a thorough straightening job after I wash/dry my hair, then do random touch-ups for the next couple days. I&#x27;ve definitely had to do less touch-ups with this one; the results really last for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many straighteners in the past, as I straighten my hair daily.  For the price, this is a MUST have.  I&#x27;ve used a CHI for the past four years, until it recently broke.  Wanting a cheaper fix, I read some great reviews on this product and tried it out-- glad I did.  It doesn&#x27;t get QUITE as hot as the CHI (although very close), but still does a great job on my hair.  Highly recommend for serial straighteners.</li>
    <li> I have used CHI straighteners for years, and I decided to give this one a try, based on the great price and great reviews.  I was not disappointed!  I just sold my old CHI in my yard sale!  This product gets much hotter, and makes my hair straighter and smoother than CHI ever did.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! I have always used a Chi, so I was hesitant about trying this one. It is light weight and comes with a nice pouch to keep it in. My hair is very thick and a pain difficult to style, but this straightener did the job! It definitely works just as well as my Chi for a fraction of the price! I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a co-worker told me it is excellent! I loved its presentation and bring gloves make it more practical, so far has no problem so my recommendation goes for it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is everything I hoped it would be!  It has a temperature dial for more/less heat.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;crinkle&amp;#34; in my hair like my last flat iron.  I love the storage pouch it comes with but I&#x27;ve never used the glove.  This iron doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or frizzy.  I bought Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Perfector Straightening Spray to use with it and they go great together!  My hairstylist recommends washing hair at night, dry to 20% damp, straighten, sleep on it, touch up in the morning.  This advice was SO helpful for me with my long, thick, wavy hair.  Very happy I found this flat iron, and for a great deal too!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> My first flat iron so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot!  The price on this one was great and so far I like it!</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron. I didn&#x27;t get my argan oil, though. Otherwise I would have rated it a five. Wonderfully priced.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I have not personally used this iron on my own hair as I still have one of the old CHI Turbo irons that I&#x27;m still very pleased with.  I purchased the HSI iron for my daughter for Christmas instead of wasting money on the CHI&#x27;s of today which aren&#x27;t very good as evidenced by the several that my daughter has gone through over the past couple of years.  The HSI, in my opinion, is on par and possibly even better than the old CHI irons and it&#x27;s certainly better than the CHI irons made today.  My daughter has thick, very wavy hair and the HSI irons out the waves much faster than the CHI does.  Another thing noticed worth mentioning is that the CHI has trouble taking a ponytail bend out of hair, but the HSI handles that bend like a pro!  This iron gets very hot so you won&#x27;t find yourself making multiple passes over the same chunk of hair as you must do with the cheaper irons that operate at lower temperatures.  The plates on this iron are very smooth which makes hair happy. My daughter has also informed me that she got great results ironing her hair after she let it dry naturally; that never happened with the CHI.  My daughter also received a CHI iron for Christmas in addition to the HSI I got her; she brought the CHI back.  While CHI may make much \\&quot;prettier\\&quot; irons, the CHI&#x27;s of today just don&#x27;t hold up.    The HSI iron came with a protective glove to use while ironing your hair which I thought was pretty neat being I know I&#x27;ve gotten a little \\&quot;hot palmed\\&quot; when my iron cord got caught on a cabinet.  The HSI iron also came with some Argain Oil and my daughter reports that she likes it, but that&#x27;s about all she has said regarding the oil.  Overall, this is a very good iron and I have recommended it to others that are looking for a good replacement for the CHI products.  Thank you HSI for making a great iron and thank you Blue Novelties for making this item available at a great price!</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and exactly how described.  It was packaged perfectly and works beautifully on my African-American  hair.  Now I can even go more than a day with curls or a &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; in my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener specifically for travel because the one I have at home doesn&#x27;t work for dual voltage. The first time I used it abroad it died. The heat was only turned halfway up and the straightener heated up pretty quickly.  Unfortunately, after I&#x27;d done two pieces of hair the heat started to fade and since then I haven&#x27;t been able to get any heat out of it. It worked fine at home at full heat but since I bought it specifically for travel, one star.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this straightener! It is just as good as the one my hairdresser uses on my hair, if not better! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Excellent price, well made and does the trick. I would highly suggest this product. It&#x27;s made better than any product I&#x27;ve used and it performs as well or better!</li>
    <li> HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great tool. It heats up quick and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Wow, what a great flat iron.  Really easy to use and perfect results.  I am so uncoordinated and this tool works for me.  It looks like someone with talent did my hair.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!  It arrived quickly.  The straightener heats up quickly and the glove comes in very handy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a farouk chi for the past 5 years and so far like my HSI better. I opted for the HSI after running into problems with finding a REAL chi on amazon- it is nearly impossible to find one for under $200 that is not a fake. The pros of the HSI in my opinion are that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair as much as the chi and is much more affordable. The cons: it takes much longer to heat up fully and cool down, about the same as a good quality curling iron. It also is a little heavier than the chi, so not as convenient for travelling purposes. Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I loved this flat iron...for the 3 times that I got to use it.  After that, I plugged it in &amp; it never got hot.  It was a Christmas item, so it was over 30 days out &amp; I couldn&#x27;t return it.  So disappointing.  A $50 waste.</li>
    <li> I had this straightener for a month and it completely broke. Does not work. You would be better off investing more money into a nicer one that will last longer!</li>
    <li> this flat iron saved my life!! not really but it has saved me a ton of money because I can do my hair myself AND it looks professionally done. It makes my hair so silky smooth and straight. I was hesitant because i have coarse hair. But this flat iron works wonders. I wish i had purchased it sooner.</li>
    <li> Singes my hair !!! Then my hair breaks off. Too high of heat even on the lowest setting. Non smooth plates. I am very disappointed especially since this flat iron had the highest amount of ratings and reviews. I thought for sure it would be a good product, having read through most of them. I was very wrong!</li>
    <li> These flat irons actually make my hair feel healthier AFTER using them than before!  Heats up very quickly and never feels as if it&#x27;s damaging my hair.  It glides so smoothly.  The 1&amp;#34; size lets me get close to my scalp to flatten out the new growth between relaxer touch-ups.  I used to get fly-away hair and static with my old ceramic flat irons, but not with these.  The argon oil pack that came with it worked very well - need to find more!  I thought it would be too oily, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I have long African-american relaxed hair, just so you&#x27;ll know.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter because our other one finally died.  This one is so nice!  Our other one was nowhere as smooth as this one is.  Your hair glides right through it, and you can adjust the heat settings so you can find just the right temperature for your hair.  It works much faster than I thought it would.  We are very pleased!</li>
    <li> so not only does this flat iron smooth out my hair AND my daughter&#x27;s hair who has very thick, frizzy, wavy hair, but it stays straight for days...i think my fave part is the fact that i can straighten my hair, put it in a ponytail all day and when i let my hair down i dont have that \\&quot;hairtie bump\\&quot; i love this flat iron :)</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service.  There was a problem with the first flat iron I received but once I notified the seller, I received a new one a day later.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet because im contemplating whether to reture it or not but i think i receieved it used. Should i keep it or return it?</li>
    <li> Works great; No issues! The oil included can cause your hair to become greasy if you use too much. I prefer a different smoothing serum and a flat iron spray to ensure smooth hair.</li>
    <li> I wish I could have liked this but honestly I&#x27;ve had better straighteners.... My hair does not stay straight with this. I went out and by a few hours later my hair was a total mess, no longer sleek and smooth. It hurts a little to hold it, it feels kinda cheap when I clamp it. There&#x27;s like this little squeak. Just invest in a GHD from sephora, it&#x27;s much better and worth your money.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing. Different temps,  couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.  My hair stylist was absolutely jealous.  I am sure she will buy one also</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!  I paid $100 plus for a flat iron that I bought at the mall and misplaced it.  I needed one quick and so after reading ALL the great reviews on the HSI I thought I would give it a try.  It is great!</li>
    <li> The price seemed too good to be true for a good quality iron with so many good reviews.  Unfortunately, I found this to be true.  I previously owned a Solia iron that gave up the ghost after 7 years but I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try based on all the awesome reviews so I could save some money.  Like the Solia, the HSI iron heated up quickly and has an adjustable temperature option. The Solia has a wheel from 0-450 degrees.  The HSI instead has a dial that only identifies 410 as the max temp. You have to estimate what temp you are at unless you are at 410 and I think that leaves the potential to be using a higher temp than you need because you can&#x27;t really tell what temp you&#x27;re at unless it&#x27;s the max.  This iron seemed to do a fair job of straightening my somewhat naturally straight hair at what I estimated would be the same as 350 on the Solia but I found I had to make a few more passes to do the job with the HSI to get the kinks out post blow dry than I had to with the Solia.  These are minor differences that I would be willing to put up with but my biggest complaint, and it&#x27;s a showstopper for me, is that it CAUGHT MY HAIR somehow between the plates several times every morning.  I love saving a few bucks but not at the expense of damaging my hair.  I held on to it just a few days after the 30 day return period expired and ended up buying a Solia anyway for 2x the cost of this iron but the minimal passes required and NO TANGLES at all were worth it.  This HSI iron is going to be an expensive back-up.</li>
    <li> I had been a loyal customer to HAI hair irons for years, but unfortunately, with as time went on their products became less dependable and of poor quality. Finding a new iron was not easy but I decided to give this one a try because of all the good reviews and it&#x27;s affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i&#x27;ve found so far:&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and it gets really hot.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the glove that it comes with (but i&#x27;ve been straightning for years), but it could be useful.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a huge section, you don&#x27;t have to go over it multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;I love the pouch it comes with. You&#x27;re not supposed to put it in their while its hot but it&#x27;s nice to keep it in there when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars because 1)I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to last, and, 2)sometimes I feel it leaves my hair a little frizzy. I used the serum it comes with, but mostly all it does is smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, black, curly hair. In case that helps anyone with their decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend it, the price is good and so far, the iron is good.</li>
    <li> Last month I purchased the HSI ceramic flat iron from Amazon. I did some online research before purchasing this product. The price was GREAT. The flat iron works great and doesn&#x27;t scorch my hair.  I always have a good experience when ordering from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron as my daughter and I both have very thick hair. Most flat irons just don&#x27;t seem to straighten our hair. I say that the HSI flat iron worked great. It straightens after one pass and hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair. I would certainly order this again.</li>
    <li> I had a Revlon before this one that worked great but needed to replace.  Saw this one and saw the high price and reviews, but I give it a 3 because it didn&#x27;t outperform my Target one.  Says it is suppose to be professional but it is not.  It does straighten, but not any better than other cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> I am VERY disappointed with the HSI flat iron. It is made out of cheap plastic that smacks together every time you open and close it. Sorry I even paid what I paid for it. Mistake buying online.</li>
    <li> Starting out I have very thick wavy curly its hard to manage.  This product is the only one out there that is reasonably priced. Its easy to use and reliable it is worth the price I would highly recommend it. My hair is smooth and soft after use.  The temperature control is great so you can change for hair type.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and she just loved it. She was so surprised how well it worked. Thank you for the great product.</li>
    <li> Bought in February and it doesn&#x27;t work all the time. The light will come on that it&#x27;s ready and its not even hot or it just doesn&#x27;t come on at all. Also notice a lot breakage in hair when I use it. When I first got it it worked great. Will go back to my CHI.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is everything I wanted and more! The added bonus is the Argan Oil. Order the full size, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because it had so many good reviews- bad idea. I don&#x27;t understand why so many people liked it. After a few days of using this straightener, my hair started to get very dry and damaged feeling, like I couldn&#x27;t condition it enough. Also, I had to wait 20-30 seconds for it to warm back up after straightening one section of my hair which added at least 10 minutes onto my normal straightening time. I ended up going to ULTA a week later and purchasing a different straightener. I&#x27;m sad I wasted my money on this one.</li>
    <li> As someone that has steadfastly refused to buy any flat iron straightener that cost 100+ dollars, I decided to order the HSI 1\\&quot; due to the great reviews on Amazon and the reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it many times since receiving it last week, and it is by far, my favorite straightener ever. The high humidity where I live is a good test, and this one hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for the price! It is even better than the Chi flat iron I also own.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my aunt, she loves it! I&#x27;m a hairstylist in Los Angeles..and am very particular about my styling tools, I would tell anyone to get this! Great cost !</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in May 2016 and received a digital model for reasons unknown to me.  The digital item held heat for about two months and now falls from 450 degrees to 435 degrees then takes about one minute to recover this cannot be right.  I will attempt to contact seller for a reason why this happens.</li>
    <li> First of all, fulfillment by Amazon was flawless. They ship it very fast and sooner than expected. I have Prime so it got here in 2 days. A+ for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many say that this HSI is better than Chi or Paul Michell. I was very skeptical because I&#x27;ve never heard of it and would be happy even if its just ok because of its low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just using it once, I am convinced that it is indeed better and the best you can buy for under $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy fizzy hair that is hard to contour and control. After using this and the sample argan oil included, my hair was transformed just like you would see on TV Extreme Make Over. No kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Makes thick and wavy hair straighten easily and fast&lt;br /&gt;Best bang for your buck&lt;br /&gt;Good ergonomics allows amateurs to handle it like a pro&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair silky soft with the include Argan Oil sample&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No auto shutoff timer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Mine stop working after about a year. I called them up and they sent me a new one no questions asked!&lt;br /&gt;They stand behind their products and customer service was excellent. I would give them an extra star making it 6 STARS but Amazon only allows for 5 max</li>
    <li> My college daughter wanted a ceramic 1\\&quot; Flat Iron that was 450 degrees. After doing research online I chose the 1\\&quot; Tourmaline Flat Iron due to its adjustable heat features and slimline look. After she tried it out the first time, she called me and excitedly explained that her hair had never looked smoother and straighter and she was extremely happy! It made her day!  Thanks Mom!</li>
    <li> Actually the Five Star rating was given by my wife, who is ecstatic with this item.&lt;br /&gt;She states it is everything she was looking for and then some.&lt;br /&gt;When Mama&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I am totally happy with my HS1 Flat Iron,  This is my second Flat Iron always used the Chi.....so I was a bit leary.  I received the product and I am very happy with it.  I would definately reccomend this product.  It does a great job and is very easy to use.  Thumbs up to this product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because of the price and all the good reviews it seems to have. When it arrived it was exactly as described. It looks nice and glides thru my hair nicely. Doesn&#x27;t catch or pull my hair like other irons I have tried. It has almost a soft texture to it so it feels nice on my hands, not just hard plastic. My only slight complaint is that it&#x27;s about the same size as my other irons but this one seems kind of bulky and it&#x27;s a tad heavy. Wish they could lighten it up a little or something. Anyhow, I have thin/fine hair and it works good and straightens my hair just fine. It&#x27;s a flat iron ~ not some magic miracle tool like some of these reviews make it out to be. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price (especially for solid ceramic plates) and works good for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new straightener! I have never spent alot on one before and thought maybe I should pay alittle more for one and I&#x27;m soooo glad I did!</li>
    <li> I am African American and I have been trying to transition from perms to natural hair, but straight natural hair. I used to use a Remington hair straightener and it worked okay for the most part but for some reason my hair never shined the way I wanted it. I was looking at getting a CHI but then I came across HSI and decided to research a bit more before I made the purchase. I am super glad I decided to take a chance on this straightener because I have never, ever had straight hair without having to use a perm and to be honest my hair never took to perms that well either. My hair is about 8 inches and kind of coarse when not permed and my new growth is especially hard to straighten because the hair is super coarse and curly. I used this for the first time tonight and I had straight hair on one pass. I will tell you what I used on my hair to get a perm look without the chemical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed together the following products to get super soft, shinning and nutrient-infused hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Moisturizing Hair Lotion&lt;br /&gt;100% African Shea Butter (purchased from Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Nature&#x27;s Way EfaGold Coconut Oil Pure Extra Virgin (purchased from Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Now Solutions Castor Oil (purchased from Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Now Solutions Jojoba Oil (purchased from Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Lemon Essential Oil (purchased from Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I mixed this together in a quick application my hair was seriously soft, manageable and amazing when I straightened it. I wanted to see how all these products worked together and now I am going to melt these items together to get an even mixture and place the grease in a container and refridgerate to make it firm again. This coupled with the straightener equals amazing results and should definitely be attempted. There was also no burning smell as I straightened my hair and the room did not fill with smoke as I am used to it doing with my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if the Argain Oil works because with all theoils I placed in my hair I did not need to use another to straighten my hair. I will try that later on and report back. The package came with a beautiful red sleeve to place the iron in and I love that touch. I don&#x27;t know how a CHI performs so I cannot relate to the differences or similarities but I do know that if you are on a budget and prefer to have amazing hair without having to shell out over a hundred dollars then this is your straightener. I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to note: I am not a puppet who was promised anything from the company or seller to leave a good review as well as I do not work for HSI. This review is coming from my honest usage of this product from a long time Amazon consumer.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;Gets hair straight- it is a flat iron after all :D&lt;br /&gt;My hair was no staticy after using it!&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable temp setting- it is a dial, so no exact temp setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No auto shut off.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it pulls your hair when you are running it through it, and it hurts. And for this I&#x27;m returning it. I just feel like it&#x27;s hurting my hair more by that pulling action.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product but I can hardly believe anyone would pay $300.00 for it. $50.00 is definitely a great buy. It takes me longer than what I expected to straighten my hair and the controls are difficult to read - temp dial especially. But overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it, am glad I purchased it, and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice and only a fraction of the price. My hair became silky smooth and I am black with coarse hair. The glove was unnecessary to use because it does not get too hot on the outside to burn your hands. The oil package I have not used yet, but I am sure it will be nice. The iron is kind of bulky, compared to my last flatiron. My last one was not a name brand but it was also real ceramic plates. My old one glided much better but the HSI is still a great product. I would recommend it especially at this price. You have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I was glad I got this straightener. At the highest setting, this does not burn the hair, just straightens it. I have shoulder length curly coarse hair and I love this HSI product. I wish the temp knob was somewhere else other than the inside, I don&#x27;t want to burn myself.</li>
    <li> The flat iron heats really quickly and straightens my thick wavy hair. The long cord is a plus too. Just beware, the pouch is too small for the flat iron, once you unpack it from the bubble wrap, but I have no complaints about the flat iron itself.</li>
    <li> I have a ghd straightener and I thought with such great reviews that this one would be better. Not the case. It is good, don&#x27;t get me wrong but there are better options out there, obviously much pricier. It is a great value for the product. My ghd was a gift from my guy (retails for around $185, which is pricey). I have really thick full wavy/straightish long hair so I appreciate fast and effective with hair products. By thick I mean thick though....like when I get haircuts I feel bad for them. One salon person told me I won the cake for the most hair. This one would probably need a few pass throughs...but if you have thin hair, this would be perfect. It clamps quite firm vs my ghd. My ghd feels smoother when straightening downwards...I don&#x27;t know how to explain that but maybe you know what I mean. So I did a comparison with one side of my hair with my current one and then the other side this one...they both do their job but this one seems like it isnt going to stay straight for as long, needs more pass throughs, not left as shiny. The bright side of this one is that is has temp control unlike mine.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Tourmaline Flat Iron. My hair is long and frizzy. Straightened it and lasted for days. Even after washing it.. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time venturing out of a Chi product for a hair straightener, let me tell you I should have bought a Chi instead. I chose this hair straightener because the price was so good at the time, but after using it for a couple months I decided that I don&#x27;t like it much. First thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it pulls my hair. I never had that problem with Chi, secondly it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it claimed.It came with a glove and was nicely packaged, but overall your money is better served investing in a Chi.</li>
    <li> I have SUPER fine hair and it is difficult to get it straight without it looking brittle... That&#x27;s why I love this iron/ oil combo!!! My hair is SO soft and shiny, not brittle or lifeless at all : ) love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!  It gets really hot and people say my hair looks super straight!  I used to use the Chi iron but it was getting old and I felt like it wasn&#x27;t straightening my hair as well as it used to.  This straightener is a great price and I highly recommend it!  My hair is really long and thick and it does a great job!</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown...fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> Bought it to my girlfriend, she is very satisfied from the product.&lt;br /&gt;Using it almost every week.&lt;br /&gt;very recommended product.</li>
    <li> its a very good product. long-lasting straight hair. It straightens hair with just one use of it. i can rely on it whenever i need it.</li>
    <li> Straightens hair very well and heats up quickly. Rotating cord is a blessing. I have not found use of the glove though...</li>
    <li> I bought this item about two months ago. It had a small scratch on the corner of the plate but didn&#x27;t seem to affect the quality of the product.  But right about the two month mark, the corner chipped off. Disappointed, I wrote the company that sent me the straightener. Told them what happened, and they immediately offered to send me a replacement. I got the new iron two days later. Talk about a positive experience! It&#x27;s nice to have a company stand behind it&#x27;s products! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product, at all.  Does not heat up good and tears hair, not smooth like our chi, which we were going to replace, but keep on using since this one is so bad.  I was to late to return, otherwise would have.  I still have it in the box, never going to use it again.</li>
    <li> After reading lots of reviews on multiple flat irons, I made the decision to go with the HSI and I have no regrets. It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s easy to use and leaves my hair sleek and shiny all day. I love the shape and weight, feels good in your hand and isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
    <li> Love this hair ironer. Would have given it 5 stars if the pouch were a bit bigger</li>
    <li> Have to go over hair multiple times for it to be straight, but otherwise good.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!! I had bought a cheap one at Walmart...was looking for a better one! This was a great deal and it works GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I have had a chi for years.  I decided to purchase thus when my Chi broke.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier works great!!!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  Heats up incredibly quick.</li>
    <li> I have really thick mixed hair and have used many different straightners.  I thought this might be a good deal so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;First off it took a while to get the darn thing on!  I had to keep pressing the reset/test button, then it finally started to get warm.  Once it started heating up it took about ten minutes to heat up, i kept touching the plates thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t have it on or it was my mistake somehow, but it was starting to heat up SLOOOOOWLY! I have straightners that are 3 years old that only take 2 minutes to heat up, this straightner was ridiculous!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Second, as if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough already I went to straighten my hair and every time I ran in through small pieces of hair it was pulling my hair out every time!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener after reading all the awesome reviews. This iron does not heat up well and did not straighten my hair well either. My hair is already straight too so either it really does not work or it&#x27;s defective. No clue but it&#x27;s going back. I thought it was going to be better than the chi &#x3D;[.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  The switches are on the inside of the flat iron and can&#x27;t be bumped off when using it.  It heats up quickly and has a good, strong grip.  This is the best flat iron I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially the oil treatment that comes with it. However, I read that it was a miracle for curly hair that tends to frizz when straightened. I still have this issue, but I&#x27;ve just chopped it up to having crappy hair. This is an amazing straightener for a even more amazing price!</li>
    <li> Least favorite iron I&#x27;ve ever owned! It&#x27;s touted as being salon quality, but it doesn&#x27;t compare! I&#x27;d never buy one again! I&#x27;d get another Croc or Corioliss iron over this one any day. Biggest complaint is that it snags and never feels smooth on my hair and I&#x27;m pretty sure it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair these days!</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these HSI flat irons for my wife to replace her Solia AC-100, which stopped working when the swivel cord connector snapped (amid a scary shower of sparks!!!) after three years of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tells me her new HSI works just as well as the pretty, pink, limited edition Solia did, and it cost half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also raves about the small sample of Argan oil the seller included with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This appears to be a very good appliance for an extremely fair price.</li>
    <li> I like this hot iron, which at first was VERY hot when heating that I had to use the glove to use the iron. It does heat up very quickly - just wish it had auto shut off.</li>
    <li> I expected a straightener that could do an okey job on straightening my hair, since the price was about half of what the brand straighteners costs. So I gave it a try because I saw how great ratings it have gotten.&lt;br /&gt;When the product came to my home it was so much better than expected, I have never been able to curl my hair with an straightener, but this HSI did the job! And it takes about 5 minutes to straighten my hair now, when it used to take about 20 minutes! So thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> It works, it does not pull on my hair, it heats up quickly, the cord is long, my hair is shiny and everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife who travels almost weekly and thus has high demands and expectations for such products.  She has been delighted with the performance and it has stood up to the rigors of constant travel.  It even worked great overseas.</li>
    <li> My wife claims this is a great flat iron. It works warms up very quickly and she claims it leaves her hair flatter with less frizz.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Having the glove made a huge difference to getting through a lot of thick hair quickly and comfortably.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron. I am very pleased with the iron and with the transaction. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product!! I have only had my chi for a year now &amp; it burnt out!! So I have been on a shopping spree looking for a nicer/better straightener and I found this!! I absolutely love it!! It is made very well and I have no complaints so far!!! I paid way more for my chi and this straightener out beats the chi!! It also came with a free sample of argan oil for my hair and I love it, I put it on before I straighten my hair, it works great!!!!</li>
    <li> The flat iron gets hot quickly. Wish it had auto shut off, but I still like it a lot. Great flat iron for the price!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve bought. Love the travel bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after reading the many positive reviews. It works really well and straightens my mid-length hair perfectly.  The sample bottle of argan oil is a plus!</li>
    <li> The flat iron was heavier that i expected (which may have been me expecting more than i should have because my previous flat iron was a FHI and cost considerably more) and hard to maneuver.  I only used this flat iron one time, so i cannot speak to how well it smooths out hair.  I only used it one time because it pulled at my hair consistently and i used it.  This was not the case with my previous flat iron, so i know it was the flat iron, not me.  It also left my hair considerably more frizzy than other flat irons.  After my first (and only) use i returned the item.  Company had good customer service and was prompt and allowed me to return with no hassle.  I wish it had worked better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting. It pulls my hair and don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
    <li> Over all for the cheap price that your paying for this product is works really well, and shipping come really fast. The only thing I have a issue with is the heat dial starts at 140. And goes to 450 and you have no idea where you set it in between because it isn&#x27;t labeled. And I wish the cord would fit into the bag as well. But as far as quality, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my HSI straightener that I recently purchased. Not only did it arrive on time and well packaged, but the results I&#x27;m getting are better than i expected. I love that you can control the temperature, others I&#x27;ve owned did not have that feature, and the the red satin bag it comes in keeps it from getting scratched when you store it. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Straightens my curly hair fast and my hair is in much better condition since getting those flat iron</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair, and this flat iron works well without damaging your ends. Definitely use some sort of heat serum or the argan oil it comes with before you straighten. I would put this on par with a CHI flat iron.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It doesn&#x27;t tear your hair out and it gives it so much shine! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> heats up fast and straightens in a short time. speeds up morning routine. glad I found this deal and didn&#x27;t go for higher priced irons that will do the same job.</li>
    <li> I have used nothing but Chi flat irons for over 7 years and after mine went out, I decided to try the HSI as it had amazing reviews. People were saying it was better than a Chi. This is not the case. My hair is thick and curly. This straightener didn&#x27;t get hot enough to even make a difference with my hair. It was still wavy and took way to much time. Plus, my hair got caught somewhere in the straightener, maybe between the plates, because it pulled at my hair. Save yourself the headache, spend a little extra money and get a Chi!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. It&#x27;s by far one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  When used in conjunction with the Argan oil my hair styles worth ear and is sure to look great.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I would totally give this product 5 stars but it does tend to pull my hair sometimes .  However it is still an awesome deal for the price.  It heats up very quickly and gets so hot that i actually got blisters on my finger from running my hand thru my hair after ironing, a glove is included with purchase though .  I spent a fraction of the money i did on my last flat iron and honestly like it more than my chi</li>
    <li> Cut my straightening time in half. Works great and gets very hot, great for really curly hair. No need to \\&quot;straighten\\&quot; with a blow dryer first.</li>
    <li> Love this! My hair didn&#x27;t friz even without oils.</li>
    <li> does not heat up to expectations can&#x27;t even use it on anything but the bangs</li>
    <li> My wife received this based on the strong reviews, and it worked fine the first few times she tried it.  The on the third try, it no longer worked.  Wouldn&#x27;t heat up, regardless of what we did.  We reset the power outlet, and still nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent a letter of complaint to both Amazon and HSI, letting them know that we did all the standard trouble shooting (resetting the power button on the outlet, etc) and here&#x27;s what happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HSI response:  Press harder on the reset button for the power outlet.  (We already let you know we reset it... pressing harder really won&#x27;t help the defective product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon response:  Print it out, and we&#x27;ll refund you!  (Only to find out after we sent it back, they deducted $10 off for restocking... what are you restocking?  A defective item?)  UPDATE:  Amazon corrected the restocking fee after contacting them.  Great customer service, and what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product. The best flat iron I have ever had. Leaves hair straight and with a shine.</li>
    <li> Professional iron at home, wonderfill! I can&#x27;t believe how silky my hair feels after using this flat iron, It works quickly and effectively and results last all day. My hair actually feels healthier after using it! Amazing iron transforming frizz into sleek, shiny hair in 10 minutes or less. I have more than nine month using it and it still works like new!!! Doesn&#x27;t seem so pricey when you put it that way!!! Plus: FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment! yeah!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much and it is the best flat iron out. My hair is very thick and sometimes hard to manage, this flat iron tames it and makes it straight and silky. I highly recommend this product, please get yourself one if you don&#x27;t have one already.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was, it doesnt get any hotter or sleeker then my old generic did, but i use it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. I&#x27;ve used one before, but it took what felt like hours to heat up and it didn&#x27;t have the nice digital display that this one has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one comes in a nice long box, inside a padded bag that zips and has a carry handle. The bag is nice and convenient. I tend to hang my items because of limited space and having it stored inside a nice hangable bag is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Looks great- does not work well- I use high end products in my hair- From shampoo to finishing spray I do everything I can to lessen the damage straightening causes- keep in mind I don&#x27;t have curly hair- but I use a straight iron to smooth and style my hair. I have always used CHI- products and had great luck- I bought this one as a backup/ keep in my car/overnight bag ( I work as a nurse with an hour commute and sometimes due to weather traveling home between shifts isn&#x27;t an option). I have used this flat iron.... Attempted to at least, on three different occasions- each time my hair felt as though my it was getting caught and pulled out on something. I always spray my hair with a silicone protectant, and I even went as far as spraying the actual straightener with hopes of getting a nice smooth painless pass... No luck. Maybe I got a dud, but I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item and used only one time. the argon oil was not there in the package. Since I used only one time I could not say a lot. but it worked well. I was used to have a remington hair straightener for years and this one seems that it did a faster job.  I gave three stars because it shows red light just after when I start not even finishing one stroke also the argon bottle is missing.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research before buying this flat iron and am very glad I decided on this one.  Price was great and the iron works very well.  It does pull my hair once in a while but overall I am pleased.  Would buy again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Much better than chi. Alittle heavier but get the hair much straighter and does not pull hair or rip out</li>
    <li> Glad I chose this flat iron.  It works great and is a very nice professional flat iron at a very great price.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, especially for the price.  Heats up extremely fast</li>
    <li> I love this straightner makes you hair so soft and adds volume</li>
    <li> Recommended to me and didn&#x27;t disappoint.  Easy to handle and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical because i&#x27;ve only used one brand of flat irons, but I wanted to try this company&#x27;s because the reviews were positive and I liked the features it has (swivel cord, glove, on/off switch not in a position where it could easily be switched off by mistake while in use). The iron stays hot and it does its job!! So far I only used them twice, but from what i&#x27;ve seen, I would purchase another pair/set if these &amp;#34;die&amp;#34; from over use in the future. :)  UPDATED REVIEW: Ended up throwing these away (missed my window to return them). They get two stars because they DO hold heat, but nothing more because they damaged my hair (even WITH the heat protector products I use). The problem is the plates..they aren&#x27;t smooth enough so they snag &amp; pull at your hair. (I have a pair of Remington flat irons from my daughter in law that works GREAT but since they&#x27;re older &amp; no longer sold, i&#x27;ll be back in the same situation if they give out on me. :(</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. It is easy to use and stays hot. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good value for the money but after reading all the RAVING reviews I expected to be totally blown away.  I have light, fine hair and it is pretty easy to straighten.  Although this product gets the job done I thought my hair would be much shinier and smoother after processing.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast...so far i&#x27;ve had a good experience with it.  I have used it 5 times and hair looks healthy</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, product as described.</li>
    <li> I ended up returning this item. It never got very hot, even on the highest setting, and didn&#x27;t straighten my hair well at all.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is normally not difficult to straighten but this did a terrible job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best straightener i have used so far. It really makes my hair smooth and sleek. Very good for damaged dry hair.</li>
    <li> It is amazing and a great price.</li>
    <li> The flat iron works great, have not bought one in awhile so figured i would purchase this. Also comes with a glove Shipping was fast also!!</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a defective flat iron.  It took FOREVER to heat up, and I had to wait for it to get back up to temperature for every section of hair. Luckily, I was able to return it and am getting the same flat iron my hair dresser uses for thirty bucks more.  I suggest a Croc or Chi for home use, not this POS</li>
    <li> Love it!! So easy to use and heats up quickly. Makes my hair look like it was professionally done! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Gets hot and stays hot till the styling is done - love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice item. Works excellent</li>
    <li> This flat iron glides smoothly on my hair and leaves it feeling silky and straight.  I very much like the temperature control which goes from very low to high.  I do not need the high temperatures as some people do and so can use it on the low end of medium.  The flat iron is very light and easy to handle and the swivel cord keeps it out of my way.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Product is great!  Just as described.</li>
    <li> I purchased the straightener/iron and LOVE LOVE LOVE it..  I have very fine frizzy hair (yes kinky greys) i set it on 12 about the middle of control and within minutes my hair is frizz free and supper soft... I love the fact that is has temperature control.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had saved myself over double the cost on a CHI iron with no temp control and bought this one first. The CHI tends to snag on the edges OUCH this one does not its a super smooth iron.. you will LOVE IT i guarantee it. OH and is sorta curved on the edges of the iron so FLIPPING your hair is a breeze to.... YOU WONT go wrong ordering this. BONUS was i received mine within two days i think, super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old, mediocre straightener.  I have wavy hair, and no matter how hard I try, I cannot simply blow-dry it straight.  Enter this flat iron.  It works perfectly.  I use a mid-range temperature, and it gets the job done in one swipe.  Sometimes, I only straighten the top layer of hair that shows, and skip the rest.  Can&#x27;t be beat at this price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron and within one use it has stopped working!&lt;br /&gt;Also i have a decent grade of hair and it didnt even get my hair that straight!&lt;br /&gt;I have used better flat irons from WalMart and Target!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy a better brand!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to travel overseas.. was not thrilled with it but it did the job... However, I sent it to my daughter and she thinks it a great product!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this flat iron and I finally purchased it.  The first time I used it I was stunned! I have curly hair and my friends didn&#x27;t believe I had straightened it myself! My hair was smooth, shiny and it lasted for days! I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great straightener! I feel like the internal thermometer is a little off though because after using it for a bit, the iron cools but the indicator light never reflects the change in temperature. I just have to remember to give it break in between sections for it to heat up again. This isn&#x27;t a big deal and it still gets hot enough to straighten out my curly hair. Quite satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would have straight hair. My hair is thick.  Love it. Buying this for my sister and highly recommending this to others.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works beautifully and was a great price. It arrived fast and was well packaged. Exactly what I expected. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have natural curly frizzy hair so I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding good products to use on my hair. I started to use its a ten and joico k-pak which I love my hair feels soft but finding a straightener I had a hard time because my hair would get straight but still have a frizzy ness to it especially at the ends. I ordered this because I saw the original price and it was on sale my hair gets perfectly straight with it and I&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months with no problems at all! All if my friends love it as well they ask me to bring it with me to their house when I come over it just come to my house just to use it! I told them how cheap it was and they&#x27;ve finally started ordered their own. I would recommend this product to everyone I have no idea how anyone could have a bad review on it!</li>
    <li> I love the straightener and it came quicker than expected! My only concern is the fact that my on/off switch doesn&#x27;t work and needs to be completely unplugged after using it because if not, it won&#x27;t turn off? Is this a defect?</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  I almost paid 3x as much for one before I saw the reviews on this one.  I don&#x27;t know how it could have been any better than the HSI.  My hair looks better than it ever has with a flat iron.  It heats up quickly and I like that you can adjust the temperature.  My hair is thin and fine so I don&#x27;t need it at the highest setting.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is not what I expected. The plates are not smooth and it seems like it snags the hair. Not a good selection on my part.</li>
    <li> 6/1/15  This comment is for a new (2nd) flat iron: My first flat iron started to not heat up.  I loved it when it worked.  I couldn&#x27;t find out how to return it, so it was not sent back.    Since this model worked great when it was working, I figured that I just happened to get a bad one ... I decided I would order another one, thinking the flat iron would be fine.  Not at all, this one was not heating up AND the flat iron plates, when closed had a gap so my hair would slip through.  I kept the box and paperwork this time, and read that it would be replaced for $19.99.  Well that amount plus adding postage, I could just put that towards a new flat iron.  And I did ... I purchased a CHI, so far works great.  This comment was left before on the first flat iron I purchased: HOW DO I CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER?  I have had the HSI Professional for about 8 months, and it no longer is heating up enough to straighten hair.  If it is not working I can&#x27;t truthfully give it more stars.  I want everyone to know, if the heating problem didn&#x27;t exist, I would give it a full 5 stars.  I loved it, it was the best flat iron I have ever used.  It is just not heating up ...</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!!! I have naturel curls and very thick hair...It&#x27;s very hard for me to handle my hair with my disability...I have to go to the hair Salon or have my daughter do my hair...Well with this product not only do I do my own hair it look fresh and beautiful all the time..I have tried so many straightener before and my hair looks with dry end no shape it looked awful...Thank God I found HSI The Styler, I can do my hair without help. I can have a natural straight hair or with a soft curl..This product is wonderful..I look like I left the hair Salon every time I use my HSI Styler Flat Iron...If I can use it with my disability and get these result anybody can use it,,,THE PRODUCT IS GREAT...</li>
    <li> So far I like this hair straightener. The plates are smooth and do not grab my hair. I like that you can adjust the heat setting and it seems to heat up fairly quickly. I wish it had an automatic shut off but other than that I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great flat iron. I love it and have already recommended it to friends and family. The sample HSI Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER that came with it is amazing and smells SO good. The button to turn it on/off and change the temperature setting is in a great location. (I&#x27;ve had others that would accidently change settings, while I was using it.)</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener - I&#x27;m curious why the cord is so long but other than that it&#x27;s been wonderful...</li>
    <li> its not like what people say and exaggerating about this product. its good but not as good as the one you see in hair saloons one  move on the hair  and the hair will be soft .&lt;br /&gt;Its good for the people with soft hair, but for curly hair and thick hair it will not be as what you are expecting. over all its good for the price and it will help to fix the hair after blow dry.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!!! I am Latina, very curly frizzy hair and so far this tool has worked better than any other hot tool I have ever used before!!! Leaves my hair shinny, is faster, and I can even make amazing waves in my hair... The results last for days until whenever I wash my hair! Definitely recommend it! And planning to buy a second one for Xmas for my mom! Thank you so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s the picture was taken first thing in the morning after 2 days of using this amazing tool... I wanted to show my mom that finally I woke up with a beautiful hair without retouching it before going to work! :)</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I&#x27;m still figuring out how to use it, but it performs well. It comes with a heat resistant glove and a pouch, which are appreciated. :) The merchant shipped on time and everything was perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great! The adjustable temperature setting really lets me control the entire straightening process. I have thick, long, curly hair and this does a really great job. I would like the ceramic part to be a little bit bigger, but it just takes me a little longer to do all my hair. It comes with a heat glove and a very nice carrying case. One of the better straighteners I have owned.</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair and this is the first flat iron that has given me smooth silky looking hair</li>
    <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t used it extensively since I bought it though.It heats up fast and does a good job straightening my hair. I have medium to fine strands and it does not take long to straighten it.</li>
    <li> After a bad experience with previous flat irons, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this iron. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, heats up quickly and has delivered perfect results every time I&#x27;ve used it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Heats up quickly and leaves my hair silky smooth with only 1 or 2 passes..I give it an A+ !</li>
    <li> The flatiron caught slightly on my hair as I used it. It straightened alright but was not as smooth as I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Its works buy not as good as i want it to. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Bought this flat iron based on the reviews and since it was rated no. 1 flat iron in amazon and bec it was cheap. Im amazingly surprised! How it leaves my hair so soft and shiny after using this. So comparable to my chi or even better. I already had 2 CHIs that overheated when i used it abroad that&#x27;s why i needed a new one. Hopefully this will not! But not going anywhere soon. Luv this so far!</li>
    <li> I have only used this a couple of times since I just got it but so far I love it!!</li>
    <li> Wife loves the product and I never knew I could get deliveries on Sunday!</li>
    <li> has lasted for a very long time now. great price</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it.  go babyliss</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this was so inexpensive! Works great!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and handling.  Hair iron was exactly as describe and works AMAZING. It left my hair smooth and shiny. I am very impressed and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> for the money, best flat iron!  I paid $40 and my niece got another brand with product and all for $100 that was no different.  For $100 I would expect a larger iron with a higher temp range.  But for $40... it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> the plates are too small</li>
    <li> This flat iron is wonderful. It&#x27;s sturdy but not heavy, and the heat doesn&#x27;t seep through and burn me like I&#x27;ve often experienced. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Professional quality and relability</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever! And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I am so glad I purchased this item and you will feel the same too. I guarantee it!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Chi ($100) for a few years.  This HSI is not only much cheaper ($40), performance is better than Chi&#x27;s. My hair is coarse and it is straightened efficiently.  It is slightly smaller but it is handy if you travel to different countries where voltages keep changing.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have never done much heat styling to my hair.  I decided it was now or never, and tried this out.  I was very impressed to say the least.  It is a very easy tool - just plug in, switch on and 30 seconds later, you are ready to begin!  This small flat iron is very easy to maneuver and my arms do not tire from a flat iron session (about 25 minutes).  I have long wavy hair and this iron straightens at the first pass.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Has multiple temperature settings and heats up almost instantly. I would definitely recommend this product to others</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST! I don&#x27;t leave for vacation without it.</li>
    <li> Gets plenty hot enough to get the job done well, but not so hot you smell burning hair, which is the problem I had with other brands in the past.  Love it</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! Use it every day!</li>
    <li> Its alright, tugs on the hair a bit so not as smooth as I would have liked and also rather heavy especially considering I&#x27;m using it as a travel iron. The plus is that the dual voltage works great. I&#x27;m using it in Europe and no problems but just remember you still need an adapter plug for it to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but ended up keeping it for myself. It arrived promptly. I was pleasantly surprised at how great it is.  I can curl, flip or straighten.</li>
    <li> Works great and straightens really fast</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and needed and new flat iron. I read reviews for days to make sure I was making the right purchase! This flat iron exceeded my expectations!! I love it and I tell everyone about it!!</li>
    <li> Good flat iron.  I&#x27;m not sure the glove is necessary, it&#x27;s just a cotton glove.  The pouch is a bit useless as well, but a nice thought.</li>
    <li> So far love it. But does take practice to learn to use a flat iron properly as this is my first.</li>
    <li> My teen took over my Chi so I wanted something to replace it without having to pay so much. Love this flat iron. When you 1st use it  it feels a little stiff. You may want to put a little oil on before you let it heat up to make it run through your hair easier the first few times.</li>
    <li> Leaves great sheen and shine to my hair and seems to keep my hair straight through out the day and I live on a humid island.</li>
    <li> This heats great but pulls my hair. I had an HSI from the same seller prior to ordering this one but I caused water damage to it so I tried this one for price. Not satisfied like the other one :(</li>
    <li> GF says this unit did not get hot enough to straighten her mildly wavy hair efficiently.  I also notice the ceramic pads seem firmly mounted instead of on springy padded mounts like her other iron.  No problem returning to amazon though.</li>
    <li> Great Iron shipped real fast got it in no time.will but again!!</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up in less than 10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with travel sleeve, oil, and gloves&lt;br /&gt;- Great customer service&lt;br /&gt;- Rotatable string so it does not tangle when in use&lt;br /&gt;- Great for curling or straightening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Did snag hair, but customer service quickly replaced the product because it was defective. New one had no issues.</li>
    <li> For the Amazon price, it&#x27;s a great purchase, especially compared to similarly priced flat irons available at your regular retail stores. It heats up fast and hot, and flattens hair in one pass or two. The reason why I&#x27;m giving it four stars (versus five) is that the free argan oil is in a glass jar that cracked all over everything in the box. I had to throw out the flat iron pouch and wiped down the cord. If the manufacturer is really going to pack a glass container of oil, it should be bubble-wrapped or somehow more protected in the box, rather than laying at the top and susceptible to any amount of pressure.</li>
    <li> Love love love my new flatiron! It makes my hair look professionally done! Thanks for such a wonderful product ! Satisfied customer!  :) Donna R.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got mildly curly hair but it&#x27;s unevenly curly, so I can&#x27;t wear it &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; because my hair would look schizo.  This heats up fast and it&#x27;s easy to grip.  You can use it for straightening or curls (or youtube the millions of ways people use their irons.)  The glove is a great bonus.  Two small gripes: I&#x27;d like the on/off and temp to be easier to reach (it&#x27;s awkward) and it would be good if it automatically switched off after an hour (for those of us with young kids.)  However, I&#x27;ve used a Chi and Babyliss in the past and this is BY FAR my favorite, even with those small complaints.  Oh, and I loved the Argan oil sample so much I ordered a larger size.</li>
    <li> Very light weight, heats up fast, when I first got it something sounded broken but I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was now a piece of the ceramic has broken off and I haven&#x27;t even had it that long</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and works great</li>
    <li> I love this straightener it was so worth it</li>
    <li> This straightener is great, it really gets the job done :) I have long hair, also very thick hair. I don&#x27;t take as long as I used to. The price is also great :)</li>
    <li> Good flatiron and great shipping. I had the electronic display previously but this one works just as well and at a lower price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron, does not pull on my hair and leaves my hair looking great</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Exceeded our expectations.</li>
    <li> My fine, long hair straightens fast and looks smooth and glossy.  This iron heats up really quickly and the ability to adjust the temperature is essential.  The travel bag is a nice addition.  it&#x27;s not too heavy either.  I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon. This flat iron is way too great for the price that I paid for. Came with a beautiful red pouch, gloves, and a trial size Argan Oil. The tourmaline plates makes my hair so soft and shiny! The flat iron is very easy to use and well designed. The swivel cord is convenient. I&#x27;m so, so, so, so, so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great on my thick unmanageable hair!!</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Function as what I expected.</li>
    <li> Good product straightens very well</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Love the temperature control feature and the bonus argan oil!</li>
    <li> For my grand daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews and price.  It came well packaged with a glove and oil.  The power/temp light stopped working after about 3 months. The controls are in between the blades and hard to see and adjust with the light on and without the light almost impossible to see to adjust.  I have slightly wavy hair and the blades seem to pull and snag my hair a lot.  The handles get very hot which is why you get the glove I guess. I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My hair never looked better.  This flat iron is amazing.  Love it and the price was incredible.  So worth the money.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to take to Europe.  I like that it has the dual voltage and that&#x27;s the whole reason I purchased it.  It&#x27;s not as good as my Chi, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be since the price was so reasonable.  Fast shipping and product came as advertised so I do appreciate that - thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have used so far. I bought 2 on the hope that it would be sufficient but it has exceeded my expectations. The second one is a gift for my daughter who has also fallen in love with it.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this hot iron I just purchased and I give it a five. I saw this at Amazon on line and I was excited because I had an old one and just looked like the same as this and worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time was 2 days earlier than promised. thank you and we can do business with you again in the future!</li>
    <li> Works much better and faster than my CHI - Best buy for the price.  My hair still won&#x27;t get as flat as I would like it....maybe my hair just refuses...</li>
    <li> Amazing, I have very curly hair and this works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Just received my new flat iron from HSI. I was skeptical about it first, but.. The more I kept playing with the more I realized it&#x27;s the best thing for my hair I have ever spent money on!!! The curls the straightness is phenomenal. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I had a friend over to try it out a few nights ago and she fell in love. I will proudly give you a 100% positive recommendation!!! Thank you for this product!!!</li>
    <li> Its not as good as I expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not like I was totally blown away. But it&#x27;s a hair straightener, and it work. Excellent seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a great product!</li>
    <li> Not sure what people think is a good or consider a great flat iron to be, but this was horrible, I read the reviews before buying and they were good, so I gave it a try....my hair was breaking off...the only good thing was It did get hot fast.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair which can be impossible! I can give you a weather report by what my hair looks like in the morning! I needed a flat iron for travel. The one for home use was so expensive and didn&#x27;t want to spend as much just for keeping in my suitcase. The price is so low that I didn&#x27;t expect great results! Was I wrong! It is amazing! And I don&#x27;t have to use it every day!</li>
    <li> Used it twice....so far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year, but just decided to review it now... The product works great and I use it a few times a month.  Heats evenly and doesn&#x27;t cool while in use.  Like others have said, the grooves on the handle are a bit uncomfortable on your hands, but I only use it for ten minutes or so, so I don&#x27;t mind.  What upsets me is that I was using it the other day and a chunk of ceramic on the edge just broke off.  For no reason.  I am not rough on my stuff, and I hand&#x27;t dropped it or anything, it just fell off.  Haven&#x27;t tried to use it again since to see if it would still work.  Enjoyed it while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Great product exceed my expectations! Very quick shipping and item came as described! So worthy it and a great deal!!!:)</li>
    <li> Great straightener for a great price. Received quickly too.</li>
    <li> Superb product.  Great price for the high quality and shipping was quick and dependable.  I&#x27;d buy from this seller again for sure.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly and straightens my wavy hair</li>
    <li> Very surprised. I am so happy with this product. The glove is awesome. I normally don&#x27;t like my hair straight, but where I live now after using this straightener my hair is much more manageable and I keep it done all week and re-curl as much as I need to. I still love my big curly hair and prefer it to straight her, but this Iron was more then worth the price. Even on days when I wear braids, workout and just straighten my bangs, I am very pleased with the purchase. I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly hair. It goes down to end of back. I can straighten my hair in 45min. Curly touch ups and all.</li>
    <li> This is an update from my original 4 star review..I was asked to give a good review in exchange for this free straightener that i purchased prior. I gave an honest 4 star review. They sent me the second one at no charge. The orig purchase was in 2014. The one i purchased, quit working this past weekend, (which i believe it should last longer than 3 years) so i got the free one out, never opened the sash prior, never used it. It was stored in my linen closet, still in the box. I used it for the first time this morning, pulled the plug out by the base and the whole thing crumbled in my hand, pieces went everywhere, springs flying, small metal pieces down the drain. The worst part is, half the base was still plugged in, I couldn&#x27;t grasp it since it crumbled apart, there was exposed metal sticking out so i had to shut off my circuit breaker to pull the thing out.&lt;br /&gt;What the heck is that about!! So dangerous, very disappointed! Updated on 8/7/17</li>
    <li> The straightener is meeting my expectations. Its the perfect size for me, heats up quickly and straightens my hair without pulling too  much. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Working good !!! I recommend</li>
    <li> Works very well I have very curly frizzy hair. Excellent price. Was supposed to get a sample of argon oil for hair didn&#x27;t get it wasn&#x27;t included :( I was disappointed. I would recommend it I really like it and use it frequently.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as powerful as anticipated</li>
    <li> Bought it for Christmas for my daughter in law and it quit working after only 4 months of use.  Too expensive for it to only last 4 months. Not happy</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a Chi and returned it after only 2 uses. I was so disappointed! I saw this one online and thought I would give it a try for the price. I LOVE it! It straightens my hair so well and works great. I would highly recommend and actually have already to a few friends. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this iron and especially for the price! Although if I knew how well it worked, I would have paid more anyway.</li>
    <li> Hope it&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s a Christmas present!</li>
    <li> It works well and comes with a travel pouch. It&#x27;s large enough to use all the time. The sample of argon oil is great.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It&#x27;s better than my Chi, heats up faster, gets hotter, and straightens really well. It lasts all day on my super long hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the quality of the product</li>
    <li> Very good straightener, My wife loved it from the first time she used it.</li>
    <li> This review is based on African-American / black hair, think 4c texture.    Recently went natural and purchased this flat iron bc although I do not get perms I wanted to make my hair straight on occasion (or when wearing extensions).    The 1st weeks I bought the hsi flat iron I was in love. It left my hair not only super straight but gave it a beautiful silky shine....welp everything that looks good is NOT good for u.    Almost a month after use (about 2-3 times a week) I noticed the changes in my hair..... it stayed straight longer and became thinner. I guess being in denial I continued to use it just LESS, at a lower temperature, and this time with heat protecter hoping maybe it was all in my head or due to something else. I loved my easy silky shine.    3 months later, my hair sheds like a cat, lost its thickness and body, and my edges are so thin. :( I mean I can&#x27;t even run a comb through my hair once without losing tons of strands. The damage is so bad I&#x27;m thinking about cutting it.     I did my research before purchasing and thought I found a great product, I was so WRONG it is far too strong and damaging... if you have BLACK HAIR I suggest you NOT buy or use this product, that is unless you wanna be the girl with no edges.     You may look like a million bucks for a few weeks but it is NOT worth the permanent damage... now I&#x27;m off to fix this mess.</li>
    <li> Not as hot as my old one.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and this flat iron works well for the price,  heats up fast too</li>
    <li> Great product. Great ptice snd fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s really hot, really quick, and straightens my hair in no time! So far, so good!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  I bought one for myself and my 17 year old daughter stole it.  I bought another on for me.....works great, gets hot fast.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that this iron advertises the ability to curl hair as well. I looked at the images and was thinking it would have a heat panel on the side of the iron as well for curling. No such luck.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Received in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a gift. Loved it.</li>
    <li> Works as well as my old, but much more expensive flat iron.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  Plus it&#x27;s half the price of her previous CHI</li>
    <li> Similar to my chi ! Loved my chi more because it was digital</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my trip abroad especially because it was the worldwide edition that can stand 110V-220V. It came in just in time for my trip. However, I just tried to use it (with a converter just in case) and it didn&#x27;t get hot AT ALL. I could even touch the iron plates with my fingers since it was only slightly warm. I will be abroad for a month so I have no idea how I can even return it to get my money back in time. Now I have to spend even more money to buy one here. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one or not since the majority of the people gave it great reviews. I really wanted to like this straightener so hopefully, I will be able to get a replacement once I&#x27;m back in the States. Now I need to think about how to contact them while I am abroad. I&#x27;m sure this straightener is great. It seems like most people who gave this bad reviews were the unlucky ones that received defective ones.</li>
    <li> Not very good straightener. Takes lot of time to get hot and I have to keep it on maximum temp setting to get little straight hairs. I have to go through each section of my hair 4-5 times to get it little straight. If I keep it on medium temp setting does not do good work. I have normal Asian hairs. Not very thick and not very thin.  I will never recommend this hair straightener.</li>
    <li> Was not pleased with this product. Does not straighten your hair that good. Would not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have had this straightener a long time ago! One thing about the design of this straightener that&#x27;s awesome is that your  fingers will never accidentally hit the \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; button or change the temperature settings. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was given this as a Christmas present and I thought it was going to be a great product. I was wrong, it gets extremely too hot and after a few months it left my hair so badly heat damaged, the only way to make my hair look normal again is to straighten it or cut it constantly.</li>
    <li> Works really great! Love it ! I received it super fast too.Others seem to dry out my hair but not this one.</li>
    <li> Wife only used once cause it was pulling her hair. Not sure if I just got a bad one or not.</li>
    <li> After days of comparing straighteners on performance and price, I finally decided on this HSI. I used to have a CHI but it needed to be replaced. I like that you can control the tempature setting and it heats up fast, the red light on it turns green when it reaches the desired tempature. My hair doesn&#x27;t get caught on the edge of the plates, the outside material doesn&#x27;t get too hot to touch so I can hold it from both ends.  The cord swivels as you move it so the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled. My hair is wavy frizzy and it doesn&#x27;t take long to smooth it out, my hairs looks shiny and it doesn&#x27;t leave a burn smell. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase, the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> If I can use this on my super-curly hair and have great results, anyone can. Amazing results, almost like in the salon. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this straightener for me to replace a 6 year old ceramic straightener. I believe it was a mid grade item at the time. Anyway, I ordered this because it was on sale as a lightning deal, and hoped it would be an upgrade from my hair tugging old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I want to say I have naturally curly hair, just below my shoulders, medium thickness, and I do not color it. So, it is a pain to straighten, but is healthy overall. The HSI came with a nice storage pouch, and a glove. The oil sample was supposed to come with my product, but did not. The item has a nice weight to it, and the controls are easy enough. When I turn it on, it heats up quickly (has a red light that turns green when ready).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I found that the HSI got hot, but did not stay hot. I think that I straigtened my hair with the light red the whole time, simply because every swipe I did lost the heat it had stored. I had to make quite a few swipes to each section to straighten my hair, and I felt it was staticky afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this item at night before bed, and I noticed that it did not hold its the flatness after bed that night (I may toss and turn alot, but my hair shouldn&#x27;t be curly again in the morning). I re-straightened it in the morning, and it held it ok until later in the day. I did not notice any crazy amount of hair-pulling with this, but a few strands did get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I guess it works, but I don&#x27;t think I will keep it. The heat loss alone makes me dissatisfied. What good is a temperature control dial if it doesn&#x27;t maintain it&#x27;s temperature. Even though it is a decent deal price wise, I would rather buy an iron that I can use long term and be happy with. I believe I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> I have bought a wigo straightner twice in a row but after it broke the second time in 4 years I decided to switch it up. The reviews for this straightner were very high but after a couple uses I am not impressed and wish I bought the straightner that I have purchased in the past. This one does not allow me to curl my hair that well and a couple hours after straightening it my hair is wavy again. I have thin hair so I have never had a porblem with straightners until now. Would recommend buying a Wigo compared to this one.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I saw the deal on this flatiron. $39.99 for $299.99 flatiron? I have always used cheap flatirons that never really worked.  I did some research on the HSI flatiron and the only negative people could say about it was that there is no automatic shut off...which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this flatiron!  It works so good on my hair.  I so happy I bought this flatiron.  It is amazing!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I was not thinking when I decided to cut my hair short for summer. I figured it would be easy and perfect for the warmer weather. Who knew it takes so much more work to keep short hair looking decent?! As I was lamenting to one of my girlfriends, she told me she swore by this flat iron (I had been trying to get the weird waves out of my hair with a curling iron- omg, I know, right? I was a mess). Bought this and haven&#x27;t looked back. Heats up super fast, and leaves my hair straight and shiny looking. I use it everyday now!</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t even work? Ii just got it and it broke? Like what? I&#x27;m so mad right not why would you bring me a broken why?</li>
    <li> I just bought this flat iron about a week ago.  It arrived within two days.  It heats up very fast and seems to work as well as the professional flat iron my hair stylist uses.  It easily glides through my hair to straighten. I have noticed a huge difference in the texture and shine of my hair after using this flat iron versus my old one.  I do think the original price indicated is a bit off; but for under $50, it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Hair Straightener. It was just as described and works beautifully. It&#x27;s such a good deal that I am trying to get my daughters to buy one too!</li>
    <li> So happy with my purchase. Received quickly and it was received as presented. Works great and fast in flattening my hair. I have thick, curly hair and have had difficulties in the past straightening my hair. No worries with this flat iron. Quick and easy and the product is of good quality.</li>
    <li> great flat iron considering the price, although i wish there was a higher temperature setting for my hair. comes with heat-resistant glove and argan oil.</li>
    <li> I have never tried flat irons in my life and I believe that this product has saved my life.  I have always had my hair in curls created with hair gel due to the humidity in Florida.  I now use this iron and my hair remains frizz free and soft looking for many days.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I received the straighter on time and it works amazing!! I am glad I opted not to go with the chi, this works just as good if not better!</li>
    <li> I heard about this straightener a while ago and go it at a cheap price. It heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny,silky and smooth!But the argon oil bottle is so tiny so  i might buy another because it works soo well!</li>
    <li> I bought my first HSI 4 or 5 years ago at a kiosk in a local mall. The sales man/hairstyler told me he had the most amazing product on sale at $90, half off of its real value.  I was impressed with the product demo on my hair but wasn&#x27;t convinced that it was worth $180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out it was worth $180 or more. Shortly after my first purchase of HSI straightener I watched a beauty guru raving about her $200 hair straightener on YouTube. My straightener had everything hers had. It worked faithfully for about 5 years. One day it died with a spark. The cable on the straightener end was burnt and the copper wires were exposed. I was sad but pleasantly surprised to find an updated HSI at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major differences between the older model and the newer one are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. The newer cable is softer and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.&lt;br /&gt; 2. The maximum temperature is now 410 (the older model had 400)&lt;br /&gt; 3. Black ceramic plate instead of beige plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener works beautifully and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. I highly recommend this product to anybody who&#x27;s looking for a decent hair straightener.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase shipped fast and very inexpensive. I had a Chi for 6 years and this flat iron is very comparable and maybe even better. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Recently, my flat iron of 7 years finally kicked the bucket.  I was really impressed with how many positive reviews the HSI flat iron had, especially for the price.  I decided to purchase one and have not been disappointed!  It heats up quickly and my hair actually stays incredibly straight, even on humid, damp days.  I haven&#x27;t tried the sample oil it comes with but I can definitely vouch that the HSI&#x27;s positive reviews are very legitimate.</li>
    <li> I tried it once in mall but I didn&#x27;t buy it because the price was too high. With the promotion price it is a super great deal. This product is awesome! Heated fast, and simple to use.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST most inexpensive flat iron I have EVER owened. I have had the cheapest to the most expensive &amp; this is the VERY BEST of them all. I got it super quick and it works great. I just used it for the first time on my VERY coarse natural hair and I am SUPER impressed. I didn&#x27;t have it on high and it straightened my hair on the first pull through. I&#x27;m about to purchase another one in case it goes up from all the great reviews, and just to have another one whenever this one goes out! I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!! I also used it with the steam iron that cost 3 times as much and couldn&#x27;t do half of what this iron did!!!!!!! ITS SIMPLY THE BEST, especially for the price. Way better than my peace of crap, chi, fhi &amp; gold n hot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently ordered this HSI flat iron a couple days ago and i&#x27;m already loving it. Because i&#x27;m cheap, (haha..) I used the SUPER savings option which made the shipping go from 3-5 days to 5-8 days. I expected it to arrive pretty late but the seller was quick in shipping &amp; delivery. It came much earlier than the estimated arrival date which was a big plus. This HSI iron comes with everything mentioned + a glove with no extra charge. The pouch is really nice and soft. I have yet to use the argon oil, but judging from the other comments, it seems to be pretty effective. I also love the heat up. It&#x27;s extremely fast. At first, I wondered how I would be able to tell when it would be ready because the indicator slightly blends in with the rest of the iron. After examining it, I found out it&#x27;s there. Ohh right, the cost. For only $40, this flat iron is extremely affordable. The cost does not match the function of this product. Overall, this is a fantastic deal &amp; I have recommended it to many friends already.</li>
    <li> Good luck finding an iron that does as good of a job as this one and for the same price or less. This iron is in the same league as Paul Mitchell, FHI, and CHI but can&#x27;t be beat for the price. I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: Don&#x27;t put the heat up too high if you have thin/medium hair.</li>
    <li> Does not compare to the Chi. It pulls my hair out and no matter what I do it causes my hair to be frizzy. Cannot use to curl from it pulling the hair.</li>
    <li> The red bag it is shipped in so so pretty.  Comes with a tiny bottle of stuff for your hair.  Even has glove!</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI to replace my Revlon that had gotten old and caked with hair product (whoops!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a \\&quot;middle of the road priced straightener at Walmart or Target\\&quot; kind of girl, but as an avid Amazon shopper, I decided to see what I could find here! I read and re-read all the reviews and got really excited about this straightener. I have fine, just past the shoulder length hair with choppy layers that I flip out. It tends to be pretty manageable and stay how I style it (when it&#x27;s NOT humid), but since it&#x27;s naturally an uncontrolled wavy, I straighten it almost daily. Because of the daily use I decided to bite the bullet and fork over $50 and it was well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up nice and fast and has the ability to change the temperature. I have never had a straightener slide so smoothly over my hair and it leaves my hair frizz-free, smooth, and shiny. I absolutely love how long the cord is and it never tangles. The only reason I took off a star is because to get my hair to flip out just how I like it, I have to pass the straightener over several times (this could also be attributed to the humidity, so check back when winter is in full swing). I could also increase the heat, but am afraid to do so just because my hair is so fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a product that is VERY WORTHY of spending a little more $$ on than what you usually do- especially if you&#x27;re a daily hair straightener like me!</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner.  I have used it only a couple of times so far, but have been very happy with it.  It heats up quickly and provides great results.</li>
    <li> I bought this review about 10 months ago from amazon.  I was very impressed with how fast it was shipped out to me and the packaging was perfect.  The product comes with a carrying case and a very nice glove that is useful when touching the hot hair.  I loved this product from the minute I used it.  I was happy that I bought it based on the user comments and it was a great deal for the purchase price.  I ended up breaking it because it fell from my vanity to the wood floor below and broke, however I wasn&#x27;t disappointed because it falls a lot of the same desk all the time and must have fallen maybe 5,000 times before finally breaking the one time.  I ordered the same product again from amazon and and still using it just as impressed as with the first one. I have thick natural african american hair and this straighter gets the job done and faster than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I previously had a chi, it was amazing. My dog chewed it and I needed to get a new iron. The chi I had runs about $100. This iron is just as good, maybe better because it heats up quickly.  The oil it comes with ia amazing too. It smoothes my hair with one pass. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the case. It has no place for the cord. But for that price it&#x27;s still an amazing deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe this summer and this flat iron worked perfectly in Italy and Greece - all that was necessary was a simple adaptor. There is no switch to change the voltage; the flat iron converts the voltage automatically, which kind of confused me at first, as the product instructions are very vague. My teenage daughter loved it as well - just plug it in and go! Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For no reason, the iron just stopped heating up - wasn&#x27;t dropped, or damaged in any way (that I know of). Shouldn&#x27;t have this kind of failure for an iron that&#x27;s 9 months old. I contacted the company, HSI, through their website, and got an email back promptly with troubleshooting tips. When those didn&#x27;t work, the rep said to ship it back, and they&#x27;d send me a new one. I had to pay about $5 for priority mail shipping, but wanted to make sure it got there. HSI shipped a new flat iron out to me about a week or so later, which is awesome, because I&#x27;m headed to Paris next week!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product, and a good company that stands behind its product!! Still highly highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I bought a babyliss 2in straightener a few years ago and have loved it but now need smaller one.  Have gone through 3 that were $50 or less in the last year.  They have all been terrible pulling hair out, making it frizzy, and just not working with my course wavy hair.  I decided to buy this straightener after reading excellent reviews and it was on sale.  Let me tell you, this has changed my life!  Works amazing!  And came with some argan oil....my hair has never felt so soft!  Trust me, you have to have this product!</li>
    <li> I have always used the same brand of straightener (I&#x27;m on my 3rd), but I was willing to try it after reading the reviews. But now the price just increased by $30. Quite a mark up.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this flat iron.  It seems to be very well made.  Heats up quickly.  Comes with glove.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I would recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product, much less money than my previous Chi. Easy to hold and does exactly what you expect. Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> The HSI Ionic Flat Iron heats up quickly.  It has a dial to adjust the heat to your hair&#x27;s thickness.  I have thin but damaged hair so I can set it pretty high.  It works quickly and one pass through works.  My hair turns out straight and soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Chi and decided to try this iron. Really like it. It is nice that it has a heat control on the handle. Very light weight</li>
    <li> To straighten my hair it does fine.  But I wanted this product to help give my hair body with curls.  I have used similar products and have had fantastic results with curls.  This one just leaves my hair limp.  Also my daughter has thick hair and it barely leaves a wave.  So, not happy with this purchase. But I did receive it quickly.</li>
    <li> It is very lightweight and works well.  The only minor that I have with the product is that it doesnt have a clasp to hold the straightener together.  I was used to my previous straightener where there was a prong to hold the straightener together while it&#x27;s on; however, it&#x27;s a minor issue and something that I have to get to used to.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. It is designed perfectly for all hair types. It gets very hot, for thick hard to style hair. Great product and will recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This iron is well made and sturdy. I can straighten or curl my hair with the iron. My daughter also likes the iron. Can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality. Recommended!</li>
    <li> By far the best flat iron I ever owned and I have had more expensive ones. HSI heats up quickly thus you are able to use it right away. My hair is naturally frizzy curly but this styling tool makes my hair so manageable, soft and shiny, I highly recommend HSI. I love it so much and I&#x27;m sure others will to.</li>
    <li> I have been using irons to straighten my hair for 12 years, my hair is curly, long and course. This iron works on my hair air dryed over night, it is able to make it sleek without frying. Non snagging on the hair as well. I am pleased with this purchase. I have had a CHI, a Remington and other smaller name generic irons; to compare this is just as good as CHI for less $$.</li>
    <li> The product got in perfect shape, in the time that the company said that would get. It is really good and I am glad that I chose this store.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my wife as a birthday gift. I figured she would just like it, but after she actually used it, she loves it. Shipping was very fast, I am impressed ! !</li>
    <li> This straightener is great because it allowed me to have straight hair in little time. I have naturally wavy hair that is super thick, and this product works great. I love the degree settings, the velvet-like case, and the fast shipping. I loved Amazon&#x27;s price-$42 with shipping. I believed this item originally retailed for $299. It is definitely salon quality, so I feel like I got a great deal- and a great product.</li>
    <li> Received the flat iron in two days, definitely the best one I&#x27;ve bad thus far. Leaves my frizzy, hard to manage hair silky and oh so soft!</li>
    <li> Other then the fact it came on time, which is always a plus, I have nothing negative to say about it so far! Just used for the first time and it did an amazing job! Nice touch by the way with the red silk cover and glove. Lets just say that for the past ten years of straightening my hair, i have replaced my CHi 5 times-thats every 2 years!! They just randomly die. Honestly for 39.99 I&#x27;m shocked it could be this good..but worth it so far and I debated this for quite some time.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT!!!  I had never used one before and this one is easy and works just GREAT!!!  The description isn&#x27;t totally accurate because it doesn&#x27;t say just how easy and well this works...I love my haircut now:)</li>
    <li> I decided to give the HSI flat iron a try after my CHI died on me. Considering how inexpensive the HSI flat iron was, I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes for it. I figured it would, at the very least, be a temporary solution until I was ready to shell out the money for a new CHI. I was pleasantly surprised! The HSI flat iron surpassed my expectations, making my curly, frizzy hair appear much smoother than it did when I used the CHI. I highly recommend this flat iron!!</li>
    <li> For some reason, this isn&#x27;t working for me.  I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair, and it is wavy, not curly.  Have a natural wave in the back, which I wanted to straighten.  Just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I am going to get my hair cut, and try again.  Hopefully it will work with shorter hair?</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple a months ago for my daugther. She needed to replace her chi.THis iron works as good. Recomended and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, let alone lengthy ones. I also am not easily persuaded by reviews either. I felt compelled to write a review about this product. Let me start off by saying I have been a proud Paul Mitchell owner for about 8 years. I am kicking myself for paying 100+ for this iron. I am an African American with transitioning hair and let me tell you.......this thing is the BEST, one pass and my hair was straight. I went over it a second time just because of habit and disbelief I think. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair first. She is all natural 3A I would guess. This thing made small work of all those curls in half the time. It straighten with ease no snags and the next day after a misty rain she is still in good shape. I don&#x27;t even think I will have to flat iron my hair again until I wash it. This iron is just that good. Normally after a washing my daughters hair will still be straight without product but will have a little frizz. This time no product or frizz. My hair on the other hand HAS to have a go over every two or three days especially for my bangs if I have not gone to the hairdresser for a professional pressing. This time I can&#x27;t tell I haven&#x27;t been to my stylist. My hair has movement and is shiny. I just can&#x27;t say enough. I can get all my roots. I think I may just call this a \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; this time because if this thing performs this well on my 12 week post hair, I am curious to see what it does on freshly relaxed hair. I won&#x27;t need to go to the stylist every week. I can go only for relaxers and do my washes at home. I almost forgot to mention that mine did come with the glove, argon oil and red pouch. I will be buying these as gifts for my friends that loved to borrow my PM.</li>
    <li> I received the item fast! It works great! I have a CHI and it works ok but I noticed my hair was not staying straight. I decided to get another straightener and found this one!!! Awesome !! Especially for the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever brought!! I even do my daughters hair and mine with no problems at all!! I would recommend this product to everybody!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Until two weeks ago when I went into my hairdresser looking like I had just flown out of a helicopter, I had no idea what a flat iron was!  I am growing my hair out from being very short, so that it will cover my ears.  It is really curly and I was looking wild.  My hairdresser showed me her flat iron and recommended I get one.  Well, have you ever looked at advertisements for such a product?  There are at least 25 different brands and they all promise something extraordinary.  I am so happy with my HSI ceramic flat iron.  One reason is that it is only one inch wide, which helps me control it - the wide ones would pull up too much hair.  The weight distribution makes it easy to handle.  The best part is the heating element.  It can be turned up so that it is really hot, but with my fine hair, the middle setting is just perfect.  It heats up instantly when it is plugged in.  I also LOVE the bright red soft carry bag that is included, and the Argan oil was a special treat too.  Thank you, HSI, for a fine product.  As usual when I purchase something through Amazon.com, the service was immediate, and the product was more than promised.</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. And I love the price! I can&#x27;t believe what a deal I got on such a great product. My daughter loves the HSI Argan Oil that came with the iron. Plus I received a bag for the iron and a glove to wear while using the iron. Thanks for an unbelieveable product and price!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product! My friends all have Chi&#x27;s and i was going to get one as well but I am glad I made this purchase due to the fact that I feel it is just as good if not better than a Chi. The product heated up in app. 30 seconds my friend was that has a Chi was amazed at how fast it heated up compared to her Chi. Overall this was definitely a GREAT buy with an affordable price!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is absolutely great! I have thick hair and I&#x27;m trying to stretch the time between my retouches and this flat iron makes my hair feel so silky and straight. It gets hot fast and leaves my hair so silky in one pass. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> If you have ever owned a good high quality flat iron, you will HATE this flat iron. If all you&#x27;ve owned are flat irons from Walmart, then this might be a step up. I was suckered in by all the good reviews. People, this flat iron is crap. You get what you pay for. It doesn&#x27;t glide through the hair smoothly at all. It catches hairs and rips them out and breaks them off. It leaves hair feeling dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay the money and save your hair. It&#x27;s the only head of hair you&#x27;ve got. Treat it kindly. Spend the money and buy a good trusted brand (like Paul Brown for example). Or invest in a high quality ionic flat iron that actually conditions your hair as it straightens.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron, so I&#x27;m not really able to compare how it works with other flat irons. However, I can say that it works very well. It has variable heat control up to 400 degrees, so that it will work on all different hair types. The ceramic plates heat up quickly (less than a minute for the lower temps, which are what I use), and the handle and outside surfaces of the iron remain cool. I really like that the cord swivels 360 degrees so that it doesn&#x27;t get twisted or caught when you use the iron. Also, the flat iron comes with a glove to protect your hand and a sample of argan oil. Of course, you can&#x27;t beat the price either. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> We bought this product and had high expectations because of the many glowing reviews.  I would not say that it worked any better than the $20 straightener that I had had for years and is still working well.  But, this morning, I heard a POP! and it is no longer turning on.  I have had this product for about 6 weeks, and of course, it is past the return window, so unless the company will allow me to return this, then it was a big waste of money.  I will update if I have any success.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and have been using flat irons for about 10 years. My $100 iron recently broke and I started looking for a replacement.  I was skeptical on how well a flat iron at this price would work, but I read the good reviews and decided to give it a try. With as curly as my hair is, I always have to set an iron at the hottest heat level, but with this iron, the hottest level actually levels my hair too straight. (I like to leave some volume in my hair.) I&#x27;ve never had that type of problem before, the hottest level usually barely does the trick. It&#x27;s great to be able to have such a range of powerful heat levels to control how straight I want my hair. Plus, I always wondered how some people with naturally textured hair get it so shiny after straightening it with heat, which normally damages the hair and leaves it on the dull and dry side. This product made me realize it has to do with the quality of the flat iron. This flat iron definitely delivers, surpasses my expectations, and gives me the freedom to style my hair in a lot of different ways.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this flat iron! Works great and is an awesome price! I loved so much I bought 3 other&#x27;s for gifts. After a month or two, I started to notice a smell ONLY when I would straighten my hair. I ran myself crazy trying different shampoos to no avail. I asked my husband to smell my hair and he said it smelled like burnt hair. It dawned on me that the flat iron somehow was so hot it was burning my hair and leaving an odor. I&#x27;ve never had this with my other high end flat irons so it was the farthest thing from my mind. Unfortunately, this smell was driving me too crazy to use anymore and I&#x27;m back to using my Paul Mitchell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product at the end of August of this year and had great results with my hair...until today. I went to turn it on and nothing happened. I pressed the reset button and it didn&#x27;t click like it should have. I put it in a different plug-in with the same results. I am incredibly dissappointed in this product- it only lasted 2 months! I&#x27;m in the process of contacting the seller right now for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron from Blue Novelties, fulfilled by Amazon. Great customer services...now to the product, it works wonderfully. It leaves my hair shinny and looking healthy, some other flat irons I owned made me look like Lion King. It heats fairly quick and even though the plates are narrow you can handle it with no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this flat iron for two months now and judging by results I would definitely recommend it to all the girls out there that sometimes need a little help with straightening out wild curls. My best flat iron so far. *.*</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6440f6720dd6eb15cc61e752f00767c1]] [[VIDEOID:mo2VWCVZLD5FYDQ]]My wife decided that she wanted a flat iron hair straightener and she thought this model looked the best.  When she got it and used it for the first time she was very excited.  It was easy to use and she got professional results doing it herself.  I have included a video on the product and show the before and after results on her hair.  (Please don&#x27;t make fun of her before hair photo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife used the temperature setting between 2/3 and 3/4 of fully turned on all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model has some very good features and it really is a high quality product.  Just a couple of issues you should be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you plug in the flat iron and it will not come on, press the reset switch on the cord circuit breaker to reset it.&lt;br /&gt;2. The unit does not have an automatic shut off timer so make sure you turn it off or unplug it.  If you have children I would unplug it and store it properly away after it was cooled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take the time to watch the video and I hope it is of benefit to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat iron included accessories:&lt;br /&gt;* Nice traveling bag&lt;br /&gt;* Flat iron&lt;br /&gt;* Heat glove&lt;br /&gt;* User instruction manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Features:&lt;br /&gt;* Adjustable temperature from 140° to 410° F to suit your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;* Smooth ceramic plates that easily slide through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;* 1 inch wide plates to work with any hair type and style and also allow you to straighten your bangs.&lt;br /&gt;* Power cord is 7 feet long with built in circuit breaker&lt;br /&gt;* On/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;* Heat indicating LED light.&lt;br /&gt;* Fast and easy to use with professional results.&lt;br /&gt;* Comes with protective heat glove if you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;* Swivel power cord to eliminate the power cord from twisting.&lt;br /&gt;* Operates on 110 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product and deserves a 5 Star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, after all of this time the flat iron is still working perfectly.ing perfectly.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this straightener. It is not too big so it fits their hands nicely. And it has an adjustable heat control which is nice because my daughters have very different types of hair. But it works great for each of them individually. Came with the heat glove too and nice storage bag which was a bonus. Happy with this purchase...and we got it at a great price.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter after her Chi ($100) stopped working after 8 months.  This works better for her than the Chi and she has very thick wavy hair.  It also comes with oil that she likes as well as a heat glove.  It is really professional quality at a great price.  I just ordered one for myself as well.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase for me. It arrived promptly. I was looking for a flat iron that did not cause static in my hair. This flat iron leaves my thick hair silky smooth and I love it. I use it with the Argon oil which I purchased locally for less and it works great and smells wonderful (the oil). I would definitely reccomend this Flat iron for a great hair styling tool.</li>
    <li> I, like the others, have never heard of this brand. However, I&#x27;m glad I decided to make the purchase. This flat iron is made of very high quality...very sturdy and it gets pretty hot. Also, it arrived very quick and I love the heat protector bag! Thank you!! Aand, they have great customer service. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. You won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
    <li> BEST Flat iron I ever owned! Heats up quick! Long lasting results! Worth every penny! My hair stylist uses the Runway FHI and this works just as good in my opinion and costs much less</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron and the price was GREAT!  I have been looking for a new flat iron for a long time and this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I am new to the Hair Straightner business. I have just let my hair grow long enough to use a Hair Straightner. I read all the reviews of this and many other straightners, this certainly lives up to it&#x27;s great reviews! It was shipped quickly and works just as described! I am very pleased with this straightner especially the price!! Do not hesitate to purchase this straightner!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the rave reviews and the low price. I figured at that low price, it was worth a shot. But I now see it offered for several different prices, which I find fishy. I also think all these new reviews are suspicious as well. I&#x27;m questioning how legit this company is. Anyway... I did not receive the oil that others are raving about. It came with a cheap looking glove and a red cover. The straightener itself is not all that impressive. It gets hot but after using it once, I can say that I think this is going back. I could feel my hair breaking. It doesn&#x27;t smoothly glide through my hair the way my CHI does. In my opinion, this is no better than any other $40 straightener you can buy at Target.</li>
    <li> So easy to use.  Has become my favorite hair tool.  My 14 year old granddaughter loves it.  So glad I went ahead and ordered it.  Very professional, and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I originally saw this product at a kiosk in a mall over a year ago retailing for $120. The promoter gave me a free demonstration and it worked instantly. It was quick to heat up and straightened my hair in seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have quite long coarse hair (about 30\\&quot; worth), and plenty of it! My hair is naturally wavy when its wet. Upon hearing this the promoter had wet my hair with a spray bottle and sure enough it began to wave and curl slightly. While he brushed my hair, he turned on the iron and it heated up very quickly. A couple of quick strokes and voila! straight hair! The promoter also showed me that a slower stroke would yield the same results. Amazingly, my hair was actually softer and smoother (iron must be emitting negative ions too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the nitty gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener is made of 1\\&quot; plates with a ceramic tourmaline coating, which allows the plates to glide more smoothly over hair strands and provides better heat transfer and more consistent temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron has heats ranges from 240-410 degrees fahrenheit, accommodating a wide range of hair types (coarse hair requires more heat while damaged hair requires lower temperatures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle and outer casing is made of plastic, and while less durable, gives benefits in less weight and less heat transfer, keeping the heat where it needs to be. The handle is textured providing a little more grip and is comfortable to hold and manoeuvre weighing at just over one pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is the swivel cord, which prevents tangles and twists both when you&#x27;re using it or storing it. Like all hair appliances should, the cord also has a breaker at the end to prevent huge surges that may trip your breaker and/or damage the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall so far to this product is that it does not have a auto shut off timer (I believe the Turbo model with the LCD display does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite this, it&#x27;s a great appliance for under $50 and easily beats out the others on the market! I cannot speak on durability as I&#x27;ve only had this for only a couple of months, but so far so good (cross your fingers!).</li>
    <li> The flat iron works great. Heats up fast and leave my hair shiny, smooth and soft. It does not pull my hair how my past straightner did. So far a great product!</li>
    <li> I ordered the HSI Flat Iron because I was in the hunt for a nice flat iron and with the reviews on the HSI I was excited to order it! I used it today for the first time and LOVE it. It makes my hair soft, silky and shiny. I did use the sample oil that came with it and love that as well! The girls at work can&#x27;t get over how beautiful my hair looks!! I purchased this product thru Amazon, it was simple and easy and it was delivered 2 day early. I am a Very Happy Women!!!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this straightener!  It is definitely professional salon quality.  It gets very hot quickly, and I only need to run it through my hair once to straighten it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing the price was considering the original retail price.  I love this straightener and am so glad I got it!</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I have always used my curling iron to straighten my hair, then to curl it. Boy was I missing the boat. This flat iron is perfect. I have curly, wavy, frizzy hair. This flat iron leaves my hair straight, shiny and manageable. I am amazed at how quickly it works, and I do not have to use it at its highest setting. The price was right too. I had seen so many flat irons at much higher prices which made me doubt how good this one could be, but its not always the most expensive item that is the best. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  If you have dry damaged hair like myself or very thick hair like my daughter then you need this flat iron.  We&#x27;ve used other flat irons before but this is a miracle product.  Our hair has never been so straight and shiny.  Warning though...it makes your hair extremely hot right after using the flat iron.</li>
    <li> This product heats up quickly. It straightens both my curly hair and my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair with ease. I like the red case it comes with and the adjustable heat setting. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Just received my straightener today and figured I would test it curling my hair seeing as that&#x27;s more difficult. It worked amazingly and I got many compliments. The only reason for a 4 star rather than a 5 star review is the free argon oil was completely opened and emptied all over my carrying case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great though!!! :)</li>
    <li> I originally wrote a good review, but now I have used this flatiron for almost a year and my hair is longer. This iron does not smooth out my wavy fine hair. It  leaves my hair looking ragged, bent and dull. Soon after I flat iron it it becomes poofy again. This was fine when my hair was shorter, but other irons, such as Hai is much smoother. I think this iron provides uneven heat and and the  plates are too rough.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest... GOOD! I am usually really unsure of how to respond to ads about &amp;#34; The Best Product Around!!&amp;#34;...but I have to admit that I am TRULLY satisfied with the HSI flat iron. I was at the mall and I stopped by one of those stands that sold ceramic flat irons and the guy that convinced us to stop, attempted to flat iron my daughters hair! I was skeptical because my daughter has hair down her back and it is really thick! To my surprise, those flat irons were wonderful but  he wanted to sell them to me for $200.00! I went home that night, checked on Amazon for the same brand and I came across the HSI Flat Irons. I did my research, read the reviews and finally placed my order! I love them! My only complaint is that I wish they were a little bit wider than 1&amp;#34; for women with thicker, longer hair. I have no problem recommending this product to anyone who is searching for a good quality flat iron that actually gives you the results you want!</li>
    <li> I have ZERO complaints about this flat iron.  Its quick to heat up, and cool down.  Dry or wet hair no problem.  Dropped mine on the ground a few times and it still works like a pro!</li>
    <li> I recieved my straightner right on time. It came packaged in a nice box. In the box was the straightner, a cute red silky carry case, a heat protectant glove, and a little bottle of the HSI hair oil. I read a few reviews before I bought this product and there where a few bad but over all there were more positive then negitives. I went out on a limb and tried this product, I must say this is the best straightner I ever had!! I have curly long relitively thin hair that usually starts to curl up during the day under certain weather conditions! I have not had this problem since using the HSI straightner! My hair literally stayed straight for three days without me retouching it! I was so amazed! This is a very good buy. If you go on the website (hsiprofessionals.com) this straightner is I believe $90. I would 100% recommend this item to any and every friend!! Buy you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price ensuring great customer service. Full satisfied. Recommend to everyone.5 star in customer satisfaction. The product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times and so far it is great! The company and customer service have also been great!</li>
    <li> This product far exceeded my expectation.  I love this product and it straightens my hair like no other flat iron.  If you are having problems with frizzy or curly hair and want it straight--BUY THIS PRODUCT!!  You will be glad you did.  Not only did this product leave my hair wonderfully straight but it added shine and left my hair silky soft.  It does not burn the hair but straightens it leaving it fabulously silky soft.</li>
    <li> I AM PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT, MY HAIR FEELS SILKY AND THE FLAT IRON HAS A BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN SET THE TEMPERATURE (LOW, MEDIUM OR HIGH) THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU HAIR. I HAVE A CHI IRON BUT SINCE I GOT THIS ONE...IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I HAVE BEEN USED. I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my HSI The Styler Straightener.  I have thick, wavy hair and this straightener worked wonders on my hair.  I also tried the sample HSI Argan oil that came with the product and loved that too!  My husband has been telling me how beautiful my hair looks ever since I started using this straightener.  Great price, great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> My Fiance has used hair irons for years.  I bought this as a birthday present.  Not only did she like the way if felt in her hand, she liked the styling of it.  But when she used, it made her hair straight, but softer and silkier than she thought possible.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She loves the fact it heats up in seconds and that you can due more then just straighten. A+++++</li>
    <li> I love this Flat Iron. It is lightweight and easy to use.  Professional quality.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Thanks for the quick shipping and ease of ordering.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after receiving an alert that it was on sale for $39.99. Let me start off by saying that I am a cheapskate and hate to spend money on things that are a necessity, but trying to use one straightener between myself and my teenage daughter was too much. So I decided to buy myself one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats quickly and did a fine job on my hair. My only complaint is that it does not have an auto shut-off, so I would not reccommend this for an underage users due to the potential of them leaving it on and burning the house down. With this being said, I actually have to wait for it to cool down and hide it so this doesn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, that&#x27;s why I have it 4 out of 5. And I def would not pay the retail price. I think $40 is almost on the higher end of a basic straightener such as this one.</li>
    <li> It is a great flat iron and I like it very much. I read other reviews to determine if I would purchase, and I was not disappointed. Yes I would recommend the HSI........ Thanks again.</li>
    <li> The straightener takes only a few minutes to heat up.. The serum that came with it is INCREDIBLE and makes my hair smell great and makes it super smooth. I can curl and flip my hair as I&#x27;m straightening it. I have no complaints whatsoever. Awesome awesome product &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old flatiron and could not be more pleased with it.  The heat is adjustable so I don&#x27;t fry my thin/brittle hair, and it heats up extremely quickly.  Comes with a nice satin case for storage (although the plug doesn&#x27;t fit in with it, I just wrap the cord around the case).  The rounded shape creates the perfect curl at the bottom without any dents.  Two thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Straightener for about 2 weeks now and I love it. I&#x27;ve been using a old straightener for years and didn&#x27;t know how much I hated it until I got this. The LED light and controls let me know when it&#x27;s ready. The included glove is a nice bonus and it does it&#x27;s job well. Using this has saved me about 10 minutes getting ready since I can use it faster then my old one. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is definitively a good product for it&#x27;s price, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a 5 star product. Chi is still way better quality wise, don&#x27;t make a fool out of yourselve.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener- the cord never get wrapped up when I try to use it and it heats up very quickly. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> If you get this they give you a sample of the argon oil.  That sh!t has changed my fine hair.  I love it.  I like the versatility of the iron, but don&#x27;t use it nearly as much as my curling irons (I have very limp hair- i need to add body).  I&#x27;m sure once I get the hang of it and use it more i&#x27;ll use it more often!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this strightener! Hot in seconds. Leaves brilliant results and leaves the hair shiny for days. Being a hairdresser, this is really helping me achieve the results I want and I&#x27;m getting an excellent response from all my clients! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different straighteners before and I absolutely adore this one. For the price, I can guarantee this is the BEST straightener on the market. Of course there are better straighteners out there, but they cost over $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this straightener. Mine came broken (one plate would not heart up) but Amazon (love them) sent me a new one without question!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah straight hair :3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a flat iron user for several years now. People have raved about this HSI Iron, so I decided to give it a try. I am blown away by my results. One of my biggest pluses is that my hair is very shiny, even at the end of the day. Since I started using this flat iron I can go 4 days without washing and blow drying my hair.  I have had compliments and would suggest this flat iron to anyone who wants fabulous hair.</li>
    <li> The HSI Flat Iron is the best iron I have ever owned to date. I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s really curly and this iron leaves my hair super straight and silky. I really recommend this straightening iron.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend who I ordered this straightener for lovea it. Works great leaving her hair straight and very shiny. Even the shipping was great! Very happy wirh this purchase, would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Great price but not even close to a Chi for my thick, wavy, coarse hair. Just OK but nothing special.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would choose is for the heat setting to be easier to read. Since it&#x27;s on the inside, I can&#x27;t tell which way increases. Sorry, I&#x27;m a little blind/ (wear reading glasses) The product is wonderful though. Now, as for the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; Arghan Oil, it was a tiny little packet. In the purchasing process, it was made to look as if the oil was at least a small bottle. :  (  Loved the Oil, wish it had been more. giggle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this flat iron to several friends and family.</li>
    <li> It broke within the first month i had it. It just wouldnt turn on one morning, i was so upset because i loved it. I thought about sending it back, but thats too much work, learned my lesson. Never getting one again!</li>
    <li> Love the straightener. Works really good and high temperature which helps straighten hair faster. AWESOME deal!! I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this product.  It appears to work better than all the others we have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic (says my wife)</li>
    <li> Bought it for Daughter and her Daughter they both loving it really makes hair look awesome. If I was into doing my hair up I would buy one for my self&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for a great product</li>
    <li> While this works, it definitely does not get as hot as my other hot irons that allow you to customize the temperature.</li>
    <li> I have used the chi for years and when it finally gave out on me I was not wanting to spend 100 dollars on a straightner.... I randomly found this one and thought well I&#x27;ll give it a try. I have been using it for two weeks and I love it ... Honestly better then my chi! If ur looking I would definitely try this one!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair without taking forever to straighten my hair and without overpaying...would recommend to every one who wants a good product</li>
    <li> tried at least 5 brands including this HSI, the best one is still CHI, I know it cost like $80 from TJMAXX or discount store, but totally worth it. this HSI looks like a pro and feels like pro, but when use it, doesn&#x27;t do its job, takes a hell of time and the hair still looks as bad as before, burn the hair without having any affection, same as you buy a $30 one.&lt;br /&gt;so I strongly suggest spend more money and buy CHI, only takes 10 mins to get your hair done and make huge difference.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  Smooth, sleek hair. Great for curly, thick hair or hair that is fine.  Would buy this product again</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself to try and straighten my very curly hair. It works. I don&#x27;t use it much as I decided my hair looks better curly than straight. My daughter uses it all the time though for her wavy hair. It does the job.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a straightener.  It&#x27;s compact, has numerous heat settings, and does a great job straightening my hair.  Quick and easy ordering and shipping.  Also the price was great.</li>
    <li> Still works great after having for over a year and a half. Heats up great, and straightens hair like a CHI but for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This flat iron dries out my hair and does not straighten as well as my 2 in CHI. I purchased this because my CHI was a bit large and heavy. However, after using both irons, I definitely will be sticking to my CHI. It leaves my hair shiny and smooth, not frizzy and dry like the HSI.</li>
    <li> There are three women in my household, so decent products are a must. Pros: this iron does get hot. Cons: the plate itself is short and the way it is mounted- if you do not do small amounts of hair, they will get caught as you pull hair through. Temperature gage is an awkward turn dial just a couple of cm from the heat plate. Not the brightest design move there. So basically...it takes us forever to straighten our hair, because of the small pieces that need to be done. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenager, and she likes it a lot.  It has only been used for a few weeks now, but it seems good so far--no problems with losing heat, though it does feel a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; on the hair.  This could just be the need to play with the correct temperature for the hair type. I personally still like my CHI better, but this is still a good bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Good price and good flat iron. Easy to use and to store. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love that when I&#x27;m in a hurry, I plug it in, choose the heat and it&#x27;s ready before I have time to start something else. Very practical, easy to use, easy to bring on vacation.</li>
    <li> I have been a devotee of the CHI since it started using one several years ago. I recently dropped mine and broke it and couldn&#x27;t afford another (I had broken 2 in 2 years) so I decided based on the amazonreviews to try this one. I love it! It straightens my hair quickly ans it also seems a lot sturdier than the one I had, although I will try not to drop it. I love having the travel sleeve, and to me the outside doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as the other one! Thank you for making a great product that is less than half the price of my previous one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality flat iron for my type of hair that would help get it real straight.  I watched and read reviews and decided on the HSI.  It came 2 days early and i used it right when i got home to the package.  It was packaged well and works great!!  I would recommend.  The argan oil thats with it is in a small sample package but i used some of that and its awesome!!! Ive told my friends about the flat iron.  Cant wait to use it again.  The price is great for such a great product!!!! Happy customer.  I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> Prefer my Chi to this product unfortunately. I was very excited to receive it, but I was disappointed with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I have the ability to change the temp, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t glide along my hair properly. Like, the plates are not smooth enough. I rarely use it and am currently still using my old chi.</li>
    <li> This product is great quality, works well, and as I am learning how to use it effectively, I have not been burned and haven&#x27;t had any &amp;#34;bad hair days&amp;#34;.  Thank you...I would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> This product heats of up quickly and does a very nice job of straightening hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair so most flat irons don&#x27;t have the capability to straighten my hair correctly. I heard about this product via a friend and decided to try it. It is excellent!!! I did have to pass through my hair four times but the results were excellent! I&#x27;d recommend to just about anyone!</li>
    <li> High quality straight iron. Gets very hot and a can straighten my hair in no time. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Would be given 5 stars but The heating plates don&#x27;t come together evenly.  Besides that great product.  Would buy one for niece too.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightening iron!  So affordable, heats up exceptionally fast, can adjust heat settings, cools down quick.  I cannot imagine how a straightening iron could be better!</li>
    <li> I find it Works best on the highest setting.  I have really thick wavy hair and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron in the summer of 2012. Almost exactly 2 years later a large chunk of one of the plates chipped off leaving the iron completely unusable. I use it very rarely, maybe 2 times a month for special nights and since I purchased it I have stored it in a high quality heat proof bag in its own pocket with the cord in a seperate back pocket. Very disappointed at the price I paid and how long it lasted. 2 years would be fine if I used it a lot, but I&#x27;ve probably only used it about 25 times.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Was definitely not what I expected. For paying almost $70 for this, I would think it would be a bit nicer. Doesn&#x27;t heat up like the reviews said. Took me longer to straighten my hair with this than it did with my $20 revlon one. I returned it and am buying a chi, which I know actually works. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is great!  It&#x27;s professional quality for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Thank you!  Great product.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick wavy hair. When she has tried to straighten her hair with other products it has taken an hour or more but with the HSI flat iron she can be done in 20 minutes with perfectly straight hair.</li>
    <li> I am impressed how quickly and nicely it straightens my hair. I am loving how soft and shiny and sleek my hair looks after using this flat iron. I def recommend it to anyone looking for a great flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my high school age daughter for Christmas after hers broke.  She is very, very happy with it!  She loves how fast it heats up, and how smooth it makes her hair look.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get an excellent deal on a well-reviewed straightener.  Sadly, I have not had as much luck as my fellow reviewers.  I have had this flat iron for a couple months now, and my hair has gone completely downhill.  Since using this straightener, I have more damaged split ends than I have ever had in my life.  Nothing in my routine has changed except for using this flat iron so I know it is the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I use this flat iron to curl my hair and it gives me the best waves.  It goes through my hair smoothly and I end up with perfect loose curls every time I use it.  Even though this iron has caused me damaged, I still have to give it three stars because of the price and how well it makes my hair look (besides the split ends).</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with type 4 hair (4C), and I was looking for a reasonably priced flat-iron. I get keratin treatments and wanted something that would have different heat settings and snag-free plates. I can say that the flat iron will not snag, the plates have springs so you can press down as much as you need. I was able to make curls and give my roots some volume. The glove and pouch are nice, the argan oil sample is not as pictured. I did not receive a small bottle, just a packet with enough for one use. I didn&#x27;t use it, the smell was too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a good flat iron for coarse or thick hair. The iron appears to heat up quick, but you will notice a difference as you work through your hair. The hair that I first flat-ironed quickly turned poofy, but the hair at the end of my styling session stayed sleek. I had to go back over the first half of my hair. On my second use, I kept taking 5 minute breaks to let the iron heat up, and it seems it would go hot and cold during use.  I used the same serum and oils that I always use in my hair, and this flat-iron did no better than the 4-year-old Conair flat iron I foolishly threw out when I thought I&#x27;d upgraded.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin or fine hair, this is the iron for you. If you have coarse, kinky hair, don&#x27;t use this ir</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it. In fact she has now informed me that she can never go back to any other. So it appears as if I&#x27;ll be buying more of these straighteners in my lifetime.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener for my daughter who has long, thick color-treated hair - she loves it!  It works great without damaging her hair.  She has had nothing but good things to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transaction was handled very quickly too.  So it was a win-win!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for my wife.  She kept stealing my daughter&#x27;s, and she absolutely loves it!  First thing that she packs in her suitcase now...even got her hair cut to take advantage of how well it performs.</li>
    <li> Best price anywhere. Love the fact that this has a controllable temperature. I have fine hair and would be in trouble with a flat iron that only had one temperature.</li>
    <li> For the price paid, it is good.  I have had better flat irons, but definitely paid more.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I must say I love everything about this Flat Iron. The way it looks, the way it heats up...I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t tell what temp it is on..it has a dial yes, but no numbers except for the hottest which i think is like 410 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;I put it a little lower than that. I think the only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; I have is that my hair is almost too shiny and soft :) lol&lt;br /&gt;it does the job and reminds me of how the Chi used to make my hair..straight, shiny, soft..but I need more texture so I will work on this part. I hope this iron lasts me awhile.. I did buy an Argan produced flat iron from Sally&#x27;s that the girl hyped as better than the Chi..and though it was better than my generic iron, I just wasn&#x27;t happy with my hair losing the straightness after a few hours or shorter time.. I have been inside all day today but the weather outside is brutal..by now walking around, doing housework, messing with products from Amazon :) (yay tax time) and playing on the computer should have unstraightened my hair..but its still straight !! :) great product..so far so good! I hope this is my last review for this Flat Iron :) if you get my meaning!:)</li>
    <li> Fabulous - my wife can&#x27;t stop raving about how great this is.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She tried it right away and said she loves it. I don&#x27;t believe she&#x27;s had any problems since receiving it six weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Would be nice to have larger and or relocated indicator light. Not always sure if off or on. Also, digital display would be nice bc difficult to know the temperature you are on (or at a minimum more gauges along continuum from 0-410</li>
    <li> I have purchased many straighteners in my day and this , by far, has been my favorite.  It does a great job of straightening, but more importantly it stays straight for a longer period of time.  The price is great too.  I&#x27;ve owned straighteners for over $100 that couldn&#x27;t compare with this one. So glad I purchased this HSI Professional.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She uses a flat iron hair straightener every day, so goes through them fairly rapidly. She needed a new one, so I looked for one that I believed would last a long time. She was so very excited when she opened it. Only time will tell how long it will last; however, it appears to be one that is durable and it certainly does the job! it was also a great price - I would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Bought it be coz my older flat iron died on me. Wanted to try something new. I am glad I bought this one. It heats up nice and makes my curly hair straight and shiny quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this straightening iron. It leaves my hair soft. Doesn&#x27;t really burn it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get it for me though. I got it for my mom who is a professional hair stylist and she didn&#x27;t really like it. In fact she said she hated it. Her reasons were that it didn&#x27;t heat up fast enough, didn&#x27;t get hot enough, was too bulky and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it was just mine or if everybody&#x27;s is like that but I was expecting it to heat up faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me how hot it goes is in my opinion fine. I always burn my self by accident with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even though my mom hated it, I still loved it. Enough for four stars. :)</li>
    <li> This product met all my expectations. I&#x27;d recommend it to others. I love how my hair looks when I use it!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on what is the best flat iron and comparing them to the steam flat irons (which are expensive) I settled on this flat iron. This was a gift for my niece who is, and I don&#x27;t blame her, dazzled by the kiosk sales people at the mall. They were trying to convince her to purchase the $200 + model steam iron, which after reading reviews about them, both low and high end, the ceramic performs just as good at a fraction of the price. Not to mention, styling your hair day after day, even with the steam iron&#x27;s, are still damaging to one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;She is still disappointed that this isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;mall awesome steam iron&amp;#34; but it still performs just as good and again, at the fraction of the price. With the money I saved, I decided to order some hair product to go along styling her hair for added protection.</li>
    <li> the plates do not get as hot as the advertisement claims.  cools down quickly as i&#x27;m straightening my hair.  does not stay hot.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and had been using a Hot Tools straightener for years (until the cord broke). I was hesitant to switch brands but this one was such a good price and had great reviews so I went for it and am so glad I did! It heats up literally in seconds and gets very hot but is also adjustable to be much cooler. I was able to get closer to my scalp than with previous straighteners and it made my hair super straight and smooth. I am also loving the argan oil sample and will definitely be buying more. I use a few drops before blowdrying and again after straightening and it makes my hair glossy but not greasy and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to take with me to Europe. I used it in Sweden and in Scotland. It has an integrated dual voltage. The only converter you need is one to make the plug fit into the European outlets, which differ depending on which country you are visiting. The iron heated up quickly and did a nice job on my hair. I love the swiveling cord so you can rotate the iron without the cord getting tangled. The iron is smooth and easy to run through the hair. Nice product!</li>
    <li> The iron is great. It was ordered as a christmas present however it was not received until after christmas. A very disappointing experience but the iron is great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gift for one of nieces in Georgia for Christmas, she loves it.  Nothing else to say. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Got it exactly when it said it would arrive. Looks &amp; works awesome!</li>
    <li> I have been using this flat iron for a few months now.  I went through many flat irons till I came across this one.  It works well enough.  I have a color treated, highlighted, chemically treated (straight permed) hair and this doesnt fry up my hair.  I even use it when my hair is semi damp when running late, and still doesnt kill my hair.  It doesnt give it shine, but I use argan oil and other hair treatments to maintain a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; looking hair.  I will continue using this until I find something better.  Its good enough for its price.</li>
    <li> I have very curly but super fine hair. I&#x27;ve been loosely following the curly girl method about two years. I recently decided I wanted to start changing it up a bit, got tired of my curls. I bought this as my birthday present and I&#x27;m not to sure about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it the first time it was often catching and pulling my hair. I looked closer at it and realized the tips touch before the base when closed. I could use more pressure to force the housing to bow but any stray hairs near the tips were pinched and therefore would not glide between the plates creating the snags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently undecided if I will keep it or return it. I do not plan to straighten my hair often, maybe twice a month, so it&#x27;s hard to justify spending more money, but I would not recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I ordered the flat iron because of the supposed quality of the HSI brand. I received the iron in a reasonable time frame. Unfortunately the iron did not work after only 3 weeks of having it. On the bright side the seller gave me my full refund within days. Maybe I got the Lemon!</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars, however it pulls my hair with every single stroke.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with outstanding price!</li>
    <li> I received my HSI straightener right when they said it would arrive.  After opening it and trying it out I was quite pleased.  After determining which level of heat was necessary for straightening my hair I was getting great results.  Several people commented positively about my hair and I said it had to be the straightener!!  This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on Amazon reviews as a replacement for my wife&#x27;s broken expensive flat iron. She was very skeptical at first. She tried it and loved it and so did my teenage daughter. My daughter loved it so much I had to buy a second one to keep the piece.</li>
    <li> I love my straightener.  It works great.  The best thing about it is that I can use it to curl the bottom of my hair without using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is a good straightener if you want something temporary. I mean I started straightening my hair one day and the the top plate totally came off and burned the tip of my finger! (Thank God it didn&#x27;t catch my entire hand) I kept it in a secure place even kept it in the original box. Please save your fingers/hands</li>
    <li> Very nice. It works good with my thin hair.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, works great, and gives my hair the same shine as my chi did before. love it</li>
    <li> Awesome quality straightener! Heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I was in Ulta looking for a Chi straightener to get my daughters for Christmas and was completely overwhelmed at the the huge selection and the unbelievable prices. So I decided to do some research on them. I looked at all kinds of reviews and bought 2 of these. My girls loved them. They said they worked just as good as their friends that have Chi brand ones. So I tried it and loved it too. I bought myself one. The price was amazing and they worked wonderful!!! You can&#x27;t go wrong with thus straightener!!</li>
    <li> I dig this flat iron.  It smooths my hair nicely and the included argan oil was amazing!  I love that stuff!  I love having the option to change the heat setting as well.</li>
    <li> This item has had several glitches. I am really disappointed. I would recommend purchasing a higher end straightener. The iron only heats up at times. When you plug it in only sometimes will it beginning heating up on it own. It also only gets somewhat hot and does not do the job of a better quality item.</li>
    <li> This iron was not too bad for the price. However, over the weekend it literally fell apart?! Really?? I ordered this in September and the irons inside started detaching making it useless! I&#x27;ve been using flat irons for prob over 15 yrs... never had I had one fall apart like this. Most of my irons are good for atleast  1-2 yrs. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, sorry. :(</li>
    <li> Easy to use great product</li>
    <li> I have used this flat iron on my hair with and without the special oil that comes with the iron. It is definitely better with the oil, so you should purchase this oil as well, but it also works really great without the oil. My hair has never been so straight and really soft (that is probably due to the oil). So happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have had in a while. It heats up really fast and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all.</li>
    <li> This iron is as close to my stylist&#x27;s as I&#x27;ve ever been able to purchase for less than $100. I think it&#x27;s a great price for this quality product.</li>
    <li> I have thick, straight hair, but use a straightener because it&#x27;s pretty coarse and frizzy.  This straightener quickly heats up and I can straighten my entire mid-back length hair in about 10 min.  It stays straight, frizz-free, and healthy-looking for about 3 days.  I also have tried using it to curl my hair.  It takes about 15 minutes.  Curls lasted 2 days.  Highly recommend this straightener!  I&#x27;ve had about 5 straighteners in the last 10 years (ranging from $20-$150), this is by far the best.  It feels well built, doesn&#x27;t catch/pull my hair, and I love the results.  I was concerned about having to use a glove, but have found that I do not need it.  The outer part does not get too hot to handle and it&#x27;s pretty easy/lightweight that I don&#x27;t need a hand on the end unless I&#x27;m curling.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really good. The packaging was great and I cant wait to use it more often.</li>
    <li> I would love it to have an indicator when hot and to have an auto off. Otherwise I love. It smooths my very curly hair to stick straight without having to go over a section more than once.</li>
    <li> Loved the straightner so much a bought a second one for a friend!  I also love the oil sample and how I could immediately notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Excellent quality.  Nice case.  Free sample argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is just like the one my professional hair stylist uses.  A great value!</li>
    <li> My hair has a curl that no hot tools straightener could get out, and this one did its job! Very satisfied with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I absolutely love it.  I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t break down on me but as of now I love it.  It leaves my hair very smooth.  I only use it to straighten my hair, I have not used it to curl my hair yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter for Christmas. She says that it is easier on her hair than her last flat iron that was more expensive.  Also, she is able to straigtened her hair quickly as it heats up quickly and does the job the first time around.  She is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I just recieved the straightner today, it works very well but, i was very annoyed that one of the HSI round signseach side of the straightner wasnt there, it fell off somehow ..,was it used ???? It feels like it has some scratches here and there !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the argon oil was one use only sample size, not the regular small one that used to be sold with the straightner (and advertised on the box!)</li>
    <li> I tried the machine on the max setting but it didn&#x27;t heat up at all. Looks and packaging were fine.</li>
    <li> I bought a highly rated straightener from walmart and her hair was a fluff ball on the first day of school:( I bought this one months later because of the reviews and it is great!!! One pass down a strand of hair and voila the hair is straight and flat, It&#x27;s amazing, I recommend this to anyone. It is skinny but it is so efficient!!!! Works Wonders</li>
    <li> Good product, kind of pulls your hair but most irons do. Overall would buy again. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Like that it has many heat settings. Blue Novelties is great, they follow up, prompt service and I would definitely order from them again!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron!! It Works faster than other name brand flat irons I have had in the past!!!</li>
    <li> This product does not work very well, the plates are not completely even so one side touches while the other has a space in between it, therefore it pulls your hair out rather then gliding evenly when using it. I have used this product twice then started looking for another, I recommend not buying a straightener online unless you have a chance to try it first.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my mom, she was very happy with the quality of the product and how it works. Top notch product because I also tested this product in my hair without being a professional in hair styling and I can say it worth for the price, the product is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My fiancé loves it she was goin to spend some crazy amount of money on one she ended up ordering this one and she loves it !</li>
    <li> The product is great, because it&#x27;s safe to use warms up really quickly and really don&#x27;t destroy my hair after using it.</li>
    <li> product arrived as expected.  so farm I have been very pleased with this product. It by far is one of the best flat irons I have had experience with.  I would recommend this to all.</li>
    <li> My mother had been wanting a flat iron for a while. She has very long and wavy hair, which is on the coarse side. After reading all the great reviews on this flat iron, I decided to purchase it. My mom is very happy with this! In addition to the heat shield spray for her hair, this flat iron makes her hair very shiny and soft. It heats up very quickly, and gets her thick hair straight in a short amount of time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. It makes my naturally curly hair straight and smooth. In addition, the sale price of this flat iron is amazing. I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Loooove this straightener. The amount of 5 star reviews compelled me to buy it (plus $34 for a straightener isn&#x27;t a bad price) and I&#x27;m very glad I did. I noticed right away that my hair gets straight with just one try, compared to my old straighter, a Sedu, where I often had to go back and straighten sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with BioSilk and it&#x27;s amazing. I definitely recommend using BioSilk with it because it will make your hair look so shiny and mine stays straight overnight. Very glad I decided to purchase this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two chi straighteners in the past few years. I decided to try this for half the cost and I am just as pleased if not happier. I love being able to control the temperature. The styler feels very sturdy. High quality for a very fair cost.</li>
    <li> This product gets 2 stars because the satin pouch &amp; heat glove included in the box are a nice touch , however they don&#x27;t make up for the fact that the flatiron is slow to heat up, heavy &amp; clunky.  The controls are hard to reach, (inside the middle of the iron).  I put this product on a closet shelf &amp; intend to keep it there until yard sale time. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> i droped my royale in the toilet. -.- so i bought this as a temp replacement. now its a permanent replacement</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair straightener! I have the chi, and I like this hair straightener so much more. It also came with this small sample of argon oil that worked miracles for my hair! The argon oil makes me feel like I have model hair LOL But this hair straightener works really well as a curling iron too! It takes around a minute to heat up. The bottom line is that I really like this product, and I would recommend this product to a friend or maybe even give it as a gift to someone.</li>
    <li> Works great on my longer hair, it turned out smooth and straight! Would recommend it to anyone looking for a straightner that gives professional results to thicker, curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! My hair has never looked so good since I&#x27;ve started using it - very professional . It&#x27;s important to establish a base line heat level for your hair, but once that&#x27;s done, you get consistent results every time.</li>
    <li> I am IN LOVE with this straightener!! I have very coarse, curly, thick hair (think horse mane, only thicker!) and I was amazed at how well this took the curl out. It heats up quickly and it maintains its heat until I shut it off. It can flip my hair under or out or make it stick straight. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off, but it is a salon styler so I assume that&#x27;s why. So I just have to remember to unplug it. Other than that, I have zero complaints. It really gets the job done and holds the style until I wash my hair again!</li>
    <li> works like a charm! would recommend for straigtening use ANYDAY! the box is even pretty looking and makes a great gift. very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> All women want a curling iron... BUT they all want that expensive one that most men just can&#x27;t seem to understand the high price for.  She&#x27;ll never mention it to you because even she can&#x27;t justify the cost.  It doesn&#x27;t make phone calls.  You can&#x27;t surf the web with it.  It doesn&#x27;t play music.  BUT...  it will quite possibly be her most favorite electronic item.  Nothing on the market geared for males will do what this product does.  It saves her time.  It gives her confidence.  It&#x27;ll make her more spontaneous.  And she&#x27;ll love you so much more because you surprised her by thinking outside of the jewelry box!  Take it from someone who knows!</li>
    <li> I recently moved and found myself without my normal straightener. I turned to Amazon and was very happy with this find. The straightener works great, and came with a free bottle of argan oil which makes my hair INCREDIBLE soft. Even comes with a styling glove if you&#x27;re prone to burning yourself (like me). Works well for straightening and curling. I was planning on going back to my old straightener brand since this one was intended to be a stopgap, but I&#x27;m going to stick to this one. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased SEVERAL CHI brand Flat Irons which have all failed miserably. I bought them around once a year if not less, because my wife kept complaining about how they eventually wore out and stopped working. Being that this HSI Flat Iron was 1/3 of the price I&#x27;ve been paying, and I haven&#x27;t heard a single complaint yet I am more than happy with this purchase. While this review is geared more towards someone buying this as a gift for their wife/gf/daughter etc. I hope my experience alone will help anyone make this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this since everyone gave such great remarks. But once i plugged it in and began to do my hair i realized that only of the plates was heating up :-/... Im really not happy about this and guess i will be getting a refund. Wish it worked great just like everyone else&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener was bought for my daughter.  She has curly hair, but she has been able to manage her hair very well with this straightener.  It makes her hair shiny and look healthy.  Great product!  Very satisfied with product and with price.</li>
    <li> It pulls your hair. not enough heat. takes me double the time then it use to take me with the nano. I wouldn’t recommended for girls with thik hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutley love this flat iron!!! It heats up very quickly, glides smoothly, doesn&#x27;t sizzle my hair and gives me perfect curls. The ceramic plates are set away from the edge enough that you don&#x27;t burn your forehead when straightening your bangs, nor does it heat up the bathroom countertop like my old flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had two CHI&#x27;s previously and both died within 12 months of buying them. The Corioliss flat iron I had after the CHIs was great, but got very hot on the outside and if you weren&#x27;t careful about where you picked it up/ placed your fingers, would burn you badly. So far, this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I had to replace my CHI and bought this based on the reviews. It is comparable to the CHI, and a great price. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> i bought this flat iron because of the reviews it had and they where right its a  great flat iron and i droped it a couple of times and it didnt break like other flat irons that break esaly i really recomend this flat iron</li>
    <li> Girlfreind loves it..she bought the hsi argan oil and it makes her dry and brittle hair look shiny and healthy...</li>
    <li> It works well. But the on button does not stay on green the ligth turns on red every time during the process.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, compact, love the clove that comes with the item, and it just works, also the price was amazing. thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> I bougth this Iron for my daugther i Love it is perfect I do my daugther&#x27;s hair every morning before school. thank you ,</li>
    <li> I previously purchased a big name flat iron from a local retailer that had the controls on the handle where you couldn&#x27;t help turning it on/off or up/down every time you held it.  After returning that one, I looked at the reviews and saw that this one had thousands of five star reviews on Amazon.  So happy I ordered it! It heats up very quickly, works very well to give your hair a smooth, healthy look, and the controls were on the inside where your hand doesn&#x27;t disturb them.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It also came with extras, like a nice carrying case and coupons for styling products.  The shipper was wonderful, sending it out the same day I ordered.</li>
    <li> For the price, this hot iron is great. It heats up quickly and does the job. My only issue is that half the time, I have to push the red button on the wall plug because it will pop put and I am unaware until I go to use the iron and it is off.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it! It works fast and she loved the oil it came with.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in high hopes because of the all the great reviews. However, when I received mine....what a dissapointment. The iron looked used and the &amp;#34;hot plates&amp;#34; don&#x27;t get nearly hot enough. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective product or if they are all like this...but I am definately returning. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Very skeptical of the amount of reviews and the raving stars. Yet, this is an awesome straightner! I love this straightner, it gives shiny, sleekness and heats up in record time. I&#x27;d reccomend this straightner in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this flat iron only three times so far, but I love it!  My hair is straight, silky and shiny, without the burnt smell that my last flat iron was leaving.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best hair straightner I have ever used! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for one!</li>
    <li> My 11 year old granddaughter (who is very particular about her hair!) wanted a hair straightener for Christmas.  After doing much on-line research and asking around, I found the HSI was the best value on the market.  So I ordered it from Amazon (while holding my breath).  Well, she thinks it is awesome so as long as it hold up, we are good!</li>
    <li> This was my first time receiving a package from Ontrac, and I am so pleasantly surprised. I ordered my item Friday@9pm via 2 day shipping &amp; I received the package today (Monday) @8am. Thank you so much! It arrived on time&amp;surpassed my hopes for it arriving prior to my departure to Armenia. Now I can take it with me&amp;use the dual voltage HSI hair iron during my vacation in Armenia. :) Wooohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I tried the product as soon as I received it-- wow. It heated up to my preset heat level in literally 5-10 seconds. All I needed was one semi-slow stroke across a strand of hair for it to its thing. I&#x27;m super pleased.</li>
    <li> styler is just like stated or better - i got it for my teenage granddaughter who is biracial - it works wonderful on her hair - leaves it shiny and silky not dried out - very professional</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I have fine straight hair but was unhappy with the result of a \\&quot;curling iron\\&quot; all the time. I like the straight look, but will a little control of the ends than drying alone. I was worried about a flat iron being too hot, but the product lets you pick your heat and gives some guidance for your hair type. I have only had the product a week, but am very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teen age daughter and she lives it I like how well it&#x27;s made and the pouch it came with for storage when not in use</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron out there. My hair has never been this smooth and silky the heat control is top notch. My daughter and I have been long time users of the other brand that starts with a C. Give this a try and you will be very happy</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! I purchased December 27th and received it January 2nd! I LOVEEE this straightener! Leaves my hair straight soft and silky! I had a chi and it stopped working after 6months due to a shortage. This is by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had and its a reasonable price. Comes with a one year warranty as well. Love it. 5 stars !!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! MY WIFE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HER NEW FLAT IRON AND IT WAS A GREQAT PRICE TO BOOT! THANX HSI.</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of hair during my pregnancy and when it grew back the unders were curly and unruly. I tried EVERYTHING. Serums. Gels. Lotions. Shampoos. Conditioners. You name it, I tried it. Until a friend told me to buy a professional grade straightener. I was worried about the price but then I came across this one and thought \\&quot;What the hell!\\&quot;. Like the title says: Best purchase ever. I don&#x27;t even have to use anymore straightening products. This thing does it all!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been known to purchase flat irons in the past that cost 3-4x as much as this one does and I&#x27;m shaking my head at that now. Nothing really beats this flat iron especially for the price. It&#x27;s quality, just like when I had a Paul Mitchell or Chi one and is sturdy. The swivel cord is good for not getting the cord tangled up like my Chi used to get, and what I hated about the newer model Chi flat irons was that the grip to tightly grasp your hair wasn&#x27;t that great, so my hair fell out of the two plates a lot. The HSI has a great grip and my hair stays in place while I&#x27;m running it through the iron. It heats up fairly quickly and has an adjustable temperature setting. Mine also came with a free heat glove which was nice and a pouch for storing the flat iron in. It works just as well as more expensive flat irons. I&#x27;m not sure why you would need to buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get a flat iron for a long time but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on one. When I saw this one on sale I decided to try it! I have been very pleased with it. Thanks for the product and good sale!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  You can set the temp.  It really seems to smooth my hair and it seems to fix much easier and better than it did with the Chi.  I loved my Chi  until using this one.  Now my Chi will be my back up in case I ever need it.</li>
    <li> A great straightener for an amazing price. So glad I grabbed this when I did. My other straightener has treated me well, but I knew it wouldn&#x27;t last too much longer. I&#x27;ll be looking for another straightener just like this that is 1.5-2\\&quot; for my longer hair.</li>
    <li> This is a MUCH better straightener than the remington I had before. I have curly hair and it&#x27;s tough to get it straight but this gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Super easy, can do large bunches of hair, gets really REALLY hot! I would put 5 stars, except I really wish it had a timed auto shut-off... I keep leaving it on and I&#x27;m going to burn down my house...</li>
    <li> After reading product description, decided to give it a try.  Happy that I did-it arrived well protected with a carrying bag included. It has a commercial type plug for safety. It also comes with a sample of argan oil. Not only does it look professional it performs well-both for straightening and curling.  It heats up in less than a minute, with variable heat settings.  Controls are out of the way-unlike my last iron. The heads float and create a smooth line.  My hair does not get caught in it like my last one. I am pleased with the iron and would recommend it. Good deal considering the price and quality.</li>
    <li> I order this flat iron for my daughter. Her Chi iron got damaged and we bought another Chi iron that she thought was the best of all of them.  When she tried the iron she was actually disappointed with its performance and we returned it.  She then went online and found this iron.  She told me that the reviews were very good and she wanted to try it.  We ordered the iron very close to Christmas and I was nervous that the iron was not going to arrive on time-. She was going to another country for the holidays and she needed the iron more than anything.  Well, not only the iron arrived on time but my daughter couldn&#x27;t be happier with her iron.  She said that it is the best iron she has had. She has a long curly hair and it is very important for her having her hair perfectly straight and shiny all the time. I am very happy that we bought it and extremely happy with the price.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these4 for Christmas gifts. I was hesitant as i had only used Babyliss. I can tell you that all 3 people are very impressed with their gift!! The iron comes in a cute velour case, you get a glove (that you will need) as well as a little bottle of hair product!!!  2 of them i gave to Adults, and the other one to my daughter who is 11. i make sure she uses the glove as it will get very hot... i think you can set it up to 450 degrees. in comparison to Babyliss, i can&#x27;t tell a difference and would very much recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright product. It gets the job done, although I wish it didn&#x27;t leave hair so static-y. The straightening didn&#x27;t really last all day. This also leave burnt smell worst than other straighteners I&#x27;ve used. The handle was also too huge for the little plate it has. The pouch and glove is an added bonus. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the use of their pouch to store the hot iron, but it&#x27;s great for travel. I will edit this review if I find that my iron lasts.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this after my Chi straightener stopped working and the reviews were so good.  I plugged it in and even after waiting a long time, it never got hot enough to straighten my hair.  I have fairly thin hair that is just a little wavy in the morning so it&#x27;s generally not difficult to straigten but this iron did nothing.  I had to resort back to my $25 Vidal Sassoon straightner from Wal-Mart to get my hair straight this morning.  Still looking for a good straightner!</li>
    <li> Very affordable and profession hair straightener. My girlfriend really needed one so when i ordered it for her she was over joyed.</li>
    <li> I have no chemical in my hair, and I have thin but kinky hair. This flat iron is the best I have owned so far.</li>
    <li> Overall very good, wife&#x27;s only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t automatically turn off after an extended period of time.  As far as straightening works very well.</li>
    <li> I use this one to both straighten and curl my hair. My hair is the type that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl when using a curling iron so I use a straightener. This straightener heats up really quickly and does the job!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this one bc of all of the great reviews but it didn&#x27;t hardly heat up. When I wanted to exchange it there was no options but to return it. Wish I could&#x27;ve exchanged to try another one. Guess I&#x27;ll buy from another brand.</li>
    <li> The product name pretty much captures it. Ceramic, compare to metal on cheaper hair straighteners, is believed to cause less damage to hair. This particular model is well built and comes with some extras like a pouch etc. Also the price is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on the price: when I purchased this product it was priced at 39.99 dollars, and now, apparently, the price went up $10 more to $49.99.  I really don&#x27;t like to see some of the great products on amazon kept increasing their price, just because they have wonderful reviews so that they can sell them at a higher price and people are still willing to pay for them. Well, I was still satisfied for what I paid for, but I hope this information can help some people.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore my straightener. Goes up to 400 degrees. Long lasting results for my hair (but also my hair is pretty straight for the most part). However, you can also curl your hair with it, and the curls come out so cute!</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for and at a great price...way more expensive at the beauty supply stores, even for someone with a license...yay!</li>
    <li> HSI is just an ok flat iron.  I had a CHI for 8 yrs and liked it much better.  The HSI does not get as hot or glide over my hair as easily</li>
    <li> I feel like I do not even need to go into great detail about this straightener because it has over 2 thousand reviews and 4.5 stars. So let me just join in with everyone who likes it and just say that I AGREE that this straightener is absolutely amazing and worth every penny! Until this one I owned a CHI, which I obviously loved, but that one ended up breaking so I was in search for another one. I noticed that this one was recommended on a beauty website so I decided to search it on Amazon and saw the RAVING reviews so I was literally almost already convinced..... that is until I saw the price. YEP CONVINCED. The price accompanied with the awesome reviews made me buy this so fast I didn&#x27;t even know what hit me. NOT to my surprise... it is absolutely amazing! It heats up super fast and makes my hair shiny and soft! I hate to say it but I think I might actually like it more than my chi :/ Ok, I know I do I just feel bad liking a $40 flat iron more than a $100+ one. Either way, this is a GREAT straightener and I definitely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I was so sad when my straightener broke that was a higher end one I got from my Aunt&#x27;s salon. I&#x27;m on a college budget so couldn&#x27;t drop $100 for a flat iron. This one works great! I have decently thick curly hair and this iron works great! I always use a heat protector and/or a smoothing serum when I style my hair straight and this iron leaves a nice smooth finish every time! Also comes with a nice satin red carrier.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she is really happy with this product. It works very well. It does get very hot so she has to be careful but she says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s nice to have a straightener that doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t want there to be humidity in the hair or it doesn&#x27;t feel hot enough but it is a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> Very simple product, sleek, small, extremely easy to travel with. Can use to straighten AND curl - Definitely leaves hair with a great sheen. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a super Amazon deal as a Christmas gift for my 17 year old. She loves everything about it and I feel safe letting her use it on her own. We have had bad experiences with other products in the past causing burns or damaging her hair but this it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;in addition, it is fast to set up and use making it great for before school.</li>
    <li> This replaced a flat iron that broke that I just purchased from a superstore years ago.  Thank goodness that thing broke or else I would&#x27;ve of never purchased this one.  My hair never looked so straight and polished!  And it&#x27;s not like it takes a lot of effort or time to do it either with this flat iron.  I love it.  I have a short bob and I hate maintaining hair.  I seriously take a shower at night and go to bed with my hair damp sometimes. I know, a big no-no. But when I wake up I just use this iron and my hair is stick straight and beautiful in no time.  The only con: no auto turn-off switch.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem for me even after reading the reviews about it because I thought I was pretty good about remembering this kind of stuff but one day, there it was, 10 hours later and still plugged in and as hot as can be.  Not good.  But I love the iron itself.  If they added an auto shut off, I&#x27;d purchase it again just for safety reasons.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener based off the rave reviews.  However, I unfortunately fell into the category of &amp;#34;the straightener did not work from day one&amp;#34;.  I returned it to Amazon, and instead of purchasing another one, I bought the Babyliss Pro Volare Hair Dryer.  The blow dryer has been life changing, and has COMPLETELY negated the need for a straightening iron, as the blow dryer gets it straight and smooth on the first shot!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancee and she loved it. It is a quality flat iron. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flat iron.  The sample bottle of oil is great because it is light and does not leave my hair oily.  I love the results I got when using the flat iron and oil together. My hair looks fantastic and smells wonderful. I liked the flat iron so much I ordered one for my sister!</li>
    <li> This heats up quick and doesn&#x27;t take long for my hair to get straight.  I have medium length layered hair.  The only thing is that any longer and it would hurt my hands/arm to use because of the weight of the tool.  I have problems with my arm.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener really fast and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Heats up super fast and it really does the job! My hair is really wavy and is difficult to straighten but my hair even stayed straight through the night, that never happens! I say this is a great value.</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE this straightener and would have paid twice as much for it. It is worth every penny, and is a wonderful product. My hair feels silky and smooth and soft and I&#x27;m able to get my hair straight-STRAIGHT, not just straight. I would highly recommend this to everyone. I am so happy with mine!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  It heats up very quickly and does a great job on my fine, thin hair!!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish that it had some way to keep it closed when not in use.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron! It heated up really fast - about 90 seconds to the highest setting. It didn&#x27;t grab my hair and it made my hair look very shiny and smooth! i also used it to curl my hair and it turned out great. my hair is already mostly straight, so i can&#x27;t say how it would work for someone with thick, curly hair but the highest setting is REALLY hot so i think it would work haha. i&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone, honestly i think it&#x27;s awesome. the only issue i have is that my argan oil was unscrewed and thus empty, like many others :(</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for a year now (quit using it several months ago) and I am selling it. When I first got it, I noticed it did not glide smoothly through my hair (I have blonde hair that is naturally pretty straight but I like to get it stick straight). I thought maybe it was because it was new so I continued to use it. A few months after using it, my hairdresser asked me if I switched shampoo or was doing anything different because I had a lot of breakage in my hair. I had switched shampoo to a drug store brand from a salon brand, so I figured that was the reason why. I immediately went back to my salon brand thinking it would fix the problem. It didn&#x27;t. My next salon appt she said that whatever I was doing with my hair I needed to stop because my hair was in terrible shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I knew all along it was my straightener but I was in denial because of all the great reviews. But I finally accepted that this straightener was yanking, breaking, and pulling my hair out despite using very high quality hair products and wiping the plates down after each use. I am STILL working on getting my hair back to the perfect condition it was in. I had to chop off 6 inches of hair to start the process.</li>
    <li> This product deserves 5 starts for sure! It is an amazing item, better than the CHI which is more expensive. For this price you are getting a fast heating flat iron, If you are in need of a flat iron! This is the one to buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great machine, I am saving so much now that I can do my nails and toenails myself.  I am 63 and as we age our nails start to chip and peal and with using the gel polish and the royal nails machine this doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.  My nails are just perfect.  The machine is very easy to use and I can have a new manicure or pedicure any time I want.  This machine also works great with regular polish.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, works very well, easy to use with out burning ones hands, head, or hair.  Its a great deal</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is fine for the price, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the silly $300 original price tag. This is not even a $100 straightener like the CHI. It&#x27;s a $50 straightener, which is fine since that&#x27;s what I paid for it, but I will be returning it because I need to replace my CHI and this is not going to do the trick. It didn&#x27;t heat up nearly enough and definitely wouldn&#x27;t curl my hair (which you can do with high end straighteners) and the biggest issue is the lower quality construction made the heating plates tug on my hair. I straighten my hair pretty often and just know that this flat iron is going to destroy my hair in no time. It appears to be the exact same straightener as one I also tried from TJ Maxx for around $30, just with a different name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s an ok straightener, but it is a $30 straightener pretending to be a $300 one. You get what you pay for sometimes (or in this case, not even).</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE. BROKE AFTER JUST 1 USE. BOTH PLATES CHIPPED.  WOULD NOT EVER BUY AGAIN.I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED. VERY POOR QUALITY.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is used by three people in my house and they all love it!  I would recommend this to all~</li>
    <li> I was expecting this product to be so much better after the reviews,, but its not smooth at all,,, when it goes through my hair i feel like it grilling my hair ,,,,</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this flat iron gets the job done with ease. I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Made my friend&#x27;s day. That means it made my day too. She absolutely loves this product. I don&#x27;t know the first thing about straighteners but she said its the best. I&#x27;ll take her word.</li>
    <li> I received the package few days ago.I gave it 5* even they did not ship it to my APO address,instead sent to the States and my uncle mailed it here for me! It comes with a box inside it contains a free small argan oil to use with it &amp; a cute red pouch for the storage. I was so worried as I need to use a converter again since it came from US, But.. when I saw the box, it is 110-240V . .I gave it a try, I used it once since I had it. It works so great with the argan oil \\&quot;leave on\\&quot; My hair was so smooth and looked so amazing! It is one of the girls&#x27; must have.. I am pleased with this product. I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She loves it and has no complaints! I chose it because it has all the qualities of a higher priced iron, but has the rounded, mark free edges so that those telltale lines of most flat irons are a thing of the past. My daughter-in-law likes quality items &amp; she has no complaints, so I recommend this product and the seller for fast shipping and great service! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over a year and I love it! It never \\&quot;catches\\&quot; my hair like a Chi would, it leaves it soft and very straight!</li>
    <li> After having a GHD. Really can&#x27;t compare .. Not really happy with this product. Does a lousy job😪..yeSh pretty dissapionted !</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the lady since i knocked hers off the counter and broke it.. she was wanting to replace with a Chi but never advised which one.. I Bought this Flat Iron for her and she loves it... I don&#x27;t have technical details I apologize but i know that she has not mentioned needing a flat iron again and &amp;#34;no news is good news&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I owned the same CHI for 5 years and it finally stopped working. I thought I&#x27;d try something different so I got this HSI because of the rave reviews on here. I do not understand whatsoever why people love this straightener. I&#x27;d say the only pro to this item was the nice, fancy packaging, but don&#x27;t let that fool you! This states it gets up to 410 degrees, and I KNOW that&#x27;s a lie. The CHI got up to about 400 degrees and it got WAY, way hotter than the HSI. This HSI did not straighten my hair and my hair is not curly. It&#x27;s thick, and wavy so it should have been able to handle my hair. Not only did it not get hot enough to straighten my hair, it ripped my hair out, and it did not go along my hair smoothly... it was very bumpy and felt like it ripped my hair even more. If that&#x27;s not bad enough, the grip design is terrible. The ridges on the handle literally gave me a blister on my thumb from holding it while straightening my hair. I will be returning this straightener very soon and replacing it with another CHI because CHI&#x27;s are amazing. I should have never betrayed it to begin with!</li>
    <li> Good straightener so far had it about 3 weeks now and so far am happy with it. Heats up fast, and works great, and the price was just right!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great. Leaves hair very smooth and you don&#x27;t have to have it on the highest setting to work.</li>
    <li> Would recomend it to other people. It straightens and curls great. The descriptions are true as it says. Shines my hair so good</li>
    <li> Its the best flat iron ive ever used. It gets hot fast and there have been no issues. Ive had it for 6 months and it is just an amazing tool</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this product.  For one, it straightens my hair very well, and I like the fact that it is not too hot against my skin.  My previous flatiron sometimes seared my neck but the HSI does not.  It straightens very nicely, as well as powering up quickly.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I never heard of this brand but I wanted something that could straighten my natural curly hair and this worked perfectly. The Aragon oil spilled all over the silk carrying case so I can&#x27;t comment or review that. But overall great product hopefully it last me a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have naturally curly hair and the cheap brand I was using would never straighten my hair and always make it look frizzy. This product is great no more frizz and stragiht hair...</li>
    <li> My sis ordered this flat iron from Amazon for me for Christmas.  It&#x27;s my first one, and it seems fine so far.  There are definitely some improvements they could make to it, however.  I don&#x27;t like the way it pulls at my hair.  And there&#x27;s no visual indicator that it&#x27;s on or warmed up.  It really needs a light on the outside to indicate this.  Otherwise, you end up stooping over and cocking your head 45 degrees just to see if the switch inside is set to &#x27;on&#x27; or &#x27;off.&#x27;  I&#x27;m used to curling irons where you know with a quick glance.</li>
    <li> It really gets in your hair and straightens it like butter! so yes this is totally worth it and, it is the cheapest one on the internet that i found!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one to purchase items online based off of reviews alone. The price on this straightener, the amount of reviews it had, and the stars were a big reason why I decided to go ahead with my order. The shipping was fast, and customer service was very helpful, contacting me via email every step of the way. Tried it out for the first time this morning, and I love it. The quality, design, and overall appearance of the straightener was definitely worth the money. Great bang for my buck. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as two of my friends have it and use it, but mine did not work at all. I switched it on the first time, but it never heated up to 410 degrees that I set. I was able to touch the plates when the light turned green! It did not heat up which makes me believe that the item is defective. Also, the red light turns to green and back to red every few seconds. I am returning the item, but am planning to purchase it one more time to give it a final chance. Will update once I use the product again. I think the manufacturer should improve their QC testing.</li>
    <li> First of all I would like to give a 5 stars to customer service. I was contacted by them and they asked me if I was happy with the flat iron and I told them that it was pulling my hair a little bit and that the smell, like something was burning was too strong.. they said It&#x27;ll pass but unfortunately it never did.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I do my hair the whole house smells.&lt;br /&gt;And also I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes it gets real hot but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because it has the highest rate. As this is my FIRST hair iron, I can&#x27;t really compare it with something else, for instance I can not declare that this is the best iron ever.&lt;br /&gt;But this iron works. And I like the results. So, my opinion will be - 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has thick curly hair. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Advantages from my previous (1.5&amp;#34;) iron: smaller and easier to manipulate in my hands, I can get the smaller head very close to my scalp (so I can now avoid a funny heat wrinkle/crease in this area), my hair does not get &amp;#34;snagged&amp;#34; between heating plates and case. Disadvantage - Does not get quite as hot, so I need to put my hair through the iron a few more times to completely straighten. I have a lot of very thick, naturally curly hair, so I don&#x27;t think this would be an issue for most people.For the price, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have course wavy asian hair overall it was a pretty decent straightener, I don&#x27;t see all the craze about it. my andis straightener that I brought from walmart works just as well if not better and it has lasted me for 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: heats up within a few seconds while my old andis took about a minute, but both give the same results on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Con: the price. I would never pay over $50 for this products. I bought it when it was onsale for $40 2 weeks ago which should be a decent price for it but now its $80 for the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; pouch, glove, and sample argan oil.</li>
    <li> This is great, can set the heat to a lower setting so you have less hair breakage.</li>
    <li> Works so much better then the high dollar ones!</li>
    <li> Works great! I actually bought this when my Chi broke! It was a great replacement!</li>
    <li> I dropped it 3 days after buying it....n the ceramic plays cracked n broke :(</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Packing and accessories included were very nice. Great quality and  professional product. Straightened hair beautifully. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first straightener and I have been very pleased with it.  It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible and does not get better. I would not recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It heat&#x27;s up quickly, is very easy to use, and leaves your hair shiny and soft. I also really like the storage bag it comes with. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have it for about a month now and I have no problems, when i flat iron my daughters hair the iron just glides, nice and smooth. But I also use argon oil on her hair(and mine as well), to help it straighten and keep frizz away.</li>
    <li> I loved it...until it blew up less than 2 months from when I bought it</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, product is better than I could ever ask for, leaves hair soft and smooth!  I do not find use in the glove, but the kids think it is fun! :)  The travel bag is easy to use and very convenient for packing the straightener away (and keeping the cord together).&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price!</li>
    <li> I did not like the iron.I return it and i am not sure i got my money back.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping...my daughter loves the straightener!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and seller service.</li>
    <li> Excellent you get exactly what it says on the tin. Works great and seems to be on the sturdy side of things.</li>
    <li> Buy this! You will save so much time and money. I have very curly hair. I usually need to go to a salon to get a professional look. It used to take over an hour to dry and straighten my hair with huge hot curlers. Now I can blow dry my hair and touch it up with the iron. The HSI spray is great. Best thing I have purchased on Amazon Prime. I love the iron. It is a time and life saver. great price too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend a Chi, but it works in a pinch.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, arrived on time, and works like a charm to straighten hair without being too damaging. Would definitely recommend, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter. She has always used expensive flat irons but when her brand new one got stepped on and broken we bought this less expensive one. She was not prepared to be so blown away by how well it worked!!! She loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, love it!!</li>
    <li> Kind of pissed I spent money on this when I had one that worked exactly the same before. This product is nothing special really, except the oil that comes with it is great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!! I have thin wavy hair and any blow dry job lasts for maybe 1 hour unless it&#x27;s a professional one but with this flat flat iron I can go 2-3 days with perfectly straight hair!! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat, the complete opposite actually and it takes me about 15 minutes to do my whole head. The argan  oil that comes with adds shine to your hair too!!</li>
    <li> This iron works great, and I love the bag, but I have been using flat irons for several years now that have auto shutoff, and this does not.  At least not the one I received.  I see some have said their iron does (in the questions area), but I just received this last week, and &amp;#34;forgot&amp;#34; to turn it off (pretty much always do this), and it was on for some 8 hours before I came back in the bathroom and felt the heat rising from the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will hopefully get in the habit of turning this off or unplugging it (very inconvenient to do the latter, considering our bathroom arrangement).  I imagine a hair dresser might like that feature, but that is not who I am.</li>
    <li> Great service!  This flat iron is the best one I have owned.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and it does a great job in smoothing the frizzies.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. The adjustable heat setting allow for multiple people to be able to use it (which is very nice in a large family).</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and it came quickly and in perfect condition. It looks very nice and has a nice travel case but I have not actually tried it to see how it works. I will update after Christmas but so far I am very pleasedd</li>
    <li> Purchased for my grand daughter who loves it. It works very well.</li>
    <li> I love it! It gives my hair that salon texture and smoothness that I have been searching  for.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake,,I wanted an iron that shows the temp you set,,it does not even have a high or low just a knob that you turn,,with a skinny line to wide line??? Go figure..,,??? that who knows how high temp is..Rather not have to take chances,,,BUT I was looking at too many,,and Just chose the wrong one,,,if you have strong dark hair..you can take a chance,,but fine blonde,,and you guess wrong position .just twist the knob,,and your hair could burn...turn orange,scorched,,because no temp control... who knows if you set in the middle?? if it is 200 degrees or 400 degrees.. but it comes with a bag,,and a glove??? it looks pretty...I did not send it back? and am disappointed that I missed the very important part..I want an Iron that the highest is maybe 400....no higher..and one I can set to only 250 for fine light blonde bleached hair,,rather go over a few times..and keep hair..from burning..than have it so hot,,hair breaks off....thanks..</li>
    <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t curled with it as yet but it gets my hair really straight. Not sure if its how course my hair is but I have to have the dial near to the end to get my hair bone straight anything less than about 375 through 410 doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil bottle looks more like a sample size than a travel size. But I love the packaging, the glove and the beautiful bag that you can put the iron back in once it cools down. Nice for traveling.</li>
    <li> So far it seems to work really well. I do wish it had auto shut-off, but I knew buying it that it didn&#x27;t, so that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault. The cord is nice and long and swivels well and I can handle the iron really well. Heats up nicely. Seems well made. Go for it!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the flat iron and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good price but just doesn&#x27;t work as well as more expensive flatirons I have had.&lt;br /&gt;My last one was ghd and it worked great but I thought I&#x27;d try this less expensive option. I have thick hair and it does straighten it a bit but it&#x27;s not the instant steamy straightening that my other flatiron had so it would take a long time to get my hair straight like that with this model.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this gift</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, dry, naturally frizzy hair and this is an excellent flat iron for smoothing it out and making my hair look about half it&#x27;s thickness.  The only caution I have on this -- do NOT put it anywhere that it could be knocked onto the floor or dropped by accident.  The plates WILL break into little pieces even if dropped onto a carpeted floor and then no more flat iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter will be so excited</li>
    <li> Love my new straightener! Works just as good as my Chi did for more than half the price!</li>
    <li> Very good bang for the buck.  I think this iron is as good as my last iron which was a Chi - and I paid a lot more for that one!  It gets nice and hot and glides smoothly.  Recommended if you want a decent iron at a very affordable price!</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. It was a gift for my daughter that has very thick and long hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> Gift for granddaughter.  She hasn&#x27;t complained, I guess she&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this! Better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve used and a really good price! It works great and I love the insulated bag. I travel a lot for work and don&#x27;t always have time to let it cool before needing to pack it in my suitcase. It is a great product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for months and it still works great!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Will order another one if I decide to straighten my hair again. Very good quality. Love the temperature control settings</li>
    <li> Professional results I love it!</li>
    <li> It works pretty good and keeps my hair straight for a long time. I used to have Jose Eber, wet to dry straight iron, I loved it but after three years it stop working as well as it did. I tried to get a replacement using the life long warranty but they kept sending me a product that dodnt work as well as the one purchases, seemed to be defective products. Then I tried the PYT iron, although it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair that much, didn&#x27;t leave my hair straight in the summer. On those humid days, my hair looked as if I didn&#x27;t straighten it. The HSI works pretty good! I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this model in 2011. With daily use, this guy is still going strong in 2014. I also have frizzy,thick , curly hair. Much better than any chi I have used.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t do damage to hair.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron at a great sale price.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a fantastic price. Shipment arrived quickly and was packaged very well.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron! It works very well at a moderate temperature, making it much better for fragile hair. The oil that came with it also calms hair down beautifully. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> Had this straightener for a couple of months.  My daugter really likes it.</li>
    <li> This iron was available at an exceptional price and additionally came with a very nice travel pouch as well as 5ml of Arban oil to protect my hair from the heat of the iron. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this iron.  My daughter purchased a CHI at three times the price and I like the HSI as well -- if not more, as it has a riostsat to control temperature and also a convenient swivel  cord which her CHI does not have.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  It does what it is supposed to do.  Good value for the $$</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it since 2012 and it&#x27;s been the best flat iron ever!! my hair is so straight and soft and shiny (normally very long curls) and the hair stays a full week for me straight. buy it and you wont regret it! I promise!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it was affordable , and it works better than I expected on my hair. This product is absolutely awesome.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This iron straighten well but, not curl. It is kind of difficult to maneuver to get the curls I want. I have been able to curl and flip with my previous flat irons. Other than that, it straightens really well especially for the price.</li>
    <li> My hair is typically unruly so I bought this flat iron to make it behave.  It works wonderfully and I don&#x27;t even need to turn it all the way up!</li>
    <li> I received my order promptly and I am very pleased with the new flat iron, my old flat irons ceramic plates were getting loose and the new one came just in time, the price was very good and I&#x27;m loving my new product. Thank you, Cathy</li>
    <li> I was looking for a straightener similar to the one my stylist uses - but without the exorbitant cost of the more popular straighteners out there - and this is it. Heats quickly, glides smoothly. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Kinda heavy and bulky compared to my other straightners I&#x27;ve owned and it pulls my hair as I get to the bottom of my hair.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this Flat iron really excitedly since I had never owned a Professional flat iron and wanted to treat myself. to my dismay though I seem to of received a Faulty product. my iron will not get hot no matter what I do. I cant tell you how many times I hit that reset button only to receive a cold iron. to top it off since I&#x27;m a college student and almost live in the middle of nowhere where my campus is located I cant return the product in time for Amazon to refund me and truth be told I feel like crying (sounds childish I know but I had washed my hair and was super excited for this only to be disappointed) I really wish I could give more stars but sadly I cant since I have an iron that wont heat up AT ALL to my horrible and empty college wallets dismay.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for someone, they loved it!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I had a chi before and the hsi is cheaper and better</li>
    <li> Great iron and love the oil they give with the pouch.</li>
    <li> My wife really wanted a chi iron. After reading all of the reviews for the Chi and then this product and really liking the price of the HSI ,I ordered it thinking if it does not work out I&#x27;ll take my lumps and just get the chi locally if I had to. Well she has had this HSI for a few weeks now and she really loves it. She has been bragging about how happy she is with it after she uses it. She said it works just as good as the chi brand. It now takes her less time to get ready (Yay!) plus her hair really does looks great too. I feel like I got a sweet deal.</li>
    <li> Very Good, helps with the curls</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage girls.  They seem to really like this product.  Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> great product. I like the temp. control. I only wish I had a 1/2 inch iron instead of 1&amp;#34;. I have short fine hair. I like the smoothness and fullness look it gives</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this straightener. She has coarse, wavy hair and it does a nice job as long as she takes her time. It gets nice and hot without damaging her hair too much (every day use is bound to damage some).</li>
    <li> This item came defective, DOES NOT WORK.  Sell doesn&#x27;t have an option to exchange item, only to return.  Pretty lame if you ask me, this was an xmas gift.  I was really disappointed due to the fact this product had tons of great reviews.</li>
    <li> With all the great reviews I thought this would be a great flat iron, but it&#x27;s not in my opinion. It&#x27;s heavy, doesn&#x27;t get very hot, and tugs at my hair. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product more than exceeds everyone&#x27;s expectations.</li>
    <li> No good for me, I have wavy hair, usually easy to straight, It took me 35 minutes to straight my hair and I didnt get the results that I wanted. Id beed using remington straighter for more than 8 years, with only 15 minutes my hair looks great.  I just bought it because I thought it will be something better, but it was not.</li>
    <li> The product worked like a charm for about two months. It then stopped working entirely. I have submitted a request for replacement once a month since I received the product but never receive an answer. Looking other places, some people say they get responses quickly and others say they never hear from support for a replacement.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this product prior to this order. She just wore it out. She asked me for exactly the same one. Great product, great seller. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love it! My order arrived on time and was exactly as depicted. Good quality. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my best friend&#x27;s 25th Birthday and she loves it. Heats up quickly and manages her hair well.. which is saying a lot, lol. She&#x27;s got massive long curls/kinks. Shipped on the early end of the estimated time too.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Wish the plates were longer.  But other than that it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FLAT IRON EVER!!!!  I have very coarse hair.  The HSI flat iron smooths and shines even my hair.  I will never use another brand again.</li>
    <li> turn irons all the way up and was still not hot</li>
    <li> One of the very few things I consider to have been a &#x27;best buy&#x27;. Sturdy and easy to grip, adjustable for gentleness, and the plates are very smooth and easy to clean. I personally do not use the glove, but the pouch is the perfect protective, cozy home. The argan oil treatment sample (a blessing in a bottle) has instantly become a new obsession in my routine. Using this straightener has always left my (fine) hair sleek, soft, and shiny. It actually motivates me to take the best care of my hair and I get excited when I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously owned a Chi, which was my first flat iron. I cannot believe how unnatural it felt grip-wise compared to this or how quickly it became grimy. Not to mention I would sometimes get a dry/damaged texture after use and it became unpredictable whether it would actually heat up or not. NO WHERE near as good as the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started my search already thinking I would pay close to $100 for something rated well. Nope!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT second guess this purchase! I HIGHLY recommend!! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this straightener is a bestseller bc this was the worst sraightener that I have ever used! It didnt get hot enough to straighten my hair. I returned this junk right away. Dont waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> I had never used a hair straightener before.  I had bought a cheaper model at my grocery store, and it was not too bad, but it got too hot for my fine hair.  I read reviews of this model at Amazon and other sites, and I thought it was the right one for me.  There are many straighteners of higher price than this, but the HSI is perfect for my hair, heats up quickly, easy to use.  I definitely recommend this, you will be happy you bought it.</li>
    <li> After having my old straightening iron for years, it was time for a new one. This iron received great reviews which is why I went with it. I have only had it for a week, but it&#x27;s worked great so far! My hair straightens ok with a dryer, but the HSI straightener helps give my hair the salon look/feel. I love having the case it came in for traveling. And it came with a sample bottle of oil which worked great and will also be great for traveling! I read some comments about people not liking where the shut off switch was (inside) but I really like it there. I have a young child who shouldn&#x27;t be near it anyways but having the switch hidden inside works out great. It&#x27;s very easy to use as well. Overall, it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> It does what it needs to do, I love it . Leaves my hair straight. Plus it came with it&#x27;s little pouch, .and a mini free oil for hair. But my bottle was empty since spilled. So that sucked. But as far as the Straightener,  it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Flat iron gets very hot quick. This flat iron is excellent. I would recommend this flat iron to every one.</li>
    <li> so i purchased this based on reviews. i had the wet to straight black flat iron and loved it. shouldve kept it it straightened my hair faster because its thicker but this one did the job good as well. hopefully. itll get better and will make my curls look good too. it feels cheaply made but its a great flat iron not worth the price but yeah. ill see if it gets better.</li>
    <li> Very great product.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason it is 4 stars instead of 5 is because of no automatic shut off which I think is important.</li>
    <li> When I first received the flat iron, I was really pleased with how quickly it came and how it looked. When I tried to turn it on, it would not. I tried everything, and finally gave up. I emailed Blue Novelties and told them the dilemma, they immediately asked if I wanted a replacement. The replacement was here within 2 days, and it works great. I&#x27;m very pleased with how helpful they were.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for someone based on all the great reviews here on Amazon. I&#x27;m a guy so I have no personally used this but it was relayed back to me that the straightener was excellent. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, don&#x27;t be - it&#x27;s great and been \\&quot;female approved\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I received my 1\\&quot; HSI Flat Iron within a few days of having ordered, which was perfect since I needed it as soon as possible.  Everything promised was included.  After trying it for the first time, I found that it straightened as well as my roommate&#x27;s $120 Babyliss straightener, though a few more passes were necessary.  Heated up quickly and stayed hot.  My hair is of medium thickness, full of volume, and wavy in every direction, but the HSI made it stay straight and soft all day, despite the humid and hot Florida weather.  For $40, this was a terrific purchase and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am usually a blow dry and go type of girl until my hairdresser started straightening my hair at each visit. I loved the look of the pencil straight style to kinda glamor up my look. But certainly did not want to pay the crazy amount of money some straighteners are. And I thought it was about time to replace my walmart conair brand which everyone knows does not do much of anything. I read the reviews on this product and thought it was worth the money to try it. Love love love it! Definitely recommend. My hair looks like my stylist did it. The only complaint, which might be a user problem is it kinda snags or pulls my hair at times. But that might just be from lack of experience with using a flat iron. I am very pleased with this product. I have straight hair that is not fine but not thick either. This helps keep the flyaways down and allows for a super straight look.</li>
    <li> The iron came quickly and as described.  It works great and feels comfortable.  The only negative I can think of is the plug in is big and I can&#x27;t use it in the same outlet as my hair dryer.  Not a huge problem because I have 2 outlets in the bathroom, but it may be a consideration if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and came with a nice pouch to store it in.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after reading and researching online for a high quality flat iron.  This was a great choice for me.</li>
    <li> I now understand why professional products are so much better!  My hair is NOT that difficult...I was just using junk tools until this straightener. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a very effective product.  My only criticism is that the controls are hard to get at.  Why can&#x27;t they just be on the outside rather than tucked in between the two iron portions?  It works very well.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better. It looks healthier with plenty of body and bounce.  I also love the curl I can get now.  Just wish it had an automatic shutoff.  But otherwise it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my Croc, tried a Solia and didn&#x27;t care for it.  Would of went back to the Croc but it was my third one and we&#x27;ll the have the best plates I grew tired of them only lasting a year.  This one works good, heats up quick and gets HOT.  But it&#x27;s not a smooth as the Croc  so 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Works really good for me :)  For the price, I would say it is worth it.  I think it is well made.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. Usually my hair gets frizzy or big, but not with this one. The temp gets hot and my hair was straight.</li>
    <li> This vendor is really very good and this is a great product.  I bought one before which I lost and now have bought 2 more.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the fence about buying a new straightener because of the cost, but my hair dresser convinced me it would make the difference. She said the HSI was the way to go, much better than the CHI and she couldn&#x27;t have been more right! I live in Florida and have very fine hair that never dries straight. This straightener is a godsend for the humidity coming on this summer. It heats up quickly, handles easily, and works wonders. Definitely a great buy AND free shipping!</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I&#x27;m so happy with it! The temp is easy to control and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good quality flat iron for a long time. My hair is relaxed and I dont like to apply too much heat to my hair. With other irons I would have to keep going over the same section of hair to get the results I want. By that time, my hair would be dried out. With this iron, I can go over a section of hair 1 time and see nice results. Its shiny and silky. I may go over 1 more time but my hair is not dried out. My hair moves.  I love that they included a small bottle of HSI Argan Oil. It really compliments the iron. I am pleased with my purchase. I am getting rid of the tools I have from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was great and It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I like the flat iron for the most part.  It seems to constantly go back to the red light meaning it isn&#x27;t to the desired temperature. I hardly see the green light on it. I have really thick super curly hair and I have it on the highest setting so maybe that is why it keeps cooling off but I am not used to that.  I have a 1.5 inch flat iron that is fantastic and so going to a 1 inch was a little difficult but not too bad.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all which is great. It does a great job on my daughters super fine hair but we rarely straighten hers.  All in all a good product I just expected a great one.</li>
    <li> Who knows?  After all the rave reviews, I received this yesterday in the mail and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth it.  Immediately upon getting home, I plugged it in and tried it out.  I have a high quality curling iron that I bought directly from a salon with a digital temperature gauge on it that normally curls my hair at 375 degrees perfectly.  After letting the flat iron warm up, I attempted to straighten my hair and it didn&#x27;t do much.  I turned the heat all the way up thinking that maybe the temperature just needed to be hotter.  I let it warm for a few more minutes then attempted the same thing again.  It didn&#x27;t do more than the $14.99 Conair that I keep as a back-up from five years ago.  So all in all, I don&#x27;t think this is worth the money and it&#x27;s certainly nothing to write home about.  Disappointed to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Aside from the above statements on the product itself, the customer service for this company is stellar.  I was immediatley contacted about the issues that I had for the product and a replacement was sent out right away.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron straightener! My hair tends to be hard to straighten and with this straightener its so easy, and also looks healthy and shiny :) so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this straightener since it was such a great deal. However it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough (even on the hottest setting) to straighten and keep my hair straight. I found myself having to go over the hair multiple times to get it straight, then half an hour later it was getting wavy again. Also when it arrived the bottle of oil had completely emptied itself over everything in the box so it was a mess. I&#x27;m not sure if the straightener is defective or just damaged from the oil leak. Other people have commented on how they received a defective straightener and had a new one sent, so that&#x27;s what I am going to try to do as well!</li>
    <li> I had bought this flat iron in september, and I don&#x27;t know if I dropped it (probably) or what, but one of the plates got a huge crack in it. I was really bummed out since this is one of the only heat products that manages to curl my aesthetically coarse looking, but actually pretty fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t curl curl it like some prom/wedding hairdo, but I can get waves in. It also, obviously, does a great job of straightening my hair so it is super flat, and it feels nice - not dry.  Anyway, to send it to HSI and get it repaired would have cost more than just buying a new one, so I bought a new one. The shipping was faster the first time I bought this, but still awfully fast for this one (both were purchased from blue novelties). Obviously if one of the plates cracks again, I&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s a product issue, but for now this is a great flat iron, especially for the price. My other flat iron is the much bigger chi, which was about triple the price of this one, and I use this one more.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! Does exactly what it says and is high quality. Very pleased with the price I paid also.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before ordering and I fully agree. Great product. Definitely combine this with the Argan oil. Makes my hair smooth and it has been less dry and people have been complimenting me on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far, but really like it.. purchased it for when I work out at work and need something at the gym for after.  So it will be perfect for that.  Heats fast, with multiple settings..</li>
    <li> This is a nice flat iron.  I got a good deal on it but otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t pay retail for it.  It is a little heavy and the temp. dial is kind of hard to get to due to the location of it.  It is located on the inside of the iron and has a little dial that you need to adjust.  It does heat up quickly. I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks but so far I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> The cable is a non-professional one. In the cable you can see if the flat irons are going to be good or not. I bought this to replace a professional flat iron and I am not happy. The iron will work but is not the best. You need to pass it several times on your hair to style it.</li>
    <li> It takes FOREVER to heat up then loses heat with minimal use. It doesn&#x27;t have an auto shutoff, the plates are not smooth when passed over hair and the dial and switch are on the inside where your hair can catch on them.  Ugh! Hate it.</li>
    <li> This styler is barely average - nothing extraordinary at all. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the $190+ &#x27;regular&#x27; price and paid the $40-  which it&#x27;s hardly worth. The flat iron feels very light/cheaply made and after the second use, the plates began pulling my hair. I would recommend another brand all the way.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flatiron.  I had been wanting to purchase for awhile but through HSI the flatiron was triple the price.  Amazon had it on sale for $49 and with free shipping I couldn&#x27;t beat it.  It is all that was promised.  I think it is very good quality and to my surprise, it came with a FREE storage bag AND a sample of the Argon Oil.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  I highly recommend this flatiron to everyone.  THANKS for the GREAT DEAL AMAZON!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, should have bought the more expensive one though . I&#x27;m not used to this dial for the temperature settings, seems kind of old school</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I&#x27;d choose it because I read the other reviews, and I&#x27;m really not disappointed. First I wanted a cheaper one - now I&#x27;m happy that I did spent a bit more. It works great and is easy to use. Love the on-off button and the temperature button. My hair is shiny after use, and styling is easy. Love it! Great choice.</li>
    <li> Very nice straightener.  Controls are nicely located so you cannot accidently change them when using the straightener.  Works well.  The conditioning oil that came with the straightener works well also.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The description of the product did not match the item description on the box. The item I received was not an ionic flat iron. I returned the item to the vendor. The item was sent back to me as \\&quot;Refused to Accept\\&quot;. After I spent $11.45 returning this item [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]The company&#x27;s answer was to resend the item back again. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!</li>
    <li> I have been using this flat iron for about a month on a daily basis and I have thick hair.  I find it to be a nice flat iron.  It works as expected, has a heat control dial which I find helpful, and is easy to use and hold in my hand.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had been using a cheap straightener and felt her hair was getting cooked and damaged with each use. When this product went on sale I just couldn&#x27;t resist getting it for her. After a week of use I asked her how she liked it and she said \\&quot;I love it!\\&quot;. Her hair is no longer \\&quot;cooking\\&quot; when she straightens it, thanks to this product. P</li>
    <li> I researched flat irons, before buying this model.  I was looking for a ceramic plated flat iron, with temperature control, and this item had both of those features.  I am a hairdresser, and this item is a professional product.  The flat iron works great, and it makes my hair very shiny and healthy looking.  I use a heat protectant spray on my hair, before using the iron, and I keep it below 300 degrees, because I have blonde fine hair.  This iron is of superior quality, at a fraction of the price you&#x27;d pay elsewhere, for the same quality iron.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have a high standard for my straighteners. My old one has been used for years now and is kinda wearing out so I needed a new one. After reading lots of reveiws about this product I was excited about it and for the price it seemed like a good deal. It came in good timing , but when I used it i was very disapointed. My old one worked better then this one!! I have to say the price is what you get it. It was terrible. I have wavy hair and need something that works well. This did not. Bummer</li>
    <li> After purchasing and returning another reasonably priced flat iron at a local beauty store, I was skeptical that the HSI ceramic tourmaline flat iron was going to be any different, but it was!  This flat iron glides through my hair without pulling and does a great job at styling my hair!  I like that it has heat settings that you can adjust. It is a great buy and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used drug store brand flat irons, and name brand flat irons to flat iron my long, thick, frizzy, coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My trusty Jilbere tourmaline flat iron  that gave me pin-straight hair finally stopped working properly after 6 years, so I needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews on this one impressed me so I bought it. I wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression: It came with so much extra... the glove and bag and sample of oil... it looked nice and professional. I plugged it in and let it heat up and tried it out. It didn&#x27;t even get as hot as my worn out flat iron. That was to be expected. This advertises 410 degrees and my semi-broken flat iron got up to 450.  Several passes later and my hair looked nice and shiny, but just wasn&#x27;t sleek like I was hoping. Also, the plates wouldn&#x27;t stay hot at all. After about 3 passes, I could tell it wasn&#x27;t working efficiently and the light on the iron was red (meaning it was not up to temp)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron leaves my hair needing touch ups through the day and never gets my hair as straight or sleek like I have come to expect from a good straightener.  My hair does not stand up to humidity well when I use this flat iron. Usually after flat ironing my hair, I can sleep on it and wake up with hair that will brush straight, but with this flat iron I have to re-straighten my hair in the morning because it is full of kinks and waves that simply will not brush out. I tested it on my blunt bangs and it didn&#x27;t do well there, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this flat iron also takes a lot of effort to use. In order to get my hair to straighten instead of just get hot, I have clamp the plates together harder than on any other flat iron I have ever used. It has doubled or tripled my styling time between it being ineffective with heat and needing frequent touch ups because the underwhelming results are short lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointing, and after such glowing reviews. I wish I hadn&#x27;t tossed my former flat iron. The only thing wrong with that one was that it would only heat up when clamped. I would prefer dealing with that and getting good results instead of all the woes that came with this flat iron. I am buying a replacement after 4 months of having the flat iron blues with this so-called straightener. I am willing to bet a $20-$30 drugstore brand will give me better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I will say that the oil sample it came with is amazing! I like that this has a light that turns red when heating and green when up to temperature. I like the placement of the temperature dial because I never once accidentally turned down the heat or turned it off while styling like I have with some other flat irons. Short list of positives that don&#x27;t outweigh the negatives.at iron. The only thing wrong with that one was that it would only heat up when clamped.

    <li> This is a great product and heats up really fast! It is lightweight, just the right size and glides over hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener works as well as the professional model my hairdresser uses, at half the cost, I&#x27;m sure.  The plates heat up fast, while you control the temperature.  The iron glides through my hair, leaving my hair smooth and shiny, as promised.  It comes with a nice, insulated bag for travel, and a glove to use to protect your hand.  I do not see the need for the glove, as the handles are insulated with plenty of padding.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up quickly and holds heat well. The price is unbeatable! No need to buy any of those expensive irons any longer.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product, is as expected. The included oil made my hair very soft and shiny. I have waist length long hair and was able to get it straightened (as well as my daughter&#x27;s) in record time.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have thick wavy hair and this straightens it out without  having to use too much heat</li>
    <li> *This was a 5 star review from my first week*: This straightener works well, a little less heat then my previous one, but at least it doesnt pull out myhair! Was nice that the seller included a bottle of oil for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I had a Ionika before I purchased this one. I owned it for 3 years! So, it was time to get another. (Note: I straighten my hair EVERY DAY, at night with a Remington Wet - Straight and then in the morning with a ceramic to get the fly away&#x27;s... so it it&#x27;s used) I read my reviews, was going to go for the same but as I am a religious Amazon-er I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this so I ordered...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great the fist week, then I noticed my hair getting stuck in the sides where the plates attach.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is that 8 months of using it and one day it literally blows up while I&#x27;m using it! It popped and sparked as I was doing my hair! I quickly unplugged it and let my husband inspect it. He noticed the cord where it swivels was open and the wires were visible. Now I understand that you can not wrap the cord as this causes wear, I use it and then store it in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was unbelievable to me as to how I could own one for 3 years (using and storing it the same way) and then this just break down in less than a year. I am VERY UNHAPPY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will go for the Remington, as I have been using the Wet - Straight for 4 years now.</li>
    <li> Love my new straightener. Had a Chi for about 5 years now , no problems with it , but wanted to try something new. So far, so good  This HSI was less than half of what I paid for my chi. Heats up super fast and handles well. Hair is de frizzed in no time. I have the digital model ,my one complaint is the digital read is on the inside of the straightener. Hard to get at the buttons with my big hands.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on recommendations from other people who have it too. This is beautiful, very practical and handy, works fast and in excellent condition. The service is amazingly fast, friendly, customer-oriented. It is highly recommendable to everyone who loves to have their hair done beautifully!</li>
    <li> Great Seller. Item just as described!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Appears to be nicely made and the controls are easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value for such a professional product.  My daughter got this for Christmas a couple years ago and we just bought this one as second one for her to keep when she visits her dad&#x27;s house.  My daughter has extremely thick and curly hair and this flat iron gives her the chance to have sleek, straight hair with very little effort.</li>
    <li> the quality of the iron is not as good as i expected.</li>
    <li> Love that this flat iron leaves my hair straight.</li>
    <li> excellent !!! we have two girls so now no fighting or wineing...BTW this is our second  HSI IRON...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but you have to pay careful attention to temperature.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Pulls my hair!!!! Doesn&#x27;t straighten nearly as good as my CHI OR H2PRO. Going back to either one of those. This was a horrible buy based off of such &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; reviews. I realize now these reviews must&#x27;ve been written by people who have NEVER owned a chi or h2pro. And must have perfectly smooth straight hair already. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Spend a little more and get the chi or h2pro</li>
    <li> Great deal, however it did not work well on my hair and had the tendency to pull my hair at the ends.</li>
    <li> good size for travel. works ok. just not as strong and powerful as I expected.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t ever buy another kind of straightener!</li>
    <li> Great straightner for the price. Works very well on my hair.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron. My sister is a hair dresser and she even bought this one after she used mine. Get it!</li>
    <li> Does not glide through hair as well as thought it would.</li>
    <li> It works, but I prefer my Croc. Great as a spare. My hair is super thick, super long, and wavy/curly no  perms. Have to use it on high but doesn&#x27;t get my hair stick straight.</li>
    <li> The price is reasonable and with the right heat protection, the flat iron works perfect!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use hair straightening irons too often, so I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s best.  But, this one works very well compared to the drugstore brands.  I have thin, but lots of it, wavy curly hair.  It straightens it fast without burning it.</li>
    <li> This was a great BUY.</li>
    <li> Love my new straightener! It was everything advertised!</li>
    <li> I just got this for my daughter who has naturally red, curly hair and we love it. It has always been hard for her to get her hair really straight, but not with this. We love the smooth texture of the plates. They do not pull at all. I gave it four stars because she does have to go over the sections with two or three swipes to straighten it. For the price, this is awesome!</li>
    <li> It works fine.  I wish I could have found a small flat iron to take to Europe, but this one has dual voltage.</li>
    <li> This is good for the price. I have to go over the same hair a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to buy a straightener that I had never heard of before. I have always used CHI products, but when my last one stopped working, I decided to try another brand. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER!! You also can&#x27;t beat that price! I would (and have) recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> Like it but wish it were wider.  :  )</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick &amp; wavy and this works better than the last 2 CHI Irons I have purchased.  AWESOME! Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Daughter uses this daily.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. This is my third, and definitely the best. Gets my wavy/frizzy hair straight with a little curl on the end. Also comes with a glove and a little sample of their oil.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking. Easy to use. Love it</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over 3 years now with no problems! Love it!</li>
    <li> Heats fast even at only moderate temperature. Doing great in both straightening and curling.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this straightner! Bought other irons at this price and they were very cheaply made. I think the quailty of this one is compared to the $100+ models.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and enclosed accessories. It came as described, arrived quickly, and so far appears to be great value for the money. No complaints from me. I&#x27;ve very pleased to have not had to spend yet another $200 plus on a competing brand to get exactly the same results; highly recommending to friends and relatives as a \\&quot;value plus\\&quot; purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Good price.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Got my very tight curly hair silt straight!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and straightens quickly too! Doesn&#x27;t fry your hair at all. Definitely recommend. (I have thick wavy hair)</li>
    <li> One word...&lt;br /&gt;JUNK- save your money. I spent $15 on a Revelon that works better than this. The rounded part is rough and snags your hair. Planning&lt;br /&gt;To return ASAP.</li>
    <li> Works perfect on my hair. My hair type is not straight but not curly and with a lot of frizz</li>
    <li> Great!!  Love it!!!  It really does an amazing job straightening my hair.  I am thinking I may have to buy a second one as I need to keep one for emergency.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the HSI flat iron for about a week. I love it. Very comparable to the Chi, but cheaper. Does not leave my hair burnt or smelling like burnt hair. Able to curl my hair as well with it with no problems.</li>
    <li> EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!!!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good flat iron, however it just didn&#x27;t work for my hair.  I have fine hair and this seemed to pull it and snag.  It also left my hair smelling a little burnt, even using my flat iron protector.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the rave reviews. Well I got it out of the package and immediately started a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fancy satin pouch or the free Argan oil. This flat iron just feels so CHEAP. It&#x27;s completely plastic and feels all too light in your hand--not sturdy at all. And it didn&#x27;t really cool down for me fast enough. I also didn&#x27;t like that its plugs was one of those vertical ones that take up a bunch of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an FHI flat iron that has springs underneath the plates. Much better grip on hair without pulling, and the handles feel like they&#x27;re metal and much more substantial. Did I mention that I got it for less money than this? Blah.</li>
    <li> Works well on the highest heat setting</li>
    <li> Works great, super company to deal with would buy from again</li>
    <li> This is a great Flat Iron and what a great price!  It heats quickly, does not leave any &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; smell that even my chi did and I loved the Argon oil sample - I am addicted!</li>
    <li> very good product, would recommend it</li>
    <li> It does amazing on my hair. Leaves it feeling very soft &amp; silky. A great straightener!! A steal for the price :) Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is how slick the design is so while i&#x27;m straightening if i&#x27;m going fast, it will slip in my hand &amp;/or fall off the counter b/c of no grip. However, this is easy to work around. Now I don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
    <li> I had a CHI before but I got tired at how easily they break so I was trying to find something cheaper. I had other cheap straighteners before that worked pretty well, this is not one of them. I had to return this straightener because it wasn&#x27;t working well (it would turn on when I plugged it in rather than when turning the &#x27;ON&#x27; button on). It burnt my hair really bad too, I only used it twice and it took months for my hair to recover and I have really healthy hair. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Didnt like the dial for heat settings to hard to see. Didnt seem to get hot enough.</li>
    <li> I bought a cheap flat iron while out of town because I forgot mine.  Like it so much I put his one away and never use it.  Expensive and no better that a $20 iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses it regularly and it really makes a difference to the texture of her hair. She uses it at a low setting with the oil, so no damage. She&#x27;s really happy with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron! Heats evenly and quickly! Feels heavy and seems to be of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> It even came with a silk bag for the iron, a little bottle, and a glove so you don&#x27;t get burned</li>
    <li> Not bad. Received on time and great packaging, however when flat ironing hair to the tips of hair, bits of hair was caught in iron. For this reason, I will be returning. Otherwise not a bad product.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that my hair takes after my Italian and Native American ancestors, so we are talking dark, THICK, curly hair that is waist length because haircuts are an all day event I do not care for. I was using a 10 year old, cheap straightener that did not do a wonderful job. I ended with frizz and it didn&#x27;t glide through my hair like my hsi does- I bought it way back when because it had big plates, and I that it would reduce my styling time. The hsi is small by comparison, but works so much faster. I just did my hair in 15 minutes.  I do to insist on it all being stick straight- I just want to tame it, get the wave by the roots straightened, and give it a natural  straighter look. I do have to section it a lot, so to have the job done so fast is unheard of!  The best thing is that it lays flat at the end, like it does after it&#x27;s been straightened at a salon. I am so in love with this iron, and I honestly hate to do my hair. This is an amazing deal.  So glad I read the reviews and went for it!</li>
    <li> I have natural african american hair. I have used Chi in the past and after 5 years, it was time for a replacement. I read the reviews and loved the price. This flat iron is no comparison to my Chi, in regards to straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> Worked great for 2 years then crapped out. Not a very good investment, considering the one it replaced lasted 8.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron in February of 2014 and it only lasted about 6 months. The heating element went nuts and started to over heat, finally it got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t even heat up. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this almost daily. It straightens nicely and does a much better job on her frizz then some of the brands we have tried.</li>
    <li> it works as good as the much more expensive brands</li>
    <li> Love it, easy to use. Straighten hair really well.</li>
    <li> Pulls your hair at the end</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, amazing quality! I&#x27;ve used various flat irons over the years, both professional (CHI, Paul Mitchell, Babyliss) as well as drug store brands. This one is hands down the best. Superior quality! Very sturdy iron, cord is long and also great quality. Was pleasantly surprised to see the box included a sample of Argan Oil, which smells amazing, a super plush carrying pouch, and even a thermal glove to protect your hand! I also purchased the HSI Thermal Protectant Spray which smells amazing (like high quality Moroccan Oil).&lt;br /&gt;This iron made my fine, wavy, slightly frizzy hair SHINE like justice and feel so silky. This iron makes me want to straighten my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Men, buy your ladies this fabulous iron!</li>
    <li> My wife loves how frizz-free and smooth her hair feels but reason for the 4 stars is that she wishes it was hotter. But it could be the hotter the iron, the more frizz she would get so maybe she&#x27;ll grow to adore it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the HSI !!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! I get a lot of compliments when I flat iron my hair. My God daugter has curly hair and she could never find a good flat iron to straighten her hair. I used the HSI iron on her one day and her hair was straight. She loved it so much that i bought one for her too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful flat iron! Looks like a miracle running through my coarse hair. Easy to use, easy to store, absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> The Girlfriend loves it. Temperature control works well</li>
    <li> I was looking for flat iron to replace by Chi Ultra and this one seemed to have great reviews and the price was great too. After using it for a couple of months I can tell you it is a great flat iron. It heats quickly and straightens my hair well. The only reason I left off a star is because I don&#x27;t love the plates on the iron as much as my chi, it just seems like it doesn&#x27;t glide over my hair as smoothly.</li>
    <li> My co-workers saw my hair after using this and thought I had just gotten a new Keratin Treatment!  I haven&#x27;t had a Keratin in over 2 months and just used this flat iron for the first time along with the sample Argan oil it came with!  AMAZING results, and the price is perfect!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price</li>
    <li> My hair is very difficult to manage and this straightener works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Was skeptical because of the price but it works great for the low cost!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when my friend and I decided to each buy one of these. The price was ridiculously cheap, but the reviews were all amazing. Now we can both say we love our straighteners and are so glad we found this product on amazon. Thank you for supplying a solid product with great quality at such a steal! My friend and I are definitely happy shoppers! The packaging is amazing as well and I love how high the temperature goes. In a matter of seconds the straightener is burning hot and ready for usage. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Great flat irons ever.........</li>
    <li> Daughter in law loved the iron</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, it&#x27;s exactly as described and works perfectly the way I expected it to.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. As good as the most expensive one.</li>
    <li> This straightner does a great job, but I recently noticed a crack down the center of the hot plate. Now it pulls my hair while using it. I have only had it since July and use care while using, traveling with, and storing it. I have no idea how it cracked, but it is very disappointing to spending money on an item that no longer can be used to its full extent. Other than the crack, it is a great straightener and leaves your hair looking smooth and shiny!</li>
    <li> easy to use, adjustable heat control is good</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had. Works great</li>
    <li> Great Straightener, especially with the argan oil. Leaves hair super shiny and smooth, everyone at work asked if I got highlights the first time I used it. It also arrived 3 days after ordering it even though it was just standard shipping. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and I have been using a straightener every day for probably about six years, and it&#x27;s taken me ages to find the perfect straightener.  The HSI Professional is that perfect straightener.  I used to be an avid Chi user, but after I went through two Chis in the past year because they kept breaking, I thought I would give something else a try.  Chis are great (at first), but if you&#x27;re going to pay over $100 for a straightener, it should last for more than six months, wouldn&#x27;t you think?  The HSI is a great price and a fantastic straightener - it even straightens my hair better than my Chi used to!  Don&#x27;t waste your  money on anything else - this is seriously the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
    <li> For the price can&#x27;t complain at all, the pouch very nice and the glove.  My daughter loves it, she gave me the old one we had that I paid $150 and she kept this one.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this iron.  It glides thru my hair with ease and makes my hair silky smooth.  Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  My old one was dying so I chose a good replacement!</li>
    <li> I did my rebonding with this iron and now my hair is silky and straight! greatly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had been using the InStyler fora out three years when it broke. I couldn&#x27;t decide between getting a new one or going with a regular flat iron. After seeing all the good reviews and feedback about the HSI flat iron I decided to get it instead and I&#x27;m so glad I did! The price is amazing and it&#x27;s definitely worth the value. My hair is super long, so long it ends at my belt line, so it&#x27;s hard to find products that can handle it. This flat iron makes my hair feel smooth, soft, and look so shiny, even better than the InStyler did! It heats up ridiculously fast too..I&#x27;m not exactly sure how fast, but a couple minutes at the most, so it saves time in the mornings. I&#x27;ve used Chi flat irons before too, and I really disliked the results. The HSI is perfect!</li>
    <li> I never thought investing in a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; flat iron was necessary, but it makes such a difference. I have thick hair so I use this on the highest setting and it keeps my long bob smooth and sleek for up to three days.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the money. Much better than my last one which was close to $200. One pass and my hair is smooth and straight , doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw. Highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love this ceramic iron.  I bought one for myself last year and use it at least three times per week.  It is easy to use, fits in your hand comfortably, heats up quickly, and takes half the time from start to finish than any other flat iron I have ever had.  I have really thick hair and it used to take me around an hour to completely straighten my hair.  Since I started using this product, it takes me around twenty minutes from start to finish.  I love it so much, I caught them on sale during Cyber Monday and bought one for my sister, mother in law, cousin, and best friend for Christmas.  They always want to borrow mine because &amp;#34;it is faster than mine&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it is easier to work with&amp;#34;.  Maybe this will keep them from wanting to borrow mine all the time.  Great product.  I never want to buy anything else.  Mine is over a year old and still functions just as good as the day I received it.</li>
    <li> This HSI flat iron works so much better than the CHI iron I had. Love the temperature control and how smooth it slides down my long hair. Sturdy made and easy to control. Great product......highly recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this to work overseas in the UK, Denmark, Paris, and Spain, and it worked perfectly with only a plug converter, no voltage converter needed!</li>
    <li> i really dont know where all the 5 stars comes from.&lt;br /&gt;but i would give a 4.&lt;br /&gt;i bought this back in 2011, and im still using it.&lt;br /&gt;i used it more often back in 2011 when i didnt do the Japanese straightening.&lt;br /&gt;from what i remembered it was just okay, not worth the $70 i paid for.&lt;br /&gt;now i only use it few months out of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recently i dropped it and one corner of the ceramic came off.&lt;br /&gt;im not sure if it will have any influences on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;i gave a 4 star because it lasted me all these year and its a good investment.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Great product for good price.  Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with this hair straightener.  I purchased this based on all the high reviews, but for some reason this did not work for my hair.  I have fine hair and lots of it, and the flat iron had difficulty moving down the shaft without snagging.  The constant tugging on my hair and the pain it induced is not worth it.  I purchased a CHI which works much better, so the HSI is being returned.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Straightens hair well and curls well too. An added plus is that it helps stop humidity, which I appreciated since I live in a humid area. Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Loved product -  performed everything that was written about it.  Just got back from international vacation and travel size and dual plug worked well.  No &amp;#34;fly-away&#x27;s&amp;#34; with this hair product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for over a 1 year now and I love it. It had never failed on me, it leaves my hair super straight and works very well :)</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair. It&#x27;s healthy but the underneath has been getting more and more crinkled curly as I get older. I have had several flat irons and nothing would straightened those problematic areas even with product. I took a Chan e with the HS1 Professional iron and so glad I Did. The argon oil that was provided is great and I usually have oily hair at my roots by the end of the da.  The argon oil didn&#x27;t even affect that at all! Very Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I wish I would never have purchased this item. It just tears my hair up. I have been using the Chi since they came out many many years ago and have never had any problems.(I don&#x27;t need educated on the temperature settings either, I&#x27;m not a dummy)  This is going right in the trash and I will be purchasing the Chi again. You definitely get what you pay for. So very disappointed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice straightener. When I got the product I was a bit off put by the packaging, since it looked like it had been potentially used. The sample of argan oil was nice so I got over the packaging quickly. Heats quickly, leaves shiny hair behind. Only concern is that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to have some sort of internal heat control, you need to be careful where you leave it (as with all heated things, I suppose). Recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my wife after her telling me she was ready for a new Chi.  I purchased this as an alternative to the Chi after reading the multiple positive reviews.  She has used it for 2-3 weeks now hoping that things would get better.  She has told me that this iron is not as good as the Chi and does not heat up as quickly either.  She has stated that she is not impressed at all with it and will save up some money as to buy a Chi again.  The seller shipped the item quickly and there is no issue on that end but as far as the product goes it is by her description just \\&quot;okay.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> June of 2012 I bought the HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron.  I love how shiny and straight it makes my very coarse, thick, wavy hair.  Last Friday, my iron suddenly wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I tried a number of things, but none seemed to work.  I contacted Blue Novelties through Amazon.  They responded quickly especially considering it was the weekend. Amazon kept track of my communications with Blue Novelties.  They were so very helpful. My flat iron is working again thanks to their suggestions. And now I can continue to have the shiny straight hair that I love.  Thanks to Blue Novelties and Amazon.</li>
    <li> A \\&quot; so so\\&quot; product. Not any better than a drug store brand, def not \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot;. Works ok but not as well as described</li>
    <li> I should start by saying I don&#x27;t have super curly hair. If you do then I don&#x27;t know if this is the product for you, but it could be. My hair just has enough of a wave to it to make it look like I don&#x27;t care enough to do my hair so I straighten it to get it to look right. I really like this straightener. It was a good price and it does a good job. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
    <li> As often attested to by others, I am not good at doing my own hair.  I am especially unskilled at using heated appliances, or at least so I thought.  For the first time, I can straighten my hair at home and it looks like salon quality. I am getting compliments from family, friends, and even at the hair salon. I never felt that I could straightened my own hair before using this product.  I finally have the right straigthening iron and I am now excited about doing my own hair.  Thanks HSI.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron for a great price! I have only owned Chi and Paul Mitchell irons in the past and thought this iron for less than half the price would not compare. I was proved wrong! This is an amazing iron for my natually wavy hair, as I only have to run it through once to get it completely straight. Def on the same level if not better than Chi irons.</li>
    <li> What I thought were some amazing flat irons at first turned out to be the shortest life span ever. These worked perfect the 1st time, then they stopped getting hot. I only used these one time, so the life span is very short on these. I contacted the seller and there was no option to replace only to refund my money. I would have liked another pair since they worked great at first. One star for one usage :*(.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Flat iron as a gift for my daughter so I have not used it myself.  She was skeptical because she had wanted a Chi.  I purchased the HSI because of all the good ratings and reviews.  After trying it she called and said she loved it. It looks very professional and expensive.  It also comes in a nice box and has a pretty satin storage bag.</li>
    <li> Received product in great time, in great shape, and it works awesome. Would definitely recommend to a friend and order another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this straighner because of all the good reviews. I was not impressed at all. I have thin hair and all it did was pull my hairs. It didn&#x27;t really help with the frizz either. I bought a ultra chi instead and it did wonders!! They are always on sale at ulta</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a ceramic straightener which would heat up fast and work well.  Friends recommended me this product and CHI product. I can&#x27;t compare these two but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.  Good quality product and fair pricing</li>
    <li> I love this ceramic flat iron for straightening and styling -- one of the best. It was a gift from my son based on my wish list which made me love it even more. However, I have a safety concern that it does not have auto shut off which has caused me to give it up. It was really hard to give up, but I absentmindedly left it on and went out on errands only to return home and detect a scorched smell and scorched surface on the resting mat. Aha -- I realize that I need a safer mat too. Thus I have purchased a new ceramic iron with adjustable auto shut off, and I am buying a thermal mat for safety also. Indeed, a lesson learned!</li>
    <li> Company was great and refunded money quickly.  The iron was either defective or fake.  It didn&#x27;t get hot enough and definitely didn&#x27;t slide smoothly through hair.  I always dried it straight first and it still didn&#x27;t make it flat.</li>
    <li> I used the flat iron and it performed much better than any other I have used in the past. I am happy with this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new flat iron, and I love it. I never knew what it was like to use a decent one until now.</li>
    <li> I thought that I would never find a better flat iron than the CHI or FHI.  Surprisingly, I have had a much better experience with this HSI straightener. These irons are the best.  They give you the salon quality that we all tend to seek at home.  I am so glad to have purchased this flat iron and I am just as excited about the buying process through this seller.  This was an awesome and smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> I loved the packaging the box and the travel bag.  The flat iron worked perfectly, it maintained  the temperature straightened and curled my hair.  I did not have any problems with my flat iron.</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping first of all. The flat iron is as good as the other reviewers have said. It came with a very nice pouch, the amazing argan oil, and a glove to avoid burns on hands. Very fast heat up, dual voltage which is great for traveling.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is mediocre at best. I have very curly mixed race hair and have used flat irons extensively, this one is no good. It didn&#x27;t feel smooth during use and the results were frizzy and unacceptable. Best of all, the plug broke (we&#x27;re talking complete failure with metal pieces falling out) after two, yes, TWO uses! It didn&#x27;t pull my hair like other irons I&#x27;ve used but that might be the only upshot here. My advice is to save up for a quality flat iron and stay far away away from this junk.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Remington flat iron until it died on me. I went to order a new one, but the great reviews on this one caught my eye.  I should have stuck with my old brand, it did a better job. My biggest complaint is that my hair gets snagged along the edges of the iron. It straightens my hair ok, but not without pulling out quite a bit of hair in the process. A lesser complaint is that my old flat would automatically shut off if left on too long. This one doesn&#x27;t. A feature I miss since occasionally I do forget to turn it off.  On the plus side, the argan oil that comes with it great.  It also comes with a nice travel pouch.</li>
    <li> I have to give kuddos to this hair straighter because it has been a great investment! It heats up fast and does a great job on straightening and curling my hair which is what I use it for. I had bought this straightner because I dropped my other one and broke it. (The ceramics plates broke) Not having the $150 to replace it I found this one on amazon for $40. It arrived before I was expecting it which was even better because I was using my old one that had broken ceramic plates and it was pulling my hair. Now I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times but so far so good. My only complaint is the plug. The plug is like the one on blow dryers. (big with the reset buttons). which means I can&#x27;t have it plugged in the same outlet with my blow dryer at the same time because they don&#x27;t fit. I normally like to blow dry my hair while the straightener is heating up. But with as fast as it heats up its been working out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this flat iron.  It has a variable temperature setting and it gets hot quickly.  What I like most so far is that the flattening surface is very smooth, meaning that my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in any part of the flat iron while I use it (as used to happen all of the time with my old flat iron).</li>
    <li> I have only used this once, but it worked great!  Great flat iron for the price!  I will have to update my review once I&#x27;ve used it more.  But so far so good!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I want it to. It also heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I can honesty say out of all the money I spent on flat irons ..these flat irons are the best.they straighting my think curly bones strsight....</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  The HSI proseeional flat iron is amazing; I will never buy another Chi.  It leaves my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love these Flat Iron, they work great with the HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil. Makes my hair soft and bouncy</li>
    <li> This straightener is so awesome and what makes it even more awesome is the price! The straightener paired with the HSI professional blow dryer has made my once frizzy hair, so soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great flat iron for the price.  It heats up fast, it straightens my wavy hair well in less time than my last flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It is by far one of the best products I own. I use it everyday and would reccomend it to anyone looking to buy one.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, this product, at this price point, not a good deal. Purchased 2 for family and both persons with different types of hair had similar feedback--&amp;#34;the flat iron just flat out didn&#x27;t straighten the hair.&amp;#34;  Disappointing performance and cannot recommend the product if the expectation is for salon straightened hair.</li>
    <li> I did not want to spend money on a chi,After reading reviews I decided to give it a try, plus I really needed a new flat iron asap.  Received the product used it right away, no other flat iron that I previously owned came close to this flat iron. Plates are awesome. Heats up fast, a long cord. Also makes my hair shinny. I would recommend this product to other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There where some things I was worried about.&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is jiggly.&lt;br /&gt;The heat setting seemed a little cooler then what temp I had it on. It may just be something I am not used to, I had to move it to med/high for it to be warm enough to straighten my hair with one pass.</li>
    <li> This straightener worked AMAZINGLY for a while, but its now 6 months later, IT DOES NOT WORK!! The red light just flashes and does not heat up, at all. I am extremely unhappy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I received my package very fast.  faster than I would&#x27;ve thought I would!  the flat iron is wonderful.  it glides right through my hair when I use it and doesn&#x27;t pull at all.  this flat iron should never receive any bad reviews.  for the ones of u who have it a bad  review,  you must of been one in a million. bc  I&#x27;ve already bought 2!  one for me and one for a  friend!  love love love it!</li>
    <li> Love my new HSI hair straightener!!! My hair looks great and feels great, especially with Argan oil use! Style holds very well for several days! Thanks again for a great product at such an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because my old one looked like it was about to fall apart. This flat iron gets really hot so watch out you don&#x27;t burn yourself. They even include a glove (I assume to keep you from burning the hand handling your hair) and a little bit of hair oil. I&#x27;ve had it two or three weeks now and I recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
    <li> This flat iron worked well for 5 months and then it died and I cannot be returned and there is no warranty.</li>
    <li> It works well. I guess for the price its not bad. It heats fast and the heat is even. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a very smooth iron but it felt rough and my hair would get caught between the plastic and ceramic parts and breaking it. Not happy. Going to try a Chi iron next time.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this flat iron for about a decade! I have very stubborn waves and curls that like to stick out everywhere when allowed to be free, and I&#x27;m so sick of having to spend forever scorching my hair in order to look put together. This flat iron smooths out my hair in one or two swipes on high heat, and I&#x27;m good to go in 15 minutes or less. Plus, the argan oil that came in the box makes my hair silky soft and smells so nice. HSI, where have you been all my life??</li>
    <li> So far I like this flat iron. I have to remember to turn it off since it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic one, but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem. The only other thing is that it has caught on my hair a couple of times.  I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price. This is the only one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The flat iron does a good job, but feels slightly heavy for holding and for flat ironing the hair.</li>
    <li> I have long and thick hair. I go to a stylist to have my hair straightened because I have used a few other flat irons and was never pleased with the results. Also, I paid a lot of money for them. I heard good reviews about the HSI and decided to give it a try. I have used the HSI twice and got great results. My hair is  soft and straight. The HSI is a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, especially for the price!  You&#x27;d think it was a very expensive straightener since it does all the same things a Chi or Jose E. brand but for a fraction of the cost!  I have very long wavy/curly hair and normal straighteners don&#x27;t work for me, like at all... at best my hair will just get a wave too it but never be completely straight.  This actually straightens my hair and it doesn&#x27;t take an hour to do it!!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the reset button issue, every time I plug it in i have to hit the rest button otherwise it won&#x27;t turn on so it takes me a couple of times of pushing the stupid buttons before it&#x27;s on.  Other than that i love it. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Chi straightener that had broken. I read tons of reviews on this before purchasing it and can happily say it lived up to it&#x27;s great reputation! It is even better than my Chi and was so much less. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a professional style straightener but not looking to pay crazy salon prices.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this item several times just to make sure. It&#x27;s not heating up properly at the highest capacity. I have to use it on same piece of hair several times. Also the red light appears constantly and has been shutting off. It&#x27;s totally defective.</li>
    <li> Small enough to get to the roots and get rid of the unwanted curls&lt;br /&gt;Comes with great extras, a glove, a bag for storage and a hair serum...&lt;br /&gt;Just loved it</li>
    <li> Heats well, but pulled hair.</li>
    <li> After reading all the awesome reviews, I got this for my daughter.  She has thicker hair with some curl, and it didn&#x27;t work at all on her hair.  She has a cheaper one that I bought for $30 and it works awesome!  She gave it to me since my hair in thinner and straight... and it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair either.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Occasionally does not blow hot enough but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> All of my friends have chi straighteners, but I decided to try this brand out, as it is cheaper than the chi but still a little more expensive than some in stores. I was hoping the old &amp;#34;you pay for quality&amp;#34; this was try, because I am in no way rich. It is really good quality, it comes with a little carrying case, and heats up quickly and can get very hot. I use a medium heat, but I turned it all the way up to get a sense of what the straightener can do. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned. I was skeptical because of the price I paid. 39.99 But the reviews made me try it and its a wonderful iron. Gets my thick hair super straight and silky. Works great on my daughters hair as well who has really textured wavy hair! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Works very well.  Thank you HSI for cutting my wife&#x27;s hair straightening time to a quarter of what it used to be. I no longer have to try and find something decent to watch on lacking local channels pulled from my dysfunctional antenna.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after misplacing a different off brand one. I was pleasantly surprised with this styling tool! I have ethnic hair and while my hair is healthy, its also extremely thick (even my hair stylist comments on this all the time). I hate pressing my own hair and will procrastinate as long as I can before doing it. It normally takes me such a long time to get it straight, but with this straightener, I literally cut that time in half. I especially like the sample Argon Oil that was included with this. It smells amazing and made my hair shiny without being heavy. I bought this based on the great reviews given by others, and I have to say this iron is a winner! You really can&#x27;t beat the amazing price that its selling on Amazon. Thanks for saving me time, HSI :-)</li>
    <li> this product was packed very well. the reviews from other users were very accurate. it immediately heated up when i turn it on. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my HSI hot iron....It heats evenly, the plates are smooth and there is no tangling!!  I am truly happy with my flat iron!</li>
    <li> This product worked great.  Best flat iron I have ever purchased, and for such a great price! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this straightener because a friend had one, and it worked better than any she had ever used.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I just love it .. Works great on all hair types . Perfect for us . I glad I purchased it .</li>
    <li> This works so well, my other one was burning my hair at a much lower temperature, and it would never get my hair fully straight. This one does not burn my hair and I have it on the highest temperature.  It actually makes my hair too straight.  I have not yet figured out how to curl with it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I have really long naturally straight hair. I didn&#x27;t really want to spend the money for a Chi, so I looked for different outlets. This straightner is amazing. It takes me about 7 minutes to do my whole head. And it looks great when I&#x27;m done. I would really recommend this to other people. I can wake up with major bed head and this tool takes care of it with enough time to get my kids up and ready for school. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was looking to buy a new straightener since my CHI straightener stopped working.So I ordered the HSI flat iron because of so many good reviews. I received it yesterday, I took it out and the first thing i noticed when i tried using it is that the little knob for the heat did not go even halfway up to 410. I decided to use it today and still does not heat up and the parts I tried to straighten are just frizzy. I&#x27;m disappointed..</li>
    <li> The item came with a small sample of the hair oil. Loved it so much, I bought the larger size. My hair is smooth and non frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and find that this iron tends to pull my hair more than my old iron did (a Chi). My friends with smoother straight/ slightly wavy hair have not had issues with this straightener but it isn&#x27;t the best for curlier/ coarser hair. Some reviews were comparing this to a Chi but I feel like Chis are clearly nicer</li>
    <li> I purchased this Flat Iron for my very picky daughter.  She has fine but curly hair.  She said it worked better than a Chi and she really likes it.</li>
    <li> Iron pulls on hair, prefer my CHI. A lot of good reviews but it did not work for me. I&#x27;m returning this bad product.</li>
    <li> I thought my hair was going to look and feel different because of all the positive reviews. Unfortunately this straighter doesn&#x27;t live up to its reputation. I had better results with a cheaper brand. The only difference for sure is the no burnt smell. But my hair looked frizzy and it took me longer to straighten my hair. Great customer service though. Would recommend seller.</li>
    <li> This product is great, is the best straightner for the money, would buy again and recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this iron it leaves my hair very smooth and does not cause as much damage as a regular iron would cause.</li>
    <li> So I was in need of a flat iron and read many reviews.  I really didn&#x27;t want to pay a ton of money and heard about a lot of knock offs of the big seller that everyone uses which made me leary.  My daughter and daughter in law have the very expensive one and swear by it.  After reading the reviews for the HSI professional flat iron, I thought what the heck.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a week but I ABSOLUTELY love it.  It heats up really quickly, my hair does not tangle up in it and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it what so ever.  I showed it to my daughter and let her try it and she was impressed by it as well.  Then when I told her the price she didn&#x27;t even believe me.  She said it had to be way more expensive because of the quality of it. I assured her it wasn&#x27;t and we both agreed it was well worth the price paid.  I am so glad I took the chance and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality flat iron.  Thanks HSI and Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Before buying this hair straightener, I used a CHI hair straightener.  I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the way the CHI worked on my hair, and when I saw this one on sale for a great price, I figured why not?  I love the fact that I can adjust the temperature and it works great with my hair.  It takes me less time in the mornings now!  Plus I feel like it leaves my hair decent condition.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the performance of the HSI Flat Iron. It gets rid of the frizz and my hairdresser commented that my hair was in great condition. I don&#x27;t see steam being released from my hair as I do when my hairdresser uses her flat iron but my hair has not been damaged by this flat iron. I lighten my hair but use good styling products in addition to this flat iron. I also like that the cord does not end up twisted and curled. It seems to be a well made product. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> The flat iron arrived very quickly. Affordable and great packaging. The only downfall is that the iron snags your hair. Other than that its a nice one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for three very important reasons. My daughter&#x27;s flat iron bit the dust. The price on this one was good. Several reviewers wrote that it does not pull hair.  It sure pulls mine. It will be relegated to the gym bag, or as a spare. I won&#x27;t return it, but it is not as good of a product as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have to return the item within two weeks because it stopped getting hot enough to work. It is warm, but not hot like it was (and like a flat iron should be).</li>
    <li> This product works well. Ceramic plates and the free glove are really nice. Good product. Glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> Works awesome!  Worth the money, this straightens my thick hair faster than any other I&#x27;ve owned</li>
    <li> Horrible! So rough! Rips my hair out!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, easy to use and works perfect!!! I use it to straight my hair and it can last 2-3 days --- time saving too.</li>
    <li> This does a good job. I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace my Babyliss (had it for 6 years until child got it wet and ruined it). It is thicker than my Babyliss  and seems to curve my hair near the roots. This is a problem because I have thick, coarse, naturally curly, frizzy hair so fly-aways are a problem. It is a little harder to smooth them down. And my bangs with the HSI don&#x27;t go like I would like. Sometimes it is like I&#x27;m in the 1990&#x27;s cuz they won&#x27;t really straighten at the roots. Near the root area it tends to curve it. HSI does smooth out my hair really good, but I think it is the new product I have been using (best I have ever used). Hair is shiny after straightening. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Updated Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I left the original review below, I was contacted by HSI Customer Service and was offered a free replacement flat iron, even though I had already returned mine to amazon. How many companies these days do that?! I was very impressed and appreciated their generosity. I was excited to give this iron another chance, especially for free! I must have gotten a defective one in the first place, because this one worked great!! It kept it&#x27;s heat the entire time, I had it at 390. My hair is very smooth and soft, I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through it! I am very impressed. I think many of the one star reviews would be changed if they gave it another shot. I ordered the regular dial model, but was sent the digital model in exchange, and I love it. I also curled my hair with it, and it worked great! Gorgeous waves, and faster than my curling iron. Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t last any longer than they usually do, but I think that&#x27;s my hair&#x27;s fault. I am happy to say I love HSI customer service and this product! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this flat iron!!  And based on the reviews I thought I would.  But there is nothing to love, it doesn&#x27;t work!  It heated up fine, the light was green in about 2 minutes.  I ran it over a section of my hair, and although my hair got very hot, it didn&#x27;t straighten or smooth it at all.  I have long, light brown wavy/frizzy hair.  I was putting a fair amount of pressure on the flat iron, to make sure the plates were tight against my hair as I slid it slowly down the section of hair.  It just didn&#x27;t do anything at all!  Also, the light would go back to red after each section, and take about 30 seconds to go back to green, so even if this straightener had worked, it would have taken forever to do my whole head at that rate.  It just wouldn&#x27;t stay hot even for one pass.  My hair was clean, dry, and product free, except for a heat protectant spray I had let dry.  I was taking fairly small sections of hair, and there was just no reason I can think of that this flat iron should not have been doing it&#x27;s job.  I tell you all this so you know it is unlikely user error that is causing this negative review, but the straightener!  I suppose there is a chance I received a defective straightener, but I didn&#x27;t have the patience to give it another shot, I just wanted my money back.  I shop from amazon all the time, but have never returned anything, so I was unsure whether to contact the seller about a return, or amazon.  I went to the \\&quot;my account\\&quot; page on amazon.com, and next to the order for this straightener, there was a button that said \\&quot;return\\&quot;, so I clicked it and started the return process.  Amazon couldn&#x27;t have made it any easier!  All I had to do was print out a return invoice to include with this return, and amazon had UPS come pick it up from my house the very next day for free!  So I give five stars for amazon customer service, but unfortunately zero stars for this product.</li>
    <li> As an African-American female, I have purchased quite a few flat irons for my family. Some have cost a lot of money and did well with heating and straightening/curling, but then the apparatus would come apart or flake or \\&quot;melt\\&quot;. Some did a good job of straightening/curling, if it did not actually fry your hair off. The plates are coated well enough so that you do not hear your hair being singed, even at the highest setting.  Heats quickly too. I also believe this one is constructed better. It is not super-light, but durable. It heats well, but I feel like my hair (and my hands) are protected. I have not yet used the glove or the argan oil. I would love to purchase a 1/2-inch one, if they had it. Good price!</li>
    <li> Still after 3 years this thing is working just as good as the first day I bought it!</li>
    <li> Heats up FAST. Doesn&#x27;t burn or dry your hair. Works great. It&#x27;s light weighted, I do my hair fast from curly to straight.</li>
    <li> Heats up in an instant.  Love the heating control so you do not cook your hair.</li>
    <li> I paid a lot for for a flat iron and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this one! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this item. The flat iron moves and I was to lazy to return it so i gave it away. ;(</li>
    <li> Heavy and doesn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
    <li> This is a good straightener for the amount of money.  It does not glide through my hair as easy as my 1st generation CHI that I replaced.  It does however do a good job and leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron.  Got my hair cut after I purchased it and it works great.  Good price also.</li>
    <li> These flat irons give a professional look to your hair. It makes you look like you just left the beauty shop.</li>
    <li> ive had many hair straighteners over the years and these are the best i&#x27;ve bought. Packaging is amazing, nice box with silky bag for the hair straighteners, a little sample of hair serum and a glove to smooth the hair and not burn your hand if you have the temperature setting at high. My hair goes from frizzy to straight in seconds, highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying my new flat iron. It&#x27;s small, warms up fast and straightens my very thick curly hair perfectly! My only complaint is that the little light indicating it is on appears to be on the bottom of the iron. But that could just be that I am setting it down wrong? Anyway, great flat iron! Definitely get it! At this price, get TWO!</li>
    <li> I have a lot if hair it really to get straight hair I work in a restaurant where I sweat a lot an my hair to but if I have to go oout and my hair still clean but is messy cause my job I just use my iron as nd it fix it perfectly and v it comes with oil that smeal really good</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Love that it has a glove so I can actually tolerate touching my hair. Better than I even expected. Very quick delivery also. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I paid extra for two day delivery, and did not get it in time. However, the iron seems to be great. Loving it so far.</li>
    <li> Works great on my thin hair!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this product, it works, it&#x27;s easy to handle and comes in a real nice pouch.  I love it!  The straightening works a long time.  I needed to touch it up just a bit when I got out of bed the next day and didn&#x27;t have to fix it all over again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It straightens my hair in 12 min. U will not regret it. No freezy hair and mine has been bleached for 10 years. I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> This amazing straightener makes my hair very soft and straight all day! It&#x27;s a great deal and if you&#x27;re looking for a good priced straightener get this one!</li>
    <li> Excellent cost benefit ratio. If you want i dice hair you must to take care of using good products. HSI Iron is one of te best iron evaluated in amazon.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how many people purchased this item because when I used it, it didn&#x27;t heat up hot enough so my semi-wavy hair was not straightening very well.  It also snagged my hair and would pull it out.  I am unhappy with the product, but I am happy with the customer service.  I returned it in its original box and they refunded me immediately.</li>
    <li> Package arrived promptly as promised. This was my first purchase of a flat iron. It has been a few weeks and so far I am very pleased with it. It is easy to use and gets the job done.More detailed instructions might have been helpful.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend&#x27;s birthday was coming around and I had thought up the idea to make something for her.  Unfortunately, as sentimental as that gift was I wanted to get her something she could also on a day-to-day basis.  This straightener packaging is in high-class red cloth and the straightener works great according to her.  Much better than the cheapo $20 straightener she got at Wal-Mart.  Don&#x27;t be fooled guys.  Pick this straightener up and you may just think it&#x27;s a quality power tool.  Except for your girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels quality and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;- Moveable cord which doesn&#x27;t get tangled easy&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my Girlfriend&#x27;s hair look amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Has an analog like temperature control which doesn&#x27;t give the temperature in Fahrenheit</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter for her international trips. Actually, this product came within fews days before the estimated delivering date. My daughter is really happy with the quality of this Ceramic Flat Iron. So far, I would recommend this product for others, but it is not used enough yet to make the final evaluation. I may update my review in the future if there is cons about it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my old well used straightener and saw the reviews on this one and thought I would give it a try.  It works pretty well but there are a few things that I am not overly in love with.  The knob to turn the heat up and down is on the inside and it is a bit awkward to adjust, the light that shows it is on/ready is on the bottom so when laying on the counter the way it is pictured you can&#x27;t see it, the iron&#x27;s pull my hair if it is turned at all.  Going straight down it doesn&#x27;t do it but I like to flare my ends out or under and when I do that it seems to pull my hair, it&#x27;s like the coating doesn&#x27;t go all the way around the blades.  It does do the job of straightening my hair though and the light that I mentioned turns from red to green when it is up to temperature which I like.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It works great!  Heats up quickly and smooths my hair in one swipe.  I have very curly fine hair and even with the humidity it doesn&#x27;t frizz up after using it.  This product works just as good as products that cost 3xs this amount.  I am very pleased and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap, Walmart flat iron for years.  I stumbled across this one when looking to upgrade and had an Amazon gift card.  WOW what a difference!  Easy to use, heats up FAST, and easy to keep clean from styling gunk; a little baking soda and some drops of water, rub on and let it set and wipe off and GOOD AS NEW.  It curls, straightens, flips, etc. perfectly.  I only have to swipe my hair ONE TIME for it to do what I want it to so it saves me time in the morning.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought it after I read the all the good  reviews. Doesn&#x27;t heat up fast and well, it  also takes several passes to straighten my hair. My hair is just wavy.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday present for my daughter. She loves it--says it works well and heats quickly. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I&#x27;m really happy with this flat iron, especially with the price. Love the adjustable temperature dial. Thanks, Blue Novelties!</li>
    <li> Very good, but it pulls my hair! Heats up, and cools down very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Not too sure about it yet....</li>
    <li> When I saw the awesome reviews, I thought I would give this straightener a try. The straightener is not the best in my opinion, but not terrible. I find that it frequently pulls my hair (which is really annoying) and it takes forever to cool down, not the best if you want to use it and then take it with you. Other than that, it does it&#x27;s job. It heats up quickly and stays heated, and comes with a nice carrying pouch which kinda solves the prolonged heat problem but at the same time I&#x27;m afraid it will melt the power cord. Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product if you want to leave it at your house to use, you just have to be slow for it not to pull your hair.</li>
    <li> I received my HSI iron quickly! Standard shipping, I ordered it on the friday after the 4th and received it on monday afternoon. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of work to go play with it. The oil (argon oil sample that comes with the iron) seems very nice...I have only tried a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am worried that my iron may have been used? When I took it out of the box the plastic around the ceramic plates seemed to be scuffed and had what looked like to be oil spots...After closer examination of the ceramic plates, i could see that one had a very small chip in it revealing what looked to be something silver behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for all those reading wondering about the pros and cons of this iron...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design&lt;br /&gt;  -The diamond design on the handle provides a nice grip&lt;br /&gt;Comes with the oil, a nice plus. It smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;Swivel cord!! Awesome, helps keep the cord from getting tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pulls hair&lt;br /&gt;  -I tried taking smaller sections to correct this problem, it still pulled and tugged. The straightener will do the job, but it certainly didn&#x27;t slide as smoothly as I had hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;Cool down takes longer than one would expect (so be careful!)&lt;br /&gt;Loose ceramic plates (This may just be on my iron because I believe it was used.)&lt;br /&gt;A little hard to guage what temperature the dial is being places on&lt;br /&gt;  -There is a dial that states the highest temp and the lowest temp so you have to guess for the inbetween..its also a little hard to see cause its on the inside of the irons handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give a lower rating for what seems to be a good product, but I took one star off for the conditon my iron arrived in, and one star off because the iron pulls my hair. I will probably be returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit Wednesday, July 10th***&lt;br /&gt;I spoke with amazon and my only option was to return the iron for a refund. They could not offer a replacement because the seller was not amazon themselves. I&#x27;m disappointed. Amazon informed me that I could return the product for a refund and purchase the item again...Who knows if I will receive one in worse condition. Don&#x27;t think I want to do all that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good flat iron.  It gets the job done. I&#x27;m satisfied with the ease of use and even heating.  Works well.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It shipped quickly and was packaged well. It only takes a few minutes to heat up and, as someone who has really really curly hair, it works very well in a short amount of time. The included oil is fantastic and its nice to have a \\&quot;case\\&quot; to put it in at the end of the day. Very pleased customer!</li>
    <li> I had an expensive model for quite a while that broke. This got good reviews so I thought I&#x27;d try it. My old iron left my hair smooth and shiny. This doesn&#x27;t go through my hair as smoothly and does NOT make my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL FLAT IRON LOVE THE OIL IT COMES WITH WORTH THE MONEY TO BUY THIS. LEAVES MY HAIR SO SHINY AND SOFT.</li>
    <li> This is truly an outstanding straightener.  heats up fast and straightens hair with no problem in a timely manner.  Switched from a 2&amp;#34; straightener and this cuts the time in half from the cheap one we had prior.  the 1&amp;#34; heading surface is the perfect size.  The price is unbeatable for the quality of straightener!!! The variable heat makes it great for all hair and weave types.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a cheaper flatiron a few months ago and have been disappointed that it did not get my hair as smooth and \\&quot;swingy\\&quot; as the HSI my hairdresser used.&lt;br /&gt;(My hair is thick and wiry - gray underneath my haircolor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely does a better job - not sure if it&#x27;s as good as the hairdresser&#x27;s model, but better than the cheapie.  I think, too, that the Argon oil may have something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because it does sort of pull my hair if I am not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re:  glove - hmm , if it came with a glove I ignored that - maybe it&#x27;s still in the box.  At any rate, I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, especially for the price! I have it set at a fairly low temperature and I still only have to run it through my hair once for a perfectly smooth look and my hair is fairly thick! If I want to turn the ends under, I am able to use this tool to do that, too! I also LOVE the oil that came with it! What a fabulous bonus! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few months ago for my daughter and she loved it so I bought one for myself. Fast delivery..</li>
    <li> This is my very first time writing a review since I have started shopping at Amazon.com. I&#x27;ve had quite satisfying shopping experience because of those reviews of the others, so I&#x27;ve decided to leave a review for this product. I think this is perfect especially during the summer time because I don&#x27;t have to blow hot hair to straighten them up while I&#x27;m sweating right after the shower. The price was also pretty reasonable comparing to its competitor&#x27;s products. Most of all, it works like charm. It saves my time and effort and my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> The flat iron&#x27;s a bit heavy and it pulls my hair. Thanks for the gloves, oil and the travel bag.</li>
    <li> I just have been using this for about a week now so I may need more time to actually give it that 5th star!  I am not disappointed with my purchase as it does a GREAT job..still getting used to it.  I would have preferred a digital read of the temperature on the outside instead of the inside of the iron but I know for the price and what it seems to be all in all I am happy with this product and would recommend. It is proving to be a good value.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a travel size flat iron, and was mislead by the words \\&quot;travel size\\&quot;  to describe oil, so not what I was looking for. That said, product looked good -and was packaged nicely!</li>
    <li> Easy to use &amp; love the included glove!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was traveling to Europe and in the past have had straighteners hardly heat and ruined when using internationally (even with the use of a converter). I was very happy with this dual voltage straightener. It heated quickly and to temperature without problem and straightened my hair very well. You still need a plug adapter, but no converter. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up fast, nice case, does the job. product arrived quickly.  It straitened and curled my hair easily.  Nice case.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. This flat iron performs just as well, maybe better, than some that cost a whole lot more.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, goes up to really high temperature. Haven&#x27;t used it a lot though but looks like a good product .</li>
    <li> The only hair straighteners I&#x27;ve had before this were the 20$ ones from Target. This one is AMAZING. Stays super hot, and still works great - I&#x27;ve had it for a year and a half-ish and it still works amazing. Granted, my hair is a short layered bob with a super stacked back, but I use it pretty much every other day and it still works like a charm. I can straighten my super think and wavy hair in 10 minutes flat.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It worth every single penny and more. My hair is super curly and after I use the flat iron it was so stray people asked me if I use the japanese straightener.</li>
    <li> Best straightner I have ever had highly recommend it! I have always had a chi and this is a lot better</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome. Without having to spend too much money I received a high quality tool.  It straightens my hair effortlessly and without having to do multiple passes.</li>
    <li> can not go wrong, it works great. highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;First time I purchased my own, and I don&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> Works great bought it due to the fact it is dual voltage and allowed me to travel to Europe with it.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t time off after a reasonable period for those of us who might occasionally forget. It could be a safety hazard for those who are used to curling irons that shut themselves off after 90 minutes or so, but that just may be the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; aspect of the product (meaning in a salon setting turning off might not be a good thing).</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time with great packaging.  The product works beautifully along with the argain oil leave in hair treatment.  My hair never looked so good outside of a salon.  The iron also came with a protective case and a professional glove which was highly unexpected and a welcome addition to this package deal.  A great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a HOT flat iron!! My hot tools crapped out on me and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune. No regrets here!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter &amp; she loves it!  I was happy to get for such a great price!</li>
    <li> I have course hair and this straightener does the job.  It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and it straightens it in one pass. I don&#x27;t have to do it over and over.</li>
    <li> Works but didn&#x27;t quite hit the mark.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work until the hottest heat. No auto shut off and the plates aren&#x27;t long enough.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair never looked so healthy straightened and it only takes one glide of the iron. I have long medium thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I&#x27;m so impressed by how wonderful this product is. Get the HSI argan oil to go with it. There is a small sample with purchase of iron. My daughters hair is extremely curly way curlier than mine and this flat iron got it straight. She&#x27;s biracial so we&#x27;re talking about some serious curls. A friend of mine recommended HSI flat irons and once I found this deal on amazon I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. It&#x27;s a steal of a deal and the best flat iron I have ever owned! If you&#x27;re on the fence on purchasing this product, don&#x27;t be- just do it! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I buy another one, because mine Fell Down and got broken. I can wait to has it on my hands again.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product.  Flat Iron works great. Disappointed with the Travel Size Argon Oil.  Was not what was indicated on Amazon site or box.  Was not a little tube of Argon Oil, but a 1 time use package.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for my mother in law for christmas. She was saying she wanted one to make her hair just the way her stylist does it. She was very happy to receive this as a gift and was super excited to try it. It took her about a week to try it out due to all the holiday madness. She is in love with it. It smoothes her hair perfectly and allows to put a slight curl at the roots for more volume and at the ends for a clean style. It helps keep her hair sleek and smooth all day long.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel flat iron.  However, found myself using it everyday! It has a light indicator when temperature is reached from red to green.  My hair looks sleek after flat ironing better than my CHI.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for a dear girl who has very long, very thick black hair, and it makes her look like a princess!!!  Very easy to use, very professional quality result.  She is thrilled, and it didn&#x27;t break my budget!</li>
    <li> I have only had it a week but it seems to be what I need, gets hot enough &amp; styles my hair just right</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great. The advertised argan oil was not included. I was hoping to try it, since I&#x27;m looking for s good smoother.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed. A great straightener at a great price. The perfect Christmas gift for my mom.</li>
    <li> I had high hope for this flat iron. I previously owned a One n Only for almost 3 years and I loved it. It finally went out on me after a ton of abuse and travel. I got this one to replace it and from the moment I plugged it in it didn&#x27;t work properly. I&#x27;m not an electrician but I would say there was a short somewhere in the wiring. It would start to warm up then the power light would start flickering and it would stop heating. I only got it warm enough to put to my hair once and it was to cool half way thru. (My hair was completely dry.)  I contacted Amazon with my issue and they were great to deal with, like always! The flat iron looked ok, the pouch was great, the product it comes with is tiny packet size, and the glove was cheap and XL.</li>
    <li> When I first went to purchase this straightener I was a bit hesitant, I had always bought my hair straighteners in person, but let me tell you this flat iron does not disappoint! I have very long, incredibly thick/coarse hair and this straightener not only straightens my hair beautifully, but I have also figured out how to curl my hair with it as well and it is now my favorite way to straighten my hair. The straightener heats up quickly and maintains that heat during the entire straightening session. I would definitely purchase one of these again!</li>
    <li> She loves the straightener and says it is the best one she has ever had. It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with a nice bag to keep everything in. One of my best buys of 2013 by far. Thanks for a great product at a really great price. Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works as good as a Chi.. Heat control setting, heats up quickly, ready light indicator,  comfortable grip &amp; satin travel pouch is cute.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, gets really hot and smooths the hair perfectly.  I use this every single day and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I liked the price point of this flat iron, and becauseof the mostly positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.  The flat iron worked very well, until one of the plates cracked.  Now the iron still heats and operates, but my hair can get stuck in the cracked plate if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t immediately contact Amazon/seller, and now the return window is closed so I&#x27;m stuck.  I will have to buy another, and this time I will go straight to CHI.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these products to everyone. They work very well. dependable and I have had no problems with them so far.</li>
    <li> Have had it for about a year now - the plate on mine actually chipped off and I don&#x27;t consider to have abused it. I&#x27;ve carried it in a travel bag at times but have not thrown it. A year later the green light takes a very long time to come on (about 15 minutes) and does not stay hot (it constantly goes back to red). It was relatively cheap, but would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for another popular brand but HSI was so well rated I took a chance and it has turned out to be a superior product! She loves it!</li>
    <li> This is the best and most efficient flat iron I have ever had. It is a fraction of the price of other brands but does a much better and faster job.i would absolutely order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener for my daughter for Christmas. It came quickly and exactly as advertised. I asked my daughter if she likes the product and she said she loves it. I would buy another product from this company with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best iron I&#x27;ve ever owned (and I&#x27;ve har my share)! It has heat settings for perfect adjustments to different hair types.it heats up very quickly and has an auto off feature.  I threw my ridiculously hot Chi away!</li>
    <li> Not only does this flat iron heat up quickly, but it glides though my hair getting great results and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> daughter likes it.  uses it everyday.  not exactly what she wanted though she wanted the real chi straightener.  but she likes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 24 y/o Male who purchased this as a gift for my SO.  She is extremely biased towards the CHI brand, and after years of tough love on the thing, it finally gave out.  So I caught a deal on this HSI flat iron and read so many of the review comparing the two brands that I pulled the trigger.  It was only $40 at the time of purchase around black friday, and it was about double for a comparable CHI brand iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gf was sceptical, but I coaxed her into trying it out, and she loves it just as much as the old one.  It gets quite hot, and has since had to learn to adjust the settings to not fry her hair, as the old one she would just leave maxed out.  I can&#x27;t comment on the quality, but she seems to be quite happy with it, and that makes me happy as well.  Its been a little under 2 months of use probably twice a week, so its a little early to comment on longevity, but it seems solidly built.  Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a sample / travel sized bottle of Argan Oil and a Foil Heat Pouch.  Overall, I&#x27;ll say its an excellent entry level iron for a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star rating due to the above, and the fact that it was such a good value.  I will probably upgrade to a five if it holds up past a full year or more of use.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.  It is high quality and exceeded my expactations.  It arrived well on time and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my grandaughter.  She has long hair and she loves it.  Would recomend  it to any one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it!  It comes with a glove so you don&#x27;t burn yourself and you adjust the temp. of the flat iron.  Very good buy.</li>
    <li> so far i like it! i love the cord that very manageble and not geting brake , so important!! it goes where u goes. heatig very fast, doeast damage or fry ur hair</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s loving it and uses it quite often.  She did her due diligence on the internet found that for the price, this piece of equipment delivered the best bang for the buck.  I&#x27;m guessing it works well as I have short spiky hair so I don&#x27;t get to use it at all.</li>
    <li> I have really thick curly hair and most straighteners will not work and this one is perfect!!! The heat settings are also fantastic and easy to use compared to other programs.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that blue novelties quickly replaced my original defective product with a working flat iron.  This iron does a good job of straightening my hair.  It does take a while to heat up, but leaves my hair looking great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the straightener since October. I have shoulder length hair that I straighten every day with. Both ceramic plates cracked over the weekend and now I cannot use it. They cracked out of the blue too, by the way. Very disappointed because I really did love the straightener.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas gift and she loves it.  Works just as described and her hair looks fabulous!</li>
    <li> She was very surprised with the flat iron and kept talking about the high quality of it.  She thinks I spent a fortune on it!  If she only knew what a great deal I got!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my wife for Christmas. Being a guy with short hair, I know nothing about flat irons. Blue Novelties&#x27; item description and other raters comments gave me the confidence that I was purchasing the right iron. My wife loves it. Blue Novelties is a company that I&#x27;d do business with again!</li>
    <li> I have long hair that is crazy-wavy-sometimes frizzy. I normally blow out using a rounded brush that does a great job taming frizzy and leaving my hair smooth and I love doing it this way. I like using this flat iron every couple weeks when I want stick straight hair. It does the job perfect! You can also make loose waves (check out some youtube videos) which I thought was amazing! Worth the purchase if you want options and nice straight hair.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my wife she obsolutely loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to look for in an iron so I based my decision on feedback I noticed this was highly recommended I&#x27;m glad i did!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy ethnic hair &amp; used to press my hair years ago. I purchased this product &amp; was very impressed by how quickly &amp; efficient it straightens my hair. The price was also an awesome deal! I encourage to buy. Product heats up very quickly again saving time. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works great. I had a chi and I lost it. I bought this after reading the reviews and am so glad I did. It was only 38.99 and so worth it. It worked just like my chi did. I bought the HSI argan oil and I am so glad I bought that stuff too. My hair is so much softer now. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever put my hands on. Only thing I&#x27;m sad about is that I didn&#x27;t find it ten years ago. HIGH RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> This is so awesome! I bought this cuz I have an old Vidal Sassoon 2&amp;#34; straightener that I got from Target for like 30 bucks, but needed something that would work overseas. Before I went abroad, I read reviews on how a lot of people with the VS straighteners who went abroad broke or short circuited theirs when they tried plugging it in the outlets over there, even with the converters. I think here in the U.S. is like 110v but abroad is like 220 or something else. I&#x27;m not sure, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to take a chance. The HSI was just the right price, and with the Argan oil that came with it, it&#x27;s actually pretty good. I&#x27;d say, just as good as my VS! But I have medium length, thick wavy hair, and as this is only a 1&amp;#34;, it takes me a little longer to straighten than my old one, which is still working btw! And I bought that like 7 years ago! Hehe. Plus this one makes my hair feels soft.. but again, dunno if that&#x27;s just the Argan oil, but either way, it&#x27;s good! So I totally recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I am so amazed by this straightener!!! I have very unruly hair that usually after straightening starts to wave and frizz a bit but this product has kept my hair straight throughout the entire day, and it&#x27;s so soft and silky!!! And the service was great, got my shipment when expected. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> It was a  gift and they just love it , great buy for the money haven&#x27;t seen any at that money in a long time</li>
    <li> I had high hopes after reading mostly good reviews, especially for the price. It didn&#x27;t smooth out my hair even after going over it several times and its a little heavy. I&#x27;ll just spend the extra coin and stick to the chi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist, but the flat iron is working well for me. I do like the travel bag that came with it.</li>
    <li> I was completely dissatisfied with this product. This is my second time ordering it thinking that the previous one was defective. However, the item did not deliver as promised. It takes a while to heat up and doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair as claimed and on top of that I had to pay for return shipping which I&#x27;m also not happy about. It definitely didn&#x27;t work for me despite all the positive reviews. I ended up ordering a Chi instead which I&#x27;m satisfied with.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife as a replacement for a Turbo Chi model that had died after a number of years.  This one is 1/3 of the cost of the one it is replacing.  That said, from what I can tell it appears to be of decent construction with a nice long cord.  Her comment was that it wasn&#x27;t quite as good, but by no means was it flawed.  Overall this is a nice flat iron and will get the job done.</li>
    <li> 3,000 + reviews can&#x27;t be wrong, right?  That&#x27;s what I told myself when I purchased this flat iron.  My old expensive brand stopped heating up.  I had resigned myself to paying $100.00++ when I stumbled upon this flat iron and all the positive reviews.  It shipped in 2 days, arrived in great conditions and works perfectly.  No need to &amp;#34;go over&amp;#34; your hair again and again to make it perfect.  This does the trick.  Even better after sleeping on my hair Saturday night, all I needed was a quick touch up on Sunday.  Love it and now I am definitely going to try the HSI hair dryer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  The oil included works great and I did purchase a spare bottle.</li>
    <li> I thought spending a good deal of money would be thoughtful idea but it was not. I couldn&#x27;t find real difference between cheap remington and HSI straightner. My hair is really thin and highly sensitive so instead of buying cheap one I chose this but now I think it was not a good idea. It takes as much time as Remington and hair also does not look that great and fine after straightening.</li>
    <li> This iron does not get hot! I have purchased other flat irons for much less that work better. My hair is easy to style too. Iron is warm not hot. Wish I could return it but I lost the receipt.</li>
    <li> I have very, very curly hair and this Flat Iron is the best one I&#x27;ve own so far!  Far better than the Chi&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> its not a chi but it works just as good, I would order again if I had too. Even my sister likes it and she&#x27;s a cosmetologist</li>
    <li> With the way this straightener is reviewed here, you&#x27;d think it would perform miracles. It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a very basic straightener, and it does not offer much control over your hair. It leaves it as frizzy as a $20 straightener, and it&#x27;s either too hot or too cold for my hair. I was disappointed, to say the least.</li>
    <li> I have had many hair straighteners, any at triple the cost of this one, and can say that the HSI Professional is my favorite of them all.  The unit heats quickly and its easy to run my hair through it.  I find that the ease of use help my hair turn out better because I&#x27;m not fighting with my straightener to run my hair through.  Your hair glides through it, rather than the tugging that you must do with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give the HSI pro a try, I think you will be impressed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after my long time flat iron suddenly and completely stopped working.  That day, I went to a local beauty chain store to purchase a replacement.  After using it for a day, I realized that this replacement flat iron just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  So I went on Amazon and searched the flat iron reviews.  The reviews for the \\&quot;HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron\\&quot; were among the best so I decided to order it.  All I can say is that it was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  Not only does this product deliver as promised (and more!) but the seller delivered my purchase on time and made sure it was securely packaged.  Finally, and just as importantly, I was thrilled with this product&#x27;s price.  The quality of this product is definitely of a professional calibre - I still can&#x27;t believe that I was able to purchase it for such a reasonable price.  Overall, this product and the service of the seller deserve 5 stars and then some!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not live up to the reviews...it&#x27;s heavy, doesn&#x27;t slide over the hair with ease, and not at all comfortable to use. Very disappointed in it. The extra money spent on a Chi is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Was not sure about this product since I had never heard of it before but over 3000+ positive reviews can&#x27;t be wrong. Its a great product at a great price. I have thick hair with lots of volume but this flat iron leaves my hair shiny smooth and bouncy. Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus delivery from Blue Novelties was super quick.</li>
    <li> I received the straightner and it works good but i was disppointed that all the hair serum that came with it leaked all out into the box and soaked that box and bag, thankfully the straightner was covered with plastic.</li>
    <li> Awesome product will buy this brand again!! Read reviews and I thought I would give it a try glad I did!!! It got here really fast as well!!</li>
    <li> Just bought my second one.  Heats fast, works well.  Yes the button is inside so you have to be extra careful, especially when turning it off that you don&#x27;t burn yourself.  Comes with a nice travel bag, oil sample and heat protective glove.  I like it enough to buy a second one.  I&#x27;m picky, I think you will like this iron.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron because it can curl as well as straighten real well. Just wish I could get a warranty on it if it happens to mess up down the road.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural over a yr now and I have to say moving to Germany made me want to go back to the creamy crack! I bought these to see if the would do the job and the job is DONE !!!!!!!!!!!  I&#x27;M SO IMPRESSED!! My6 hair is silky and straight and I love it!  The iron gets really hot so it took a while to get the right temp for my hair...be careful so you dont burn your hair! I would recommend this to any naturals out there along with the beyond the zone heat protectant thats gives your hair a glossy shine !</li>
    <li> This straightens my super thick and curly hair. It works as well as or better than more expensive flat irons.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron as a gift from my BF and at first based on all the reviews i was happy!! after i used it i hated it!!!! my hair is curly and thick it takes me forever to straighten my hair and after a while the lines on top of the straightener start causing my fingers to hurt sort of like the are getting bruised! all i can say is i hate it!!! don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> One of the best ceramic flat irons I&#x27;ve seen in a while! Like no other! Leaves a shine every time!</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel softer and more silky than any flat iron at the department store. I try to only use it once a week to prevent heat damage.  Style does last if I wrap hair at night.</li>
    <li> The price is great for this straightener, and it warms up really quickly. My complaint is that the plates have a gap that is easy to catch your hair in. They are somewhat flexible and tilt when you close the straightener, allowing a small crevice to form. Also I think the straightener would work better for thicker hair, since you have to apply a lot of pressure to make the plates close along their entire length. I don&#x27;t use it often so I wouldn&#x27;t go out and get a new one right away, but I won&#x27;t be buying another model like this one.</li>
    <li> Hair straightener pulls out your hair while straight en ignition. It also has trouble turning on and I got this a month ago</li>
    <li> This product is OK. Nothing out of the ordinary. Looking at the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d receive a super straightener, but it&#x27;s OK at best. I noticed the straightener did not get as hot as my prior one used to get. Gets the job done though.</li>
    <li> I never used to be satisfied with my flat irons and would jump on the chance to try someone else&#x27;s in hopes of finding one that I loved.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, naturally straight blonde hair and use this iron to give it body and I love it. I had my first one for a year until I threw it off my counter on accident and the ceramic chipped. It had survived many drops prior, but this was one really was more of a throw. Anyway, I purchased this one again because I have yet to find one that I like as much. ( I have tried everything from chi, babyliss, sedu, conair and remmington.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used my new ceramic flat iron twice but I really like the way it leaves my hair smooth and straight.  With other flat irons I&#x27;ve used, I have had to do each section of hair several times before it&#x27;s straightened the way I like it, but this flat iron is quick to heat and quick to straighten hair and love the glove it comes with to avoid burns on my hands (which I did quite a lot).  I would recommend this product and the price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> So I know some people think this product is fake, or not a real HSI, but from what I have seen in my use of it so far, it is perfect, and seems genuine. I have very curly, puffy hair, and this gets it silky smooth in a few runs through each piece of hair. I have been to cosmetology school, and used a Paul Mitchell straightener. This works at least as well as my PM flat iron, and a lot faster. MY PM flat iron broke recently, and I bought the HSI as a replacement, and I am happy with it so far. I love the little silk bag, and the glove. It did not contain the hair oil, but I don&#x27;t mind, since I have my own. It does not overheat or burn my hair, and there is no awful burnt-hair smell. Overall, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a quality flat iron that heats up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t get my hair caught in the plates.  My daughter and I both use it.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd straightener that I bought ever since my 5 year old straightener had to retire :( ! So I decided to buy something on amazon because I was already buying something else on here &amp; the only reason why I bought this product was because the reviews were rated so high. Once I got it delivered, I tested it right away and was highly disappointed. I expected it to be just as great as everyone was saying but to my surprise it was extremely weak. So I had to deal with the consquences &amp; kept it.</li>
    <li> This is working very well for me.  Nice to finally have a flat iron that gets hot enough to actually make my thick, wavy hair straight.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Came with free sample of argan oil.  Temperature adjustment is a great feature.  Controls are a little awkward to reach, but once I realized I am not going to burn myself reaching inside the iron I got more comfortable with them.</li>
    <li> Compared to other brands I have used in the past, it&#x27;s OK. It does the job, but I can&#x27;t say I am VERY impressed with the product. It will have to do for now.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my new purchase, perfect for using with two different voltages while traveling , It is very powerful and works quick for unruly hairs. Thank you</li>
    <li> I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS BUT THE FREE SAMPLE WAS WORTHLESS. BUT THE FLAT IRON DOES WHAT IT SAYS. AND AFTER I POSTED MY COMMENT THE COMPANY SENT ME A LITTLE BIGGER SAMPLE OF THEIR LEAVE IN PRODUCT. SO GOOD FOR THEM. I HAVE TOO MUCH HAIR TO SEE A DIFFERENCE BUT AT LEAST THEY TRIED. AND FOR THAT I THANK THEM.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like other people but this hair straightener is good, good enough. I have thick, kinky/curly hair and I saw this straightener on groupon at an acceptable price, a little below $50 so I decided to buy it after a short product search. I finally got it in the mail and tried it on the first day with my regular products and the end result it ordinary. The only concern I have if how long this straightener will last compared to my previous straightener that lasted well over 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get the oil thing in a little bottle but instead a pouch thing, everything else was as advertised. There is also the issue of burning my hand but that&#x27;s why they give that full glove. There is no indicator to tell the temperature but that isn&#x27;t really an issue for me since I use it on the highest heat level. The box to be honest looks so fake, nothing professional about the appearance but the product does it&#x27;s job&lt;br /&gt;I guess</li>
    <li> This works just as well if not better than my chi did. And at almost 1/3 the cost. Love it. My chi died after just over a year. I have two backups a $15 coniar that really pulls my hair and takes forever and an Ed hardy that I paid $30 for. It works ok but also pulls some.  This one heats fast and I really love the auto shut off feature, just in case I forget to unplug. It does very well with my fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I have tried them all - Chi, GHD... and although they produced decent results, they never lasted long. When I first received the HSI I absolutely just loved what came with it! A nice velvet puch to keep it in, a sweet LCD display of the temperature settings, but then the quality of the product itself.  It is weighted nicely and the cermic is of the best quality. The heat settings are easy to control-but most importantly THE RESULT HSI PRODUCES! I have frizzy, fly away hair and usually with any flat iron my hair will straighten, but not tame.  HSI has given me beautiful, straight, tamed hair.  and it lasts all day if you use the right products along with it! If you know how to curl your hair using a flat iron (THIS IS THE ONLY BEAUTY APPLIANCE YOU WILL EVER NEED) ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS. dont even think about looking at the Chi or Shestraightners or GHDs. Your search stops here! IN LOVE!</li>
    <li> Easily the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. I love it so much, the cloth case is pretty nice too. I was worried because the flat iron is small, but I actually like it more than my old large one.</li>
    <li> I thought for sure I&#x27;d love this flat Iron because of the positive reviews. It takes more than two passes to straighten my hair. (which isn&#x27;t really curly) it takes too long.  It&#x27;s kind of like the cheap flat iron I just threw away. I&#x27;ve tried it on both med, &amp; high settings with the same results. The process takes longer than I&#x27;d prefer. The HSI flat Iron is okay, not great.&lt;br /&gt; Could I recommend this product, No...Which is to bad, since I really wanted to share a good review,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Disappointed</li>
    <li> This is a great straightner for the price.  It does my above shoulder hair length great.  I read some reviews were it would pull the hair and I have had that happen to me.  And the on/off switch is in a very odd place other than that I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Does a great job with my hair and I had some questions and was given fast responses I am very thankful.</li>
    <li> The straightener itself is ok - I ordered one before and it didn&#x27;t seem to get that hot and  they ended up sending me a new digital version.  I still can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s my favorite unfortunately because it still doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  Maybe I read the other reviews and expected too much.  But as far as the company goes they gave great customer service and responded to me quickly and were nice enough to send me a replacement the first time around.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daufhter&#x27;s birthday and she was absolutely thrilled. It was better than expected. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a straightener</li>
    <li> I bought this because my previous straightener had gone out. I hadn&#x27;t heard of HSI previously but for the great price I figured I would give it a try. It has been great so far and was less than half the price if my previous straightener. It arrived quickly after I ordered it which was a plus too!</li>
    <li> Was excited about the great deal on the hair straightner but my light on the hair straightner will maybe be green for a minute then turns red again so I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;s not heating up like it should hope it doesn&#x27;t stop working soon :(</li>
    <li> This straightener did not do well at!! Both my daughters shared a Remington straightener &amp; I thought it was time for my 13 year old to have her own. So I researched &amp; read a ton of other reviews for other straighteners &amp; decided on this one. Big mistake!!! It took about 7 to 10 minutes for it to heat up completely. (The instructions &amp; the description read that heat up time is 60 seconds). Then finally after the long wait for it to heat up, a few seconds after she would start straightening her hair the temperature drops down suddenly to 395 to 350 degrees. And it won&#x27;t heat back up to the 450 degrees at all while you&#x27;re using it. My daughter does not have curly hair. She&#x27;s got fairly thick, healthy long hair that is wavy. Using this straightener on her hair took twice as long to style as her Remington one did. And that&#x27;s not even including the amount of time it took waiting for it to heat up. And even taking more time with it, her hair still was not really straight. Her older sisters 4 year old Remington straightener did much better. I did read the instructions carefully &amp; I tried it out maybe 5 different times hoping that it would get better. My daughter was so disappointed. If this wouldn&#x27;t even work on her wavy hair, I just don&#x27;t see how it would actually be possible for someone with curly hair. There is just no way!! After trying it for a few days I finally gave up &amp; shipped it back for a full refund. She now has a brand new Remington one (for the same price) &amp; it does so much better.</li>
    <li> our hair gets caught in the plates and pulls it it out, very uncomfortable, cant use at all on myself or my daughter. I hate to have to return things but I did return this. The service was excellent, I received the flat iron in just a few days. I hope my return is that quick.</li>
    <li> Love this iron. I was afraid it was not going to compare to my chi, but it does. I needed a new iron and did not want to pay an arm and a leg. So glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I gathered my information about the product and the seller from the previous reviews, they were all positive, decided to buy. Got it and I have been using for 1 month now&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing straightener , doesn&#x27;t waste your time and easy using. The seller brought it to me in no time, even before the estimated one. I really recommend it to everyone to try.</li>
    <li> This was advertised as equal to CHI. Doesn&#x27;t work any better than my drug store purchases. I have thick hair and that may affect it but it definitely isn&#x27;t superior as I expected.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a good product.  I would have given it a 5 star rating if the flat iron felt a little smoother as it runs through my hair.  When I use the iron it feels as if my hair is getting pulled a little when it actually isn&#x27;t.  However, it does get the job done and as stated before the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Never used a flat iron before but, this product had great reviews at a fraction of the cost of the brand chi.</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron in London, Malawi and South Africa (with various different outlet adapters) and it worked great everywhere! It always got hot enough and never overheated. It&#x27;s a great size for a carry on and would great on my thick, curly hair. Definitely a great choice for home and travel.</li>
    <li> I love how fast the straightener heats up! My hair is very long (to the middle of my back) and so I need a straightener that works fast so I am not spending hours on my hair everyday. This one does the trick!</li>
    <li> Love it! Gets super hot, works really well and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair! I have used other brands in the past, but this one had great reviews so I tried it out. Really glad I did!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a good flat iron and I can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s best selling? It doesn&#x27;t slide through your hair well. I wish I never bought it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and value. It left my hair silky straight and frizz free. I would have chosen five stars but it seems a little bit awkward to use - turning on, heat settings, maneuvering...I&#x27;m sure that over time, I will get accustomed to this, as well.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous when I ordered this. My previous straightener died and I ordered this as a replacement. The price was so good I figured I would just reorder a different brand if this one didn&#x27;t work out! But I love it. It takes a few minutes to heat up but it has reduced the time I spend on my hair by half! I use it to curl my hair as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this flat iron is AWFUL.  Why is it the best? I don&#x27;t know.  This flat iron does not do justice for my hair at all.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain, but it straightens my hair in a weird way that none of my other flat irons did; and it hurts because the flat iron pulls my hair.  There&#x27;s a huge difference from when I use my Remington Anti-Frizz flat iron, and this one.  The Remington one actually makes my hair looks straight, but it leaves a smelly fragrance on my hair.  I actually prefer my mini flat iron from Remington, because it leaves my hair straight without having smelly hair.  I can&#x27;t wait to get a Chi instead.</li>
    <li> My hair is coarse,curly and frizzy. Yay! This iron is the best I have used so far in my straightening experience.</li>
    <li> I used to have a solia which was my first high performance flat iron, and I was happy to spend the money to purchase an iron of this quality, when it unexpectedly went dead in the middle of a crisis I was unable to part with that amount of cash at that moment and decided to take a chance on the HSI based on the reviews I read for the product and I am flat out amazed. This turned out to be a great deal.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of HSI but the flat iron got so many positive reviews and the price was right $39.99 so I gave it a try.  This is a great flat iron.  It heats up immediately and provides a smooth, shiny finish to my hair.  No more frizz and it lasts all day.  I definitely recommend this product..and it came with a nice travel pouch!!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this from Amazon since I have a Prime account and I needed a quick replacement for my broken flat iron. I received it right away and I used it immediately. It worked better than my previous flat iron and since it&#x27;s only 1 inch I could use it to curl my ends and it cut down on the process of using hot rollers or curling iron. I later went to my neighborhood beauty supply store that caters to professionals. I noticed a couple of ladies buying their \\&quot;advertised special\\&quot; flat iron selling for $99.99, almost double what I paid for this and the beauty supply product didn&#x27;t come with the travel pouch, glove or Argan oil sample. I felt reassured that I made the right decision to go with this purchase. I normally research my purchases, but I was in a hurry this time and took a leap of faith. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this product and very excited about my purchase. However, it is not at all what I had hoped for and I would not recommend this product to anyone. For about two weeks, every time I would use this flat iron (which is daily) I would put it on the highest setting, but it would not stay hot. It kept gradually declining in temperature. At this point, the LED display has stopped working completely and is a blank screen. I can no longer see what temperature the iron is on and have to guess if it is even on at all. I am very disappointed with this product to say the least.</li>
    <li> Works very well with my daughters hair.  Heats up fast and does a good job straightening her thick wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I love the straightening power of this thing.  It is fantastic.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time.  I suppose that is what you&#x27;d want if you worked in a salon, but it is not ideal for home use.</li>
    <li> I shaved off all of my hair, so this product is of little use to me, however, my wife straightens her hair every day before work.  She really seems to like it&#x27;s ease of use.  And she looks great as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess this is a glowing review.</li>
    <li> I am a guy and always wanted longer, straighter hair. I am Latino and have thick, beautiful wavy, curly hair. Lots of body, nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I grew up with straightening cremes and never liked that. Plus with my hair I can blow dry straight. I did some research with straightening irons and this unit had great reviews. I love it. I am growing my hair out and have great silky, shiny straighter hair. I love the versatility of the many styles I know can have because of this unit. I love it, love it. Arrived quickly, well packaged. Seller was amazing, AMAZON is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to travel in Europe with me on business trip. It claims to adjust the volts, but it broke after half my head was completed. I plan on returning the item. If you are planning on taking this oversees with you, look for another item.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly and does an excellent job. It is hot though so be careful, gf already burned herself once.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in December and loved it. Maybe because it was my first flat iron.  I mainly used it to curl my hair since I naturally have straight hair.  I probably used it about 3-4x a week. It worked great for 2 months but then earlier this month I started noticing my hair wasn&#x27;t as vibrant and the curls wasn&#x27;t as great.  And the plates doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to.  I can curl my hair without using the glove now.  And the off button doesn&#x27;t work.  I have to unplug everytime I&#x27;m done.  It is cheap but now I&#x27;m going to invest in a GHD product.</li>
    <li> You honestly get what you paid for. No doubt about it, this machine will snag your hair. I would just fork out extra money to buy a better hair straightener but if you need one that does a mediocre job then go with this one.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast. Though I did expect it to be hotter. I have very stubborn hair, but it works great on my daughter&#x27;s waist length hair. I love the bag. I put the iron in it when I am done using it. Clears up my counters and I don&#x27;t have to wait for the iron to cool completely before putting it away. The bag holds it great while its still warm.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve EVER owned. I am African American with natural hair.  I added a little Chi Deep Brilliance Select oil blow dryed then flat iron my hair and my hair was so straight and silky.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I am loving it.  I held off on getting one because I have fairly straight, fine hair and was always concerned about damaging it.  But the temperature control on this is easy and reassuring.  The iron heats up completely in the time it takes me to blow dry my shoulder-length hair and works perfectly.  It also comes with a sample packet of their argan oil and coupon for additional supply (which truly helps to protect your hair, especially for fine hair; however you can generally use any drugstore anti-frizz or conditioning product which work just as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest selling point for me was the fantastic value.  You won&#x27;t find a better flat iron at a better price!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife. She loves it. The electric setting of 110/220 V comes handy as we travel extensively to Asia. Very professional seller; highly recommend..</li>
    <li> Compared to the other flat irons I have owned, I do not like. NO AUTO Shut Off, to be fair, they do not advertise this but I did read in a review somewhere that is did in fact have it. I&#x27;m telling you now that it does not and I do not understand why they cannot manufacture this product to have one. It&#x27;s dangerous. every single one that I have owned has had an auto shut off. But again, to be fair, they do not advertise that it has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for it&#x27;s performance. I have owned a sedu, a chi, and a Salon Tech PFIP100 Titanium 450 Professional Hairstyling Iron, 1 Inch. The salon tech just died on me after owning for almost 2 years so I was looking to replace it. It has a heat setting that reaches 450 but the reviews for it were not as good and it is more expensive so I thought I would try out the HSI. First off, it does straighten my hair. I have very thick, coarse, curly hair and it takes me a while to get it straight. The HSI does get it somewhat straight but it does not stay that way. I have never had my hair wave back up or frizz unless it gets wet or unless the humidity is very high. That has not been the case. I could straighten my hair and then wake up the next morning and it is usually more smooth, more straight but with this product, it&#x27;s a wavy mess again. I think it does not get hot enough to get it really straight. The Salon tech reached 450 and seems to glide through my hair better. The HSI has a bit of a pull/ snag to it. Also, the barrel part gets really hot so you cannot touch it without wearing the glove. I&#x27;ve never had any of the other flat iron&#x27;s that I have used do that before. I have a chi that I spent about $100 on a few years ago that still works and bought the Salon tech to get a better flat iron so I was using the chi when I purchased the HSI. They&#x27;re about the same as far as performance but the Chi will auto shut off and I don&#x27;t have to unplug my hair dryer in order to use it because the plugs are not the big giant plugs that take up the whole outlet so you can only have one of that type plugged in at once. I thought for the price that I could try the HSI out and see but now I wish I had just gone ahead and purchased another Salon Tech. I do plan on getting one because once Summer hits, the HSI will be no match for my hair. So my gripes are no auto shut off, doesn&#x27;t get my hair very straight and doesn&#x27;t set it so it stays straight (we have poof hours later).</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 flat irons in the past 8 or so years. My last two were CHI&#x27;s. The Chi gets extremely hot and was causing a lot of damage on my hair. I needed something that would get my hair as straight as my CHI but wouldn&#x27;t do as much damage on my hair. The HSI is perfect. It has temperature controls -- I like that I can get my hair straight without burning it to a crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural african american hair and this straightener gets my hair as straight as those who have relaxers.</li>
    <li> This flat iron hair straightener heats up fast.  Takes frizz out of hair with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to cool quickly after turning it off.&lt;br /&gt;So far the hair doesn&#x27;t seem damaged by it for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Service and delivery were outstanding.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend after reading all of the awesome reviews (I&#x27;m a CHI owner myself), and she LOVES it! Great price &amp; great product!</li>
    <li> love it! and my hair does too!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really ask for a better hair strightner! For a long thick hair , It does the job just right, easy to curl and style i, you name it! the price the&#x27; just beats it all, it&#x27;s a full package! So far Im loving it! It heats up quick and leaves your hair smooth and silky.  P.s I love the fact it came with the red sexy pouch, the  glove and the hair sample oil .that&#x27;s a plus! the shipping was on time. So I&#x27;m happy:)</li>
    <li> And the receiver has been extremely happy and satisfied with the product.  Easy to use.  Great results.  Nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> I returned this because it didnt heat up enough to straighten anything</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener anyone in our family has used. With 5 females in the house, we have been giving it a workout! It works well on thick long &amp; curly hair, fine hair, and coarse gray hair. We have been happy with how quick it heats up, how it will straighten curly and gray hair with one pass, and how smooth and hot the plates are. One daughter commented she wants this brand when she gets her own straightener.</li>
    <li> I wish the controls were easier to reach, and that  it had a digital temp. setting. Packaging was great, and it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron 2 years ago and I am still using it today. The tool works like it was my first time using it, I am so hooked to it that I cannot switch to another one, I tried to shop for one but I never end up buying any. It heats up really quickly and get the job done really really well. Personally, I do not set the temperature at its maximum and still get spaghetti hair result. I am thinking on getting their hair dryer too and whenever my flat iron will stop working I for sure get the newer version. Thank you</li>
    <li> Works better than the Karmin. SUPRISED!!</li>
    <li> works great using 110 or 220V</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this flat iron purchase. The cost is great. It has temperature settings and comes with a glove you use to prevent burns, and a carry bag too. But the greatest part is how good it works. I bought one for myself, one as a gift and ordered one for my friend too. Blue Novelties was very responsive to a problem I had with the delivery of one of the orders. I would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just take this product with me anywhere i go. It just help me in a lot of situations mostly hair problems, well duh. Anyway, there are so handy and they heat up real quick so you want have any problem waiting if you are short in time.</li>
    <li> love it and fast ship</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have used many brands and types of flat irons and these are by far the best I have ever used. Great on the hair, no burning, keeps a great temperature, and does not give your hair that dull look.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Works how a flat iron should. Great product and will definitely be looking at HSI for future hair care products.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair staticky or fried!  Best one I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of them.</li>
    <li> I read all the fabulous reviews and bought one of my own. I love it and the price was right! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This straightener sucks, my comsir straightener from target ($30) works better. Wish I could get a refund !!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for what I paid for it. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid the full price. It does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this HSI Ceramic flat iron when I read the positive reviews and I am so glad I did.  This is the best flat iron ever.  It leaves your hair completely straight and so smmoth.  If you want to use it to curl your hair it works great and the&lt;br /&gt;curls stay for along time.  So stop reading my review and purchase this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used this product while on vacation in Italy.  It performed expertly and my hair looked silky smooth thanks to this straightener which worked great with the European outlet adapter.  Loved it!</li>
    <li> despite the really high ratings, the product that i got was clearly used and was in disgusting condition (sticky plate and oily handle etc) despite the icky condition of the iron, i decided to give it a go and the iron itself wasnt that good. i tried it on my hair and it couldnt even curl my hair, instead it just made that fizzing sound of my hair frying. had to return it pronto. i am never buying cheap hair irons online.ever.</li>
    <li> Works great!!! And the price was right!!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time I purchase one of these.  This is actually the third one i have purchased, not because they have broken down, but because my family likes them so much they ask if they can get one as well.</li>
    <li> Helps control the fizzies but doesn&#x27;t burn hair....the temperature setting is quite accurate. I only wish the little red light that shows that you left it on were a bit bigger and easier to spot.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and have used it several times and am pleased with the results on my naturally frizzy course hair.  This is a high quality straightener for the price, I would recommend it for those wanting a good straightener without wanting to spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> This works exactly how we expect or to</li>
    <li> this was a great product at an even greater price. So far, this flat iron has not burned my hair and it leaves my hair bouncy and shiny. Hope it last a long time!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on this straightener because I heard mixed reviews on a CHI. I am happy that I ordered this instead of paying the money for a CHI.</li>
    <li> this is a fabulous product. I love it. however,  I do have a little trouble curling but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Awesome hair straightener! My hair is generally unmanageable and a disaster, this straightener works magic on it! Have owned for almost 2 years, and is still in great condition even with daily use! Huge fan :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron based on the reviews and also couldn&#x27;t ignore the affordable price. Unfortunately though this flat iron just did not work out for me. The flat iron would tug and pull my hair, and despite going over one section three to four times, my hair was still frizzy and wavy.</li>
    <li> I love how it works. It is a great flat iron and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it for anything.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job well. No issues with delivery or packaging.</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough Argan oil to rate that and I don&#x27;t use the glove, however the straightener works great! Without the heat even turned up all the way, it straightens my hair in just a couple passes. My hair is semi curly-wavy. For extremely curly hair, I imagine it might take 3-4 passes, maybe less if the heat is turned up. I wanted something reasonably priced that would straighten my hair in just a couple passes and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
    <li> this works just as it is supposte to ...it is very very hot so be super careful..it does the job well</li>
    <li> Fantastic flat iron, low price.  Was very lucky to find!  Would suggest this product to anyone that loves flat ironed hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
    <li> I loved the HSI flat iron.  I bought the cheapest one and my only frustration is that it doesn&#x27;t turn off if I accidentally leave it on.  So if I did it again... I would step up to the high bracket.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who is a hair stylist and she loves it. Says it works better then a lot of her big name brand irons that she spent 3x as much on! She is very happy with the quality and performance.</li>
    <li> The plates on the first one I received didn&#x27;t meet so it pulled my hair- was shipping a new one &amp; it&#x27;s the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> this works perfectly!!! loved it</li>
    <li> I think this flat iron pulls on my hair and is not as smooth as the flat iron I replaced. But considering the price, it does an okay job. I like that I can set the temperature of the flat iron, I have pretty straight hair already so I don&#x27;t need to fry my hair to get it straight.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I needed a 220 V for travel outside of the United States.  Since the product is 110/220 V I can also use it in the US.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and it does a great job on my thick, slightly wavy hair.  The price is exceptional!</li>
    <li> Never had a professional straightener until now. I am very happy with my purchase and the product itself. The deal was a steal!</li>
    <li> Good flatiron ~ love the sachet that comes with it, use this all the time for traveling...recommend to anyone . I also have fine hair ; works great</li>
    <li> This is a great product and is exactly as described. It has a control for the heat setting.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I had used a GHD straightener for years before it finally died on me. Since I didn&#x27;t feel like spending the big bucks, I decided to buy this one. I have been using the HSI straightener now for over a year and it is holding up better than expensive ones I have owned. I straighten my hair every day and have been for years now. This straightener definitely holds up to my high standards! And you know what? If it only lasts a few years, I won&#x27;t feel bad buying another one.</li>
    <li> The flat iron was shipped to my house the day after I ordered it. Fast!! The product works great!</li>
    <li> This hair iron is awesome straightens fast and keeps my hair straight all day. Arrived quickly. There&#x27;s no need to purchase a super expensive iron because this one is great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace my Sally&#x27;s ion color brilliant flat iron. Sally&#x27;s works so much better. This flat iron snags and pulls my hair, takes quite a while to heat up, and it didnt straighten my hair as well. It left my hair slightly frizzy as well. I wish it also had a feature to tell what the actual temp of the plates were in numerical form instead of a dial to guess the temp.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a decent hair straightener to buy and a friend recommended this one to me. When I first received it, it didn&#x27;t look new, to be honest. I bought it new, but there were minor scratches as if someone used it before. I contacted Blue Novelties about it and they weren&#x27;t able to exchange it, but did give me a $10 refund. Overall, it&#x27;s a good straightener. I love how the strands of my hair does not get stuck in the straightener no matter how much hair I am straightening at once. I was also very happy with how kind their customer service were.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and works well</li>
    <li> I use this to straighten my hair often, but also use it to curl my hair. It is very safe on your hands, and does a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> Love it, especially like the carry pouch it came with. Travels well</li>
    <li> This is a very good iron, makes my hair very straight and silky.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This was a great product and has worked amazingly. The price was amazing. I used to have to take my daughter to the saloon every couple of weeks to get her hair straightened, but this flat iron works great. I would defiently recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Works great! Highly recommend for stubborn hair!</li>
    <li> It pulled my hair and the iron itself smelled like it was burning ....not even on the highest setting. I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  I&#x27;ve had a CHI that lasted for about 9 years, so that is all I have to compare to.  This does the job. It does catch my hair occasionally, so I have been learning to adjust to that.  The packaging it arrived in was very impressive.  Overall, you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Oh It was still in the box. The package was so small, I did not even see it! Thanks this is great, disregard last message!</li>
    <li> I had been using a CHI for a while and just was not happy when I saw this one.  I gave it a try and was so pleased that when I went out of town and forgot it, it drove me CRAZY! I even tried stopping at a drugstore to get just something for a few days.... I was so glad to come back home to this one.  So much better than my CHI. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works so well on my hair. I use it almost everyday. It is perfect and i think everyone should buy it.</li>
    <li> I lucked into a good priced Chi about 7 years ago and loved it! Then it broke and I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it so I bought straightener after straightener at Walmart. Then, one day I happened to see this straightener was on sale for $39.99 and I jumped on it because I knew several hair dressers that use this straightener. I LOVE IT! It straightens my wavy hair in the back (which I haven&#x27;t had happen since my chi) and it doesn&#x27;t pull at my hair! It seems like with all the cheap straighteners it would grasp my hair and pull under the plates which then made if frizzy and damaged. This straightener is exactly what I needed at a good price!</li>
    <li> Nice product, quality and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> Have bought two of these already - one for my daughter &amp; then I decided I wanted one too! Great quality and straightens my hair easily and quickly. The HSI oil that comes with it as a bonus is fabulous too. I&#x27;m hooked on it and prefer it to others I&#x27;ve bought. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one and especially at this price!</li>
    <li> I love using this flat iron on my curly hair. It gets the right amount of heat I need and works very well. It is inexpensive and well built.</li>
    <li> I was really worried that this would be a piece of crap, but it wasn&#x27;t! ! it works just as well as my $100+ chi straightener did, for over 2/3 less of the cost!! plus it came with a nice traveling bag and a tiny vial of hair oil. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this straightener!!</li>
    <li> I bought the product based on other reviews and I found that it does it&#x27;s job. It straightens my hair when I tell it to. Good job flat iron, keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and was just as described. I have very thick, coarse hair and my previous flat iron worked great, but broke after several years, so I bought this one to replace it. I was surprised that I had to put it on the highest setting to even get any results, I have to run the iron over the hair several times to straighten it and I can only straighten a very small amount of hair at a time, so it takes me three times the amount of time to straighten all my hair, then when I was using my previous iron. When I am done, my hair still looks a bit frizzy, not as flat as I used to be able to get it with my old iron. The one pro is that is does leave my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Crapped out in a month.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife a few months back and shes in love with it. By far the best thing I&#x27;ve found on this site!</li>
    <li> This is a a HIGH END flat iron that was recommended by my hair dresser step daughter for my other step daughter&#x27;s 11th birthday present (which  she had asked for). It works beautifully on her thick hair and she loves it. Ironically  she used it on my 10 year old&#x27;s curly fine hair and it also worked wonders (and she did not burn her) so I am VERY PLEASED</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have purchased. The heat goes up to 410 degrees. Takes less time to get my hair straigh.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works well however it is heavier than I expected and has a chunky, boxy design which makes it harder to maneuver around my head. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> just as described.  great value!  shipped quickly and packaged appropriately. would recommend this to anyone - we used it in south africa and worked great with the converter.</li>
    <li> Love it! Gets hot quickly and straightened my hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for 1.5 years now.  I do not have to use it on highest heat (like previous ones I have owned), and there are no stains on the ceramic plates.  This iron heats up fast and the light is a great indicator of when to run it through your hair.  I use it about 3-4 times a week and my hair stays straight for 2 days after!</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Jilbere flat iron that I loved and had for years. I thought about purchasing the CHI based on using it previously and other people’s recommendations. However, I stumbled upon this product and was swayed by the great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m so happy that I’ve purchased this flat iron. I’m an African American with very thick relaxed hair and I loved the results of this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HSI:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-heats quickly and has a great adjustable temperature control&lt;br /&gt;-has a great swiveling cord feature that helps alleviate the tangles you get with other tools&lt;br /&gt;-comes with a glove (Admittedly, I only used it once, but it is a great accessory for those who are likely to burn themselves or use the highest temp—Think Brazilian hair straightening hot)&lt;br /&gt;-doesn’t tug, pull, or snag my hair (a problem I’ve had with the CHI)&lt;br /&gt;-also curls hair very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a flat iron worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron works great for my hair. The hair oil makes my hair smell good &amp; makes it feel softer.</li>
    <li> The HSI ceramic flat Iron works just as well as, if not better then, my last flat iron which cost $100.00 more.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product and would recommend it. I have very thick, coarse hair.  The flat iron really smooths out my hair and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> So much better than my old straightener. Gets the job done and I&#x27;m reasonably certain it&#x27;s not completely frying my hair. It even does a little shaping at the end so I don&#x27;t wind up with super straight hair ala 2002.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girl and she loves it. Works great. God quality. Fast shipping from seller.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product because of the price and I am not AT ALL disappointed. excellent product. heats up fast, my daughter loves it. great price and fast shipping. will recommend.</li>
    <li> I did some research and this flatiron was over $200 and I paid $39.99 for mines and it works like a professional hair stylist. I gives it that shine just like everyone stated. I did receive a glove and a pouch and a small package of hail oil. I receive this today and I recommend this everyone who wants to use it.</li>
    <li> Love my new HSI straightener! My hair is much smoother than with my previous flat iron!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is such a great buy! It heats up within seconds and leaves hair feeling smooth and silky. I have thick hair and it only takes one stroke to get my hair straight (at the highest heat setting of course). This is a great product for a great price. I have tried other more well known brand name irons (CHI, BabyBliss) and none of them work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> My wife was looking for a new flat iron. She developed a list of features she wanted in a new flat iron. This iron was around $100 cheaper than all of the others with similar features. She gave it a shot, bought this one and loves it!</li>
    <li> The HSI is a life saver in the morning. It flattens and shines my hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend bought this via my account when her current hair straightener had died. Seemed to be a great deal, and the product has arrived and works well! No complaints at all and the shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product, arrived on time and there were no problems with it.  I also like the argan oil that came with it.  Makes my hair look great.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair straightener. It works really really well. I used it on my frizzy hair and it only took like one or two times through to completely straighten my hair. It heats up very fast. I would recommend this to anyone, it works great.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery considering I&#x27;m in the UK, only took 7 days to arrive from the time of order! Wasn&#x27;t able to leave feedback until now as I&#x27;ve just received the plug adaptor, which took even longer to come (from mainland UK)! This is an excellent product at an exceptionally good price. Saw the item on the HSI website and the price was 3 times more than what I paid for it on here. I have very coarse thick hair and this is the best straightener I&#x27;ve used that really straightens my hair with just one pass. Cannot express how pleased I am with my purchase and will be telling all my friends to get one too. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and the quality for such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;It also came with some accessories that are very nice.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;Good temp controls&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging with velvet pouch and glove&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I read the reviews others left so I was hoping that I would experience the same when I used the product.  It is fantastic!  What a difference a good quality product makes when ironing my hair straight.  I love it.  This product is easy to use and the temperature advice on the manual is correct also.</li>
    <li> Completely stopped working within only 9 months.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Wife picked it and loves it. She wanted a ceramic flat iron and found this contraption and so far it is working pretty good.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter with the ratings on line.  Not as happy as I wished.  It does a decent job, but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the one I use and is pretty flimsy feeling.  I would buy something else next time.</li>
    <li> perfectly smooth hair!</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron and the argan oil is amazing. Totally would purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I liked the product and the quality, the temperature control is very good. The sleeve that came with the product is really useful, and the packaging is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Ozolin</li>
    <li> I travel and needed a dual voltage device to use when I am out of the country.  Plus, I bought this flat iron to try out on my thick, long hair which is naturally curly and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron works great and gets hot enough to straighten my hair in an excellent manner.  The size is perfect to get any shorter hairs or edges of your hair also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron has worked great for me in the U.S.A., France and Italy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> After graduating from cheap grocery store straighteners, I was gifted a GHD straight iron in high school. After several long years of hard use ( my hair can be quite unruly ) my faithful straightener was finally no more. I was reading the reviews for the HSI and since most said &amp;#34;better than a chi!&amp;#34; and not at a bad price either,  I thought I would give it a try! Unfortunately, this flat iron does to my hair as most grocery brands do. The plates are NOT smooth on your hair. You can literally hear it breaking and pinching the strands.  Also, the heat is not as intense as listed. I needed it on the highest setting (supposedly 410 degrees) to have any affect on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly for a young teens first straightener, it would be perfect, but I would not consider this to be a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; flat iron. I&#x27;ll just splurge on another GHD.</li>
    <li> Great product, heats up fast and stays hot!  Leaves my hair looking great.</li>
    <li> Long, tangle resistant cord is a plus. Heats up quickly. Plates let hair glide through.</li>
    <li> Love this straightner! It&#x27;s powerful and it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for myself a year ago and when my mom&#x27;s old one broke, I didn&#x27;t look anywhere else, I bought her the same one !</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Works well and treats my hair well.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It works better than expected!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my HSI for a few years and it works great!  I never realized the difference between a drugstore brand versus a good, more expensive flatener. My hair is smooth and frizz is eliminated.</li>
    <li> This straightener is just like every other straightener that is NOT a Chi. My hair is curly and thick, and it takes 2 days of straightening with this to make it stay straight.</li>
    <li> This works very well, heats up pretty quickly.  I just turn it on as I blow dry my hair and when I am done it is hot.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the ceramic ionic flatiron. This is the the first time I&#x27;ve ever used one &amp; was surprised at the ease.&lt;br /&gt;Product delivered within 5 days...packaged nicely. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> When I press the iron down to straighten my hair it&#x27;s not flat and always pulls my hair, at the tip of the iron, and it hurts. I do not look forward to straightening my hair, because of this. I want to return it but online returns are such a pain my the butt.  Update- it finally broke, mainly because I threw it. So excited to buy a chi!!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 1 star it&#x27;s because it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations based on the reviews.. It says its fast shipping but it took 10 days to deliver it and I&#x27;m so excited to used it but another disappointment because it doesn&#x27;t work with my hair. It takes a long time to straighten it.&#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the first one I ordered as a gift. Unfortunately, the first one never would turn on and heat. Fortunately, I had purchased it through Amazon so I got a refund and then ordered the second one at a slightly higher price. The second one works fine.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better.  Easy to use and does not snag hair.</li>
    <li> Have had this for several weeks now, and really like it.  Great value for the price.  I have moderately straight, frizzy hair and use this to smooth it out and straighten it completely.  When it is fully heated, one solid run through hair straightens it perfectly.  Size is great.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Fiancé loved it! She straightens her hair every day and this straightener makes her hair look healthy!</li>
    <li> The flat iron works fine.  It is just a little too heavy and thick and not as easy to hold on to as the one I had previously which was a Sudo.  Overall it is okay</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my new flat iron. I&#x27;m in Vegas now with my sister, and she has a professional flat iron she paid $200 for. She used mine and loved it as much as much as hers.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and she loves it :)</li>
    <li> I have never been so ANGRY with a product. This came not only unwrapped but broken with 3 cracks, dirty, and the logo fading off!!!!!! This was USED and broken and stuffed into the box! Seriously?! And now I have to return the product which takes time out of my already hectic schedule. I was REALLY looking forward to getting this what a WASTE!</li>
    <li> I was surprized how well it worked because of the reasonable price. I would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie</li>
    <li> The straightening iron heats up very quickly and works well on my thick and course curly hair (think 80s perm)! It makes straightening only about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> My first flat iron!!  So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and fast free shipping!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! It heats up momentarily, I can adjust the temperature really fast. It does its work well. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on good reviews but seems to be like any other average flat iron. I got this for my wife as a gift. She used it only a couple of times and went back to her flat irons she bought at Walmart. Did not have any issues but I feel this product was overpriced.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, nice even heat and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out. Great price, great salon quality flat iron. Gonna buy another for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> i read some reviews and was very excited about this product. Once I got it the product did not turn out that great.  It does straighten hair but takes a lot longer than my previuous one.  I have had better results with the one i had before.  There are better products on the market than this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what all the hype is about. I have fairly normal wavy hair. I used a hot tools for 15 years before it died and forced me to buy a new one. Based on the reviews for this one is why I got it. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as you would think, at least mine didn&#x27;t. It is just sitting there collecting dust now. I get better results with my blow dryer &amp;#62;:( waste of my money, wish I would of purchased a Hot Tools product. If it works for you great, but I personally didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love the HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 Ceramic trauma line ionic flat iron!  I have short, fine hair and it gives me volume I want.  I have used the hot brushes, curling irons, etc. and this HSI is the only tool that delivers the volume I want with no curl and a slight bend at the ends!  And if I wanted curl, it would do that too!  Amazing product.  I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I bought this because of the reviews I read and I will say I agree with all of the positive ones.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the packaging. The accessories are very handy.&lt;br /&gt;(glove and argon oil...sweet!!)&lt;br /&gt;My point? if you are loking for a high end product and the low end cost,&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;it is really fun to use!</li>
    <li> This flat iron Got my hair straight, fluffy, and light. It was really a good investment for the low price.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, no complaints</li>
    <li> This iron works great for straightening or curling.  It heats up very quickly and is very easy to use.  I have very dry, wavy hair and this iron does not seem to dry it out even more or cause it to frizz.  My hair looks soft and shiny for the first time in years.  It even came with a free glove and travel pouch. I tried the Argan Oil and it made my hair very soft and shiny.  I am pleased I was able to find a high quality flat iron at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> great love it. works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of flat irons and paid 4x what this one costs but this one is the best without question.</li>
    <li> I love that this is an adjustable (heat wise).</li>
    <li> This flat Iron is the best I have used on dry hair. (I also have a Remington Wet 2 Dry) It creats sleek and shiny straight hair. Ans as my hair is thick and course that is a challenge. The shipping was fast as well.</li>
    <li> Love the heat setting!  Great deal!  Works as well as my Chi for 1/4 the price!</li>
    <li> Awesome Argan Oil Products!</li>
    <li> My hair was pretty damaged from using a metal iron in the past. I switched to this iron, got a hair cut, and my hair has stayed very healthy. :)</li>
    <li> Even heat--Great flat iron.  Great seller</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. I bought this for my mom on her birthday and she loves it. I actually use her straightener more than I use mine. I am actually about to buy this again and especially since the price went down. I would recommend this for any one needing to buy a new straightener or first time buyers. It heats up really fast and doesn&#x27;t need to be at the hottest because it gets super hot.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I&#x27;m happy with it.  Heats up quickly and has a very long cord.</li>
    <li> Product came fast and its a great product for a great price</li>
    <li> We have now purchased 3 of these and absolutely LOVE the HSI!! For a fraction of the price of other flat irons...this one works just as well as at my salon and will continue to buy them and give as gifts 😃</li>
    <li> I have only used this flat iron once. I have naturally curly thick hair, shoulder length. Each time I run the iron down the hair, the sides at the tip of the iron catch my hair and pull. Also it is not smooth..feels rough going down my hair. And yes I use Argan oil beforehand. I bought a Hana about 8 years ago that finally died, but they cost arounf $300.00. I was trying to find something suitable but less expensive. This one is not recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. Plates right from the box looked flimsy. Do no buy this item as it dragged her hair with plates and broke/burned them. These good reviews are misleading. Returned no issues.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was just ok for me. My last flat iron was a John Frieda that heated up to 455. Maybe that&#x27;s the problem. My hair is coarse, and if it&#x27;s not hot enough I have to go over it 3 times. The HSI also tugs at my ends. I was torn between this one and a Paul Mitchell, but this one had such good reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it. Disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I did a great deal of research which taught me that \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot;, \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; and \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; really do matter. After looking at options that met my whole list of criteria (especially world wide dual voltage)I was surprised to find one so much lower than the rest.  At just under $40, it was a real value.  I have used this flat iron for several months now.  It works well and I have found no problems.</li>
    <li> I was \\&quot;upgrading\\&quot; my flat iron from the Chi.  The HSI flat iron does its job but I like the Chi better because it doesn&#x27;t take as long to heat up and it seems to get hotter than the HSI flat iron.  Overall, they both do the job.  I guess the HSI was purchased at a better price than the Chi though so both are good.</li>
    <li> I have thin and frizzy hair. The HSI straightener, with its tourmaline plates, really helps in removing frizz and giving my hair that sleek, shiny look! I have used other, more expensive flat irons before. I loved my old Solia one (again, with tourmaline plates). When that got burnt (my fault...I used it abroad and the voltage difference burnt the iron). Later, I bought CHI and Babyliss ceramic flat irons. Neither did a good job of removing frizz. Finally, I bought the HSI flat iron. I am quite satisfied with it! It is able to remove frizz from my hair and give it back that healthy soft look! On the downside, I wish the temperature control dial was placed more conveniently. Still, that&#x27;s a small inconvenience for the price and the results. The fact that it can be used internationally is a bonus, since I do travel out of the country.</li>
    <li> It did not heat up properly even. Not very hot even when set to the highest heat. But it must be a fluke with the flat iron I received since everyone else rated it so highly.</li>
    <li> It works really well. The only thing I&#x27;m not a big fan of is the placement of the dial to adjust the temperature and the fact that it gets really hot (which it does say on it) on the outside of the flat iron where the plates are. This makes it a little difficult to use. The temperature dial is tiny and not easy to get to. All my other flat irons had the flat dial that comes out to the edge. One other downside to this flat iron is the large square plug. Ive never seen that on a flat iron or any other &amp;#34;hot tool&amp;#34; before. Only on blow dryers. You can&#x27;t have your blow dryer and this flat iron plugged in at the same time :( It does work really well so I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for those things.</li>
    <li> Very please with this straghtner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this flat iron a few times and so far I&#x27;m liking it. To be fair, I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before so I&#x27;m not very proficient yet, but I really like that I can adjust the level of heat, that there&#x27;s an on and off switch, as well as a travel bag.  I think it was reasonably priced and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used no-name walmart brand of hair straighteners. I have extremely curly (ringlets) hair that can take up to an hour to straighten. It usually will take me a few times to go over it with others because of humidity or other reasons, but I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have to touch it up nearly as often. The price was amazing, and I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new straightener. The adjustable temperature is a plus!</li>
    <li> I just received this a few days ago.  So far it&#x27;s great!!!  It arrived on time, perfect condition.  Has done what the ads and other reviews said.  Excited to be using this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as my first flat iron, so I was a bit nervous.  I didn&#x27;t want something that might damage my hair, but at the same time, my hair is thick, so I needed it to be good enough to straighten my hair, which has a mind of its own.&lt;br /&gt;The iron works great.  It heats quickly, and even a novice like myself was able to use it effectively.  I really like that it has a variable temperature setting.  My hairdresser warned me against buying one that doesn&#x27;t have a heat control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  Got it for a good price, too.</li>
    <li> Great straightener for a great price. I love the glove that is included with it as it keeps my hand from burning while still giving my hair that straight sleekness that I seek :)</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener.This is the first time I am using a straightener and I found it very easy to handle and operate.Moreover as it has temperature control unlike certain other straighteners which has a fixed temperature setting, I used a lower temperature setting which I was comfortable enough to avoid hair damage. I have moderately long hair and it just took me 20-30mins to straighten it to a desirable level.Although the manual is not very detailed ,for eg the LED light which indicates the heat setting glows red as well as orange.But I am not sure about the difference between the two colours,need to figure it out.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get my HSI because of the rave reviews. I was pleased at how quickly the straightener warmed up, which was positive. The negatives are that it doesn&#x27;t work well to curl my hair. I have tried countless times to have it curl my hair, and even if it does, the curl falls out in a few hours. I also find it hard to straighten my hair quickly with the HSI because my hair is thick/long, and you have to do tiny sections. In a hurry, this is frustrating because I want the job done quickly. Before I have had straighteners that are 2\\&quot; and I think I prefer that to this one.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!  Heats quickly and straightens my hair with one pass of the iron.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave any creases in the hair, especially at the roots.  Fast shipping and good price too.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best straightening iron I have ever used. It leaves my hair looking like I just stepped out of the salon all day.  Even after a night&#x27;s sleep, my hair still looks good.  I am more than happy with the product I received.  It shipped immediately, arrived nicely packaged. Excellent monetary value.  Everything exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely by this product again and from this vendor.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It heats up quickly and goes through my hair smoothly.  My hair stays pretty shiny after using it too.  The only thing I wish it had was an indicator light so I can tell it&#x27;s on.  Yes, I could look at the switch inside, but a light on the outside would be more convenient.  Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> Item shipped quickly, no damage.  As it is a gift I can only assume that everything works as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> The plates are nice, everything surrounding the plates is cheap and shot. Returned and got my handy dandy Corioliss! I did love the free argon oil sample. Will buy that again from them</li>
    <li> I try not to leave negative reviews, but I really don&#x27;t understand how this rates so well on here. This product made my hair feel nice ONCE, and that was when I used the free sample of oil. It always made my hair feel drier and more brittle, plus it had a weird smell the first few times it was used. Nothing special - already packed it away &amp; onto another brand hoping for better results!</li>
    <li> It does feel and look cheap. The plates pulled on my hair. I don&#x27;t understand the raving reviews.</li>
    <li> Horrible iron! One plate doesn&#x27;t heat up and the other side doesn&#x27;t even get hot! Pulls on my hair and takes me twice as long to iron my hair! Such a waste of money</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener.  i have naturally curly hair and usually wear it that way, but I do like the option of straightening it from time to time.  My prior straightening iron didn&#x27;t work well.  I had to blow dry my hair out straight and even then I would end up with frizzy hair once straightened.  I&#x27;ve also had to use the highest heat setting on my hair leaving my hair burning hot to the touch.  But, with this HSI professional straightening iron, i got smooth straight results easily the first time I used it, even starting with my hair curly.  It glides easily through my hair.  the cord is nice and long so you aren&#x27;t tethered to the wall and it also swivels which is nice. It did a great job straightening even set to a much lower temp than I am used to.  I&#x27;m SO excited about this iron.</li>
    <li> Wife really likes it, says it works a lot better than previous and gets her hair done faster!  She would recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife as a Christmas present. She can&#x27;t stop talking about how it has changed her life. It straightens her hair really fast and makes it shine.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very pleased with my purchase of this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener over a year ago and I have loved it!! I have curly hair and it does a really good job making it straight and gets rid of the frizz. I do not like, however, that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto turn off. I have left it on a couple of times and it will burn the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I dropped mine one too any times, and one of the plates broke and chipped. So be careful not to drop yours! I will be purchasing the same straightener, only with the digital display and auto turn off. Although more money, I think it&#x27;s worth it! These are great straighteners.</li>
    <li> It is very good quality. I love the agan oil with it too so I ordered it. The price is great too</li>
    <li> This is a great Flat Iron Hair Straightener!!!</li>
    <li> Love how soft your hair feels when finished</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price, I needed something for trips fit the bill. The only item I wish the flat iron had was an auto off.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to order this iron since I was used to a CHI iron which burnt out but I LOVE this iron and really love the heat protection spray you just must get also. This iron gets hot quick and it does not pull your hair!</li>
    <li> Came in right on time and it works great!!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter likes it.  Her Mom has one just like it so it must be good.</li>
    <li> So far I really like the flat iron.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This flat works great as a replacement for my Chi that broke.  This flat iron heats up well.  I love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Best one ever used very reliable no burns a real pleasure to use a lot better than espected,easy handleling the traveling kit is Awesome no else give those anymore,very satisfied best deal around,HSI you have a new user for live.</li>
    <li> I wish it closed while it heats up (needs a lock).</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product I recommend it to everyone.. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for nearly two years and just love it!  I purchased 2 more, one for my travel bag and one to replace the first one.  I&#x27;ve been really bad at keeping the plates clean from build up so I wanted to start new.  I&#x27;m keeping the first one in the bathroom closest to my pool so that I have it handy when I need it. It still works great, I just can&#x27;t get all the build up off. I&#x27;m careful to wipe my new one down each time I use it. No problems and I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loves it, works like its supposed to.  :)</li>
    <li> Great product and especially for the price! I bought this for my daughter who usually uses a 2 inch hair straightener but she really loves the versatility of this one.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this straightener!  It is an excellent value for the money.  I can see why this is a #1 seller and top-rated item.  Updated 12/2015: My wife used it daily for a full year before recently dropping it on the floor.  I just ordered another one since she loves it so much.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent price and fantastic straightener! It heats up very quickly and works way better than my last one.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, does the job. Still working after 3.5 years.</li>
    <li> Well....this was Purchased for my younger Niece as a XMas Gift and I happened to ask her just the other nite how she was liking the Iron (She had asked me for one as a Gift) &amp; she simply said......I Love It !  So between the Item arriving as advertised....fast, on time Shipping and the Item getting a &amp;#34;I Love It&amp;#34;........ that says 5-Star to me !</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it! It&#x27;s very nice and sturdy and gets very hot. The glove comes in handy not burn yourself in tight places.</li>
    <li> Great product I have naturally very curly, frizzy hair and this flat iron makes it silky and smooth without damaging my color treated hair. I like it so much, I purchased it as a gift for a friend who claims its the best she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great. Heats up quickly an I love how you can set the temperature. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the plug came broke. It still works though, at least for now. Hopefully it keeps working and I wont regret not sending it back!</li>
    <li> I love these flat iron....</li>
    <li> Works great!  my daughter and I both use it everyday.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved her gift!  It came in as expected.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Friday, December 26th and it arrived yesterday, December 29th. Kudos for the fast shipping and delivery. I was able to use the iron on my hair today. This review is only for the flat iron. My hair has been described as hard to straighten by more than a few people who have tried to straighten my hair. Today, I let my hair air dry after applying Moroccan oil (not the free sample of the argan it came with), in order to have it in its natural, wavy state. It took very little time to get my hair straight with this iron. I am impressed beyond measure. I really do not think you can beat the price. It definitely went beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am a professional with almost 30 years in the hair industry. This iron is a great value for the money and I would recommend it to everyone. I still get some pulls and snags, but it smoothes my ends and makes my hair look healthy.</li>
    <li> this is the best one i have ever bought!</li>
    <li> Great product, does a good job on thick, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and a great price</li>
    <li> My wife reports the heating element pad is smaller than her previous flat iron so she can&#x27;t give it 5 stars. However everything else about the HSI Professional she loves!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love it</li>
    <li> no instructions in the box.  Had to read some of the previous reviews to see exactly what settings, etc I needed to use.  The go green light is deceiving.  It comes on when warm, but not necessary up to the temp you need</li>
    <li> This is the second straightner I am buying from them. The first broke after 2 years and one to many times dropped. Works great.</li>
    <li> Love my HSI flat iron! I love that I can adjust the heat to get my hair as straight as I want it. I have curly, thick hair and it works so well, no one would ever know. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their hair straight</li>
    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get quite as hot as my old CHI flatiron did before.</li>
    <li> One use and I already sent it back - guess I was spoiled by my original Chi that&#x27;s still going strong after 10 years. Forgot to pack the Chi on a 2 week trip, and didn&#x27;t want to go without one for that long, thought I could go cheaper based on the reviews.  Several reviews mentioned a snagging problem and coarse or thick hair.  That was exactly my experience as well.  It doesn&#x27;t glide nearly as well as the Chi, and at the end it somehow snags and pulls. Can&#x27;t be good for my hair, and I hate it. Maybe if I had no frame of reference I&#x27;d just put up with it, but it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the Chi on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it !!!!! Works great and love the pouch. We buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the product, love the service and love love love the price I saved $50  my hair is lovely . but why the glove?  I</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. Haven&#x27;t heard anything from recipient about the item so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. When we got it my wife was very impressed with the initial quality, solid and sturdy feeling, however it snagged her hair when she used it. Before I even had a chance to worry about it, Blue Novelties emailed me to see how we liked it. I told them the problem. They said sometimes a defective one is sent out, so they sent a new one without any hassle and I didn&#x27;t even have to complain about it. It was an awesome statement of how they 100% guarantee their product. My wife loves the new one her hair glides through it, it heats up very fast and as a few other people said, her hair stays straight longer without kinking. Very very happy!!!!  Wife says it&#x27;s better than the chi she used in college.</li>
    <li> It is awesome but only thing is due bad packaging oil (included one sample Oil) was leaked and spread all over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll use it on my extensions but not my real hair, It made me feel like it was tugging and burning my hair, but it works really good on extensions so that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law and she absolutely loves it. She has already told me at least half a dozen times how fantastic it is and how much better it is than her previous one. I feel confident that I can strongly recommend this product on her behalf.</li>
    <li> Love this, was waiting for a sale on another decided to try this one and am so glad I did. Just as good as the expensive ones. Love it. Love the price</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product, you can&#x27;t beat the quality you get for an affordable price! I highly recommend this product# Satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my niece as a Christmas present. She is 22 and said it is the best hair straightener she has ever had.</li>
    <li> Was surprised how easy it was to use.  Gives my straight hair a soft shiny curl.....</li>
    <li> This flat iron is wonderful for my natural hair. Its as if I got a fresh perm. It gets really hot, so you have to be careful. I have African American hair, by the way. This tool worked wonders for my hair. And I like the free argon oil sample. It was great.</li>
    <li> As expected, works great.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well. Happy I ordered it</li>
    <li> Great flat irons works as good as CHI!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  I&#x27;m so glad I spent the $35 for this flat iron..:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great iron for the price. Could be hotter and slimmer, but a great price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Works as well as expensive ones for a great affordable price.</li>
    <li> great product works quickly</li>
    <li> Better than I thought. Arrived many days before scheduled. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Came fast will order again</li>
    <li> Thanks for making my girlfriends hair straightener shopping easy, and affordable, great product, was a little hesitant going through Amazon. I don&#x27;t usually shop online, but what a great experience she loves it way better than her old chi. Thanks again keep up the good work guys!</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER with a. FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment.  I absolutely love the straightner/ flat irons! Before this purchase, I researched how to chooses last irons. The HSI hair straightner is ranked in the Top Ten Best Flat Iron Review and were heavily recommended by the websiteP&amp;#34;Flat Iron Queen&amp;#34;.  The plates heat up quickly and no matter how thick your hair, these tourmaline infused pales will leave your hair smooth, silky and straight! Definitely worth the price. I received my flat irons super fast, too!</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron last week!  My old one broke so I had to buy a new one and thought I&#x27;d try this one out, sounded great for the price.  Everything arrived as it said it was supposed to with the Argan Oil and all.  It also does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I have naturally curly hair so when I blow dry it I have frizzy hair that needs some help from a flat iron.  This flat iron does a great job and seems to do it much faster than my old one.  I was using a Helen of Troy Ceramic Flat Iron which worked well but this one maybe because of the heat and the oil works faster and I am able to do the cute curls and flips much easier than I was able to before.  It&#x27;s a great buy for the price!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I wanted my hair to look the way it had been done by my professional stylist, but I couldn&#x27;t go back to her every time I wanted a straight &#x27;do.  This product gives me the results I want.  It is easy to handle and use. It heats up quickly so you can start using it within a minute or two of turning it on.  It usually only takes minutes to style my shoulder-length hair. I love the way my hair looks with the HSI straightener.  My husband even commented that he liked the new styling.</li>
    <li> Great quality, and really works well with my thick hair.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this for my  daughter for Xmas and she loves it, great sale price too!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and very fast delivery. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am going on 2 years natural. My hair is thick and I tried to straighten it before and it didn&#x27;t work out very well. The flat iron is amazing but I also think the way I blow dried my hair had an impact on the flat iron&#x27;s ability. The iron left me with heat damage too but use a heat protectant and a medium-high heat setting.I was skeptical while reading the comments and the praise of this product but it is exactly what I wanted! Buy it, you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Great product, well handled, promises kept for delivery. Well done!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavey hair and this worked great in straightening it. Love that you can adjust the temperature.  Excellent price</li>
    <li> It works.  Doesn&#x27;t heat up fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because if the price. I would buy it again because of how well it works!!  It is so much better than the Chi I had before!!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I just got mine Saturday finally- took over a week to get and I live an hour and a half from where Amazon ships from.... I have it set to the highest setting, I turn it on before I get in the shower so it has a good 20-25 minutes to heat up. It seems like it does not get very hot. The second I run it thru my hair it loses what heat it had and the light goes red. I also find it tugs my hair. It also takes me several times to go over the same spot. I have owned a Chi for the past 10 years and loved it, after my last one went out I thought I would try something new, less expensive. This had great reviews, but I too am ready to return and go back to the Chi.</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener to use on holiday in the USA. I have very thick hair and wanted to look sleek and groomed on holiday. The straighteners were great. They have variable temperature - very suitable to use in the States where the voltage is different to the UK. They were one inch very good for my mid length thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had them delivered to my son&#x27;s address in States. Delivery was very speedy and efficient.Also glove,case and Argan oil were part of the deal.</li>
    <li> I love it and it shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I received my HSI flatiron from amazon yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. . My hair is natural no relaxer and with the use of the fantasia straightening serum and argon oil, I was able to combat Virginia&#x27;s humidity. My hair is smooth, straight, silky, and more importantly protected from heat and the sun. I love this flat iron! With other irons my ends were left frizzy leading me to believe I had split ends.&lt;br /&gt;The HSI smoothed my ends and gave my hair lots of body without the fried burnt hair smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener and it worked good for about a day then all of the sudden the plates stopped getting hot enough to straighten my hair, and the red button that&#x27;s suppose to turn green when hot keeps flashing from red to green whenever it feels like it, so I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s hot and when it&#x27;s not. I was concerned about some of the other negative reviews I have read on customers who have had similar problems, so I contacted HSI directly to ask them about it. They assured me that it was a great product and I would not be disappointed. So I then decided to buy the straightener but it has been a complete joke. I truly don&#x27;t know how this product has so many great reviews. Blue Novelties is HSI professional but with a different name is what HSI told me, so this straightener is coming directly from HSI not a third party retailer, so I know this product was authentic but it sure has let me down. I returned the order to Amazon and purchased the Babyliss Pro TT with tourmaline and it is hands down better than this straightener, I will never buy an HSI product again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. It exceeded all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this flat iron two weeks and its been working great.  I used to have an expensive Sedu flat iron that went on the fritz just as the warranty went out. I didn&#x27;t want to spend over a hundred dollars on another flat iron.  After seeing the reviews, I decided to buy this one for half that price and give it a try.  I&#x27;ll write back if I have any issues, but for the price it performs like any brand that would cost twice the price.  I have shoulder length, thick hair and this iron does a great job.</li>
    <li> Okay, if you&#x27;re looking for a high end flat iron at a low end price this is it! First of all this is my second one I&#x27;ve purchased. I bought myself one then bought my mom one that&#x27;s how much I loved it. I only need to go through my hair once and since I&#x27;m natural and care a lot about my curl that is very very important ! I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed and the oil is the bomb.com. Just another added touch plus they have great customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have own many flat irons and I find that this one is very similar to my very first purple flat iron \\&quot;herstyler\\&quot; which I paid about $150 for at the mall kiosk years ago &#x3D;(! I dropped it so many times that it finally broke so had to get something new.  I&#x27;m SOOO glad I was able to get this at a good price!  It leaves my hair smooth and shiny! The argon oil is amazing as well!! I will have to get some more once I am done with the sample &#x3D;D Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good straightener under 50 dollars. I have tried many different brands including the expensive name brands like chi and this one just doesn&#x27;t compare. It is simply amazing. It leaves your hair so silky and smooth. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener ever!I was at first worried that this would not be a good straightener due to the affordable price it was. I have bought many straighteners for this same price that wouldn&#x27;t do anything for my hair but fry it. This HSI straightener is the best. My hair is hard to straighten and never holds a flat look for a day. This straightener happens to straighten my hair the first time it touches my hair and it stays straight all day long even after I sleep on it. Not only does it perfectly straighten my hair, it keeps it looking healthy and frizz-free. The first time I used it, people thought I had went to a professional to get it done! I definitely recommend this HSI straightener to everyone. Plus, the argon oil that comes with it smells amazing and does a wonderful job with the straightener on keeping my hair looking and smelling beautiful. You only have to use just a small dab of the oil and it goes a long way. If you are looking for a straightener that gets hair straight the first time it is run through your hair, this is the one to get and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I borrowed a friend&#x27;s flat iron and could not believe how silky smooth my hair felt after using her HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener.  It is a great price and gives excellent smoothness to my frizzy hair. I purchased one and then my granddaughter wanted one. She is sixteen and only wants the \\&quot;what&#x27;s in now\\&quot; products.  She has told her friends about how much she loves this HSI Ceramic Flat Iron.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants smooth, silky hair with no damage to your hair.</li>
    <li> What a bargain! I have very thin hair just below chin length and this takes me 5 minutes. No need to keep going over the same spot over and over. Once or twice through and it&#x27;a set. Glad I got it as the price!</li>
    <li> My daughter is loving this straightener.  I did a lot of research and it paid off, this product is very good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the reviews are so great on this product.  This flat iron does NOT glide through the hair, it pulls and ripped some of my hair out even when not applying heavy pressure.  Also, the plates do not close fully unless you exert great force (which rips your your hair even more).  The only parts of the plates that touch is the very top when using in a normal fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to try and replace a KQC x-heat which I broke (stepped on, my own fault) and this doesn&#x27;t even come close.  Will be returning and re-buying the other iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HSI really does feel like a cheap product.</li>
    <li> Great straightener for a great price! Would def recommend buying this one! Heats up within a minute and goes up to 140 degrees! Love it!</li>
    <li> I can totally see a difference in this straightner! I was actually quite suprised it works so much better than the same one at Wal-Mart for the price!</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive to buy this product since I&#x27;ve never heard of HSI, but no regrets. I bought it during the lightning deal and paid less than $40. It was to replace an older flat iron that I burnt out after 5+ years of use. I received it promptly (thanks for fast delivery Amazon). I tried it out the day that I got it. I have course hair, so I set it at a high temperature (not the highest, but pretty close). I used it to curl my hair rather than to straighten it. This did an excellent job! My only complaint is that the temperature dial and the on/off switch is in a little awkward place, in between the two plates. I almost burned my hand turning it off. Hopefully, this will last.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the product! The size is perfect, the material is high quality! I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this item to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this HSI flat iron straightener for my wife after her CHI straightener stopped working. Not knowing a thing about straighteners I was immediately attracted to the significant cost savings on the HSI compared to others in the market but was worried that a lower cost equated to a cheaper product. Well she has been using it for over a week now and has repeatedly said it is better than the old one so this is a highly successful purchase! I not only saved us a bunch of money but got a feather in my cap too!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI professional straightener for my daughter. Wow!! This product is amazing.  She has very coarse wavy hair and a lot of it. It used to take me hours to straighten her hair, and then within an hour it would frizz. This works in half the time with excellent results. I even use it on my thin straight hair for volume. Try this product..You will not be disappointed! Especially for the price! Excellent Product...Excellent Seller!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet but the weight seems right. As these are my 1st pair of flat-irons, I&#x27;m happy w/ the look &amp; feel. Some reviews mention on/off button location (on the inside) as bothersome, I&#x27;m undecided on this. I paid $40 for the iron, glove &amp; tiny lil argan oil LOL. I&#x27;ll give the oil a test; if I like it I can get some later</li>
    <li> Excellent iron. Especial for the price.</li>
    <li> This one ranks up there with the chi straighteners which I used to own. after I dropped and broke my chi (twice) , I decided to try this product which seemed to have great reviews. It works great! I have really thick coarse hair and the high setting works fabulous without burning the ends. I&#x27;m so happy with this product that I&#x27;m recommending it to my sister and cousins who live by Chi</li>
    <li> Loved the great deal I got when I made this purchase for my daughter&#x27;s birthday present.  My daughter loves it.  Shipped quickly.  Price was great too! Would definitely buy from this supplier again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loved it. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price. I expected it to get a little bit hotter than it did, but it does the job, and I have pretty curly hair. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife she loves it</li>
    <li> Heats fast. Works great. Shipped exactly as promised. Love the oil!</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron. Just as good as any CHI... Perhaps even better - comparing price and all the extras it comes with - this is an excellent buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flat iron my hair every day, so I needed an iron that could stand up to the task without frying my hair.  The HSI flat iron truly does that. Quality product.</li>
    <li> Best one I have purchased, and I have many.</li>
    <li> When my TruCeramic Pro died on me recently, I learned that their &amp;#34;lifetime replacement warranty&amp;#34; was no good because in the 8 years I&#x27;ve owned it, they went out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking around on Amazon for a replacement from a non-infomercial and salon-trusted company I found a great deal on this HSI straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well as my TruCereamic Pro did and I loved the extras included like the heat-resistant glove and Argan oil sample.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and I am amazed at how silky smooth and straight my hair is after using this straightener. I love that it has a control so that I can use the highest setting and my daughter can use a lower setting for her straight fine hair. Great product and fabulous price!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!  Price was awesome and it arrived very quickly.  I&#x27;ve always had a Chi- this flat iron is WAY better!  You can&#x27;t find a better value or product!</li>
    <li> such a great product. this is a gift for someone but i have one myself also ordered here! AWESOME PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It straightens my hair in half the time and it&#x27;s silky soft (my hair, not the flat iron). I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read some reviews were they mentioned the iron was pulling/snagging their hair, which had concerned me, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all, thankfully.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when my Sedu hair straightener broke after a few years.  It works well, heats up fairly quickly.  It isn&#x27;t as smooth as my old one though and takes a little longer to heat up.  However, given the price difference, most people would probably opt to buy this product over the Sedu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably keep this one until it dies.  But I&#x27;ll invest in another, more expensive hair straightener like the Sedu in the future because there is a noticeable distinction to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sedu link: http://www.amazon.com/Sedu-Revolution-Tourmaline-Ionic-Styling/dp/B003AJLQ4W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1414594101&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;sedu+hair+straightener</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price, but I didn&#x27;t love it. Went out and bought a new Babyliss instead. I have waves and loose curls, so a flat iron usually has a decent overall effect on my hair. But I found myself having to go over sections of my hair again and again to get the same results that I typically get easily with the Chi and Babyliss brands I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> My hair is baby fine and curling irons did not work on it for more than a few hours. I was amazed when my new hairdresser used this hair straightener with good results. At last something that works!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the hair straightener right away and am happy I did.</li>
    <li> I had a Baby Liss before, and is not as awesome, but for the price it does a good job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small but cute straightener. I just used it about 4 times , so fa so good.</li>
    <li> Great Hair straightener!  I have used CHI for years but at the cost of this one it works almost as well.  It definitely gets really hot and straights perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just like my old Chi.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a straighter that was going to do the job. Im a hispanic woman with curly, curly hair. This did the job for me and in less time . Im so happy with my new straightener.</li>
    <li> Straightens hair rather easily without having to go over same spot multiple times. It heats up quickly and does not pull your hairs like some straighteners do. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have spent triple the money for higher end products but having found myself in need of replacement i began reading reviews for all flat irons. This particular one was a highly rated, reviewed item and the price couldn&#x27;t be beaten.  I ordered it and received it quickly. I love it, it performs to my demands and will recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, price was absolutely enticing and performance is above expectation.</li>
    <li> Good quality flat iron.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully, it arrived very quickly and I absolutely love the price!</li>
    <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t really like it :( I have thin, long hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!!  I have long, thick naturally wavy hair.  I had purchased a Babyliss about 4 years ago.  I spent over 100.00 on it.  It recently died, so I decided to go with this one because of the great reviews.  I wish I had bought this instead of the Babyliss!  Great price, great product!</li>
    <li> From the insane reviews of this, I thought it was going to be life-changing! :) It is a very good straightener and a good price for it&#x27;s effectiveness, but I would not say it as good as one of the higher-end straighteners. I got it because of the dual voltage for a trip out of the US and it worked very well with an adapter.  The oil, however, may be my favorite part. They send you a little bottle of Argan oil with the straightener and I think I am officially hooked on the stuff.</li>
    <li> These Flat Irons work excellent, they get very hot and they leave your hair shiny and soft with that salon look and feel. I have a short bob and they curled my hair very well. I recommend these to anyone with any hair length, they should work well.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves great product for a great price</li>
    <li> Great product and simple to use. I had to help my 13 year old use it, but her hair turned out beautifully.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! Thank you for a high quality item!!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, gets VERY hot - it only takes me one or two passes to straighten my hair.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very happy!! Bought this for my teen daughter and she really loves it!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it. Works as well as the CHI I previously owned, at a fraction of the cost. Completely worth the money. In fact, it works so well, I purchased a 2nd one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had an automatic shut-off I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great for the price! Very professional tool for the hair. Nice detailed and the seller will definitely be one I look forward to using in the future!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve owned (I&#x27;ve had 5) - even better than the Nano. Great price!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on flat irons &amp; this one was absolutely the best. It was everything I hoped for.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it!  Does a great job and my hair looks shiney and healthy!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast service!!!!!</li>
    <li> great product works great!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I purchased this item months ago and have been very satisfied with my purchase. It works very well and have not had any issue. Item was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this iron.  I have had so many compliments on my hair since using it. I won&#x27;t buy any other brand from now on!!!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron my wife has used up to this point.</li>
    <li> I love it . Works well to straighten and curl with an awesome price</li>
    <li> bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> ..I was hoping for a better product...I&#x27;ve had MANY straighteners, but this one takes the prize of being the worst.  It pulled my hair every time I ran it thru and there was hair hanging on the plates......had it less than 12 hours....it&#x27;s already on its way back. ....</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> This  product works fantastic! I would recommend it to all of my friends</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener! I have long wavy hair and this straightens it so quickly and holds all day! Would definetly recommend</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;m impressed. I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. I normally buy more expensive irons and I was overjoyed to find out that this iron works very very well.  I have naturally curly hair that is extremely frizzy after I blow dry it. This iron makes my hair very smooth and beautifully straight.  I&#x27;m grateful to the people who review Amazon products; without their reviews I would not have found this iron. The oil that comes along with it is fantastic. Don&#x27;t hesitate; buy this iron and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron to replace my CHI.  It just didn&#x27;t seem to be working right after 4 years.  So I looked up flat irons and was looking at between $150-200.00.  When another search turned the HSI up, I read the reviews and decided I had nothing to lose.  I ordered one and got it a couple of days later (thanks to Amazon Prime).  It really works!  All of the great reviews were accurate.  I have coarse, medium thick hair, cut in an angled bob.  My hair is difficult to tame.  I used the oil that came with flat iron, and my hair now looks silky and straight.  So, if you&#x27;re debating about this, go ahead and order.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I think this flat iron is great. It heats up fast and is not overly bulky. I like that is cake with a pouch to store it in.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair very smooth and doesnt catch hair at all.  The oil and glove  that it comes with is kind of a gimmick, but the actual product works well.  It heats up very fast as well.  I only straighten my hair once in a while though, so i can not speak to how well it will work with continual usage over time.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this no stars. I bought this in May of 2014, and it didn&#x27;t even make it 5 months. It never really straightened my hair very well. Never again will I buy this. Back to a Chi I go!</li>
    <li> So glad I listened to the reviewers. This straightener is amazing! It heats quickly and straightens wonderfully. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product. Seems like a high quality flat iron; haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  It heats up fast and leaves my hair looking great.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been wanting a flat iron for a long time. She saw this deal for $39.00 and decided to get it.  It work great and we got it earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> use it everyday.. it is hot, yet doesn&#x27;t fry your hair.  It is great product for the money</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. What used to take me forever with my one only takes minutes. Plus the best part was the price I paid. I am getting the same results that I would have with one that could have cost upwards of $100.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to anyone looking for something new.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift for my wife. It was delivered on time and at a great price. My wife loves it and was very excited when she got to us it. I would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Great product, solved my problem for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have a very curly hear and this Iron doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Second time buyer-love it!</li>
    <li> Works fine so far (used 4 times) but does not seem well made. Parts of the plastic exterior edges are jagged and do not seem glued properly to the ceramic. Can easily scrape hands  unintentionally.</li>
    <li> I like it much better then Chi</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.  I bought it to take with me on a trip to Europe and it worked perfectly.  It heated up quickly and I liked the red travel bag.  It made it easy to find in the suitcase.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! It gets hot fast and straightens my wavy hair quickly! This straightener is comparable to my CHI and Milano ones!</li>
    <li> Everything as promised.</li>
    <li> tried it today for the first time, good</li>
    <li> best hair tool ever!!!love it!!!its a steal for the price and it really works it didnt make my hair dry</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. Works fast and efficiently. Only con is it snags her hair a lilttle bit from time to time.</li>
    <li> Best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever owned only thing I don&#x27;t like is that u don&#x27;t know how hot it is</li>
    <li> Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> ordered for Xmas 2014 after reading several good reviews. girlfriend loved it, and the value is incredible.</li>
    <li> Great product! Just as described.</li>
    <li> I was not happy at all with this flat iron but for the price I thought I would try it&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to get my hair stright and when I did it looked fuzzy and dry I do really love the oil that came with the flat iron</li>
    <li> Bought this and its garbage, Bought myself a Karmin and much better iron.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron and the argan oil! I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet. Quick shipping and great price</li>
    <li> Works well - has a strange location for the turn on button (underneath close to heating element).  Once you get used to it, not a problem.</li>
    <li> Works good as expected.</li>
    <li> Performed as expected.</li>
    <li> Seriously this has been the best sale i have bought in my life. Gives an amazing shine to her, doesnt do much damage, brings all the tools necessary and adaptable.</li>
    <li> This straight iron is very effective and easy to use.  No hot spots, doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  Works fast.  It&#x27;s greatly changed my morning routine for the better.</li>
    <li> Daughter got it for christmas.  Was worried that it would just be another flat iron.  Said it is the best flat iron she has ever used.  loves it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the recipient loved it--better than a different brand of hers which stopped working.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price! I see no need to spend big bucks on a pricier one.</li>
    <li> One of the reasons that I decided on this particular straightener is because it included a free 5 ml bottle of Argain oil.  There was no oil in the package that I received.  I was very disappointed. The straightener looks great.  Everything looks to be in working order.  I am sure I will be happy with the straightener.  I would like to receive the promised oil.</li>
    <li> I used to have a CHI that my daughter claimed as her own. I bought this iron based on all the great reviews. Returned it after the first time I used it. My CHI used to glide through my hair. This iron pulled my hair and felt like it wasn&#x27;t even hot (you ladies know what it feels like when you think your flat iron is turned on and it isn&#x27;t). Sometimes you get a deal, sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This item was not made well, i have frizzy hair not really thick more like thin and it would not straighten it at all. This product i thought would be amazing because of the views but it was not at all. Also the argon oil i thought would be a little bit bigger and it was so small. I always used a CHI and i wanted something cheaper. I should of stuck with the CHI because it lasted me 4 years and so now im going buy another CHI and have to spend allot more money but better quality. There is one thing i can say though is that AMAZON is amazing with returns i got back my money and shipping i paid within 5 days and they emailed me and everything when it went back in my account so i must say amazon customer service is fantastic! but if your looking for a good hair straightener go for the CHI anyone is great and Paul Mitchell i heard is great too. :)</li>
    <li> Amazing, went from wavey, nasty, dry, damaged, frizzy hair to silky soft straight! Only took one use and i was hooked! Cheep too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than my Chi but the price is great and it heats up nicely.  The Chi and my prior flat iron both developed electrical problems after about a year.  This is a very good value.</li>
    <li> I have NO IDEA why this product is on the bestsellers list on Amazon. It doesn&#x27;t run smoothly down my hair, its rough and its pulls. I have thin asian hair so it should be fairly easy to straighten, but not with this. I have to drag down my hair mulitple times on the same section of hair. It leaves my hair feeling crispy and dry. I had to go back to my 2 year old $25 straightening iron from CVS , BUT it is still 10x better than this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Wow I just got my flat iron a couple of days ago I went from a big thick Afro to silky straight bouncy hair i can&#x27;t stop touching my hair I love love it.</li>
    <li> It is a great iron. I have been using conair for a while, this one heats up faster and works very well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Was a fan of CHi until a new one gave out on me. Was a little hesitant to go elsewhere but decided it looked too good to pass up. I could not be happier with my new HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. Works like a champ which is what I needed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this straightener.</li>
    <li> The wife is super happy with this iron flat or whatever this is... So need I say more?! OK I will anyway... She says this is the best flattening iron or ironing flat she has EVER used--believe me, she has gone through a few! The oil thingy that comes with it is supposed be magical as it helped her tame her otherwise wild hair! So I am ordering an extra bottle of that oil for her--she used a VERY tiny amount of it when she used the flat iron the first time, so the 2 oz. bottle they sell should last you a very long time, unless you straighten your hair once or twice a day... It still should last you over a month I&#x27;d say. Anyhow, so overall, a five-star product in my book. Wife is happy, which means I am happy too! :)</li>
    <li> i originally wanted to purchase a GHD hair tongs , but after reading other comments and the massive price difference i took a gamble on these, cant not find a dual voltage switch but will find out when i go back to australai, heat up super quick and HOT which perfect for my hair the delivery was a day before estimated date , i also purchaced the tong holder which is also perfect can not find fault with either product ,just hope they are right about them being dual voltage,perfect and a good price as good as ghd and over 100 bucks cheaper , buy these ,</li>
    <li> No wonder this product has good reviews. It works very well on my hair (long and wavy) like my CHI flat iron. The advantage of HSI over CHI is the temperature adjustment. Sometimes the CHI flat iron becomes very hot and difficult to manage. So, i prefer using HSI and CHI will be my backup.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 24 year old daughter and she was delighted with the results, having left her hair soft and shiney. She takes pride and care with her hair and this iron certainly delivers in all aspects of hair safety and grooming hair beautifully. The delivery time was very prompt especially ordered so close to Christmas and with living in Australia.Thankyou kindly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards Pauline</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I have had thus far. I have tried quite a few. This iron really lives up to all the hype that the reviews I read gave it. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was happy to own HSI flat iron and using it was really fantastic..I have used lots of hair flat irons with brand names and expensive ones but HSI flat iron is more effective. This HSI flat iron provides my unruly, coarse, curly hair to look great and straight.</li>
    <li> Works well and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using flat irons for over 10 years, and it has been a struggle finding a good one that actually lasts and doesn&#x27;t pull out all my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a CHI that I spent over 200 dollars on, and not even a year later it just stopped working, it worked in the morning however in the evening it stopped. So I visited amazon went through the flat irons and the review and this one had some great reviews, plus the price was something I couldn&#x27;t beat. It arrived within a couple of days, greatly packaged and when I tried it, I fell in love. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out and the best part is it lasts through humiditym with the chi I had two straighten it 2 times sometimes 3 a day, this one I straighten before work in the am and by the time I get home from school )11ish pm) my hair is still shiny, still flat! I love it, I will never buy another chi! If I could give it 10 stars, I would.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  I was skeptical at first since I&#x27;ve always used Chi, however after using HSI it is comparable or better than the Chi.  The price was a lot cheaper than the Chi too.  I highly recommend you try this product.  Another plus is you can adjust the heat setting to your type of hair, so you don&#x27;t burn it.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> great product! Works very well on my daughters ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It does just as good as my CHI at half the cost!!!!  I love that you can set the temp on this iron.  My CHI did not have this option, and I found that I can set the temp lower and it does a great job on my fine hair.  LOVE this product, it is a must have if you are looking for a new iron and dont want to spend hundreds of dollars on a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Chi flat irons and thought I would take a chance on trying the HSI professional iron. I really like it. It is a very good quality iron and cools down quickly. I would recommend this product to anyone wondering if it is just as good as some of the other expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I have wavy-ish hair and the straightener i was using wasn&#x27;t really doing its job. This straightener is perfect. It heats up quick, and straightens pretty quickly considering i have long, thick hair, reaching the bottom of my back. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it. It comes with the glove thing and an argan oil sample which smells really good but i haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It came with a free bottle of oil for your hair and it works amazingly as well. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and gets your hair very straight. It gets up to 400 degrees for all types of hair. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Having read the reviews of this product, I purchased it for myself late last year.  The product worked quite well, up to and until the plates cracked and broke accidentally.  This product has a one-year warranty and when I contacted the manufacturer for a warranty replacement, I was told that accidental damage is not covered as this is a &amp;#34;salon grade&amp;#34; appliance and they will not replace my product.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> These are decent straighteners and seem pretty good value. They came with various things but I&#x27;ve not needed them. I like that you can adjust the temperature.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. I should have bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing.  I have been a Chi owner since 2007 and thought Chi was the best... even though 2 Chi&#x27;s died on me.  I was also duped by those Mall Kiosk people and bought a Royale hair straightener... don&#x27;t ever do that!!  They sold me a broken one and then when I tried to return it, they said they don&#x27;t return items, only exchange.  The next one they gave me was awful also and broke in less than a year and I wasted $200!!!!  This time, I decided to take a chance and go with something new and I did NOT want to spend a lot of money again.  I was impressed by the reviews for the HSI so I decided to give this a shot.  This flat iron works just like the Chi, but probably better.  And it&#x27;s so much more affordable.  It really really works well!!  If you want to save money and use a great flat iron, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very finicky about my hair, especially since I have a lot of hair, thick, wavy and frizzy.So, I came to Amazon again to be rescued  after my Royal flat iron fell from a top bunker and smashed in several pieces,and found this one. I couldn&#x27;t ignore the thousands of excellent reviews and decided to give it a try. I loved the price! I liked that it came with a glove, and I really liked that the temperature reaches up to 400+ degrees. The pouch is a nice touch also. I really loved that this flat iron leaves my hair soft, it doesn&#x27;t burn the hair, and I can curl it if I wanted to. It remains straight until wash time, and allows me to not abuse the hair with constant ironing. I will definitely recommend this iron to my friends. From now on, this will be my go-to brand!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s average. You get what you paid for. It has really high ratings so it did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Granddaughter and she Loves it!  Came sooner than expected!  Another plus!</li>
    <li> Great value and works well!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron bar none. I read over 200 reviews before I decided on this one. I have mixed raced hair and with only two passes, it gets my hair butter soft. Plus the cord is long!!! Will repurchase.  I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a great value.  It works just as well as brands costing twice as much.  Also, it has a temperature control.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Initially had some issues keeping the power on, but after reading other reviews I pressed the reset button (a pain in itself) and the iron heated up pretty quickly. It straightened my hair so quickly and left a sleek look. It is SO much better than my old FHI iron, which I spent almost $100. This is a pretty good bargain for the quality of the iron. I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It will make my hair more smooth. No need to preheat it, hair can be done very quickly.</li>
    <li> really glides through hair..the settings are very convenient. Heats up rapidly. My hairdresser recommended this brand and I&#x27;m glad I followed her advice! It&#x27;s  comfortable to use. A very good value too.</li>
    <li> While this straightener was good if not great while it was fully functioning. Unfortunately, this morning I found one of the ceramic plates had cracked in several pieces fro the center out.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I can straighten my hair so quickly! I bought one for my niece who has thick curly hair and she says its great too!</li>
    <li> This iron is not as magical as I expected after all of the glowing reviews, but it&#x27;s decent. I was pleased to see the insulated travel pouch it comes with (I do think the glove is overkill, I&#x27;ve never met a flat iron that didn&#x27;t go up to 400F so it&#x27;s nothing special in that regard), and the argan oil is a nice touch although I&#x27;m not much for using oil in my hair.  Build quality is a bit suspect. The temperature control is primitive at best and unless you have it cranked all the way up, it&#x27;s a crapshoot as far as guessing the actual degree of heat. It does heat up quickly, though. Indicator light on the bottom is kind of weird, but mostly irrelevant. Long cord is a plus, particularly for traveling purposes when it&#x27;s very possible to be faced with an unsavory distance between outlet and mirror. Dual voltage also a huge plus, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this if it weren&#x27;t.  All the reviews mentioning how the plates sort of &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; the hair are correct. Hair does not glide effortlessly between these plates and while it doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing breakage (yet), it&#x27;s a less pleasant and less efficient straightening experience for sure. The end result is decent, however. In a few spots I did have to make several passes over the hair, but it ends up smooth once you&#x27;ve taken the time to use it properly. Of course, I think nearly every flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used has been at least somewhat impressive right out of the box, especially in comparison to whatever I&#x27;m replacing, so I guess only time will tell how the plates hold up and how the heat level maintains through daily use.  In short, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with this flat iron, but it&#x27;s a pretty good bang for the buck especially factoring in the inclusion of a travel pouch, the dual voltage capabilities, and the oil sample. Even if it does crap out in a year, forty bucks isn&#x27;t too tragic to have spent on the endeavor. If you&#x27;re in need of a new iron and can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to shell out the better part of $200 for something fancy, I think this is a solid option.  Edited 5/25: I have decided to return this thing. I&#x27;m leaving the 4 stars because I do think it&#x27;s a pretty good value with nice results if you&#x27;re willing to be patient with it, but as someone who straightens their hair on a daily basis, I really can&#x27;t deal with the pulling/dragging issue. I experimented a bit with adding curls with this iron and it went terribly. Since the plates catch the hair, every single curl has resulted in a kink because the plates grab and hold for too long before being able to slide the iron through to create the curl and it looks awful. While I don&#x27;t curl my hair that often with a flat iron, I&#x27;d at least like the option to be able to do so. I&#x27;d rather spend more money to have a product I&#x27;m truly satisfied with rather than just thinking &amp;#34;it&#x27;ll do.&amp;#34; Off it goes.</li>
    <li> I loooooove this hair straighter. It made my hair beautiful.i read many positive comments about this product and decided to give a try. Buy this straighter . Especially with ardock oil. You will never regret!</li>
    <li> I have super short hair that I am growing out right now...which is a pain...but this straightner helps me iron out my bangs and completely makes my look go from &amp;#34;mom hair&amp;#34; to something that&#x27;s much more suited for a twenty-something. Heats up very quickly and does not pull on my hair like cheap irons will do.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great traveling&amp; reaches a high temperature.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of flat iron before buying the HSI PROFESSIONAL CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON and this one is by far the best one I have owned. I have curly and frizzy hair and after using the flat iron my hair is not just straight but it feels soft and frizz free. My hair style lasts longer now, what helps me save time and also helps my hair to stay healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I use the flat iron in my daughter&#x27;s hair, and she loves the result every time!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a great product at such a good price. It is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and excellent packaging.  It took me a few minutes to figure out how to turn it on, but since then I have used it on my hair everyday.  Love it!! Leaves my hair looking healthier and less frizzy; opposed to the store bought brands.  Very Satisfied!</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser talked me into a brand new style which required me to use a flat iron on my hair.  He recommended a brand that was much more expensive.  After reading reviews, I purchased this one due to the price and positive reviews.  It has exceeded my expectations!!  My daughter has a flat iron that cost $150 and this one works just as well.  It heats quickly and does a great job straightening my new hairdo!~</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this purchase, I had a CHI previously and this is equally as good, or even better, and you can&#x27;t beat the price $40.!!</li>
    <li> Been using a chi brand iron for 10 years or so and it was not heating up anymore.  Did not want to spend the money on a new one.  This product was cost effective and just as good.  Very happy! Heats up fast and the results are excellent!</li>
    <li> It was what I expected.  Very happy with it!!</li>
    <li> So this is my 3rd time using the flat iron since they arrived and it is pretty good.  I guess I have such a high expectation of using a flat iron that straightens within 1-2 glides regardless of the wave pattern of the hair. This iron is more like 3-4 glides. Heats up super fast and if on the highest setting (410) you should use the provided glove to protect those fingers.  Super fast shipping was 2 days w/prime!  Overall I love the product and would purchase again if I had too for the great price.</li>
    <li> Impressed with iron especially for price and brand. Works very well with smooth irons. Gave it only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light. Got product immediately.</li>
    <li> Just got it for my wife&#x27;s birthday, shes used it a couple times. It curls really well.</li>
    <li> love it my old one is in the cabinet under the sink lol</li>
    <li> This is awesome. I had a Remington one for couple years ..I was putting much effort to straighten my hair ,.. finally I decided to try something else. I read other reviews and ordered this product. I just received it and  I was so excited to test it... Unbelievable, it did very well on my hair with much less effort though :) try it</li>
    <li> Its ok i give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I liked it, but after using it, I love it.  I don&#x27;t know what the glove is for, I have never used one; its an awkward thing to have.  I would much rather have been given a heat protector for the iron itself so I can take it on trips. but the iron does its job and quickly too. It doesn&#x27;t seem to take me as long as my older iron, which I like.</li>
    <li> I personally love it.It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and even without using any product my hair is shiny &amp; smooth after using this flat iron. I love how it has a temperature nob to regulate it. And it also comes in a nice little carrying case. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my new flat iron and the carry bag it came with.  Would recommend it definitely.  I also love the free Argon Oil that came with it, will definitely be ordering a bigger bottle of the oil.</li>
    <li> The argan oil sample that everyone else is raving about comes in an packet so small that the quantity is perhaps 1/4 of a teaspoon. It&#x27;s possible that the company used to give more and changed their policy, but that&#x27;s what I got with mine. The straightener itself was definitely not of what I could call salon-quality. I&#x27;m not sure what other folks are used to using, but when I&#x27;ve gone to the salon, the straighteners they&#x27;ve used on me have gotten very hot, very fast, and gotten my hair super-slick-smooth. This straightener did none of those things. I already have straight, fine hair, but even at a high setting, this iron did not flatten my hair to a glossy sheen like the models that you seen in salons. Granted, I didn&#x27;t pay a salon price for it, but considering the other reviews, and for something to call itself &amp;#34;professional,&amp;#34; I expected a little more. :(</li>
    <li> The flat iron make your hair really straight without damaging it. Especially for my kinks and curls. The oil also does not way it down.</li>
    <li> I would love it even more if it had auto shut off feature.  I love the quality of the iron--especially for the price!  I am impressed with this flat iron.  I love that the cord is long and that the cord turns at the iron to prevent tangles in the cord.  I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Straightened my hair but it snagged the whole time and my hair was frizzy after.  Lightweight is about the only good thing I can say about this iron.  Returned it the next day and ordered the brand I usually use.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This straightener was better than I hoped for at the price I paid. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron at a great price! Only complaint is that my baby hairs get snagged occasionally!  Would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron, I Love It!!!! Price was very reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> Heats up extremely fast, which I like, I will recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> Nice product. It straightens my hair well and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because of the positive reviews and I must say it was worth the gamble. Works better than my CHI. After straightening my hair with HSI, my hair feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I just received my new straightener and it works very well! Keeps my hair straight and silky without getting frizzy. It also heats up quite fast, so I don&#x27;t have to wait long at all to start using. Sometimes the light turns green to indicate that it is ready, but will go back and forth between red and green. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product and I recommend it to anyone in need of a quality product without shelling out a ridiculous amount of money.</li>
    <li> I love the Adjustable temperature from 240F to 410F and how it makes my hair shinier. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to flat iron being that I have natural African American hair. This flat iron works wonders and gets the job done. Usually when I flat iron my hair I&#x27;m never able to keep it straight for more than a day or two, especially being that I stay in Louisiana with all this humidity. But I would say with this iron my hair stayed straight for a week and it might have stayed longer, but I washed my hair. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS IRON TO ANYONE. My only con about the iron is that I don&#x27;t necessarily like where the controls are placed.</li>
    <li> Got my straightener a few weeks ago. I have very thick curly hair that usually takes an hour (and another person) to straighten. I was pleasantly surprised that it got hot so fast and worked so well on my hair type without burning it. I&#x27;d recommend this product even for people who aren&#x27;t great with hair (like me). Of the straighteners I&#x27;ve owned, this one has worked the best for me.</li>
    <li> These heat up very quickly and do a good job of straightening my hair. I did just have my hair cut recently but before then, I had long hair, past my shoulders. My hair is VERY thick: we&#x27;re talking so thick that I need to book two back-to-back appointments whenever I get it cut, because it takes so long. With this flat iron, I could straighten my hair in under 20 minutes. My hair is naturally wavy and I had it permed about seven months ago, and a few corkscrew curls still appear every now and then. The flat iron straightens them completely, and it does it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons I&#x27;ve given it four stars instead of five, and both of those could be user error. First, my hair doesn&#x27;t always stay straight. It never goes back to being completely wavy, but sometimes the ends start to &#x27;flick&#x27;. This is most likely because I&#x27;m doing something wrong, and I do live in Georgia, where it is very humid, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Second, my hair definitely isn&#x27;t as healthy as it was before I started straightening it every day. I use argan oil for heat protection, but my hair is dry at the ends.</li>
    <li> When I received this straightener it looked pretty nice a lot of cool things came with it but then I tried turning it on and it would not work. Basically it did nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my chi straightener stopped working. I was a little hesitant, but decided to give it a try. This is a wonderful product! My only complaint is that my free sample of \\&quot;oil\\&quot; was opened and spilled in the box.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It Works better than expected!</li>
    <li> Omg I cant even tell you how good this flat iron is I just took my weave out that i had for 6 months and Omg I had a rats nest under my head it was so nappy and dry but this flat iron got my hair Bone straight and it gave me a bounce too...I fell in Love with this flat iron</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase.  I had been looking at a much more expensive straightener because i have long thick hair that is very time consuming to fix. When i found this one for half the price and all the great reviews i decided to try it and am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This straightener has worked well for me so far. Nothing to really complain about. It straightens my hair and gets the job done. The argon oil is also a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself &amp; within a week I ordered one for my friend that used it &amp; loved it too.  Heats up fast and works great.   I love the glove &amp; the hair oil too.   We are both very happy....especially with the price!!  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I have thin frizzy hair,does a good job straightening. Makes my hair perfectly straight and sleek .  Warms up quickly. Only thing I wish this straightener had was some kind of stand for when it warms up. And I threw out the silk storage bag. It is too small and difficult to get the straightener into. Overall I would recommend this, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> This is great. My 10 year old uses it. Can use to curl nicely. It gets hot so be careful. It flattens well (and straight!).</li>
    <li> Gets hot and straightens my mess of hair. Doesn&#x27;t EVER pull my hair which has been a problem in the past with other brands. Very happy with this purchase. Thanks amazon reviews for this pick!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my CHI unexpectedly died and I didn&#x27;t want to spend an exorbitant amount on a new one. I came to Amazon and found this flat iron and ordered it after reading how amazing the reviews are. I purchased it almost exactly a year ago and have used it regularly since and it has held up really well. It heats up quickly and the cord is on a little swivel so it doesn&#x27;t get in your way. The heat options are really nice and it has a light to let you know when it&#x27;s on or off. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to replace mine anytime soon since it&#x27;s holding up really well, but when I do need to replace it I will repurchase this one again!</li>
    <li> It works well enough, but seems to fry the ends of my hair (obviously, it is heated and by heating my hair at such a temperature I am causing it irreparable damage) and breaks off the ends. I do not use it often, nor do I blow dry my hair too often, and my ends are not over-dried or very damaged. I only use this when necessary, due to the fact that I feel it is highly damaging. Does get the end result of straightened hair, however, which is why I purchased it. Just wish it felt softer on my hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace my Chi straightener and after researching online and on Amazon, decided on this one. At the time, my hair was long - to the middle of my back - and since it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s difficult to style. This straightener dragged across my hair instead of gliding across it, and also pulled at it, and it bent the ends under instead of curling them under. So, I had to pay to ship it back.</li>
    <li> I thought I was cashing in on a really good opportunity, but it turns out that it was too good to be true. It has amazing reviews from tons of people so I was pretty convinced it was a great product. The heat dial is hard to twist because it it located at an awkward position. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to get nearly as hot as the dial selected temperature and resulted in my hair not actually getting very well straightened. Also, when you are in the process of straightening your hair there seems to be quite a bit of &#x27;drag&#x27; as in it was almost pulling my hair out as I was trying to straighten it. Very disappointed in this product. :(</li>
    <li> Product looked great and was true to photos provided. Product came with in promised arrival date. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really rate the iron for it&#x27;s effectiveness because the one I received has a damaged chipped/cracked plate and I&#x27;m not going to snag, rip out my hair on this thing so I have to return it.  But, I ordered a replacement and if this one is not defective I will update my review.</li>
    <li> The straightener works as good as my old one.  The oil is great!  Very smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel oily!  Love the storage case too!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite flat iron. I love the temperature control and the results I get when I use it.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this product, except for the fact that it does grab my curly hair a slightly bit and is not as smooth as I wished for.  It is definitely worth the price and seems to be a good product. I do travel and am very happy I can use it in different countries with different voltage.</li>
    <li> Love this! Straightened great, heats up fast and the rounded edges perfectly flip my hair out or under</li>
    <li> It works very good. My hair looks smooth and shine after using this product. I use everyday.</li>
    <li> Great value and works very well. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Hair goes from frizz to sleek in seconds!!</li>
    <li> This is only the 2nd review I&#x27;ve ever posted before. I was using a remington wet/dry straightener that I had for years. I only used it occasionally to straighten my flyaways. I recently got a short cut that was going to require regular straightening. This HSI straightener shipped quickly and I am loving the results! I don&#x27;t think my other straightener could come close. A big thanks to the seller!    UPDATE 3-5-16:  My poor straightener, like other reviewers, is starting to have heating issues. The light will never turn green to say that it is finished. Also, when it says 310 degrees (still no green light) it is super hot as if it&#x27;s 450, or more if that&#x27;s even possible. This has been going on about 3 months, not sure if it&#x27;ll make it any longer or not!</li>
    <li> It heats up fast, straightens &amp; can curl hair nicely without leaving lines in hair. So worth it and was surprised because of price. I would recommend to a friend 100%!!!</li>
    <li> I like it.. But still love CHI brand better. The edges of this straightener catch on my hair so it&#x27;s not as comfortable straightening my hair than it is with a CHI.</li>
    <li> this flat iron does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I have very hard to curl hair and it curls in nicely. Love the glove and the case and the bottle of Argan oil. And the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This was an early Christmas gift I gave for my daughter and she was so thrilled and loved it so much she said that she doesn&#x27;t want any other gifts when Christmas comes. It is an excellent hair straightener and makes a nice hair curling iron, too!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!! Makes my hair feel soft and the glove helps out a lot with not burning my hand.  Pouch is wonderful for travel after use. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend for Christmas and she really likes it a lot. She said it cuts her hair straightening time in half compared to her old one. She gives it 5 stars</li>
    <li> My 18 year old granddaughter had been begging for a Chi hair straightener for her birthday.  I was totally ready to bite the bullet and spend a lot of money, but b4 ordering it I read all of the reviews and ended up seeing how everyone was raving about this HSI straightener.  I ended up deciding to take a chance on this, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  She loves it...and I loved having that money left over to buy her some clothes!  She has thick, kinky hair, and so far this is doing a great job.</li>
    <li> Heavy weight, and as explained.  It&#x27;s not better than my Conair flat iron for some reason.  Can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, but the weight of the iron is great.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful. My wife loves it</li>
    <li> heats up fast and works well.  still practicing but I think that it was a great deal</li>
    <li> I loved it!! it does an excellent job of straightening my hair. I have a CHI that I cannot adjust the temp and it is just to hot and leaves the ends frayed. I can adjust the temp of this iron and it was half the cost. I also really liked the argan oil that came with it and will be ordering more of it.</li>
    <li> I actually bought two of these (at a great price) and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;One of my daughters has softer hair that&#x27;s easily straightened, while my other daughter&#x27;s hair is more coarse and it takes a bit of work to get it straight. I was able to do both heads with ease and it looked like they had just come from the salon (actually even better).</li>
    <li> My wife likes it. It warms up fast and does what she needs it to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 for my all female family. They all love their new straighteners ........ need I say more ??????????? 3 happy females makes one happy dad !!!!!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought it based on other good reviews hoping for the best. I was not disappointed! Works great and leaves my hair looking like I came from the Solon.</li>
    <li> Works better than the one I paid $100 for!</li>
    <li> I replaced my chi (which lasted 5 years until it finally pooped out on me) with this straightener. I read all the reviews and thought it was a good pick. It arrived on time, packaging was nice. My hair is thin and cruly and it breaks very easily but this straightener has created more split ends after ONE use than my chi did in FIVE years. Also it doesn&#x27;t get my hair pin straight in sections, poofs it out, and pulls my hair. Not really impressed.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy. Love the job it does with the temperature control.</li>
    <li> You know you have received a professional grade product as soon as it arrives. Every detail is well thought out. Spring loaded heating elements, super fast heat time, digital controls that stand the test of time and high quality materials and workmanship. Even the included storage pouch is thoughtfully padded and the argon oil is the best available.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! Heats up evenly and quicker than I can get my hair blow dried. I have long, layered hair that is wavy and somewhat coarse and it gets very dry and frizzy. This leaves my hair soft, smooth and -no frizz! Easy to flip and curl with. My hair stylist uses this exact same one on her clients so I looked it up and found it super cheap! This is an amazing deal on a really good flat iron ladies!!! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> What I really like about this product after using it for about one month:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a GREAT value for the money&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up very quickly (less than 15 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;- Solid ceramic plates won&#x27;t flake off like cheaper ones with a thin ceramic coating&lt;br /&gt;- 1&amp;#34; paddles much easier to use on shorter hair&lt;br /&gt;- Hair smooth &amp; shiny after styling&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;d recommend this for most people with the exception below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not so great:&lt;br /&gt;- Paddles don&#x27;t clamp as tightly or evenly as I&#x27;m used to, so I have to use a lot more pressure than I did with my previous flat iron to get the same results. This isn&#x27;t really a problem for me, and my hair still looks great when I&#x27;m done, but this may not be the best choice for someone with arthritic hands.&lt;br /&gt;- Temp dial in an awkward location that&#x27;s hard to see in between the paddles - but if this helps keep the price more affordable, it&#x27;s fine by me; once you&#x27;ve found a workable temp for your hair, you shouldn&#x27;t have to change it.&lt;br /&gt;- Electrical cord stiffer and made of cheaper material than expect. While this may also help keep the price down, it requires more handling care to minimize kinks or other electrical cord faillures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General comment: I had my previous flat iron for almost 8 years. As much as I paid for it, I expected it to last longer, but what ended up malfunctioning on it was the on-off switch. It started going on the fritz about a year ago. The work-around was for me to keep it in the on position all the time, and simply plug it into the wall outlet when I wanted to use it, and unplug it when I was done. This worked most of the time for awhile - although I often had to gently jiggle the switch back &amp; forth (sometimes for up to 30 seconds) to get it to connect. Since the on-off switch was already faulty, even this eventually failed, and nothing I did could get it &amp;#34;on.&amp;#34; A friend who&#x27;s an electrical engineer examined it and told me most on-off switches are poorly made and will typically fail after being used enough times. He said the best solution in engineering scenarios is to wire around the on-off mechanism, bypassing it altogether. Short of this electrical feat, he confirmed leaving the switch turned to the on position and plugging and unplugging the electrical cord from the outlet will minimize these switch failures. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing and will continue to do with this HSI Pro.</li>
    <li> It is perfect!  Everything I wanted</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the straightener!!! I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Love it</li>
    <li> My Daughter and I love it. It straightens with one time over and leaves our hair shiny and smooth. Great buy for my money!!! Two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> It comes with a glove, a carrying pouch, and a bottle of hair product! It works amazingly well! I had the CHI before and paid a ridiculous amount for it. I paid a fraction for HSI and it works just as well, maybe even better!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Flat iron leaves hair straight and shiney the first time you use it! A few swipes on a small section of hair and your hair is straight! You don&#x27;t have to keep going over it like with some flat irons.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!! Greatest hair straightener</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my sister for christmas. She is totally in love with it and uses it everday. Shipping was fast and product was as described.  Thanks for great service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not that smooth finish but ok for price</li>
    <li> From the reviews I expected much more. It is better than your $25 straightener, but it isn&#x27;t professional quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the wife was looking for.  she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great iron!  My only regret is not getting it sooner.  I have been receiving multiple compliments every day on how great my hair looks!</li>
    <li> Great product. I think it will be perfect for international travel.</li>
    <li> I got this device for my wife. My wife has really curly hair and she looks really sexy. While that is all handy and dandy, one of my fantasies is to stroke my fingers down my wife&#x27;s hair while we make hot passionate love. The problem is every time I do it, I get my fingers stuck in her curly hair. So instead of making hot passionate love, we spend the entire time unclogging my fingers from her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got this device, it has made my fantasy come true on a daily basis. I asked my wife, what will her rating be for this product, she told me 4 stars. I am adding another star, cause now I make hot passionate love every day without getting my fingers strangled in her overly curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love how it has temperate control so I can adjust how hot I want the iron.</li>
    <li> Love this hair straightener. Bought one for myself several months ago and ended up purchasing another for my 14 year old daughter. All of her friends want one too. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> My sister was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm in Bulgaria. I&#x27;m glad I have this for international travel.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Love the price!&lt;br /&gt;Another fantastic product from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used! Happy withy purchase. :)</li>
    <li> this straightener is PERFECT for my hair. It takes less time and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair</li>
    <li> I have yet to meet a straightener (even expensive ones) that don&#x27;t catch and pull my hair near the plates...until now! Love this. Worth every penny so far.</li>
    <li> I left my old HSI Flat Iron in a hotel and ordered this model thinking it would be even better, but it&#x27;s just okay. Does the job but doesn&#x27;t heat up as quickly. And I loved that my old one beeped when ready. With this you have to keep looking for the red light to turn green.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great.  Works like a charm.  I like the extra &amp;#34;goodies&amp;#34; that cam with it too....I use the oil when I wash my hair.  It works great with the straightener.</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these as presents for my girls who use them on a regular basis and they both love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderfully quick styling time!!</li>
    <li> This takes a long time to straighten my already almost straight hair. I keep turning the heat up in the hopes it will be better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is all that great, it&#x27;s just an average hair straightener. For me it&#x27;s just ok.  I have to set mine to 450 degrees to get a good straightening. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s good for my hair that I have to set it to the highest temp. I&#x27;ve had other hair straighteners that I can set lower than that for the same price and some are cheaper and accomplishes the same result.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron! I love the results! Heats up fast and leaves my hair smooth, frizz free and shiny! I highly recommend the HSI flat iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item specifically for use in Europe because of its automatic voltage conversion.  The iron worked perfectly in the country and conditions I need it for.</li>
    <li> Makes straightening quick and easy. No need to go over same section of hair over and over. Straightens the first time.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She has unruly hair and need a quality iron that won&#x27;t damage her hair. We bought 2.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this iron, I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it straightens hair. I was going to keep my old one as a back up. But instead just tossed out. My hair is so thick and used to take 20 minutes to straighten. With the HSI  it took 5 minutes. LOVE IT.  Should have bought one sooner.</li>
    <li> Had this straightener for about nine months. I&#x27;m currently looking for a me straightener. It fell off the counter and broke about an inch of one of the plates. I kept using it any way I spent $70 on this thing. Now, however, it turns itself off every time I touch the cord, so it has to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my granddaughter and she she gave me all others she had tried ..she loves it</li>
    <li> I needed a 1&amp;#34; straightener for my very short haircut and was planning on purchasing a CHI.  My husband talked me into trying this since it was so highly rated and $60 less than a CHI.  It works every bit as well as a $100 straightener! It gets extremely hot, straightens in one pass and leaves my hair shiny.  It takes about 3 minutes for it to get completely hot and it stays plenty hot during use. The cord is extremely long if you need it, but I keep half the cord wrapped up with a cord keeper on it so it isn&#x27;t so long. The bag is great for putting the straightener away while its still hot, which my husband is very happy about since its not always on the bathroom counter. I haven&#x27;t tried the heat resistant glove or oil that came with it yet.  Save yourself a good chunk of money and buy this staightener!</li>
    <li> It arrived yesterday and I immediately tried it. I&#x27;ve had trouble with my other straighteners because my hair never wants to actually become stick straight and stay that way for more than a few hours. However, I used the HSI yesterday, with just a drop of the argan oil, no hair spray or other products and my hair is still completely straight today after a full day outside in Floridian humidity, and an entire night&#x27;s sleep. It&#x27;s still smooth and silky and not even my most stubborn curls have reappeared. I also had it in a ponytail for half the day and there was no annoying bump after I took it out, for the first time ever. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It was perfect. I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product and it worked overseas as stated!</li>
    <li> I like the size and weight of it.  Ceramic gets my hair much smoother than my old gold metal iron. The glove is very handy.  I did have to laugh a bit at the size of the oil that ships with it- it&#x27;s about a thumb size bottle.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the iron is that the heat control is a black dial on the inside of the handle so you have to look at it at an angle and try to estimate where a small indented mark has landed- there are no numbers either. If you need very precise control of the heat (like set at 350 rather than the max of 410 degrees) I recommend looking at a different model.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price. Definitely got hotter than my old Chi and feels better on my hair. Not quite as great as a Sultra, but considering I could buy about 5 of these for the same price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an awesome deal!</li>
    <li> My wife REALLY loves her new flat Iron. Good quality. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought two for adult daughters at Christmas.  Nothing but good comments.  &amp;#34;Hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or brittle like old irons.,&amp;#34; and not a bite of frizz!  Excellent delivery,  great price!</li>
    <li> Just received my straightener and I let it sit for a few minutes and it never heated up after being plugged in.  So disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic buy! I bought this item to replace the flat iron which cost me $100 and only worked for 2 years.  I&#x27;ll update to see how longs it lasts.  But with the discounted price and the included glove, makes it a great buy.  The glove actually makes the process of straightening my hair much faster because I can handled the iron and hair at the same time.  This iron heats fast and the swiveling cord works to keep it from tangling.  5 stars</li>
    <li> Great quality product</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron after reading the reviews.  It was going to replace my circa 2009 Sedu iron that had finally conked out.  I&#x27;ll be completely honest.  This flat iron was disappointing.  It straightened my hair - kind of.  I have thick, long, naturally curly hair that  straightens easily and quickly, and usually holds straight pretty well (except in high humidity).  I use good products and only straighten a few times a month.  I approximated where I normally would set the temp and it made no progress on my hair.  I turned it up three times, the last setting at the hottest it would go.  Even then it only kind of straightened my hair.  (Meaning if I went over each piece several times, and did TINY pieces).  After I succeeded in -kind of- straightening it, 20 minutes later you could already see the frizz starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other negatives - The temperature setting is a knob that goes from min to max, no numbers.  You have no idea what temperature you&#x27;re at.  The on-off switch is inside the unit near the base, so it&#x27;s awkward to use - especially when hot.  There is no auto shut-off/timed shut-off.  Every time you plug it in you have to press the reset button???  It is just cheap hard molded plastic - nothing fancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some good things about it - it heated up fast.  It came in nice packaging and had a pretty sleeve to store it in.  It slid through my hair very smoothly and didn&#x27;t pull, tug, or break hair.  No funky burning hair smell - even on the hottest setting (which makes me think it just doesn&#x27;t get that hot to begin with).  The 1&amp;#34; size makes it really maneuverable and easy to use - especially for those pesky pieces near your face.  It left my hair feeling very soft - just not very straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess for the price I paid ($40) I honestly don&#x27;t think it was worth it.  It performed about as well as my travel cheapey straightener but at twice the price.  I will likely be returning it and putting the $40 towards a better straightener.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works fast at straightening my very wavy hair without burning.  I&#x27; very owned  Chi&#x27;s for years, at twice the price and the HS I is a much better iron.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for .....</li>
    <li> Almost perfect.  Just wish it had an automatic shut off...</li>
    <li> Product shipped immediately and was brand new, sealed in the box and flawless.  I purchased this flat-iron for my wife because her CHI flat-iron broke recently. With the price being so low I was somewhat hesitant with purchasing it, but my hairstylist said HSI is a good brand and it&#x27;s definitely listed a great price.</li>
    <li> The iron heats up quickly, which is great. It works well. Although I personally feel the Chi works better on my fine, thin hair; the difference is not enough to justify the higher price if one. I am satisfied with the performance of this much less expensive alternative.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with the heating knob being so close to the hot plates. Without a digital display, you had to mess with the knob while trying avoid getting burned. I ended up buying a Chi with a digital display</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!  Love the storage bag, glove, and sample argan oil... nice additions to the flat iron purchase!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Works better than expected....gets my hair very straight.</li>
    <li> It was nice while it lasted. Apparently there is only a 30 day return on it, which I never noticed. The flat iron lasted just about 6 months... not what I expected for this price. Very disappointing. I&#x27;d suggest buying a flat iron someplace that stands behind them for a year.</li>
    <li> My daughter gives this a 4.5. She loves it, but it does yank at her hair.</li>
    <li> Product great. Was sent in 3 days not even waiting the week that they said very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product should really have an automatic shut-off feature. Twice I&#x27;ve forgotten to unplug it and have come home after 9-12 hours to find it still on.  Admittedly, that is my own fault but it&#x27;s just surprising.  Other than that, this is a wonderful straightener.  Easy to travel with, heats up quickly, and does a great job!</li>
    <li> Very professional flat iron and easy to use.  I love it.</li>
    <li> It gets hot quickly and works really well.</li>
    <li> She really liked the gift</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener! It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and straightens my hair quickly.  I am very happy with it and what a great price!!  I feel like I just left the salon when I am finished.</li>
    <li> Would prefer for there to be a light to indicate power being on or off.</li>
    <li> Its a very good product. Does its job very well. Takes only 30 mins to do my medium length hair. Heats up really fast. I would say in a min. Hair stays straight for almost 4 days without any issue. Its got its own silky carry pouch hence its easy to carry it whenever I travel. I haven&#x27;t used the oil that came with it.</li>
    <li> I had a Sedu flat iron for years and it finally died,  after reading the reviews on this I decided to go with this one. I could not be happier with my purchase! This flat iron does just as good of a job as the Sedu did and is about 1/3 of the price. Love it, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> For the price, this straightener is a steal. I still prefer my ghd but for the price point this is top of the line. I would put this in the range of my sedu flat iron but it&#x27;s about half the price. Never owned a chi so I can&#x27;t compare it to that. Does pull a little but nothing to really complain about. My hair is ver soft, shiny and straight after using this straightener but I think it also has something to do with the cleansing conditioners I&#x27;ve been using. I recommend this straightener due to its drug store price but salon quality. I will continue to use it along with my ghd.</li>
    <li> Trying to get used to this one.  So far, good.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as expected. The cord is pretty long and it heats up quickly. In addition to an argan oil sample and carrying pouch, it also came with a heat protection glove that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this straightener for a few days, but so far it works well. It heats up quickly and straightens my hair without much effort.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift. The first time it was used the plug-in apparatus separated and came apart when the plug-in was removed from the wall outlet. It heated up great, got very hot very quickly, and worked great. This is the first electrical appliance I have ever had where the plug came apart.</li>
    <li> Good flat iron.  Heats up fairly quickly.  Works really well after you blowdry your hair.  Make sure though that you don&#x27;t have the heat on too high, because you will fry your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, I used it in Egypt and worked very well. Just use an adaptor.</li>
    <li> This thing is fantastic! I was unsure about purchasing it because the price was so much lower than I had ever spent on a straightener, but decided to give it a try because of the reviews and I love a good deal…couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  It is a one swipe straightener, has a swivel cord, and has an automatic shut-off feature that comes in handy for those of us who have a little too much going on in the mornings.  I&#x27;ve had it about six months and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair gets straight!</li>
    <li> Great product!  This iron heats up very fast and gets very hot!! Make sure to use a product on your hair when you iron, otherwise it will burn your hair.  Also make sure your hair is completely dry!!  This iron works perfectly and leaves my hair smooth and flat.  My frizziness is gone! I definitely recommend this iron (and I have owned many!)</li>
    <li> Great straightener, even better price! It doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair, and gets hot enough so that my hair stays sleek and straight the next day!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. Love it Update after using this one year:  i found that in the duration of using this flat iron compared to several other brands including the Chi, this is a low quality iron. It requires several passes to straighten my hair, does not leave it smooth or silky and snags my hair constantly. It never gets very hot and i will definitely be buying a different brand soon.</li>
    <li> Works as well as promised. I just have to get used to using it.</li>
    <li> Natural Hair, 3C **4a** &amp; 4b strands, I put the tempurature on 410° because I had never presssed my hair and needed it straight. This flat iron did just that in one pass. Hair felt relaxed. Hopefully I will not have any heat damage, but that would be my fault. Really was amazed by the press and it&#x27;s silkiness. I definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with cute red pouch/bad, glove, and oil I believe (I just used the flat iron).</li>
    <li> Good but hair gets caught on edge</li>
    <li> On/off switch in weird place.</li>
    <li> My daughter has super thick hair &amp; mine is very fine. We both are in love with this!! The argon oil is amazing. Smells amazing &amp; the shine it adds to our hair is gorgeous. Affordable. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered one for my daughter and she loved it, my wife was jealous so I got her one also, she loves hers also. They both were wanting one from a mall kiosk for 120.00, I said to try this one it got good reviews. Smart move, saved some money and they are both very happy</li>
    <li> Had to return this.  The blade is really short and it took forever to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a hair straightener before, but decided to order one from Amazon. The reviews certainly helped me choose the right one for me. It&#x27;s easier to use than I thought and less scary. It even comes with a glove...how cute is that? I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and it works well. It&#x27;s price point was also a factor. I considered gifting it to my daughter if I found it difficult  or uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Not the best but is a reliable straightener with good results.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing the good reviews.  It straightens well, but make sure you brush your hair and divide it into manageable sections. The switch and the heat control are placed between the &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34; which is not so convenient. I mean, when you just have used the ceramic flat iron, turning it off could be dangerous as it is close to the heat source. Also, it would have been nice if there were more heat options and if the clippers could lock. I didn&#x27;t use it for curling, so I cannot give advice about that.</li>
    <li> The one I got was in a very bad quality that when I close it on my hair, the spring wont open it fully. I find this thing to be bad in quality. I don&#x27;t use mine anymore, I bought another one.</li>
    <li> I tried this straightener based on other reviews since the price was very inexpensive.  The product works great and is comparable to high end, expensive straighteners.</li>
    <li> I love this product for many reasons..it can be a challenge finding a hair straightener that not only does its job well, but also one that doesn&#x27;t damage your hair in the mean time. With this tourmaline infused straightener, you get just that: a job well done and healthy hair. And the useful silk pouch used to cool down the hot straightener after use...that&#x27;s like the cherry on top of the cake. What a bargain for the price! I&#x27;m am very pleased and would recommend this straightener to anyone.</li>
    <li> It does the job but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like so I feel like takes me longer to do my hair and the light is not very bright and there is not an auto shut off so its hard for me to remember to turn it off but good for the price</li>
    <li> compared to other ceramic straighteners this one took a while to heat up.  Once heated, it still didn&#x27;t straighten very fast and would take a while to get the result I wanted.  I ordered it back in June and it broke a few days ago, it stopped heating up all together, very disappointing will not be replacing with another one by HSI</li>
    <li> I gave this item as a gift, and it was a huge hit! I would recommend this product. It is high quality.</li>
    <li> Love my new flatiron! Works great and leaves my hair looking shiny, silky, and smooth. Heats up consistently and stays hot. I use it for curling and straightening.</li>
    <li> I had a straighter with metal plates and thought the ceramic plates might be better for my hair. Honestly I can&#x27;t tell. The only thing I do know is my old one was digital and turned off automatically. This one does not.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener for $50 2 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong and beautifully straightening my hair! So recently I bought a second one! I can&#x27;t believe how good this straightener is! I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;very quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to people with very fine hair is works great on mine.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She was using mine.  This is a wonderful flat iron.  I hightly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good Product that my wife and daughter wanted to take on a trip to Europe.  Worked great, small, lightweight and had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I have extremely thick course hair and it gets it very straight with minimal time and leaves my hair smooth and shiny. I also love the argan oil it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener.  Works as good as my old Amika if not better.  Great price as well.  This is a winner!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for her birthday.  She wasn&#x27;t real happy with it; saying that is doesn&#x27;t get has hot has the chi. It took longer to style her hair with this flat iron.  I would recommend this for someone that was just starting out using a flat irons.  But not for someone that is really looking for using it as long time use.</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener, it makes my hair looks like it was done at the salon, and for someone as hair challenged as me, this is no easy feat. Have no problems so far and use it about once a week (twice a week during special occasions). Purchased in November.</li>
    <li> I know little about this except the composition of the surfaces and that the ceramic tourmaline hybrid is supposed to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, my wife needed a new one and this was a Christmas present she helped pick out. Works really well and she loves it. I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend $100+ on any of the other ones when this one works well. As long as Amazon keeps it at the current price of $40, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my adult daughter for her birthday.  She says she loves it and she uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> Not sure what is the little bottle of oil for, but the product works good</li>
    <li> Bought this straightener for my teen daughter who is starting to experiment with different ways to do her hair. She has VERY thick curly hair and we, as first time users, were able to straighten her hair very well with this product in about 30-40 minutes. The tool is really easy to use, sturdy, and has a long cord. It heats up fast (no waiting!) and the glove is really helpful too.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair and this iron does a wonderful job of flattening the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; on the top of head when whether I wear it curly or I blow out my hair straight, it smoothes out the frizz and kinks each day until my next wash.  I don&#x27;t even have to place it on the hottest setting to get smooth hair.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> This is my first one inch flat iron and I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but immediately I was pleased.  It handles well in my hands.  I like the way the settings are on the inside so your fingers don&#x27;t bump into them while you&#x27;re using it.  It heats up very fast and I thought I&#x27;d need it on the high setting because of my daughters natural/thick hair, but I didn&#x27;t.  That thing was smooth like butter (close to the roots) and straightened perfectly with no snagging.  I also didn&#x27;t have any issue with the cord or cord length.  My daughter did not complain and believe me, she would have if she felt the heat get too close.  I get it.  Highly recommend.  FYI, I use it for my 6yr natural/thick hair and my hair which has an agave smoothing treatment.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister and used it at her house one night. I will be purchasing my own. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I love the way it leaves my hair....so soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister. She said it works great and is comparable to the Chi flat iron she used previously.</li>
    <li> When I searched for travel sized flat irons, this came up.  It showed a storage bag, which I thought would be good for travel, as well. It was highly rated by customers.  I was surprised when it arrived, as it is the same size as my other iron.  However, I will not return it, since it functions better than my old one.  I did put it in my suitcase without a problem, but I was looking for a smaller model.  My fault for not paying more attention to dimensions.</li>
    <li> I thought all irons were the same until I tried this one. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;Totally transformed my hair! Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a flat iron, although I have watched my daughter with hers for years.  I am totally happy and love the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped quickly and arrived before I had expected it!</li>
    <li> I had a flat iron already but it always left me wishing it would get just a bit hotter and glide just a bit more smoothly. Well, this HSI product does the trick. My hair is thick and while it&#x27;s not coarse, it&#x27;s not fine either. It can be a struggle to get all of it flattened on the sides and curled just right on the ends. With the HSI I have it smoothed out in mere minutes. I love it. If you have never owned a flat iron or if you have one but wonder what all the fuss is about, invest in this one. You won&#x27;t regret it. Customer service was exceptional as well. My order arrived promptly and everything was as promised. Kudos to this stellar seller :~)</li>
    <li> Works great. I like the temperature control although it it could be a little more accessible and easier to read. Heats evenly and quickly.</li>
    <li> ACCORDING TO MY WIFE, IT DRY&#x27;S HER HEAR.  A GOOD IRON LEAVE THE HAIR SHINY AND THIS ONE LEAVES IT DRY</li>
    <li> Love it, and it is so easy to use.  No more frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This product heats up fast and works well. It is light and easy to use. However, I do have to run it through my hair a few times to get it completely straight. But, I have very wavy hair, so this is the usual course of action for me. Overall, I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She&#x27;s happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Really like this iron. Heats up quickly and straightens well. Really long cord which is very convenient. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given if five stars, but the on/off switch and heat dial is located in the interior of the iron.</li>
    <li> My friend had this flat iron and I loved it so I had to purchase my own. It&#x27;s amazing and it does a great job. Leaves my hair flat , shiny and smooth!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, lightweight, feels good on my hair/without pulling or breaking</li>
    <li> This flat iron/ hair straightener is amazing!  It heats up very quickly and straightens my hair with the first swipe! IN LOVE :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron came highly recommended so when my ancient Chi crapped out I bought this one.  It is not snazzy with quick heat up, auto shut off, and digital display like other flat irons, but my ancient Chi didn&#x27;t have any of that either so I&#x27;m used to it.  It is a big heavy (like my ancient Chi) but it works as expected.  For the price, I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Argon oil was not included, but that wasn&#x27;the why I bought the product, so no big deal there.  The straightener works allright, not as good as what I am used too, but then I usually get the higher quality straightner because my hair is very thick, curly and course; a tough combination for any straightner. But this one will get the job done until I can afford to replace the old one later down the road. The argon oil was not included as was stated that it would be, but that wasn&#x27;t why I ordered the straightner, so it was no big deal for me.</li>
    <li> It is a great straightner. My daughter even tried mine and liked it so well that I ended up ordering her one also. Our hair is difficult to straighten and we both lead very busy lives and are delighted that we are able to straighten our hair in just a few minutes time.</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener for the price.  Does an excellent job, I have thick curly hair and when on high it is salon quality.</li>
    <li> The straightener arrived quickly.  The difference in my hair is amazing.  My daughter has long thick hair and it still doesn&#x27;t take half the time that her other straightener took. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> I have a bad and cheap one before, it takes forward to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;Often I gave up before I get it all done.&lt;br /&gt;so when I got this one, I am happy.</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever.  It works very well and my hair feel silky and shiny.  Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Returned it because it snagged on my hair. It seemed to be sturdy and got very hot but I don&#x27;t like products that snag.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up fast, does the job.  No complaints.  Very nice packaging and seems super high quality. Works great to curl as well</li>
    <li> I upgraded to the digital LCD temperature control model and this a flat iron someone could get excited about!&lt;br /&gt;It works (translation: my frizzy hair is straight!!!!), the price is unbeatable, there&#x27;s no guessing about the temperature setting, the cord swivels (no small matter -- my Sedu stopped working because of an unresolvable twisted-cord problem) and if all of that weren&#x27;t enough, the company that sold it to me was the most responsive and consumer sensitive company I&#x27;ve EVER dealt with.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve ordered this product twice. The first flat iron was ordred for me by my husband as a gift, I noticed that the light that tells you it&#x27;s reached the selected temperature didn&#x27;t stay on as if the iron was losing heat. It also didn&#x27;t feel hot enough or work well and I had it at the highest setting. After reading many great reviews about this I sent it back and ordered another. I use a CHI at home and was hopeful this one would be a better product. Second one came and the same thing happened! I don&#x27;t know if these are just defective because they came from Amazon and not an actual store. I&#x27;ve read that you can get counterfeit products. Not saying that&#x27;s what this is, I just didn&#x27;t have any luck.</li>
    <li> My daughter has really thick \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; hair as she calls it and she loves this straightener. She had one already and broke it so when we went to replace it I asked what kind she wanted this time (willing to pay more for one) and she chose this one again. She said it straightens her hair better than any straightener she&#x27;s used and faster.</li>
    <li> Love it! Not only does it straighten  smooth without any smell or pulling out my hair, it curls great too. I love that it has a loop at the base of the cord for hanging and came with a nice travel pouch, heat glove and sample argon oil!</li>
    <li> Extremely thrilled with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love ittttt , made my 4b hair extra straight !</li>
    <li> Does a great job straightening. Takes a bit longer than my previous Sedu straightener but it was much cheaper so I&#x27;m good with that. My only complaint would be that it pulls when I get to the end of my hair a bit, but it&#x27;s more of an inconvenience that I have to get used to than a problem.</li>
    <li> Our girls love it!. Easy to use and it is very fast. Very nice. You just need to take obvious safety precautions.</li>
    <li> I like to straighten my hair from time to time but it always left my hair dry and brittle. I am really pleased with HSI ceramic ionic flat iron because it does not damage my hair</li>
    <li> Ive been using this everyday for a bout a year now. It works well and doesn&#x27;t overheat my hair. The only weird thing about it is the light that goes from red to green that indicates when it&#x27;s hot constantly switches back and forth at random times. I usually only look at the light to make sure my flat iron is plugged in and working. Heat concentration is nice and balanced. You can curl your hair with this straightener too.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron just takes forever to heat up.  But very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make your hair frizzy. Definately reccomend it!</li>
    <li> This flat is great.  I have relaxed hair, but I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair.  Half of my hair shaft is natural.  This straightened my natural hair nicely and if you use the oil, the iron really seals the hair shaft.  I tried curling my hair and the curls were beautiful.  I use two passes on my natural hair and one pass when reach the portion of the shaft that is still relaxed. I use a medium heat setting and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Works great. Be sure to have a great hair product if you have frizzy curly hair like mine. :)</li>
    <li> I have not had any issues with this flat iron, and it seems to get plenty hot enough. I just think a 1&amp;#34; is too small for my hair. I have soooo much hair and it takes forever to straighten it. With that being said it works best for curling my hair.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Smooths my hair quickly. Speeds up my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky and looks great. Definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I am editing my review to emphasize the customer service from the store/ supplier is stellar. The product arrived right on time &amp; it did work in Mexico (I bought it because I needed a dual current device). However, it didn&#x27;t seem to glide through my hair like my usual flat iron. It did keep the frizz down but only for a few hours; since the humidity was significantly higher, even compared to my Florida home, that no doubt was a factor. Maybe the current did effect how it performed also or there is a coating on the plates...i don&#x27;t know. I was still glad to have it &amp; will continue to use when travelling.  After my review, the supplier emailed me to see if they could do anything to improve my experience &amp; offered a free hair care oil. Great service, true customer care.</li>
    <li> The variable temperatures are great and I can speedily get my hair done. I use it when my hair is already dry, just as my hairdresser showed me.</li>
    <li> Product exceeds expectations 😊 heats quickly and straightens perfectly!</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron, easy to use, and works fast for morning touch up. I&#x27;m not one to fuss with my hair, having been blessed with good hair, but using this is a pleasure and adds a new look.</li>
    <li> I read that this iron could be used for not only straightening, but also curling. I did not find this to be true. I didn&#x27;t need this for straightening because my hair is straight as a board already. I tried to use it to give a little upward flip to the ends of my chin length hair.  It wasn&#x27;t a nice, rounded curl. It was kind of a square curl. I know, I should use a curling iron with a round barrel for this. I&#x27;ve tried, believe me. Maybe my hair is just too thick or stubborn for any handheld curling instrument. I keep going back to hot rollers after several fails with irons. Probably works fine for straightening, but it wasn&#x27;t helpful for curling like I had read.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I decided to get this flat iron.  My previous one lasted for over 10 years and I was bummed when it finally died.  Given the price, I think it&#x27;s really excellent and works well.  My only, slight complaint would be that it&#x27;s kind of awkward trying to adjust the temperature knob-it&#x27;s hard to see and get to with your fingers.  It can be done, it&#x27;s just sort of in an awkward spot on the device.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron!  I have very thick, wavy/curly hair and this flat iron leaves my hair smooth and shiny in a short amount of time!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was iffy about buying this I have been looking for a new straighter for a year now . And I love it ! Thank you</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, really goes beyond straightening to change the texture of hair from coarse to silky!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair straightener that I have ever used. It works quickly and flawlessly. To make it even better, this product came with a heat glove and oil which is awesome. It came quick and right on time. To top it all off, it is priced so well. I&#x27;m so surprised this isn&#x27;t worth hundreds. I&#x27;m so happy that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I have very thick hair that usually takes me about 1-1.5 hours to straighten , but after using this straightener it takes less time and comes out great. ive always had problems with hair feeling brittle, but that was not the case with the HSI. I ended up buying two, one for myself, and after my aunt heard how much i loved it, i bought her one too....overall great product and it was way worth buying</li>
    <li> Heavy, no auto turn of as listed..takes a long time to heat up...unconsistant heating..grabs hair and pulls hair when using..not recommended!!!! Not sure how this had such a high rating..that is the reason I bought..knew the price and the ratings were too good to be true..returning item!!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!</li>
    <li> It glides over my thick wavy hair smoothly and quickly.  Love the travel bag.</li>
    <li> The straightener works great!  I definitely recommend this item for anyone with thick curly hair!  Thank you for a great buying experience!</li>
    <li> I received my first one and it didn&#x27;t heat up much. The company that sells this product emailed me to ask if my expectations were met. I told them I believed I had a defective iron and they sent a replacement. I LOVE IT!!! I have thick hair and this iron does a great job. I am so glad I purchased it. I would recommend it highly. Thanks for the 5 star customer service too.</li>
    <li> Worked amazing; so fast and makes hair super straight and shiny! Best hair straightener I have ever used. And I love that the original price was over $200 and I only paid $35 for it.</li>
    <li> The power cord for this outlet promptly broke after about five uses, by falling out continuously. It also shocked me when I attempted to insert it back into the flat iron. Was very happy I was able to return this for a full refund, since it was obviously a shoddily made product.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a cheaper Revlon flat iron.  This one is wonderful!  I can straighten my hair so much faster now.</li>
    <li> The HSI 1 ceramic tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron hair Straightener together with the free Argain oil leave in worked great in my curly and frizzy kind of hair. I really didn&#x27;t know what kind of flat iron to buy there is so many in the market and they come in different prices. This one have a lot of good reviews and a really good price for a professional flat iron so after doing so much research finally I decided to purchased this item.</li>
    <li> I used it one time and then would not work again.  I tired everything to get it to work.  I was sad because I thought it looked like a very good.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will try another one or not.</li>
    <li> Love this ceramic iron. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Everythink good! Thank¨s a lot!</li>
    <li> It is a good straightener, but I dislike its bulky plug. It makes it difficult to use the same outlet with other devices. I like to blow out my hair and fix it with my straightener.</li>
    <li> Seems like a nice straightener.  The only problem is it isn&#x27;t heavy enough.  I used it once. &amp; has been sitting in the box.  But did heat up nice.  &amp; everything met what I wanted.  Except needed more weight to it</li>
    <li> This product was a gift and it was loved!!!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this flat iron is so awesome that I just had to. I cannot find a single thing wrong with it. My hair is naturally kinky curly and I&#x27;ve used tons and tons of products...&amp;#34;permanent straighteners&amp;#34;...and spent a small fortune trying to smooth my hair. This by far does the best job ever. My hair looks and feels fabulous. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy the HSI! It&#x27;s better than my CHI :-)</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 14 year old grand-daughter.  She loved it and said she can do her hair in half the time it used to take her.</li>
    <li> Works great came scratched on the heating unit itself... pulled hair quite a bit but after so many uses the scratch smoothed out a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;Would have gotten 5 stars otherwise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using straighteners for many years. It all started with the awesome Helen of Troy straightener. After this, I bought a Paul Mitchell straightener for $150. LOVED the straightener, but after 3 years my kitties knocked it off the bathroom counter and into the toilet. So alas, I was on the hunt again, but did not want to spend another $150. I&#x27;m do glad I ordered this. It really works very similar to my Paul Mitchell. It&#x27;s a little thicker, but definitely leaves hair silky and shiny. Has different temp levels. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the amount of time it takes to heat up. I went from my 30 second heat up time with the Paul Mitchell to somewhere around 5 or 10 minutes. I guess that&#x27;s the only con though.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this from a drugstore brand. In love!! Works so well, even on extensions. I have super curly hair and it straightens with ease. The bonus oil makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love it amazing my hair is so hard to work with so this product did it&#x27;s. Job people who complain are those who are never happy w anything</li>
    <li> We purchased this IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER and it just does what it is supposed to do so perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy a straightener. The seller shipped it pretty fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;So, that is definitely a big plus.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for over 3 years, it still currently work it is one of the best. Great price and product</li>
    <li> this is my first real flat iron. the reason for that is i always had relaxed hair and never felt the need for a flat iron. i&#x27;ve had long hair, really short hair and weave. the only time a flat iron has been used was when i went to a salon and my weave needed to be bone straight. lol. but for the past year i have gone natural and wanted a different look. i&#x27;ve left my hair naturally straight but i wanted something different which is really hard with my hair bc the first sign of humidity my hair kinks up. so i went on a wimb and purchased this flat iron. so far so good. it really makes my hair pin straight and i love that it comes with a sample bottle of argan oil. its really convenient bc of the swivel cord and it heats up pretty quick. so far im enjoying it.</li>
    <li> great price, good hair straightener.  I was concerned that this wouldnt be as good as the Chi that i have used for the past several years, but I am very satisfied with this straightener.  It is slow to heat up, but is good after that.  Quick shipping.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The flatiron works very well and heats uo quickly. The only criticism I have is that the temperatures are not marked on the rheostat dial or body of the flatiron.. That would be helpful. Also, the included glove is helpful because two handed operation is required because of the spring closure. The gloves saves one from burning fingers.</li>
    <li> I received my new HSI straightener about a week ago. I thought it was finally time to upgrade from my cheapo walmart brand. I have not yet been disappointed. I read some of the reviews before purchasing and one mentioned it was heavy. I don&#x27;t think it ways more than the average straightener. Then again, I am not one to spend hours in front of the mirror in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed that I absolutley love is I don&#x27;t need to touch it up as much. Usually my naturally wavy hair will bounce back overnight and I have to start all over. With the HSI, I spend less than 3 minutes touching it up.&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint was it didn&#x27;t have an auto shut off... My previous one didn&#x27;t either, so I figured no loss. The one before that didn&#x27;t have an auto shut off but would automatically shut off because it was disfunctional. I personally find the auto shut off can be annoying. I do love how the light turns from red to green when it is hot, which it does rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it is a good product and would reccommend it to anyone. ESPECIALLY for the price!</li>
    <li> I have straight hair, so I&#x27;ve never felt like I needed a straightener. Then I cut my hair really short and when it grew back, it would dry all funky, so I thought it might be a good time to buy one. As a college student on a tight budget, I wanted one that wasn&#x27;t exorbitantly expensive and after scouring amazon, I settled on this one because of the low price and high reviews. Well, it has exceeded my expectations. It heats up in less than 30 seconds, and using it in conjunction with the hair oil makes my hair sleek and shiny. Now I am no longer embarrassed to leave the house and since it was so inexpensive, I have money to spend!</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase a new higher quality straightener; I usually just buy the Conair ones at Costco. A lot of users reported it worked on their coarse, difficult to straighten hair, but I found this was not the case for me. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a faulty one or what, but mine did not heat up very much, and I had to work extra hard to get my hair a frizzy straight. Needless to say, I went back to my trusty Conair, but I feel like this straightener would be wonderful for normal to fine hair. Not for thick, curly, frizzy, difficult to straighten hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is my first straightener, and I purchased it based on the positive reviews.  It heats up very quickly and straightens quite well.  The cord rotates at the base, which makes it easy to maneuver and prevents the cord from becoming twisted.  The green light lets you know when it is ready to use.  It takes less than a minute to heat up.  It also comes with a beautiful storage bag and a free sample of hair oil.  Another small but important detail for me is that it has a small &amp;#34;loop&amp;#34; on the cord that allows you to hang it from a hook if you wish. I highly recommend this product and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she thinks it&#x27;s great for styling her hair quickly.  I wanted a good quality item that would last her through her teenage years and not spend a fortune too :)  This seems to have fit the bill.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this flat iron, my previous Chi broke down after 3 months. This flat iron has temp. adjustment which will be less damaging to my fine hair. Good communication and very fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is, in my opinion, loads better than the chi. You can adjust the temperature, which is something you cannot do with a chi. This leaves my hair shiny, smooth, and straight. Other straighteners I&#x27;ve used have left my hair dull, semi-straight, and fried-looking. This straightener is also fantastic for curling the hair. I prefer it to curl my hair over my Conair curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I have to say is that they don&#x27;t include the holder/stand that I&#x27;ve found to be necessary if you don&#x27;t want your room to smell like it&#x27;s burning. Has anything burned yet? No. But it smells horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and recommend it for any current Chi user or if this is your first hair straightener!</li>
    <li> good product warms up quickly and does the job ..A little heavy maybe ..it works for me ..It is my first one it deos not do any dammage ot the hair</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my wife and it did not disappoint! It did a fantastic job on her hair without any hassle or hang-ups. I would recommend this product to anyone! Plus, the turn around time from order to delivery was amazing! And the price ... I seriously thought I got it for a steal the product is that good!</li>
    <li> I really like the straightener so far. The fast heat up and high heat make straightening a much faster process. It&#x27;s not as excellent as it seemed to be regarded by other reviews. If it lasts a few years for me though I will count it as a good purchase &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is the second on rive purchased. The first was for my daughter three years ago. It&#x27;s still working as if it were new. She uses it every week. I kept borrowing here and finally decided to get myself one. You can set temperature and avoid burning your hair. Works quickly.</li>
    <li> For the price I can&#x27;t complain! Love all the accessories it came with as well! Would recommend for someone not wanting to spend an arm and a leg on a flat iron!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Out performs similiar products by far. I highly recommend this product, the features are great with heat control settings and lasting effects.I am thrilled with this purchase as I have had similiar products that I paid alot more for and they were not as good as the HSI. This will be my flat iron choice from now on. You will not be disappointed with purchasing an HSI ceremic flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, long, curly hair and it was no problem for this iron.  Powered right through the madness and I was left straight, sleek and NO FRIZZZZ!  YAY!  Buy it.</li>
    <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be purchasing an overpriced flat iron based on some name brand and I wanted a good one with adjustable temp. I couldn&#x27;t be happier plus compared to pricing at other stores I got a great deal buying from this seller on Amazon. Love the flat iron and seller. No complaints</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this straightner. Just minor irritating things...there us no light indicating it is on, or ready for use. The heat dial seems flimsy or loose. It seemed to take forever to cool down</li>
    <li> I am a black american with natural hair. I wanted to have an option to straighten my hair without adding chemicals. This is an absolutely awesome product! It straightened my hair so well that it looked like i used a hot comb or have a relaxer. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a straightener, especially if you had natural hair. The issue of the temperature dial and power switch on the inside of the tool is a non-issue for me.</li>
    <li> The item was better than I expected it&#x27;s in brand new condition and works so great I just love it</li>
    <li> My hair is so thick that every  hair dresser I go to is surprised despite my warnings. I bought a straightener at a store and it does a decent job but is not hot enough so I end up taking a little longer trying to straighten it. The HSI has a temperature setting on it that allows me to set it to 410*. Now straightening my hair is even easier and faster.When you have as much hair as I do, fast is good.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have been using it for over a month and it&#x27;s perfect for styling my hair, straightening it or curling it. I am so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Why buy an expensive flat iron?!? This one is great, and the price can&#x27;t be beat. You will not regret buying this. I love it!</li>
    <li> everything works great I am very happy with the product. It is great with the goves as they are preventing sun cancer and spots on your hands I would not go gels with out them.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a rock star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum feels delicious, the thing heats in seconds, it swivels without sticking, straightens without pulling, and is obviously a solid hunk of well-made merchandise. I&#x27;m more than pleased with this little beast - it does exactly what my budget hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gift this thing like crazy, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The item arrived within 48 hours which was fantastic.  I enjoy the fact that I can choose the heat setting.  It works great in straightening my hair and within one or two swipes.  Great item for a great price.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t invest $160 into a different product when it wasn&#x27;t necessary.  I wish though their was detailed information from the manufacturer as to the specific features and how to use it/clean it etc.  I would rate this 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this flat iron and I love it. It does everything that is says and more. I did have a couple of things that I wasn&#x27;t very happy about but the company this product comes from actually emailed me within 2 weeks of having this product and asked how everything was. I explained the issues that I was faced with and I got an email back within a day asking if I would like a replacement. I usually don&#x27;t like doing replacements because they are such a hassle. Within 2 days I had my new flat iron (maybe even an upgraded one because its a tiny bit different than my other) and I am happier than ever. I loved the customer service that this company provided.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron a couple of months now. It seems to work just as well as my previous Chi iron, for a very good price. Overall, I think this was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Item was just as advertised and works great.. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price for what I got. I  was very pleased!</li>
    <li> The Styler flat iron worked well.  I like that you can adjust the temps and it heated up fast. A light or something to notify you when it reached the temp would be helpful but is not necessary.  It curled the ends of the hair under well.  I am not sure why it came with a glove but I love the packaging and storage pouch.</li>
    <li> Cheap and it works great! Shipped fast and I love the oil that came with it. Highly recommend it for difficult hair.</li>
    <li> I have been debating whether or not I should buy this flat iron for a few months, and I finally did. It came in two days and I am very impressed! It heats up very quickly, and works extremely well! It did not come with the argan oil sample everyone talks about, but I used John Frieda Full Repair and my hair looked amazing. :)</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Its my new best friend! I have terribly uncontrollable frizzy hair and I am lazy so ive always worn it long and curly via lots of product. But with this I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry. I especially love the glove genius idea!</li>
    <li> I mostly ordered this styler due to the price drop and the reviews.  This is a solid flat iron that does a good job on my hair.  I have coarse, wavy hair that frizzes like crazy in the summer.  This iron took care of that and my hair stayed smooth and straight all day.  The controls are on the inside of the iron handle (just below the two plates) which are both a plus and a minus.  The plus is that you can&#x27;t accidentally shut off the iron in the middle of styling your hair, as I have done with another straightener that I have.  The minus is that there is potential to burn yourself in order to reach the on/off switch and temperature control.  This iron can get REALLY HOT, people!  The only other minus is that there is no indicator light to show that it is on, so you could pick it up and possibly burn yourself. The product comes with a glove and a carrying pouch, as well as a small vial of styling oil.  I didn&#x27;t really use the oil, I didn&#x27;t feel I needed it.  The styler did the job well enough without me having to use any extra product on my hair.  As for the glove, it&#x27;s not completely heat proof.  I did end up using it because after straightening a section of hair, it was very hot to the touch with just my bare hand, so the glove helped.  In spite of the minuses, (every styler of this kind has burn potential) I like this straightener a lot for the price (I paid $39.99 for it).</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results after using this flat iron. The flat iron not only give the professional salon look* it is easy to use. I am super satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron for about 4 years off and on but didn&#x27;t quite get what the big deal was. My hair never looked the same as when my hair dresser would flat iron it for me. Then I bought this one and it&#x27;s amazing. This one works so much better I can&#x27;t believe it. I don&#x27;t even have to hold it long at all - so less damage.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Just received this product 3 days ago, used it yesterday, and I&#x27;m a believer.. It straightened my hair silky straight!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, AMAZING, second, AMAZING, third, it seemed like it was about to die. I really like, no LOVE this product, but it seemed like it&#x27;s dieing.. Can I get a new one?</li>
    <li> I recently cut all my hair off into a short pixie cut. I needed to invest in a new flat iron that was a little smaller but still wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair. I have used this iron a few times now and I love it! It heats up incredibly quickly, straightens well, and does not damage my hair. I have also been using the oil that came with the product. It is a very small sample bottle but you don&#x27;t need much. Because my hair is so short now, the sample will last me at least a month. I will most likely buy more once my sample runs out. So happy I bought this iron!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a very good flat iron for a very long time and I came across the HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener.  It was marked down with free shipping.  I received the flat iron in about one week.  The packaged was packaged neat without any damage.  I am very impressed with the flat iron and would highly recommend to anyone looking.  It straightens the hair pretty fast and stays all day without frizz.</li>
    <li> I broke my CHI flat iron and ordered the HSI as there was good review.  However, i prefer my old CHI.  There are some hairs that get stuck between the plate and the iron plastic frame and  it hurt and then brake the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good quality as i expected.</li>
    <li> I admit, it is a step above the conair I bought last year as a back up but it is not even close to being a Chi or Paul Brown like some claim. It just doesn&#x27;t get as hot. Does the job, it just takes longer. This is coming from someone with natuarally curly hair so for someone with pretty straight hair, it will probably be just fine.</li>
    <li> This straightener is everything I hoped it would be.  I&#x27;ve used other nice straighteners in the past (CHI and others), and this one is VERY comparable but at a much cheaper price.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I absolutely love this new flat iron.  It doesn&#x27;t pull our hair it straightens in no time and my daughter loves giving her hair a curl with the slender iron.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron! Easily straightens out my thick curly hair. It doesnt pull on my hair as other straightners have in the past. Heats up rather quickly over all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for the price. I love how it stays hot while I do my thick, coarse hair. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it recommends buying the stand to keep the iron working in top condition. Otherwise I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair straightner! Love it!! Does every thing it is supposed to do and more, best thing out there! Highly recommend to anyone else looking for the same thing</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed the flat iron. it is very easy to use and i have had terriffic results. Many of my co workers have commented on how straight all my hair is with this product.</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a hair straighter, I was considering CHI as well. But when I gave a shot for this HSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straighter works great. It just a few sec your hair will be straight. If you are using everyday, the shorter you will use this to straight.  They packaged great. I would recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron as a replacement due to the great reviews.  I bought my current flat iron at Walmart about 4 yrs. ago for $14.00. This HSI flat iron is not any better than the one from Walmart! I have long, fine hair..It did nothing special for my hair!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item one time so far, but it works great!  I have been blessed with hair that is long, thick, coarse, wavy (the Hawaiian in me) &amp; frizzy.  I tried the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look for a long time, but decided it&#x27;s ok to go straight, especially if it makes me feel better about myself. The price also was what sold me on it. It came packaged nicely, with the added gift of Argan Oil &amp; a pretty carry bag.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like the temperature control. I previously had a Chi straightener, which I used for several years. While the feel is different and the Chi was a great device, the HSI is a terrific find for the price.</li>
    <li> This styler is the best I have tried. I own at least 3 and will only use this one now. It simply does exactly what you want of a styler. My hair is silky and smooth after using it. Perfect and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have extremely frizzy and very thick hair, so having a great straightener is a must. I used this product the second I got it, and I must say that I was quite impressed by the transformation from frizzy to straight, silky, soft hair. The quality of this product is very high, and it was a plus to receive a sample of their Argan Oil which even made my hair even more tame! If you&#x27;re looking for a quality straightener get this one, it gives Chi or the ones in the mall a run for their money. Totally worth the amount I spent, and I would totally recommend it for others.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.  I have tried several straighteners and this one does a great job.  I have naturally curly thick hair so I had to set it on the highest level.  It still looked straight and great at the end of the day.  So glad I bought this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this and recieved it THREE days earlier than estimated! Seriously, the best straightner for $40! Heats up fast, has smooth plates, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and is made very sturdy. Love the product, love amazon!</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats very quickly and flat irons your hair very well. I like this product and I would reconmend it to someone who ask about it I glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> This straightner does the job! It&#x27;s not as expensive as the chi &amp; it can actually straighten my curly thick hair. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome flat iron, seriously. I was in the market for a new one when i read reviews on the top 3 , and was able to make my decision quickly based on the price and quality. This iron is salon quality, I am very pleased with the round ends on each side when curling or just flipping out the hair at the ends. I am truly a satisfied customer and the shipping time was pretty quick.</li>
    <li> This is a top quality flat iron, full size but not unwieldy. Heats up quickly. Love the different heat settings. I can style my hair very quickly with this iron as it effectively flattens or curls my hair in a minimum of time. I have lots of fine somewhat flat hair and this helps me add some fullness and get rid of the waves I do not want while shaping my style just the way I do want.</li>
    <li> First off the HSI Flat Iron does work really well especially for the price. I could get my hair straightened in 10mins compared to my old flat iron that would take about 30mins. The HSI heats up almost immediately and really does curl your hair well. The Hair oil treatment is amazing but it is a very small sample that gets used in a couple days. Also the HSI gets so hot that sometimes when using it on my hair the handle area would get pretty hot as well and I didn&#x27;t like that but it is still do able. I have owned mine for about 7months now and I am having to replace it because it was dropped several times from my mother in law, so one of the ceramic plates started to come up and would snag my hair when I would use it. With that said be careful about dropping it because when the ceramic plate does come up it hurts too bad to use the HSI all together. I reordered another one and expecting it today!</li>
    <li> Got the HSI Styler Ceramic Hair Straightener for my daughter.  She loves it. She have very thick hair, and it took her less than half the time to straighten her hair, she only had to do it once to get the results she wanted.  She has been using it almost daily, and hasn&#x27;t seen any hair breakage.  I will be ordering another one for my other daughter.</li>
    <li> This straightener works so well and is really cheap!  I bought and returned a much more expensive model because this one is amazing.  Would definitely recommend.  Comes with a nice case for travelling as well.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  It is hot enough to straighten my thick, coarse, wavy hair.  Also, the sample of Argan oil, wow.  I am totally going to buy some of that when my sample runs out!  Makes my hair shiny, silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this flat iron! I had used Friction Free and T 3 flat iron before. Now I only need to use less 10 minutes to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After I used this flat iron, my hair became straight and silky. This HSI flat iron is the cheapest flat iron I ever paid,but works&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!! I also  like it  because it is 110V - 220V so I can bring it to my country to use!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straight iron replacing the Chi that I currently had.  I read a lot of the reviews on here and it allowed me to give it a try.  It was a plus to see it being compared to the Chi at half the price.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far and was disappointed with the results.  I don&#x27;t straighten my hair as much as I add wave to it.  This product didn&#x27;t seem to do so well with the \\&quot;wave effect\\&quot; like my Chi does.  I might try it for a simply straight look and see if it works better for me...</li>
    <li> First time buyer of a flat iron and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Adjustable temperature control ensures you get the amount of heat right for your hair.  Easy to operate and comes with a sample of HSI Argan oil that is excellent!  Highly recommend if you are in the market for a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I expected the product to be more professional but it was ok for the prize. My chi straightener is still my preferred one.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  I was skeptical about ordering this item, and meant to save it to my wish list.  I accidently clicked purchase by 1-click through Amazon.  I am so happy that I did so.  For the price, this beats my Chi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K</li>
    <li> I have never used a flat iron before and this was easy to use and really made my hair look great.  I really loved the Argan oil that came with it - made my hair really soft and shiny.  Easy to use instructions and great to have the glove so that you don&#x27;t burn yourself.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron works wonderful. The adjustable temp is great for different hair types in the house. The iron warms up quickly and does a wonderful job of straightening. I have VERY curly hair and this iron make short work of pulling those out. Great iron!!</li>
    <li> works well. gets you hair really hot so it hard to hold when styling but gets your hair straight. I hav naturally curly fizzy hair and it takes the high temp.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 7 years old CHI. Wanted to try something different. After reading all the wonderful reviews about the product, I purchased it and couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I love that it has different settings for different types of hair.</li>
    <li> My beloved Chi straightner died last week.  I quickly got on Amazon and researched hair straightners. There were a ton of options, but I chose the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch because of the awesome reviews and excellent price! I ordered it and received it two days later. It came with a thermal heat glove and cover which I condisered it a bonus because I paid much more for the Chi 3 years ago and it didn&#x27;t come with anything. It gets hot, but it&#x27;s not too hot that it damages my hair. It&#x27;s a great balance.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It straightens my, thick, relaxed hair in \\&quot;one pass\\&quot;...on medium temp.  I don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;stall\\&quot; the iron on my hair. Just one quick pass and my hair is straight. This baby gets hot.  If I used on the high setting, my hair would be scorched, but for super thick or extremely curly natural textured hair this flat iron will get hair straight quickly and efficiently on the higher settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature control knob/on-off button are located inside of this flat iron.  The temperature control knob doesn&#x27;t have numeric temperature markings, except at the highest and lowest settings, but it is easy to gauge the temperature ranges best suited for your hair type.  For first time users, I would recommend starting at the low temp and gradually increasing to temperature best suited for your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up in a few seconds. HSI included a thermal glove. They&#x27;ve also included a nice satin storage bag and a sample bottle of heat protectant oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this flat iron helps stretch my relaxer. It straightens my new growth very effectively. Now, I only need to touch up every 5 or 6 months. I do the whole nine yards in my hair care.... regular trims, co-wash, deep conditioners, protein treatments, hot oil treatments, heat protectants, etc.  My hair can take this heat and stay healthy, but too frequent relaxing will damage my hair. This product is a godsend for me.  HSI is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, for anyone leery of intensive protein treatment products, but still in need of a good protein treatment, you may try using raw eggs. Beat an egg, apply to shampooed  and towel dried hair. Let set for 15 minutes...no heat required,(but a plastic cap can be used). Then rinse thoroughly. Follow with a good moisturizing conditioner.  It&#x27;s a little messy, but its a safe inexpensive fix...much cheaper that products like Kerafuse. The egg treament is very effective for breaking and brittle hair. The egg protein will firm up the hair texture, so following with a moisturizing conditoner is still necessary.  If hair is breaking, one treatment a week is a good protocol. I&#x27;ve had fabulous results using the raw eggs, when I experienced excessive shedding after using a relaxer. The breakage stopped.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter who insisted that she needed a croc hair straightener. After researching online, I discovered this item had the most positive reviews. After trying it out, my daughter agreed. She is thrilled with how quickly it gets the job done. To be as clear as I can, she has long thin hair that is only slightly wavy, but not naturally stick straight.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because she says she has to have the stand because there is no safe way to put the hot iron down on its own. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener when I broke my CHI. I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 again, so I looked for a cheaper option. After readying all of the good reviews, I settled on HSI even though I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand. I paid only $40 (w/ free shipping), but this straightener works just as well as a CHI. It is well made, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, and it gets the job done. I always thought the CHI products were overpriced, now I know for sure. I would definitely buy HSI again!</li>
    <li> I have only used the HSI flat iron a few times, but so far, I really like it.  I am a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off though I found out that the HSI flatiron that is coming out next will have that feature.  Also, if you purchase this model, please note that the red light which indicates it is on is on the bottom of the handle and not on the inside where the on/off switch is.  When I turned it on for the first time, I didn&#x27;t know if it was on or off because there was no red light on, so I touched the inside to check it and got burned (nothing serious, just a quick burn).  Just wanted that to be a FYI.</li>
    <li> My wife was took about 2 weeks researching flat irons.  She had mixed reviews about the Chi and Babyliss etc.  I found the HSI and decided why not try it out.  She loves it!  It heats up so fast and gets the job done, especially at the price I bought it.  She is glad I didn&#x27;t go and spend over $100 for a flat iron because this works just as good.</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron straightener is perfect for smoothing the frizz out of my thick, curly hair. My hair is dry and fragile and the lowest setting is just what I needed and the reason I picked this product.  I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron for an excellent price.  Bought it to replace my $300 flat iron and it does just as good a job if not better.  The sample of argan oil that comes with it is great as well.  My hair is really damaged from repeated bleaching and the oil makes my hair so smooth.  I love it and will definitely buy it when it runs out.  I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the product because I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand, but after reading great reviews I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  You will too!</li>
    <li> This straighten worked better for my hair than a CHI. It makes my hair look smooth and soft unlike other straighteners that sometimes made it look almost greasy. I would definitely recommend this to future buyers. Don&#x27;t waste money on over-priced straightens that may not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]</li>
    <li> This is my very first flat iron that i have owned. I have very curly hair and used this product in the morning before work without troubles. The heat is adjustable and the iron was very easy to use even without the glove provided. It heats up in a short amount of time and cools down relatively fast.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every cent! It makes you want to become a hairdresser, because you finally have the right tool, to straighten hairl!</li>
    <li> Best deal I have ever gotten. I love this straightener! And for such a great deal.  Also got free product with my order ! Quick delivery as well,  very impressed.</li>
    <li> Pros- It does get hot, fast. Cons- I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and the ceramic plate is cracked. I was happier with a cheaper Infinity brand straightener that I had for five years. I think I will try a Chi this time.</li>
    <li> My Chi straightner recently passed away and I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend the big $$ to replace it.  I was willing to give the HSI a try after reading the other reviews.  I agree that it works as well as my recently departed Chi.  The one drawback is that it does not heat up as quickly as the Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curiously, it came with a black glove and I dont know why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]Kay - so if you&#x27;re into nails, who doesn&#x27;t want a salon product that dries your nails like when you&#x27;re at the salon?&lt;br /&gt;This one hits the mark.  Love the fact that you have an assortment of timers to choose from and that you can use it with or without the fan.  I actually prefer without the fan.  No tackiness here.  My nails are nice and dry and even ready to do a dish if you have to!  No kidding.  In a jam, I forgot and did the dishes right after and my nails were perfectly fine afterwards! Course - I don&#x27;t recommend doing that!  Just letting you know it dries them that well that it&#x27;s possible.  Love this product and love the fact that both hands fit in at the same time.  Highly recommend and seller is fast with contact and turnaround.  I had the product in no time flat.  If you&#x27;re looking for the right nail dryer - look no further.  This is the one you want!</li>
    <li> This was an amazing price for this product!!! It works great and heats up instantly.  Hopefully it will last longer than my last two Chi flatirons.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener to replace my old one that was falling apart.  It works great so far.  I like it that you can adjust the temperature.</li>
    <li> I really like the light weight and narrow grip since i have tiny hands.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have pieces that my hair gets caught on like the junk one I owned before this.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - i LOVE IT!  :)</li>
    <li> Needed a flat iron read the reviews and the HSI iron was ordered. It was inexpensive so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, I was incorrect it is. The Argan oil that comes with it great bonus.</li>
    <li> I purchase the HSI Cermaic flat iron after researching flat iron for african american&#x27;s with naturally thick hair. This product is the best thing since slice bread. I would recommend this to anyone with thick hair. Long as you part your hair in small section you will have fabulos results. I love the flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love the extra long cord that is on the flat iron.  I do not feel like I am connected to the electrical outlet in my bathroom.  The iron is not heavy, I had rotator cuff surgery and have trouble holding a hair dryer, but this does not hurt me at all.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi flat iron for years and I have missed it dearly since it stopped working. I just couldn&#x27;t see myself shelling out $140+ for another one so I have been trying cheaper store bought versions that have not worked very well for me. This flat iron is very comparable to the Chi and I love it! I have naturally curly/frizzy hair and it needs a great flat iron (and serum) to help tame it. This iron heats up very fast and I&#x27;ve been using the serum that came with it and I have to say that my hair looks amazing! Thank you HSI for making such a great flat iron, and an affordable one at that :) Also, Amazon shipped it to me so quickly it was a very nice surprise to come home to after a long day at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole G.</li>
    <li> I just got this last week (extremely quick delivery I might add!) and have had the chance to use it several times now. I have frizzy multi textured curly hair and this straightens me out in a 1/4 of the time as my old one - also texture is just like when they do at salon - which I can never usually achieve with old one! I have only turned it up a little over half way so far too!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is better than my previous flat irons which cost at least double what I&#x27;ve paid for it on Amazon. It straightens my wavy hair quicker than my previous flat irons and leaves it smooth and silky. I only go through an area once or twice at the most and I use it with the HSI Thermal Protector and they work very well together. I cannot believe the brand isn&#x27;t more popular! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> I have never had much luck in using flat irons as I&#x27;ve usually wound up frizzing up my hair and causing endless damage to my ends. As I&#x27;ve just gotten a new bob haircut, I decided to give it another shot and checked out the top rated flat irons on Amazon.  I found the HSI and boy, am I glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this flat iron has temperature control, which is fantastic if you have curly hair like me. On days I&#x27;m going from curly to straight, I can set it near the top (410F) and on touch up mornings, at a lower temperature (300F and below)for maintenance. It heats up quickly and has a long cord.  For those women who travel, this is also one of the only flat irons I&#x27;ve found with these features and dual voltage. You&#x27;ll still need an adapter, but you&#x27;ll be able to take it abroad nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve used my HSI twice with excellent results. It straightens my hair quickly and the style maintains easily. I&#x27;m definitely glad I decided to buy it.</li>
    <li> Works great whether you need a quick style over damp hair, or a shiny, sleek straightening. Happy with the product and VERY happy with the heat settings!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like my other.  Also the on/off switch is in its proper place and not where it is easily turned off during use! I kept turning off my other flat iron because the button was right where your fingers go.  This one works great! I don&#x27;t even need the highest setting to get my hair looking great.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It leaves my hair really straight and it takes very little time to do it. My hair stays shiny! I recommend reading the instructions and adjusting the temperature according to your hair type, of course like with any hair product that puts heat on your hair you need to be careful. Haven&#x27;t tried to use it to curl my hair yet but overall I love this straightener.</li>
    <li> I\ve hesitated a lot before purchasing this iron. The thing is that I am from Europe and have been living here in CA for only 2 months. I am going to Europe net month. So I needed item that would work both in the USA and Europe. I found this item and doubted if it would work in Europe with 220V. So I decided to try.&lt;br /&gt;Great!!!! I got Worldwide edition (thoght i spent only 39USD:))))&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Does not straighten even at the highest temp for wavy hair.Bought it since people were saying its a great iron. Get a chi, even if its more money.</li>
    <li> Item doesn&#x27;t get too hot like other straighteners, although it took me a while to find the on/off button.... I do love it!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on several flat irons (feeling that I needed a new one because I&#x27;d had mine about 10 years), I bought this one.  For the price, it&#x27;s a good product.  I feel that my previous flat iron, a Corioliss, got hotter... but all and all I&#x27;m happy and would recommend.  I normally write longer reviews, but with a flat iron, I feel there are only 3 responses:  1)  It&#x27;s too hot or defective, and burned my hair.  I&#x27;m so mad that I want to freak out.  2)  It&#x27;s amazing and makes me look like a celebrity with next to no effort (I think you&#x27;d pay a lot more than $40 for that response).  or 3) It&#x27;s a good product, but nothing amazing.  The final response is mine.  :)  I hope it was helpful.  :)</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item. First straightener I have purchased and have no issues with it.  Plates heat up very quickly, easy to hold, love it</li>
    <li> Recently, my GHD flat iron died and I had to begin looking for a replacement.  As much as I liked my old flat iron, it was expensive and it did not last as long as I thought it should have.  I did not want a Chi because the last one I purchased began to break after two weeks.  So I began the process of trying to find a flat iron that provided quality without breaking my budget.  I found the HSI flat iron online and I was impressed with the price and with the amount of positive reviews.  I decided to purchase the flat iron and so far it has been a great decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the flat iron I was impressed with the quality of the iron and how sturdy it felt.  The temperature is easy to set and I like the cord because it does not seem to tangle.  I use the medium setting for my hair and the provided oil and my hair has been sleek and shiny every time I use it.  It works so efficiently that I actuallly get ready much sooner in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly straight, just a little wavy, so the medium setting is sufficient for my hair.  As hot as this flat iron gets, I am sure it would work well even on the curliest of hair. I like this flat iron enough that I recommended it to my sister.  This flat iron works as well as any that I have used in the past and the pricing is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and its very poofy when i don&#x27;t put product in it. this straightner makes it so much easier to tone it down. Love it so glad i bought it. Worth the price :)</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. With this hair flat iron i can have straight hair in less than 30 minutes. It doesnt  burn your hair. It leave your hair really soft and healthy. I use  the argan oil treatment when i use the flat iron. They are fantastic together.</li>
    <li> I have never had a one inch flat iron but I wanted one that i could curl my hair with. I have used it quite a few times and I love it so far!! I bought it because it was such a good deal! I am very satisfied. :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic value on flat iron and better than its competitors.  My daughter has thick hair and she is able to use this with great results.  Seller was great, fast, and included an extra little bottle of oil.  So pleased and will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 19 year old with very curly hair. She loves it, says it does a great job!</li>
    <li> I actually did not order this product.  My boyfriend ordered it for me after noticing that my hair straightener was falling apart. I was not familiar with the brand, but so far no complaints. It is definitely good quality. It heats up quickly, gets extremely hot and the glove included in the box comes in handy. Considering the price, it seems to be a steal of a deal.  The same results if not better than any Chi straightener I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is much better than the ones you get in the local drug or discount store but not much more expensive. High end quality for a budget price. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love Love this flat iron! Such an awsome deal for the price. We bought a total of 3 so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to share mine with my daughters!!</li>
    <li> What a great iron! Leaves my hair silky and smooth. Heats up very quickly and love the temperature dial. Yes you would pay much more for this so it is a great deal! Would definitely recommend. Oh, the seller is fabulous as well.</li>
    <li> After purchasing many cheap flat irons and many split ends and damaged hair, I finally broke down and said I would purchase a Chi or another expensive name brank(oh boy am I glad I didn&#x27;t). I did my research on **top flat irons** and after so many high customer rated reviews, I just had to purchase this flat iron and the price was so unbelievable. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner. I am so excited every-time I straighten my hair. It just glides thru my hair and not a single damaged end.I have shoulder length wavy hair and I am able to straighten it or curl. I cant wait for my hair to be long so I can create many more styles with this flat iron. The Argon oil it comes with makes it so smooth and doesnt weigh it down. I am extremely satisfied with this product and recommend it to every person that straightens their hair. Great product and I hope it last me for many more hair styles to come. [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]</li>
    <li> Wonderful items. Heats quickly to straighten and curl hair. best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I purchased this, and I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t written a review. LOVE this straightener. Can&#x27;t believe the PRICE on it, too. The only thing I wished it had was an auto-shut off, but I bought a Belkin 30-minute outlet timer and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my curly-haired daughter who lives to straighten her hair. Terrific iron and safer than others that don&#x27;t have a safety.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of its dual voltage, and it worked great on a recent trip to Peru. Didn&#x27;t need to mess around with a converter, just needed an adapter plug.</li>
    <li> Just as many reviews this item had got, I can also say that this flat iron is great! It is professional grade at bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have much to say other than that it is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Ability to select the heat settings is a real plus and the coated plates makes my hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> its not a chi but its okay, it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi flat iron before getting this one. I have curly hair and I would flat iron my hair the night before and it would be curly again by morning. I spent close to an hour trying to get my hair straight. Now with this flat iron, my hair is done in 10 mins - and stays straight for at least a week. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Iron works great on my hair and my biracial daughters hair and we love the argan oil!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase of the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Straightener. My hair feels incredibly silky after I straighten my hair. I recently cut 12&amp;#34; of hair off, and am still able to do loose waves in my hair with this straightener as well! More than happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron specifically take to Europe as it has dual voltage.  It worked fine with a plug adapter.  A lot of the reviews said that it was better than the CHI.  I wouldn&#x27;t go that far, but I only used it for about 10 days.  It was definitely more reasonably priced than my CHI.  It has a nice sleeve for traveling, so it will definitely be my &amp;#34;traveling&amp;#34; flat iron.  I was using an oven mitt for my CHI when I traveled.</li>
    <li> I got &amp;#34;attacked&amp;#34; by one of those styling booths at the mall and was surprised by how long those curls lasted...&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try out a flat iron to curl my stick straight hair, so I borrowed a friends before committing.  I had read all the reviews before on this particular flat iron and after trying my friends purchase the HSI. The plats are slicker than the regular ceramic, but outside if that it works great and heats up in 5  seconds. My only worry is : how long will this work?  My hope is never to replace it..we shall see.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype about this. I like my $25 one better from Walmart. Might have gotten a fake one or something. Did NOTHING for my hair. Best of luck.</li>
    <li> It does the job. Not ecstatic over it. Feel a little drag.</li>
    <li> Works very well and I&#x27;ve had this for years!</li>
    <li> This flat iron does an excellent job as far as my wife is concerned. She is perfectly satisfied with it and her hair is even more beautiful than usual after she uses it.</li>
    <li> Felt cheap and pulls hair at the end of the iron. Not sure how this got such high ratings outside of the email they sent attempting to get me to leave a 5 star review with the promise of another sample of the hair oil. But I guess for $39.95 you get what you pay for when it comes to hair styling tools.</li>
    <li> my old one works better,</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife since she didn&#x27;t have a good one and she seems to love it.  She is constantly using it and I haven&#x27;t heard her complain one time. Also the company seems very good and sent me av email asking how I liked the product and if there was anything they could do for me. This is awesome and that alone to me would have given them 5 stars. Great product and great company.  I would recommend buying this and from this seller, Blue Novelties.</li>
    <li> Product works great - comparable to a Chi. I like the temperature setting as well the light that turns on whenever it&#x27;s in use (however no automatic shut-off, just wanted to mention it in case that is a necessity for someone). Loved the accessories it came with and it shipped very quickly!</li>
    <li> Arrived on item. Works great. I like that I can regulate the temperature on this Straightener unlike my previous one.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is very easy to use to straighten hair, and to make curls with, too! Thank you!</li>
    <li> 2nd purchase, myself and daughter.  Excellent iron, plus great value.  Very nice travel bag.  Professional quality, long swivel cord.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it. It works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use chi digital flat iron before this&lt;br /&gt;There is much big difference</li>
    <li> For the most part it is a good flat iron it stays hot the whole time unlike my other flat iron where I had to in plug and give it a chance to re heat. I have very thick and course hair and it leaves my hair feeling silky smooth. I love the argon oil wish it came with a little more than it did because it is expensive to get more but the flat iron did come with coupons to get more. It left my hair bouncy and full not too flat. Only have to go over hair twick but usually I have to go over multiple times with any other flat iron.</li>
    <li> love the flat iron.  only brand I will use.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product...I am not a flatiron expert but this is a well made, substantial product</li>
    <li> Got this straightener for such a great price!! I will be giving it away as a Christmas gift. It was packaged great &amp; I hope my sis will love it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this flat iron to work for me, since reviews were so great. Unfortunately, it does not consistently stay hot and sometimes I have to play with the plug, cords, on/off switch to even get it to come on. When it is on and hot, it&#x27;s does a good job of straightening my very thick coarse hair. Maybe I got a dud or a previously used one that had issues. I will probably have to buy something different that I can rely on. Such a bummer :(</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair. I guess, depending on how humid the local surroundings are--makes it very hard. The flat iron is good. I guess, not good on my hair.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair short so had to get a smaller straightener. I love this one I bought! It heats up pretty quickly and is easy to curl hair with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was great. They emailed me about 2 weeks after my purchase to check to see I was 100% satisfied. Never had a company check on me before. I&#x27;ve had companies provide customer service after a complaint but never one that reached out first.</li>
    <li> Works SOOO much better than the cheap versions like you buy at Walgreens.  Well worth the extra few dollars to have it work better.  Does a great job of smoothing hair out better and faster.  Could not be more please with this if I tried!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even consider the plug - like small pronged plugs and no have to plug and unplug dryer to use the iron.  Think I&#x27;ll like it better as it gets a bit older - too slippery right now so doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job.  I do not use the product with it</li>
    <li> This is a great product! We have gone through so many straighteners that we were about to give up. When we saw the sale price of this one we couldn&#x27;t pass it up! It works great! I love the fact that it has a &amp;#34;shield&amp;#34; so you can pretty much place the straightener right up to your head without getting burned, creating perfect hair :)</li>
    <li> Seems to dry out hair just a little. Takes longer to get my hair straightened than my previous flat iron.  Its okay. Not what I&#x27;d expect from a &#x27; professional&#x27; style iron.</li>
    <li> This is the best iron I&#x27;ve used.  It has rounded sides, so no creases end up in your hair.  I also love HSI&#x27;s argan oil.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product!  I didn&#x27;t realize how inadequate my old flat iron was until I started using this one.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! My hair is healthier and shiner than ever!! Finishes my hair so much faster than any other straightener! Love it</li>
    <li> We now have two, one for me and one for my daughter....  We have not used other flat irons in the past, so we can&#x27;t compare, but both of us have been extremely pleased with how well this brand does the job.  Both of us use ours everyday, and neither of us have experienced damage to our hair, the iron heats up quickly, and is easy to use...  We are very pleased!</li>
    <li> The flat iron arrived at my house soon after my order, and it meets my exectations.</li>
    <li> For my wife, she said it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I scored such a great deal on this flat iron! I am excited!  It straightens and curls like a dream. Its like the Cadillac of the hair straighteners! Heats up super fast!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron it comes with a glove and baggy to store the iron but it&#x27;s not as hot as I was expecting but it does do a good job.</li>
    <li> Works really well and would def recommend it. Good price too. (I hate this word limit stuff geez I don&#x27;t have anything else to say)</li>
    <li> Love that I can do my hair quickly in the morning since it heaya up so quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a CHI fan, but after my last one broke within a year I figured it was time to try something new.  I purchased this straightener based on customer reviews and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The price is right and it works the same if not better than my previous straighteners.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; value!</li>
    <li> Its OK! not great but not horrible purchased. The flat iron works fine doesnt pull the hair ,I will spend more on my next one and get better results</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! The last straightener I purchased was worthless from the start, so I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement. When I saw the deal on this HSI, I couldn&#x27;t resist. I have thick, shoulder-length, wavy hair that can be a tad unruly, especially in humidity. While I haven&#x27;t tried it out in summer weather, I have tried it in rainy weather, and between the straightener and the argon oil that comes with it (little sample), it worked! My hair remained glossy and straight. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I usually trust amazon product reviews ...after reading so many I purchased this product ..awesome heating ,quick heating ..my friends compliment on my hair these days after I have straightened .this is my first straightener .Even  though I have thin and silky hair ...I put it to more than half settings to get best results ,obviously with heat protect spray .</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron! One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Recommend to anyone! Love the oil as well!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever for black nappy&lt;br /&gt;hair. Leaves hair silky and straight even without a perm. For the price it is the best one I bought. It gets vwry hot and do the job. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This straightener is a good product for the value, but there are a couple of issues I have noticed. First, I have thin, fine hair, but I still have to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight. This makes me think that it doesn&#x27;t actually heat up to the temperature it&#x27;s supposed to. I have also noticed that the iron doesn&#x27;t close as tightly as it should. I have had other higher end straighteners that can straighten even the smallest section of hair, but this one seems to struggle with that. If I use a thick section of hair, it straightens fine. But if I use a very thin section, the two ceramic plates don&#x27;t seem to clamp tight enough to straighten the hair between them. Overall I am happy with the product, and am willing to look past its issues because I got it for a good price.</li>
    <li> The product is everything the reviews said and more! I have very frizzy hair- all that&#x27;s needed for it to get wild is a drop of water or a tiny bit of humidity. The flat iron, for the first time in my life, has given me control of my hair. No more need for ponytails all summer! Thank you HSI!</li>
    <li> So my mom wanted a chi, but as I was looking online for one this HSI one chaught my eye! As I read the reviews they were great! So I took the risk and bought it! $40 for a flat iron no big deal! OMG she loves it! My cousins loved it so much 2 of them just ordered one and another is going to!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good flat iron that won&#x27;t break the bank I say you buy this one!! It works great!! 5-stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> I researched for a concave flat iron.  I was disappointed because the flat iron itself is completely flat, just the plastic sides of the iron are concave.  That was not what I expected.  The iron works fine, just not what I wanted or expected.  The description is misleading.</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR the best-performing flat iron I&#x27;ve had, and it does not fry my hair--even when slightly damp.  It has been six months, and it still performs as new.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Works even better than the CHI one that I spent over $100 for a few years ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different hair straighteners and this one is both a straightener and can do curls.  I like that it&#x27;s clear to see from the dial what the heat setting is.  It is also placed in location that your fingers won&#x27;t hit it by accident.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but so far I love it. Easy to use and quick. Way better than my old straightener which was heavy and fatter.</li>
    <li> I have only used it so far for straightening. I like the 1 inch measurement and that it flattens any frizzy hair and makes it silky without appearing to burn my hair. I had a Sedu before this one, and I admittedly liked it better, but it also cost a lot more. This is a nice flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> Had an old straightener for waaaay too long - this thing gets so much hotter and straightens so much better. Wish I would have bought it years ago. I have naturally wavy hair and this thing works great in the mornings.</li>
    <li> this flat iron works like a charm.  it does heat up quickly and makes some pretty awesome curls.  next time, i think i will upgrade to a digital reading on the same model flat iron.</li>
    <li> She loves it and if it makes her happy, it makes me happy.  It comes with a bag and she likes that for when we travel.</li>
    <li> Meets the expectations. HSI professional 1 ceramic tourmaline ionic hair straightener does what it promises. This is better than comparable devices available in the market.</li>
    <li> Great value! Great for someone who doesn&#x27;t use it for every day.As a stylist, I always caution if you wrap the cord, do it gently. Tension causes breakage at the joint and that&#x27;s why 80% of irons fail. Be gentle! You&#x27;re iron will last much longer!</li>
    <li> I love it! I was going to buy another chi, but seeing as I&#x27;m a tight wad I went for the cheaper version. And honesty it works about the same if not better than the chi!! Very impressed!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s out of control hair. She loves it and says it is comparable to Chi.</li>
    <li> So I ordered just because it was on the Amazon Best Seller list I guess I&#x27;m just helping to promote this idea of this flat iron being awesome frankly it is NOT. It is quite underwhelming and these reviews are over exaggerated</li>
    <li> Love this product! I would definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! The barrels are easy to change and heat up very quickly. Curls last for days. Received product sooner than expected. Very happy!</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It was packaged nicely and was a very good deal. My only problem was that the ceramic plates didn&#x27;t feel very smooth. I loved the argan oil and the heat glove. This was a very good deal, and works better than a CHI.</li>
    <li> Does not have self turn off as described. Fair + quality for the price. Warms up dairly quickly. If I purchased @ brick and mortar store, would have returned but did not want to deal w/ return shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months and use it regularly. It works well. It&#x27;s not the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used and it&#x27;s not salon quality, but for the price, you can&#x27;t expect that.</li>
    <li> Tends to pull hair often, which usually only happens as the device ages, but it did it from Day 1.</li>
    <li> Once this puppy heats up it works wonders.  Quite a deal I would say.</li>
    <li> Not very hot definitely not professional quality. .. reviews were very misleading very disappointed was expecting better straightening iron !</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> The best ever!!!!❤❤❤❤❤</li>
    <li> flat iron is great----works very wellp</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! Very happy with purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she hasn&#x27;t had a chance to learn to use it.I think once she has a chance to learn how to use it it will be great. One thing though there was no info in the box that told how to use it. For the price I thought it should have that info with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed in this item, after all the great reviews I thought I was getting thee best straightener out there. I like the way it heats up but it doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair smoothly. The plates feel as if they were dry and at times it catches your hair (OUCH). I would not recommend this item!!</li>
    <li> I was swayed by the reviews on here to try out this flatiron. I have been using a ghd flatiron for the past few years and it has been amazing. It hasn&#x27;t died on me yet, but I figured that it would probably die soon and it would be nice to have a backup, just in case. And I couldn&#x27;t argue with the affordable price of the HSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received it and used it for the first time today. It heated up quickly (but I miss the beep that tells me that it&#x27;s ready like I have on my ghd). I immediately noticed that the straightener seems to drag across my hair, rather than glide. It almost felt like I was damaging or possibly ripping my hair by using it. I have relatively thick hair that has a natural wave to it. I turned it up to medium heat at first, but that didn&#x27;t seem to be hot enough, so I eventually turned it all of the way up. After passing over the same section of hair a few times it seemed to smooth it out pretty well and glide a little better. Didn&#x27;t seem to cut down on straightening time for me at all and the ergonomics of the straightener aren&#x27;t the greatest. After straightening all of my hair I am satisfied with the end result, but not amazed. I guess I was expecting more due to the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll keep it as a back up since it was so cheap and keep using my ghd until it dies. If you have the money I would possibly look into a ghd or I hear that babyliss is good, too. But, for $40, this gets the job done. Meh.</li>
    <li> great iron at a great price. love the temperature dial to ensure minmal hair damage. Fast shipping as well</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my sister and I to use, but I returned it after trying it out.  The temperature seemed inconsistent and it took a while to heat up.  Then it would catch and pull my hair unless I was very, very careful.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and it&#x27;s easy and my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> it straightens my hair well.  it works better than jose eber straightener I had. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The flat iron does a wonderful job of straightening my hair in a short amount of time.  So far the quality matches that of the Chi I had previously been using, for a much better price!  I was disappointed with the &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; Argan oil, which I was expecting to come in a small bottle for several uses.  Instead, it was what I would call a sample tear open packet for one use.  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this review five stars.  I have never seen a travel size version of any product sold in a small, tear open packet.  The description should have said &amp;#34;sample of Argan oil included&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flat iron so far. It heats up fast, I only have to run it thru my hair one or two times and its straight! It arrived in 2 days. I have been using a chi and after the second one just quit working and it less than a year old I decided to try this one</li>
    <li> So far so good! This heats up SUPER fast! I like the sleeve it came with, makes it easy for travel. I don&#x27;t use the glove though but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for others. I love the long cord. I have a curling iron cord I constantly trip over and it&#x27;s gets knocked to the ground. The long cord allows me to move to the mirror I like that is further from my plug and doesn&#x27;t cause a tightrope effect like my curling iron. I have a weird setup so it works for me. It&#x27;s great having the buttons on the inside, my last one had them on the side and I had to be careful to not turn it off while i was using it. Not a concern with this one. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on this product, and after seeing a 4.5 star review I thought this would be a great deal for a great price. I was looking for a product that wouldn&#x27;t fry my hair. (My old flat iron severely damaged my hair despite trying many different types of oils and protectants) Although this straightener did not damage my hair by heat, my hair easily caught in the iron and lets face it, whether your hair is falling out by heat or being pulled out, you are still losing hair! Finally this flat iron did not straighten effectively. I tried using it from a medium temperature to the highest temperature. I would have to go through it many times and by the end of the day it was wavy again. I saw a few reviews like the one I am writing and I think my iron was defective. I sent it back and I don&#x27;t intend to get a replacement of the same product. The fact that I saw more than one review like this one shows that this product proves it is not without fault and I don&#x27;t intend to take my chances with this product again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this iron after using chi irons for many years. This iron does just as well with my thick, course hair. Nice product. Heats up fast.</li>
    <li> i have straight fine hair and i tried three types of iron. this one is the best for me. the way to curl is not very intuitive so i had to watch some tutorials on youtube. but the good thing is that the length of the hair won&#x27;t matter when using this, the other two had limitations on hair length.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful transaction. They delivered exactly what they promised and the hair straightener worked wonderfully for my very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love the HSI flat iron...it heats fast, leaves hair smooth, and easy to set temp. Handle doesn&#x27;t get hot like other irons I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly to curl my hair and it fulfills that need.  However I still prefer my babybliss to straigten my hair as it has longer and smoother plates.  Fyi, babybliss makes very tight curls which I don&#x27;t like because it&#x27;s plates are very flat compared to other flat irons.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I recommend it highly. My hair has never looked better. Shipping was very fast. Would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, it gets super hot. I&#x27;m a fan of this brand their curling irons are just as great.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this iron after reading all the positive reviews. However, after using it I can say that this is a terrible iron. First, it pulls my hair horribly. Second, I&#x27;m not sure the plates are really ceramic. It reminds me of some of the first flat irons on the market from years ago...just hot plates that seem like metal and not ceramic. Third, it took several passes to actually straighten my hair good. My hair was fairly straight to begin with as I had blew it dry with a large round brush. Also, my hair isn&#x27;t resistant at all, so I&#x27;m not sure why it was difficult to get it straight with this flat iron. The iron did get really hot though. There was no slip even though I use a light smoothing serum (something I could use or not use with my old Barbar flat iron and still get good results). This resulted in &amp;#34;hot spots,&amp;#34; which is terrible for your hair. If you want a good flat iron, this isn&#x27;t it folks--not if you are used to the higher end brands because this doesn&#x27;t compare, at all! Save your $30 and put it towards something better because this is a waste. I am a licensed professional (since 1996) and have used a lot of different irons...Barbar is really good although it does pull some (very little effort and you have straight silky hair)...Chi and Fahrenheit are okay, Keyoseki is good but is a p.o.c. and doesn&#x27;t last long,  T3--is way over-hyped, Biosilk is mediocre. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This came very quickly - it is a great hair straightener - even had a glove (to protect from burns) and a nice mesh carrying case.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have very thick and curly hair but it straightens my hair with no problem. It also leaves my hair very shiny and soft. It was an added joy to purchase it in sale. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Works excellent, dual voltage used it abroad with no problem. Seller were excellent</li>
    <li> I find this flat iron too heavy and uncomfortable to use and it takes a long time to straighten my hair on one of the higher settings.My $15 Conair did a better job of it. In fact i see myself constantly giving this iron a pass and reach for the cheaper conair instead.</li>
    <li> So far it has been everything I expected it to be....heats up and cools down nicely...I would recommend this item</li>
    <li> Not as hot as my old one- Still, works well. Mine came with the glove, which i didnt expect, so I bought another and I wish I hadn&#x27;t. I never use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Have had it for close to 3 years and still works amazing, I got it at a great price and immediately felt the difference between this and the cheaper Conair straighteners. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have short hair, but this is small enough to use so thats great. I love it, it reaches maximum temp quickly. Theres a screen that tells you what temp its at as its climbing to max temp. also it lights up green when it reaches maximum.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron, particularly for it&#x27;s adjustable heat.  It heats very quickly and works well It has good accessories with it and the price is very good.  I don&#x27;t see why you would have to pay more for one.</li>
    <li> Great Product for the price. I have only had it a week, but works great, heats up very fast to 400 degrees. I have very thick and natural wavy  hair and this flat iron did a good job straightening it. Iam glad i Didn&#x27;t spend $100.00 on one.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Brand new. Works perfectly! Reaches 450 degrees and leaves hair beautiful! Comes with glove to avoid heat on the hand and bag for storage</li>
    <li> Very nice product. You will love it. Fast shipping . Wife uses it everyday and said its the best one she has ever had.</li>
    <li> Used on med-thick slightly wavy hair. Leaves hair very smooth and silky. Would highly recommend this and have done so to many friends!</li>
    <li> Great product, great value. I was well overdue for a flat iron replacement and this was the perfect product for me and for a great price.</li>
    <li> It works fine.  I don&#x27;t think it heats up hot enough like an original CHI did, but would recommend compared to other flat irons.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this straightener. I generally have straight hair but it&#x27;s very thick and gets a little poofy after blow-drying so in the past I&#x27;ve always used a curling iron to fix any deviations. However, I tried my friend&#x27;s GHD straightener one day and realized how soft and how straight or curly it made my hair depending on what I wanted it to do. It was much quicker to use than the curling iron and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was slowly destroying my hair. So I went home and looked on Sephora&#x27;s website but found that it retailed for $225!!! In my mind, that is a giant waste of money. (Well for me, because I generally have pretty straight hair.) So I turned to Amazon for an alternative and found the $40 HSI straightener which I actually purchased with credit card points. SUCH A DEAL! The straightener is absolutely amazing. It heats up fast just like the GHD and smooths out any of the poofiness from first-day blowdrying. I also love that it includes the argan oil, the glove, and the pouch. What a bonus!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well to straighten my hair. Comes with a nice bag for travel and a variable temperature setting. I ordered it especially for a trip to Europe, and it worked just as well there as it does at home in the U.S. I would definitely order another in the future.</li>
    <li> Very high quality.  It does a great job getting my hair straight and smooth.  I have rather long hair so I needed a straightener that could help me speed up the process and this one does the job!  Ceramic plates make a difference too.</li>
    <li> the best thing  about this flat iron it doesn&#x27;t make my hair so straight at the end of my hair , I just can form it any way I want without being so straight .</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good flat iron. The only thing I seem to have question about is that when the iron becomes hot and ready, the light stays lit, as it should.  As soon as I use it to straighten one length of hair, the light goes on and off and it return to the color (on and off) of when the iron is in the process of heating up. However, the iron is steaming hot and it does straighten the next length of hair. So,I am not sure what that&#x27;s all about. The travel size sample of argan oil was nice.</li>
    <li> I really expected to pay at least $100 for a straightener, as that is how much my last one cost. I found this one, and surprisingly it looked EXACTLY like my old one, a coriless, I think it was called. Heats fast, and does exactly what a straightener is supposed to do. I also looked this brand up and it was apart of a TOP 10 straightener list for 2014.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my wife as her CHI ceramic straightener got damaged during travel. She used the HSI one and said it is pretty comparable to her CHI but for the price it is really great. After trying this one she even bought one for her mom.</li>
    <li> This is actually my third purchase of this product because the first one went to my daughter, and the second one went to my sister. When I was visiting my sister in Seattle, she saw how straight and shiny it made my hair look.  She tried it on her own hair, and she loved how well and easy it worked on her normally frizzy hair.  So, I gave it to her and I ordered a new one for myself.  I love how it makes my hair so straight, shiny and silky especially when I apply the argan oil on my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and I only wish it has an auto-off feature which is not a big deal to me.</li>
    <li> I owned a CHI before this straightener and it seemed to run more smoothly through my hair and definitely heated up more quickly. This straightener probably takes 5 minutes or more to heat up to the max heat, which I am surprised that I have needed. It does the job though and has a nice little carrying case and the Argon oil is nice and has lasted a few weeks so far (I have medium thickness, mostly straight, fine hair.) I&#x27;ll keep the straightener, but I may go back to the CHI next time. For the price, however, this straightener does well and gets hot. It just takes some time to get there.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The presentation was fabulous!  The use was even better.  Easy to use and to store.  I could not be more pleased!!</li>
    <li> It does not heat up enough. End up running the straightener few times before getting the results. I was quite excited after reading 4/5 star reviews and dual voltage option was great to have. But quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> Its rare that I flat iron my hair since the area I&#x27;m in is very humid but whenever I do use this flat iron it does wonders for me. My hair stays straight and super soft and the little sample they give is awesome too I bought the big bottle and it helped my hair as well. Now I had this flat iron for over a year now and its still working and doing wonders I like it.</li>
    <li> Great service , many compliments on my hair using this product . I like the size and that it has multiple settings.</li>
    <li> This hair iron is very good and does a good job in my hair.  My only problem with it is that I wish it had an automatic shut off timer.  I have forgotten to turn the iron off and it&#x27;s stayed on through the following day.  I find this very dangerous!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because my Chi I&#x27;ve had for 7 yrs finally kicked the bucked. I didn&#x27;t really have the money to spend $100 on another having just got back from vacation so I starting looking for a cheaper option. Having read the reviews on this and for only $39.99 I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am so pleased! It works just as good as my Chi did !! And let me just say I have curly, thick, frizzy hair normally ! And I didn&#x27;t have to spend $100!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightening iron about 9 months ago. After reading so many positive reviews for a mid-priced straightener, I thought this would be a great buy. After buying it, this straightener worked as promised and heated up quickly and left my hair nice and supple. Unfortunately, after only 4 months of use, this straightener would take a really long time to quickly heat up and sometimes wouldn&#x27;t even reach the desired heat level. I know this isn&#x27;t a result of my overusing my straightener — I MIGHT use it once or twice a week — and it&#x27;s definitely not a result of me not taking proper care of it. I&#x27;m really sad I had such a negative experience as there are thousands of reviews on here that are overwhelmingly positive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener awhile and though I don&#x27;t straighten my hair daily, I really love it. It is one of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve ever owned and I feel very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This does a great job on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t take long to get my hair straight with this product and my hair never feels dry after using it.</li>
    <li> This was a re-order of the same flat iron for me after leaving mine in a hotel room. Great product for a great price. Seller shipped quickly and packaged well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works great on my thick, naturally curly, wavy hair. I have been pleased with my purchase of this product so far!</li>
    <li> I was so worried about blowing a fuse for the whole hotel after reading blog after blog where that had happened; but this was great, no blown fuses!  And it is really a great flat iron too...it&#x27;s right up there with my CHI.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a dual voltage flat iron, look no further, you found the perfect one.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this flat iron after using a pretty cruddy Conair iron.  It was packaged beautifully and it heats up quickly, but like the Conair, it still pulls as I move down my hair and I am still experiencing quite a bit of static.  I use straightening serum and I used the Argan oil sample but it hasn&#x27;t helped.  Have to admit I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up incredibly fast and is a marked improvement upon others I&#x27;ve owned. I love the digital temperature control. The product was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this flat iron at all. It pulled the hair while straightening even when you applied little pressure. It was very heavy. It didn&#x27;t make the hair soft or shiny after straightening curly or wavy hair. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I am a professional hair stylist and I would recommend chi, hot tools, and babyliss.</li>
    <li> What I really wanted is an iron that my hair won&#x27;t get pulled or stuck in, but it seems like all do. This one isn&#x27;t too bad, but any hair that is at the edges of the iron will get pulled or stuck in the edges. It&#x27;s definitely better all around, including less pulling than my last iron and for the same price so I gave it four stars. The argan oil smells AWFUL to me that will be going in the trash. The natural smell of Argan oil is just fine, but this smells like cheap synthetic perfume to me. The case and glove are nice, but if I had paid full price I would hope for a case that the iron can go in while hot. Overall, the iron does its job as advertised, but I was hoping for the top of line and this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron that would get my hair straight as a hot comb and this was it!! I also like that it came with a cloth case which I also use to sit the iron on since it can be extremely hot for most surfaces. It works well on my full coarse hair</li>
    <li> This straightener does not get that hot and does not straighten hair very well at all.  You have to take such small pieces of hair, and you have to go over it a few times to actually get it straight.  I was very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this straightener for a few months, trying to give it a chance. Ordered it based on the stellar reviews. Maybe I got a dud. It takes a long time to heat up and I suspect is not heating to the maximum temp (never heated up Enough to even consider using the heat glove it comes with). It does a poor job of straightening my pretty manageable hair (just a little wavy).  I bought this one to replace a Remington straightener that I picked up form target about a year ago for about $40. That one preformed much better, looks like I will be purchasing another replacement. Should have retuned it right away.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this because I read all of the great reviews.  The first time I tried it, it felt like it was shredding my hair.  So I cleaned it off with a damp towel and tried again - same results - shredded my hair!  I returned it!</li>
    <li> i used the cortex before and that lasted me forver before i realized my hair was falling apart it was so damaged. that straightener just kept getting hotter and hotter. no temp regulation. the hsi feels cheap in my hands compaired to the cortex. as far as straightening goes, it doesnt get nearly as straight as my cortex did when i first got it. my hair doesnt stay straight all day like it did with the cortex. but its okay for now. its not bad enough to send back but i wouldnt get another one. im wondering if the company has its employees do these positive rewiews... kinda weird how many more reveiws this has compaired to other products on amazon. also, youtube reviews on this product almost all state that they were sent the straightener from the company and instructed to do a reveiw on it...</li>
    <li> This product is NOT worth it.  It takes FOREVER to heat to temp and when it finally gets up to temp, it doesn&#x27;t stay hot.  Not to mention, it pulls hair.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have found this flat iron years ago! This flat iron makes my hair look like it does when I leave the hair stylist. It is so smooth and straight. I can even go to bed with wet hair and wake up the next morning with a mess that this flat iron takes care of.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My straightener arrived, and the packaging looked great, but when I opened it, it felt like it was a toy. The plastic seemed very cheap and there&#x27;s a part at the end that connects the plug to the straightener that&#x27;s very loose. It feels like it&#x27;s probably going to fall out soon. As for straightening, it does okay. I have to go over it many more times in order to get it okay. In the end it was my garnier fructis spray that saved the day. I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews, and I wanted this to be great. Luckily for them, I need a straightener and don&#x27;t have the money for a different one, so it will remain in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> I was originally going to replace my aging paul mitchell straightener with a CHI straightener.  After reading reviews, I felt pretty confident this would do the trick.  My hair is medium thickness with a wave to it.  I tried it this morning on close to the hottest setting....and it barely did anything. It took twice the time for my hair to get remotely straight and by the time I got to work it was frizzy and wavy again.  I&#x27;ve never really expierenced this type of problem with any straightener. It drags across my hair and it leaves it frail and brittle looking. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews, however, I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the cheaper one I already had. However, my younger daughter LOVES it so I gave it to her :-)</li>
    <li> It heats up very fast, adjustable temp, on/off switch,  insulated case allows you to put away hot, and really smooths the hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I WAS A BIT NERVOUS ORDERING THIS, BUT AM SO GLAD I DID.  I LOVE IT AND HAVE EVEN RECOMMENDED IT TO MY STYLIST, WHO IS LOOKING TO REPLACE HER FLAT IRON.</li>
    <li> My friend referred this flat iron to me when I commented on how perfectly straight her hair was, so I decided to go for it. I was in need of a good yet inexpensive flat iron (compared to my old chi) and had high expectations for this. Right out of the box, it looked scratched and used. The plates won&#x27;t meet and snagged at my hair as I ran it through. Midway through my hair, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t look as straight as my left side did. The plates stopped heating! Not completely, but they were cool enough to touch briefly. Is this normal or is this one a defect???</li>
    <li> This iron is packaged nice and works fine although I would question the word &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; as part of it&#x27;s title. I have thick shoulder length hair and have not found any significant difference in styling my hair over the stand flat iron I previously used.</li>
    <li> Background: I have wavy, easy to straighten hair. That being said, it took me 30 minutes to straighten my BOB-LENGTH hair -purchased this iron because of the ratings were, but definitely disappointed! -does not deliver the smooth, shiny results -not a good user experience as the plates weren&#x27;t smooth gliding through the hair and often snagged.</li>
    <li> Had to return. Painfully pulled hairs bc they would get stuck under the edges of the plates. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have natural black hair and my hair stays straight.the heat protectant is soo good too. Its worth the price and it doesnt damage my hair. get this flat  iron</li>
    <li> Love the argan oil that comes with this, it really helps my hair. The design of this flat iron is great, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and that&#x27;s important because it takes quite some time to finish my hair. It has a lot of settings and heats up very quickly to 450 degrees. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews and thought I&#x27;d invest in this. I was very happy with my old $15 straightener that lasted me several years. unfortunately, it is just nowhere near up to the expectation, and my hair is neither coarse or thick.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron! It works awesome. I have curly thick hair and a ton of it so it&#x27;s hard for me to find a flat iron that works well for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister in law for Christmas.  She loves it and her hair looks fabulous!</li>
    <li> My straightener already broke. I suppose some are more durable than others, but when dropped accidentally, pieces broke off and I can no longer use it :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter and she loves it.  I used it and was impressed with how well it works.  Definitely&lt;br /&gt;money well spent!</li>
    <li> Was needing a new iron for while now and when I saw this on Amazon for such a great price it was a no brainer!!  So glad I purchased it!!</li>
    <li> Nice product and the price isn&#x27;t bad. When looking around I noticed that a lot of places charge too much for a hair straightener until I wound up upon this one here on amazon. I liked how they give you other things in the box like the glove and a chemical to put in your hair too make it more smooth. After a week or so I noticed good results and would recommend anyone looking for one that this straightener is good.</li>
    <li> Broke within 3 months of use. Very expensive item to break so quickly. The plates just completely came apart. When it worked it worked well.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener. It heats up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair like others have. It fits well in my hand and the swivel cord is great. It comes with a nice case and glove to protect my hands from the heat if necessary. Good value!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super cool. Just like the ones we see in the mall. Came quickly as well</li>
    <li> It works really well, it straightens my hair wonderfully without frying it. Wish is would heat up a little faster.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but pulls my hair. Also, I have noticed I have started to get split ends which is something I didn&#x27;t have before with my other straightener. But for the price, it&#x27;s worth it until I can afford something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The more I use this, the less I like it. I only straighten my hair once every couple of months but when I do, it pulls my hairs out and it definitely gives me split ends! Not sure where all these good reviews are coming from.... haha</li>
    <li> Great product. Great buy. Works exactly as desccribed.</li>
    <li> This product works great!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I can get my hair super smooth without much effort.  I loved it so much that I ordered another one for my daughter and she is loving it as well</li>
    <li> Pretty good iron, heats up to 400+ F and works. Comes with a sleeve.</li>
    <li> The unit is working out okay.  I was expecting a better experience with the ceramic tourmaline ionic plates.  The plates don&#x27;t glide smoothly along the length of hair, it sort of catches.  But on the whole, it works fine and I&#x27;m able to achieve the same results as with my previous flat iron.</li>
    <li> I just received my flat iron yesterday. I straightened my hair last night and I can definitely see the difference. My hair is so straight right now. This coming from someone who hates doing their hair and I was so excited to do it this morning. I gave it four stars because it was supposed to come with the sample size argan oil. While there was a sample size in the box, there was nothing in the pack. But overall, very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> I just bought this flat iron because my hair was looking &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; from the iron I had been using.  With this one, my hair is soft &amp; silky!  I am thrilled with my purchase and you sure can&#x27;t beat the price.  Do not hesitate to buy this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy long Indian hair.  The straightener does a good job, although you do have to go over each section of hair a couple times, not just once or twice.  Also, since I have so much hair the 1-inch product isnt going to cut it for me.  I would recommend this product to others---maybe someone with thinner and less hair.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews, but I love this flat iron. I have fine curly hair and it is like swimming against the tide to get it straight without frying it to frizz. I read other reviews and gave this product a try because of the reviews and it works great. I actually get the Asian Hair look I was going for! Amazing! You will want to get a full size bottle of the Argan Oil to go with it.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter LOVES this flat iron.  It is the best one she has had.  It is an extremely high quality for an extremely reasonable price.  I think you get the professional results without the professional price!</li>
    <li> This works great on my hair. I have very difficult hair as it is naturally wavy. My individual hair strands are thin but there&#x27;s a lot of them so I have thick hair. This is definitely worth the price. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister in law for Christmas.  She is using it and has no problems with it!  Her hair looks great!</li>
    <li> It is exactly as advertised.  Doing hair is not my best thing but I am learning how to use it.  I think it will keep my suddenly curling bangs under control.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom for Christmas. I am currently teaching her on how to use it properly. It heats up fast and does a great job. She is slowly getting the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I love it, I have curly thick black, and this works amazing and give great results with minimum effort, but the hair has to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it if you are looking for professional results at your home convenience, and paying this much to own your flat iron is much less that one visit to the hair salon.</li>
    <li> Awesome! 3rd one purchased in our house full of girls!!! Best one out there for the price!!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Flat irons are expensive.  I have not owned one before due to this.  my hairstylist said it was a good product and I am learning to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> They came exactly as described and are very quick at straightening my frizzy mess.  They heat up really quickly and do the job ten times quicker than my previous straighteners.  I can straighten much larger sections at once.</li>
    <li> This is better than my current flat iron because my hair stays flat a lot longer. I live in FL, frizz prone land and my hair did not get frizzy once I stepped outside.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is curly and frizzy, but with this flat iron it stayed pretty flat, which was impressive.  I have only used it once and I&#x27;m content with the results.</li>
    <li> Great product for curling and straightening! Just used in turkey and Spain as well as the U.S. with no problems. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this product it&#x27;s similar to other high end straighteners yet it is way more affordable . I am using it everyday .</li>
    <li> best straightener for the price. This is the second one I have bought!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as described.  Straightens the hair really well.  I would reccomend to anyone who is in need of a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> I saw this straightener being used by several of the stylists at the salon I go to.  When I asked about it, it came highly recommended.  They demonstrated it on my hair and I have found it easy to use and operate.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  And that is coming from someone with an original CHI.  The range of temperatures is awesome, as my hair is hard to straighten, so I need a very hot iron with fast recovery time.  I hadn&#x27;t even realized that my CHI was not getting as hot as it used to, until I used this iron and it cut my hair styling time in half. This one gets super hot and keeps its heat well.  Also, the auto turn off feature is great and saved me a few times, LOL.  Also, the addition of the heat resistant styling glove and travel case was awesome, especially at such a great price.  I have burned myself in the past, so the glove is great and thin enough that I can still feel what I&#x27;m doing and not fumble around while styling.  Lastly, the Argan Oil sample was nice, as I was actually out of town when I ordered this, and hadn&#x27;t packed any finishing serum.  After leaving the flat iron at home, I was already anxious for a replacement, and then to see I forgot my go to styling product, totally bummed.  So when this great iron arrived so fast and with a nice free sample, I was very happy!  I would for sure buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find something better than the CHI, but I&#x27;m in love with this straightener! Easy and quick and half the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my sister-in-law.  She has never owned one, and she loves it.  Her hair is short but curly.  She uses it every day, I think!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. I have thick wavy hair and this product battles through it with ease. I have bought more expensive straigthner that don&#x27;t live up to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast..&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great product bought as a gift for my fiancé  and she loves it!! I also recieved the product very quick</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick wavy hair and this works great for her when she wants to have a straight style. It heats up quickly and does a great job. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great quality for the price. But I do have to run the iron a few times through my hair. My hair is long &amp; frizzy, but very manageable with this iron. I don&#x27;t like the dial temperature, but love all the accessories it comes with. Overall great product for price.</li>
    <li> Works as well as my chi that burned up and half the price. I was nervous about buying one that wasnt a chi. But I am happy with it</li>
    <li> Great product! works better than a chi that I had been using. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thick and curly.  This keeps it straight for two days. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Because it pulls your hair out when you use it. The side of the irons are not flat enough and it causes damage to your hair by ripping it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife as a gift.  Here is what she had to say about this item:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This hair straightener works well, is durable, looks nice and does what it is supposed to do.  It is a quality hair straightener.  My only criticism is that it did not include a heat proof case to secure it in immediately after use.  My previous one had such a case, which I&#x27;m glad I saved in order to use with this one.  That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. I have been considering a new flat iron for many months and had done much research and read hundreds of reviews. The HSI is as advertised, heats up fast and does the job well. Product arrived quickly and purchase was hassle free. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought for my  12 yr old daughter who has long naturally curly hair. Made the investment and it was well worth it.  She can and does straighten her hair by herself with no help needed.  Doesn&#x27;t take long and when she is done her hair is completely straight and stays that way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas..  It stopped working Jan 15th!  I can&#x27;t return it because I&#x27;m passed the return window!  I guess this has taught me not to buy electric items on the internet!  UGH!</li>
    <li> I just got this today and just got done using it. It does make your hair smooth and shiny! I love it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it.  Takes less time to straighten her hair and works good.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is $60 cheaper than my old one and it&#x27;s equally as good. I have naturally frizzy/curly hair and this flat iron gets it nice and smooth without breakage.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my wife and she loves it, saying it is much better than her previous straightener.</li>
    <li> Structurally this is a good tool; however, it does not hold a candle to any Chi Straighter! I decided to purchase the HSI Straightener after my Chi of 4 years stopped working in some electrical outlets. I decided to give a new product a try. I decided on this one due to being a best seller. I wonder how many people have returned it! You get what you pay for. This straightener took 3x as long to straighten my hair then the Chi and I have chin length hair!! I had to keep going over my wavy hair and it was on the highest setting! My advice, spend a little more money! Although I am saddened my Chi didn&#x27;t last more than 4 years, I will buy another Chi! Probably in Pink!!</li>
    <li> Great deal. Loving this iron! Upgrade from a crappy drugstore one. Like night and day!</li>
    <li> Good deal for a great straightener</li>
    <li> Awesome shipping time!  I can really tell a difference with this flat iron over others I have used throughout the years. Heats up very quickly, has automatic shut off, works better than any other flat iron!</li>
    <li> It works good, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I have thick curly hair and previously had a CHI but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money this is a perfect option.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron and use it often.  It came with a holder, mitt and fabric case.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use. I am still trying out different heat settings for my hair style but the product works and I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is just as good as any high- end priced one!  I recommend to anyone who asks.</li>
    <li> Love it,this is my second iron,i loved my first one better but i gave it to some one that ask me for it in a vacation,so i bought this one because i didn&#x27;t wanted to spend too much money on a new one,and for the price of this one i am very satisfied with it,i have very dry frizzy hair and it does the job to tame my hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect straightener for the price. Works great. Wish there was a way to clamp it shut when im done with it though.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the Hai brand and absolutely loved it.  I decided to try HSI this time and I&#x27;m a little dissapointed.  First off the &amp;#34;Travel size&amp;#34; Argan Oil is really a sample size.  They really shouldn&#x27;t use it as a selling point.  It takes me longer to use this iron then my Hai one.  I&#x27;m tempted to send this one back but don&#x27;t want to deal with shipping it back.  Oh well, it does the job for now.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to use this brand . Nice product , and the argan oil sample is good.</li>
    <li> ok product, good shipping. i&#x27;ve used this a few times, but am not completely impressed.  howvever, it&#x27;s a good iron for the money</li>
    <li> It beyond my expectations I would recommend it. It gives my hair a nice shine and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> Does an amazing job straightening my hair, while keeping it glossy and healthy looking. The only downside for me is that, while it has the heat glove sent with it, I don&#x27;t like to put on the glove when straightening my hair. Unlike other brands of straighteners, the outside handle (where the plates are kept) is not very thick so you can&#x27;t really touch that part of the straightener without the glove. Overall: Would recommend this straightener has it gets the job done a lot better than other straighteners out there!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rapid response and well designed such that you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning your fingers and workmanship is top notch!</li>
    <li> Came fast..works EXCELLENT. VERY VERY well made. not cheap at all... my fiancé is picky and she loves it. .</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and I wanted an iron with an easy to set temperature control and plates that dragged smoothly through my hair without having to pay an arm and a leg.  This met all three needs.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Straightens well but seems to pull on little hairs as you go down - worth the money though for a straightener under $50</li>
    <li> This straightener works great!!  No problems at all.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! I live on the Island of Guam and the humidity is very high year round. I have very curly hair under my slightly wavy hair. This straightener is the only one so far that I can use and it really straightens it and it stays straight!! The argon oil is great too!!</li>
    <li> This the best flat iron I have bought. The thing I like the best is that it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
    <li> Works great, love it.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener for my touchups. I have naturally curly hair and when I first blow my hair out I find that this takes longer than my other one. This straightener does good for my touch ups and it keeps the frizz away.</li>
    <li> Works great! Brought it for my sister for Christmas. She loves it. Great price as well, can&#x27;t bet it !!!</li>
    <li> I ordered it on Monday, received on Thursday and used it after my shower, boy this tool does smooth out my thick curly hair with burning or damaging my hair or pulling. Goodbye to my old tool. It&#x27;s worth the purchase ladies.</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift.  She was thrilled. She actually flat ironed and styled her hair with it and told me that her hair still looked great the following day.  The edges on the plate are nice and smooth so her hair does not get pulled or snagged between the plate and the handle.  She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener as a Christmas gift for my little sister.  She&#x27;s constantly spending $30-$40 for the crappy in-store straighteners.  I got this one for $39.99 and thought it would be more professional style because of the original price, however it is pretty much the same as the cheaper ones in the store.  :(  It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my nicer one that I baught at Sally&#x27;s for $60.  If you&#x27;re looking for a really nice straightener that gives the sleek/silky shine - I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with that being said, my customer service with this seller was amazing and I would recommend buying other products from them.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this flat iron does the trick. Heats up fast, temp adjusts well, very satisfied</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron hair straightener about a week ago and am very satisfied with this purchase. The packaging was very nice and I like that you can adjust the temperature of this iron. Considering that these types of straighteners can be pretty expensive I think this is a very good value for the price and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works similiar to store brands, but couldn&#x27;t beat the price.  The only complaint that I have it that it snags my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great and gets hot enough to do the job. Highly recommended by me. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener after reading all the rave reviews and it did not disappoint!! I am so thrillled with this product. I have very thick, very curly hair and it straightened my hair in about 20 minutes, whereas before it would take at least 45 minutes. It heats up very quickly and is extremely easy on my hair, no tugging or pulling and very smooth. It&#x27;s also perfect for making curls! Definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other brand.</li>
    <li> I still have a hard time believing the price I paid for this gem. Save your bucks and go with this iron!  Don&#x27;t think twice, just do it. A gazillion positive reviews can&#x27;t be wrong. Works just as well as my Paul Mitchell iron. I also like the oil that came with it! I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on these but it does what I need a flat iron to do and it arrived very quickly. I would buy this again for sure.</li>
    <li> I did not use it yet but the style and other things looks grate. I think you can buy it</li>
    <li> My hair is relatively thick, and is wavy, bordering on curly. Some days it&#x27;s curly, some days it&#x27;s just wavy. This straightener warms up fast, and straightens my hair fast. It also leaves my hair smooth and soft, unlike my previous straightener that left a rough texture and some frizz. I use this at least once a week, and before when my hair would take about an hour to straighten, this one only takes about 20 minutes, and that&#x27;s only if I&#x27;m sitting down and actually doing it carefully.</li>
    <li> After my straightener for the last five years finally gave its last croak a few weeks ago, I was in the market for a new straightener.  Because of its reputation, I assumed I was going to get a CHI, but decided to look around a little first and came across this bad boy.  After looking at all the positive reviews and awesome price I decided to give this baby a chance.  I am so happy I did!  The straightener works way better than my old one ever did, the black handles and black plates give it a very sleek and attractive appearance, and it even comes in its own red satin-y lined black box which makes it feel like pulling a sacred relic straight from Dracula&#x27;s coffin.  I would recommend getting some of the Argan oil too.  I decided to try it out the sample first before I bought a bottle and I should have just bought it then.  It makes my hair sleek and soft like a kitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: Highly recommend this product, don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive straightener because this one is awesome.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this flat iron after my salon flat iron died.  I am very happy with the performance of this flat iron.  I had tried an off the shelf revlon model that never got hot enough and never worked for me.  This iron does a great job, heats up quickly and handles great.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as my old Hair straightener didn&#x27;t flat my  hair as i wanted to be.&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time that i used HSI i noticed the difference with other straightener that i have used before. It took a short time to straight my hair that lasted longer. Also the oil at the package helped a lot and kept my hair smooth and bright.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to buy and use HSI, its worth it.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Bought it as a gift after seeing a lot of positive feedback. Heats up quick and works flawlessly. Shipping was outstanding and fast, and the description couldn&#x27;t of been more accurate</li>
    <li> Works great! This is my first time buying this brand and so far I am very satisfied. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family</li>
    <li> After reading all of the great reviews on this flat iron, I decided to order one myself. I was so impressed with how quickly it was shipped! It seems like a good quality product, however I had 2 problems with it. The first thing is that the flat iron part that&#x27;s supposed to be smooth has a couple rough spots on it and it catches my hair and breaks it. The other thing is that it doesn&#x27;t get keep my hair straight, even with it turned all the way up. I have fine/thin fuzzy hair which I can usually get to straighten with other irons I&#x27;ve tried, so I&#x27;m not sure if my HSI iron is not working correctly or what.</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying I have an abundance of curly, semi-thick, long hair. I have not straightened my hair in three years.  During the last three years I have tried to nurture my hair back to health after experiencing severe heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand HSI wasn&#x27;t recognizable at all. Brands like Chi and Sedu are far more popular by name, but I absolutely must say that the HSI was far superior than the Sedu I had. Mind you, the sedu I had was actually wider. I was skeptik that I could work with a 1in. Flat Iron, but this prouduct was effective to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was flat ironing AFTER blow drying it, I didn&#x27;t see any steamy smoke floating above as I ran the iron through peices of my hair. It proves to me at least, that even at 300 degrees, this iron was somehow delicate on my hair. My biggest fear is heat damage, because why I choose to straighten my hair, I do love my natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many passes does it take to straighten? Well, I did blow dry my curls  first. It was a straight kind of poofy. Then I ran it slowly through sections of hair. Literally, one pass with this iron was enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to create curls or flip your ends with this iron too! The flat iron has flexible plates and it moves with you. At first I thought my iron was broken because I&#x27;ve never seen this feature, but it&#x27;s so amazing. My previous Sedu flat iron claimed to flip and curl hair, but it really didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall concept of this product is just great. I do like it, and somehow, I don&#x27;t know why, it just feels safe on my curly hair. Like I said before, there isn&#x27;t a huge surge of steam being exerted as I am running the iron through my hair and this is calming in a sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps women/men, especially those who are wondering is this might work for ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> Got the product quickly and my wife began using it.  She loves it so far, and it works great!  Even the carry bag that it comes with is a really nice quality bag.  As with any straightener, time will tell how long the device will hold up, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the HSI Flat Iron Hair Straightener! I have thick, curly hair...so not every product is effective in giving me the soft and straight look that I want. I have been though numerous straighteners, and I give the HSI iron an A+. Quick heat up time, several heat options...and it also comes with a glove and heat-resistant bag. Overall...highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have owned many straighteners over the past 10 years.  The number has to be around 15.  I started buying off run of the mill, low quality ones from Walmart.  After watching my hair break off and become dry, I decided it was time to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener is the third high quality straightner that I have owned and it lives up to the standard I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a styler that heats up fast and seals in moisture, look no further!  Plus the swivel cord is a great touch.  No more getting caught or tangling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have given this 5 stars, I am a bit confused as to why the temperature control is in such odd spot.  If it were up to me, I&#x27;d move it.  However, This seems to be a standard with many straighteners lately so I did not deduct any stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pouch is a great addition.  No straightener I&#x27;ve owned has ever offered one with the product for free and I wanted one.  It&#x27;s great for traveling to make sure my investment is protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that if the one inch plate makes you shy away from ordering this, it&#x27;s a mistake.  I thought bigger was better and never would have given a second thought to one so thin.  Trust me, you don&#x27;t need a flat iron bigger than an inch.  This does an amazing job of making your hair completely straight without any hair getting caught and being pulled.</li>
    <li> My sister is a hair stylist so I&#x27;ve always had straighteners that were upwards of $100 because they are what she uses. Needless to say my expectations were not high based on the cost of this product. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this straightener is not only comparable to the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used but better in many ways.  It heats up quickly and you don&#x27;t have to pause for long periods of time while it reheats.  I am very, very happy with it and will recommend this to friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 CHI irons and after reading the reviews on this one I decided to give it a chance.  After using CHI for several years, I conclude that I still love my CHI better than the HSI.  I do have to admit though that this HSI does do better than my old Revlon flat iron, but after using the HSI for two weeks I put it back in it&#x27;s package and brought my old CHI back out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I like CHI better than the HSI:&lt;br /&gt;~CHI irons have the heat indicator light on the inside of the flat iron (which sounds odd, but to me it&#x27;s very easy to see while holding the iron in your hand if the heat in the iron dropped or is still at the right temp while looking in the mirror).  When I hold the HSI iron the heat indicator light is on the outside of the iron right where I hold it so my hands cover the light up.  Seems like a small issue, but when you&#x27;re in a hurry it&#x27;s a pain to have to re-adjust my grip or set the iron down just so I can see if the heat is to the right temp or not.&lt;br /&gt;~Grip on the HSI is uncomfortable (made up on lots of small crisscrosses which indent in your fingers and even left marks).&lt;br /&gt;~Loses heat very easily (with comparison to CHI).  Ever 2-3 strands of hair (and I have thin hair) the heat was lost (the heat light indicator would change from green to red).&lt;br /&gt;~Lastly, it snagged on my hair.  Which having thin hair as it is and having strands ripped out of my head daily wasn&#x27;t pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s not the worst, but not the best.  I&#x27;ll probably just use this one to take on vacations when we travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter and her hair never looked smoother. Just a couple of passes with this and she&#x27;s out the door. It heats up quickly and has adjustable temperatures. I have paid over $100 for flat irons that don&#x27;t compare to this.</li>
    <li> I have had a CHI for four years, which I paid $120 for... well it recently died on me and I had to replace it quickly. I had a &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; cheapy one by Conair, but it was pathetic. So, I found a great deal for this one just before Christmas, and bought it for myself. I couldn&#x27;t be happier, it works as well as the CHI for a fraction of the price. It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t fry my long hair. I would recommend this to anyone with fine-medium hair types.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and used it few times, and it works great!  Heats up real quick.  I was able to straighten my long hair within 15 minutes!  Comes with bag, glove, and some kind of oil.  I used a CHI before, and this one works just as good!</li>
    <li> First of all let me say I purchased this iron on sale for $43 &amp; free shipping. I&#x27;ve never spent over $40 on a flat iron .... so I&#x27;m not sure how the really expensive irons compare. Even though this iron retails for $300. I still prefer my flat iron I purchased from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply. I do like the design &amp; it fits comfortably in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;The iron DOESN&#x27;T seem to reach MAX TEMP &amp; pulls my hair. I have fine/thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this straightener.  I originally bought a CHI on sale for $100 down from $200??? I took it back, it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.  The HSI straightener reaches temperature, leaves my hair sleek and shiny.  It comes with a beautiful pouch and argan oil which leaves your hair even nicer. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but after reading all the positive, I feel compelled to do so!  I have had this for over one year and have tried to like it and all I&#x27;m grateful for is that I didn&#x27;t spend what it supposedly retails for.  It does not stay hot, and it practically pulls my hair out each time I use it.  I can&#x27;t see any difference between using this one or a cheaper brand bought at a drug store.  I also don&#x27;t like that it does not automatically turn off after being on for an extended amount of time.  Even the cheap ones have this feature.  This seems like a fire hazard to me. I would have sent it back if it was easy to do so.  I can&#x27;t recommend purchasing this at all!</li>
    <li> I love it! It was easy to use and I love the glove that was added to protect from heat of iron.  It had an awesome red bag to store  it in as well.</li>
    <li> I just received my flat iron so this review is based on only 2 uses.  So far, I like it.  My hair glides smoothly through the flat iron and it straightens my hair nicely.  I did find that my hair sometimes gets snagged like some other reviews said, but I&#x27;ll probably need a little more time to get used to the straightener.  I would have liked it better if the heating elements were longer so I can grab more hair at one time.  (I have a lot of hair!)  Also, the on/off switch and temperature control settings are inconveniently placed on the inside of the straightener, so if you have big hands/fat fingers, it&#x27;s kind of awkward to adjust the settings.</li>
    <li> I got the straightener very quickly in the mail. I&#x27;m usually skeptical about hair products and appliances and wanted to check out this straightener. I&#x27;m an amazon prime member and couldn&#x27;t believe how much this item was. I&#x27;m impressed- this straightener makes my hair look professional every time!</li>
    <li> This is something our daughter in law REALLY wanted! I think she will be SO happy with it, too! Great price &amp; very speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> Works very well to straighten or curl hair. I like the shiny hair I get with this flat iron. Works quickly and has adjustable heat settings.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  I have aChi and this flat iron works just as well as my Chi.</li>
    <li> 3 stars for now on this item.  It arrived and was immediately wrapped for Xmas.  Upon opening my wife found the small bottle of oil had leaked over everything!!  Needles to say she and I were quite upset over this.  I will report back after she tries it.</li>
    <li> I found out about this flat iron through one of my friends. She has the same one. I fell INLOVE with it. Shipping was quick too. most deff would recommend :) I tried many irons. This one is at the top along with Chi.</li>
    <li> I only paid $29.99 for this straightener and it isn&#x27;t even worth that!!!! It pulls my hair, doesn&#x27;t do a great job and is a pain to even turn on. I have to reset the plug every time I go to use it. I hate it. Chi is more expensive- but definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> This item was given as a gift.  I had been told the existing straightener my gf had was not hot enough.  I found this product, which was priced brilliantly, had great reviews, and fit the criteria of what I was seeking.  The gift was given yesterday morning and used within an hour.  The feedback?  \\&quot;The flat iron is FABULOUS!!!  I LOVE IT!!!  It is perfect, and does exactly what I have been hoping for.\\&quot;  I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product, nor the service.  All was/is excellent!</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a new flat iron for Christmas. She had another brand and thought a different styler was what she wanted. After looking at other products and reviews, I settled on the HSI, not the one she originally requested. Ordered through Blue Novelties through Amazon a few days before Christmas. It arrived in one day. It was on sale and a great value. Found after I purchased it, it was number 1 rated styler on Amazon. The product was nicely packaged. My wife was impressed with the professional look and feel of the styler. She was totally and pleasantly surprised to also find the protective glove, travel pouch, and sample oil. She just used it today, day after Christmas. She loved the way it slides easily through her hair. Just getting used to it, so cannot offer comment on specifics of operation or durability, but first impression - ecstatic! Couldn&#x27;t wait to tell me about it. Would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I just received this item as a Christmas gift yesterday and decided to use it today. After seeing so many positive reviews, I decided to put it on my gift wish list and I am so happy that I did. Let me start by saying that I have very thick curly/kinky natural hair. I used the product along with the trial size leave-in argan oil that came in the box. I only had to glide the flat iron over my hair once and my hair was silky, shiny, and soft! I was blown away! I have used the CHI and FHI flat irons in the past, and this flat iron is much better! I am in love:-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace my aging Chi. The reviews were great so I decided to give it a chance. It worked great for a couple weeks, but when I got it out to use yesterday I realized the plates were cracked and broken. I had not been rough with it/thrown it around, so I am very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a flat iron for a long time but didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg.then I got a gift card from my kids for amazon&amp;#34; which I love&amp;#34; by the way so I started looking at flat irons and when I saw the great reviews on this one I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It&#x27;s a great flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used!!! It hears up really fast and gets up to 400 degrees. It straightens my wavy hair in two swipes instead of 5-6 like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, but A LOT of it! This flat iron gives me the sleek look that I have been trying to achieve and tames the frizzies.  The iron heats up quickly and does not snag my hair.  The product comes very nicely packaged with a carrying bag for the iron plus a sample of argan oil and the price seems very reasonable!</li>
    <li> I had the paul Mitchell iron for yrs till it just pooped out on me. I immediately went on amazon to buy the highest rated iron I could find since I have crazy hair that doesn&#x27;t do a thing with the cheap kind. I was expecting to pay at least $100 for my new one. After reading the reviews on this one I just had to try it,especially since it was so decently priced. Not only does it work better than my last, the grip is very comfortable too!  I can&#x27;t wait to run out of my morraccan oil so I can start using their oil also since it too has great reviews!</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and undamaged. Flat iron performs as described. I like the temperature control feature. Very satisfied with product and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife.  It showed up on time and my wife loves it.  Says it&#x27;s the best straightner she has ever used.</li>
    <li> Great price, great for any hair type, can use it to curl and straighten. My wife loves this iron she has thick hair and she only has to run the iron through her hair once. Highly recommend all husbands to buy this iron, she will spend less time getting ready to go out!</li>
    <li> I love using this to curl my hair.  The oil that came with is great as well.  Overall I think this is a great product.  I was a little worried since the number of reviews make it seem like it might be fake reviews, but I am really impressed, especially for the price</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair which is naturally curly.  I am a bit of a lazy straightener and occasionally would try to go too fast.  It doesn&#x27;t matter with this.  It leaves my hair very straight and shiny.  I also use a spray heat protectant product (just a cheap suave product) and it just does a great job.  Warms up very fast.  I have paid a lot more for straighteners which don&#x27;t work half as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best straightener I have ever used.  I will be buying another one for my mom&#x27;s birthday which is coming up.  Cuts my straightening time in half!</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI Stler Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener for my fiance as a Christmas Gift.  It does a great job at straightening her hair.  The price cannot be beat, and she thinks it does as good of a job (if not better) than a lot of the more expensive hair straighteners out there.  She is very satisfied with her straightener and said she would certainly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product. It actually makes my hair look and feel like it does when I leave the salon. I was so pleasantly surprised as I typically do not have good luck with hair care items. My hair is so soft and unfrizzy! Yay! It arrived right on time and it included a nice cloth carrying case and a heat resistant glove to help prevent burns. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I can not believe this straight iron only ended up setting me back $50 it is truly salon quality and works great on my hair. I would recommend you pick an HSI over a Chi because of the build quality that the HSI has.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Chi user, and sadly as with so many, my cord shorted out.  Not wanting to spend another $150 on a defective product, I decided to give HSI a try.  I am very, VERY pleased with this high quality straightener.  This straightener gets up to 410 degrees, nice and hot.  It is also very solid and heavy, not chintzy like you might expect for something at this price.  My hair is as straight as my stylist gets it when I go to the salon.  And the Argan oil sample is a great bonus, adds shine to my hair without grease or heaviness.  If you&#x27;re in the same boat I was, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry with this one.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is wonderful. It heats up fast and greatly decreases the amount of time I have to spend in front of the mirror doing my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch.  i love this product!! my hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled out and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
    <li> Did not work well on my hair. Not hot enough and was not comfortable to use. Sent it back , no problem</li>
    <li> I think i had 5 flat iron in my drawers and not all of them satisfied me. It straight my hair fine but its too long to get my hair done &amp; most often i have a lot of hair fall. Then last year we spent christmas at my in law house. And i met this bad girl in my sister in law&#x27;s bathroom, i ask to try it. And im like.... OHhhh my god! Im in love. Then i was like OK i need you in my life and i ordered the next morning. And ever since im happy with my purchased. I love it, and i don&#x27;t have to struggle straightening my hair in hour and worried &amp; irritated that my hair falls and dry. Girls who looking for a good flat iron, i highly recommend this, you wont regret buying it. Its worth the money promise ;)</li>
    <li> We compared lots of straighteners to the CHI which is very expensive! My daughter has THICK curly hair and lots of it.  This flat iron has a light when it&#x27;s on and temperature gauge.  It is also curved on the edges which allow you to &#x27;flip&#x27; the hair.  Very good quality!</li>
    <li> I bought this even with the hit and miss reviews. This is indeed a wonderful flat iron my hair is thick and wavy and long it use to take me hours to flat iron my hair now it only takes 45 mins to an hour at the most I would deffently recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even last three months.  Worked great at first, but now it won&#x27;t even heat up.  I will try another brand next time.</li>
    <li> Mine does a good job, however, the light constantly switches from green to red whether or not it is in use. I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud? Heat doesn&#x27;t seem consistent. :(</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron, especially for the price. The rounded edges make for nice flat-iron curls, which is why I bought a new iron. Heats up quickly. Swivel cord makes for nice handling. Only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly over my hair as I&#x27;d like (I have think, fairly curly hair), but results are still good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with high hopes but the first one I received wouldn&#x27;t heat up correctly or stay on. I was really sad because I had high expectations of this product. I spoke up and the company sent me a replacement. I am so happy I have this flat iron! It took me a little getting used to but is better than any other ones I have used on my long, dark this hair! I love it!! it makes my hair soft and sleek, not dry and strawlike like other flat irons. never again will I buy a cheepy flat iron.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this people asked what did I do to my hair!  My hair is naturally straight, but using this it helps with the frizzies and straight from the salon look.  My hair looks great all day, I have had other flat irons in the past but this is the only one I have ever wrote a review on.  Title has the word HOT, since one of the guys in the office came up to me and said damn girl you look hot today... I love your hair like that!</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive with this product because I didn&#x27;t recognize the brand. I have already tried several high quality and popular brands but I hadn&#x27;t come across HSI. But because I was out of the budget at that time, I had no choice but to buy this cheap one from HSI. But to my astonishment, this hair straightener provides quality hair care.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me great and nice locks. I love this straightener because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all dry and frizzy. You know, the other brands that I&#x27;ve used would oftentimes leave my hair all worn out with dry, split ends.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this straightener from HSI. For those who are wanting to buy great quality hair straightener that is half the price of those top notch brands, then this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> After almost 3 months I have no complaints. Having the dial to regulate heat is an improvement over my CHI model which was either on or off, otherwise it operates pretty much the same.</li>
    <li> Product was bought as a gift and she loves it! The flat iron is exactly what it said it was and works great!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone!  My hair feels and looks amazing - smooth, shiny and healthy.  I have curly hair and find it difficult to have it straight on a rainy day without it looking like the weather. BUT when I used this flat iron with a little bit of the argan oil sample, I could not believe how silky it looked.  I received a lot of compliments on my hair.  This is a definite keeper, so glad I found it after much research -THANKS!  The customer service from this vendor is top notch and you can see that they take pride in it.  I originally received the product without the sample of the argan oil and noticed that it was not heating as it should.  Contacted vendor who shipped replacement out same day - no hassle what so ever.  I appreciate doing business with businesses that cares about customer satisfaction - thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a month, but it works great so far. It&#x27;s as good as, if not better than my Chi and at an even better price! I&#x27;m definitely glad I decided to purchase this and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale on Black Friday, can&#x27;t beat the price.  This straightener gets very hot quickly. Hair glides through straightener smoothly. This product came with argan hair oil which keeps my hair silky smooth, and smells great! I have type 2B hair.</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron about a week ago.  I have used it 4 times, each time hoping it will work well.  The thing is, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it said it should. Definitely does NOT get up to 400 degrees.  I have thick, wavy hair. I used to own a Chi for this reason.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the HSI had such great reviews for the price! I was really hoping this would be as good as Chi because of the reviews I read on it....but like they say, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  Now I am on the journey to returning the cheap thing.  By the way, I owned a remington wet-to-straight for 14 years, I bought it at Rite-Aid...it got much hotter than this tool.  I will say, I did not have the clamping issues that some people had, it looks nice,  I like the grip on it. The argon oil they send you that is sample size is pretty amazing, but I only got to use mine once as the lid was not tight and spilled ought in shipping.</li>
    <li> I have owned a fair number of inexpensive flat irons before this one and I am so happy that I have one that works now.  My hair is long and curly so it can be quite cumbersome to straighten.  I tried it first after I blow-dried my hair straight and was pleased that it seemed to really give my hair a crisp, salon look.  Later, I tried it after I had let it naturally dry curly.  Obviously it took a bit longer to get it looking great, but so much faster than my old flat irons.  It heats up really quickly and even though I almost always use the hottest setting, I like that there is a lower heat option.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for salon quality iron. Purchased for my niece she was grateful for the gift as she was sharing with her mother. All accounts of the product indicate it is top of the line and I was able to purchase for an unbelievable price. Arrived on time and in original packaging, new in box. Beautiful and works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She has had quite a few top of the line straightners that have cost hundres of dollars and this by far is her favorite! She loves the Argan Oil that comes with it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener based on the price and how many great reviews it had. I purchased it for $49.99 and the retail was listed as $299.99.. I definitely would never have paid that much for this hair straightener. It&#x27;s decent- probably worth the 50 bucks I paid for it, but not even close to being worth $300. I have a CHI that I paid $160 for that I&#x27;ve had for a year and a half and to me, they&#x27;re close to the same - I still prefer the CHI to this one. It&#x27;s definitely not a bad deal but not exactly what I was hoping for.. It does the job and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> Works great. I love how the plates are a darker color than most so it helps hide the product buildup.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this was good at all. Used for a few days and sent it back. Not a pro styler</li>
    <li> Well, I bought HSI PROFESSIONAL CERAMIC TOURMALINE  as a gift for my wife after that I saw the rating  in  Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my wife said she preferred her old Styler, Because it is faster than HSI in heating and stronger and there is an electronic screen on it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any way we keep it for our young daughter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Works as described, better than conventional straighteners that take multiple tries. So at the price, this is one of the best products out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this in October 2012 and Febryary 2013 it doesn&#x27;t heat up anymore.  I really liked the way it straightened my hair during those 4 months, but seriously, 4 months?!</li>
    <li> It works a lot better than I expected. I&#x27;m happy I bought it. The wait could have been shorter but I still got it so its not that big of a deal. I got an email saying that the Argan oil wouldn&#x27;t be included, but I have a small sample anyway.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works better than my Chi and is half the price! Not to mention, my hair looks great! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because my other one (izunami, which i was fond of) stopped heating up and wouldn&#x27;t stop beating -- when i received this new one i was kind of hesitant because of the way it looked -- but after trying it.....I LOVE IT!! i can adjust the heat level and love how silky my hair looks!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to be happy with this product,I bought it for my daughter for christmas and I used it and now I think I use it more than her. Great product</li>
    <li> This is a nice flat iron for a nice price. I love that it heats up quickly but I wish i would have gotten a wider size. I have long hair and the 1&amp;#34; is too small to really straighten my hair with one stroke. Overall I recommend it and I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> About the only good thing I can say about this straightener is that it does get hot enough so that only one pass is enough to straighten MOST of your hair.  HOWEVER, after a while the plates from mine kept detaching from the iron, so my hair gets snagged and broken.  Also, it LOOKS like you could make a nice wave or curl, but BEWARE, if you are not careful, it will give it a boxy folded over shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT Recommend this.</li>
    <li> This Flat iron is definitly the most afforadble and cheapest yet the greatest quality flat iron. Well worth the money. I would say for the price this is the best!</li>
    <li> It looks nice but it just doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I need it to. The green light turns red after I run it through one piece of hair, then I have to wait a minute for it to get hot again. This is really frustrating because I have a lot of hair (and its really curly). Not even really worth the $50. But I guess if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair its fine to use.</li>
    <li> i was REALLY excited to recieve this and although it came a little late, i was happy. when i opened it, it was obviously used and returned. the bottle of oil was empty and the cord was all over the place. but putting that aside i tried using it, the temperature button was really hard to get to and hard to turn if your fringers are slippery. then even at the highest temperature, it was really cool. i tried straightening my hair and it isnt thick very thin actually, but it took me 3-4 times to go over that strand to make it straight. also, it has a really smell to it like burning metal, it stunk up my whole bathroom. i am going to return this and i would not recommend it. also, the straightener pulled on each end of every strand of hair. it really hurts</li>
    <li> I love love love it! And such a great deal! Works prefectly! This is the first flat iron I have ever purchased but it is just as good if not better than the ones I have seen in the salons.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron! I was a little sceptic going from a Chi to something I&#x27;ve never tried before but by all the great reviews I took a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did, it works great and I&#x27;m happy I did!</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. You can control the temperature and it gets hot fast (which is perfect if you&#x27;re always in a hurry like me). Also straightens hair easily and smoothly.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this Flat Iron and dropped it and cracked it and I immediately ordered another one just like it.  I love the way this Flat Iron gets really hot and does a wonderful job straightening my hair.  I can&#x27;t believe that I was able to get it at such a great price too!</li>
    <li> Pretty basic, nothing fancy but it gets the job done.  The on/off switch and temperature knob are kind of strangely placed in the inner area.  If I had realized it didn&#x27;t have an auto shut off, I wouldn&#x27;t have chosen this model.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a straightner for a while and when I read the reviews, I thought it was a good straightner. When I received it and tried it out, I was a bit disappointed that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny and smooth like other straightners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron when it was on sale for $39.99!!  I was skeptical because I had gotten another flat iron for the same price and needless to say I was super disappointed.  I even got a CHI from target for more than double the price and I returned it (BAD).  Anyway way, long story short, this is the best flat iron I have own.  I have curly, frizzy hair and it works wonders on it!  When I saw what what it did to my hair the first time I used it, my jaw hit the floor!!!!  Totally recommend it, sooo happy with it!!  UPDATE 12/18/2015!! Have had this flat iron for more than 3 years now and still going strong!!  I use it at least 1x week.  Now, that&#x27;s a great investment :)))!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always puzzled why my wife feels the need to straighten her hair but she does. She needs a hot iron to handle her long, thick hair. Unfortunately, while this one says it is rated at up to 410F it does not work nearly as well as other irons in this range. Not only does it take her longer than her previous iron, it doesn&#x27;t get as straight as she&#x27;d like. Not recommended for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I choses this iron from it&#x27;s ratings. I have recommended it to my friends. It heats up fast and works well on straight hair as well as ethnic hair. I love the cord feature that prevents it from getting all twisted up. I hope to enjoy this one for a while to come. The price was perfect for me as well.</li>
    <li> works great&lt;br /&gt;this is my first flat iron.This is not so much expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know about the other irons but this is working great for me.No need to buy the other one.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair so it is hard to get my hair straight and silky. I previously owned the onepass by bio ionic and that worked ok but the strips got worn. I was going to buy the onepass again but I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 to have to replace it in a year. After searching amazon I found the HSI flat iron which I still don&#x27;t understand how it went from $299 to $42.63 (the price I got it for) but the reviews were great and that is my kind of price so I decided to try the HSI. Before I flat iron my hair I washed it then put the free sample of HSI argan oil with coconut oil. My hair transformed from curly and frizzy to soft and manageable.... so far so good.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! It&#x27;s hard to clean, though. I never used the heat-safety love because I&#x27;m not incompetent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair with flat irons for 10 years.  Loved my Chi but it stopped working and I thought it might be fun to try something new.  So glad I did - the HSI Styler is completely AMAZING. Totally smooth, doesn&#x27;t tug on hair, heats up quickly, and the results are fantastic -  my hair ended up super smooth and glossy. It came with a little vial of argan oil which smells great.  Price was great too. I&#x27;m completely thrilled with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife who is very particular about what she uses on her hair. The item came right on time and was nicely packaged in a box with a bag and instructions. My wife absolutely loves the straightner and tells all her friends about it. It heats up very quickly and the controls are located nicely inside so you don&#x27;t accidentally hit them. This will definitely be the only straightner she uses going forward.</li>
    <li> I ordered the HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for a dear friend of mine. Hers was going out. This came at the perfect time. She is so impressed with it. She got it today(fast shipping too) and loves it. She says she cant wait to use it tomorrow. Cant say how wonderful it has been to deal with this seller!! Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with my HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron!  I have course, thick, frizzy hair and needed to find a straightener I could use quickly and efficiently.  I was a little nervous because the other straightener is the only brand I have ever used and was also used by my hair stylist. Now my hair feels great, is shiny and the plates are so smooth running over my hair-no pulling my hair out by the roots!  Best investment I ever made :)</li>
    <li> This straightener worked exactly as described. I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a [[ASIN:B003DKKQLC CHI Ionic Single Pass Ceramic Hairstyling Iron 1\\&quot;, Designer Chameleon]] and I had heard this one was comparable. It straightens my (super thick and curly) hair, but the minute I get into humidity the poof is back. That is more a reflection on the quality of my hair and not so much the product. However, I did notice that with the Chi&#x27;s silicone strip on their ionic straightener, I didn&#x27;t seem to have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, this is a great quality for the price and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My wife has been asking me to buy a Flat Iron for the last two month. Finally, a week back we got this delivered. She is really happy with it. She loves all the features, how it works and what is more important for me.. she is happy with her hair! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I got an email from the vendor and it looks really serious and good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This product works really well. Heats up fast and straightens hair quickly. I like the various settings for heat levels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands on my thick hair, and the HSI was by far the best one. I normally have to go over a section more than once, even with a high heat setting, and I hate the damage it does to my hair. The HSI made my hair perfectly smooth in just one pass, and it stayed straight and shiny. It was such a great price for a professional straightener like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped out quickly and arrived on time. Love it and would recommend it over any other brand!</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying I now buy practically everything from Amazon.  I can ALWAYS count on super fast delivery and great deals!!  I purchased this flat iron because of the reviews it received and the price.  I am happy to say I just love this product.  I have relatives that own the more expensive CHI flat iron and I know they wished they had saved their money and bought this one.  I can get my hair straight with just one pass with this flat iron and I&#x27;m no pro at using them.  Thank goodness it came with the glove because I have long hair and the glove protects my hand.  I would recommend the HSI flat iron over all of the flat irons out there!!!</li>
    <li> ive only used this once since i received but it made a huge improvement on my hair.  i have coarse frizzy straight hair and this iron really smoothed .  it out.  i have tried many anti-frizz products including loreal and nothing seemed to work so i saw the great reviews on this iron and had some money to burn and i bought it.  im glad i did.  i have never used a flat iron before but saw infomercials on them but they were too expensive so i never bought one.  this was a good price for getting started with one.  i am still experimenting with it (temperature) and getting used to it though.  would highly recommend if you have coarse frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This was just like the $75 ones and for way cheaper.  Seems high quality so far! No problems at all and we&#x27;ve had it for a few months.</li>
    <li> I bought this styler after reading multiple comments about hair irons being ruined after being plugged into European outlets, even when using a converter.  Rather than risking my expensive Chi, I bought this iron because it had the dual voltage capacity.  It worked great with only an outlet adapter.  Very close to my Chi.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron that would actually straighten my thick hair.  I have been so disappointed with previous flat irons I&#x27;ve had but can&#x27;t spend a lot of money on a fancy one (plus the one time I did spend over $100 on one, it only lasted a year).  After reading the other reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try, and I am very impressed.  It is perfect!  It has a nice long cord, a grippy texture so there&#x27;s no danger of it slipping out of your hands, and it heats up super quickly even when using at the highest heat.  It comes with a heat-resistant glove, travel pouch, and argan oil sample, which makes the price even more unbelievable.  Most importantly, it works really well.  I struggled doing curls and beach-y twists with my previous irons (they would look all crinkly, and the iron would slip off the hair), but this flat iron is impressive.  A few seconds per strand is all it takes to create beautiful, messy twists, and it also straightens hair wonderfully when I want a smoother look.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It seems to give me the same results as my hairdresser&#x27;s iron, and I know hers was several hundred dollars.  A great buy!!  I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I have had it for a couple of months now and it is working great.  It does take about 5 minutes to heat up and it is a little bulky, I have very small hands and short hair.  I can still manage it great!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. My hair is very fine and color treated. Most flat irons fry the ends and it looks&lt;br /&gt;like straw. Not with this! My hair is smooth straight and shiny. Highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old straightener just took too long to work.  This is a great product.  I came very nicely packaged.  It would be a perfect gift for Christmas or birthday or??.  It heats up fast and works great.  My hair is shiny and nice and it lasts until the next shampoo.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find a heat protective glove included!  Wow!  That is just what I needed and it WAS on my wish list.  Give this baby a try and think about Christmas gifts - never too soon to start!</li>
    <li> When I heard all of the hype about this flat iron I thought people were being overly dramatic, but when it came time to retire my old flat iron this one happened to be on sale and I took a chance. So glad I did. It heats up quickly and gets super hot, I don&#x27;t even need to use the highest setting like I usually do on most flat irons. In combination with the little mini bottle of Argan oil that comes in the package, my hair has never been so shiny, smooth, and soft after straightening; and it stays like that all day. I&#x27;ve been made a  believer and am so stoked that I decided to give this flat iron a try. Will also be purchasing the full size bottle of the Argan oil.</li>
    <li> This straightener is a great size so it is very portable, and the price cannot be beaten. It comes in an awesome package with a bottle of Argan Oil and a great velour case to hold the iron in once it has cooled down. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product. It is worth every penny if you have coarse or long hair.</li>
    <li> It definitely heats up quickly, but it does not work well on my hair. With other irons, I am able to both straighten and then curl my hair with two or three passes, this iron requires five or six exaggerated passes just to get my hair straight (and not even completely straight, I might add). The plates snag my hair, it doesn&#x27;t glide over the hair nicely. I could see this being a great iron for other hair types, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. Heats up quick and really works. The straightest my hair has ever been! It is the perfect width -- you aren&#x27;t doing one hair at a time but its also not clunky. I  love the glove that comes with it, no more scorching your finger tips and it comes with a nice sleeve to put it in after you are done. Also good for putting under while it hot, so no fears of scorching your counter top.</li>
    <li> Christmas for a teenage girl.  Was she ever happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product since I got it. And very satisfy .... just as I expected after reading the great reviews on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a chi and paid over $120. I didnt want to spend that much but wanted really good quality. This straightener is both. Works very well, heats quickly and evenly and fits those who are budget conscious.</li>
    <li> This iron is the best, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on buying so far this iron is the best. I like the fact that it has a glove including a little bag. Trust me this iron is worth the money that it cost.</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener!  I&#x27;ve tried a couple different ones and this one is super nice.  It has plastic on the outside so you can touch it while you&#x27;re straightening your hair!  It&#x27;s super!</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple flat irons and this is the first one that I can hands down look forward to using. I use it daily and I find that I can get every style I want. I no longer use my curler as this does a better job as well. Very impressed and would recommend!</li>
    <li> I overpaid for this product by almost double.  The next day it was half off.  Not a good business strategy. Did I get some money back?  No.</li>
    <li> After years of just buying cheap flat irons I finally decided that I needed to take better care of my hair and use a ceramic flat iron.  After reading reviews I ordered the HSI flat iron.  I have not regretted this purchase.  My hair is extremely thick and stubborn with partially natural waves.  This flat iron leaves my hair shiny, without the split end looking style and my hair doesn&#x27;t revert back to its waviness as soon as I step out of the door.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, frizzy hair and have went thru several straighteners.  I wanted a CHI but then seen this one and thought I&#x27;d give it a try and it has a better price tag.  So far, it has performed well considering my type of hair.  It does better than any of the \\&quot;store bought\\&quot; straighteners I&#x27;ve been thru that are the same price or more.  I do wish it had a safety shut off.  All in all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> First one worked so well that I had to buy another one because my daughter was always stealing mine!  Thanks...great service and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, as other reviews have said, it works as well as the irons that cost hundreds of dollars.  There was a small snafu with my order and the company could not have been more responsive and solved my issue immediately.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> When my daughter used this for the first time with her friends they were wowed !&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product. I have curly curly hair and it works well</li>
    <li> Recently switched from my Cricket flat iron to the HSI flat iron and it is 1000 times better! It straightens my hair so much better and faster without breaking it. My hair is shiny and the style lasts a lot longer than with my previous flat iron. Awesome iron for less than I paid for the Cricket. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had an auto shut off like my Cricket in case you forget to unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** After using it for about a year, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t heating like it used to. Now it has been two years and I have to have it on the highest heat setting just to use it. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as it did within the first year. I&#x27;m looking for a new one and just might spend $150 to have one that lasts.</li>
    <li> I had a CHI flat iron for 6 years. I swore by it. It finally broke and I didn&#x27;t have $150 to replace it. I read tge reviews on the HSI and decided to give it a try. It is amazing! I will never buy a CHI again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my new flat iron. Came in a gorgeous red box with a sample argan oil and thermal glove. What a treat for my self. Can&#x27;t believe I only paid 40 bucks. Just go a head and buy buy buy!! Bought from bluenovelties,great seller!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Leaves my hair silky soft</li>
    <li> I love this straightner. I was heart broken when my chi died but didn&#x27;t want to spend another $100 on a straightner so I gave this one a try and it works just as well or better. I love that you can adjust the temperature of the iron to you liking.</li>
    <li> Opening the box was an exciting adventure:&lt;br /&gt;-Satin Bag with light flee-like material as a liner&lt;br /&gt;-The flat iron inside the satin bag&lt;br /&gt;-5ml of Argan Hair Oil&lt;br /&gt;-A glove (What!!! A glove to protect your hand. Wow. Not sure I&#x27;ll use it much, but very thoughtful.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait to use the flat iron. The flat iron itself is equipped with:&lt;br /&gt;-On/Off button&lt;br /&gt;-Dail to increase or decrease the temperature&lt;br /&gt;-Indicator light on the side to let you know when its ready or at the set temperature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Heats up Quick! And my hair didn&#x27;t seem to snag like it often did when using my T3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair defrizzed and silky smooth and ends didn&#x27;t seem to feel fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was convinced that when I lost my T3 (cost $200) due to a blow up in Barcelona, that&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go back and buy another T3. But so far, I&#x27;m glad I chose to try something new.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron after I broke my old iron.  Breaking the old one was a blessing in disguise.  I love this iron.  My hair looks great after using it for the first time.</li>
    <li> Flat iron heats up super fast and works great. Maintains the heat well. Comes with a handy light that lets you know when it&#x27;s at the heat selected, green, or the heat has gone down a little, red, and you need to give it a moment or two to heat back up to the temperature selected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> perfect! Seller is amazing</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you use the UV lamp.  I was conscious of the added damage to my skin until I stumbled across this item.  It prevents wrinkles and those ugly dark spots, so you can keep your hands pretty.  I even bring them to the salon when I get my nails professionally done.  Wish all salons would offer these, because I often get asked from their clients where to get them.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my hair type (thick, wavy-ish hair that is somewhat coarse in the back), and straightens it quickly and smoothly. It&#x27;s a great price too-I don&#x27;t think you can find another hair straightener on the market right now for less than forty dollars of comparable quality to the HSI ceramic flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, thanks to Amazon for the extremely fast delivery-I placed my order on Friday and it came Monday morning. I don&#x27;t even have Prime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very impressed with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy construction and great overall quality. Its not some cheap plastic that my old straighteners were made of that cracked and broke after some use. You wont even have to crunch press your hair in between the straightener for it to do its job like some other straighteners. For only $40, this is meant to last and will outdo the majority of the other straighteners out there. Spend 20$ for a OK item that might break in a few months and do a minimal good job, or get THIS for 40$ and it will last you for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product and especially for the price. I&#x27;ve always used the Chi but thought I&#x27;d give another straightener a try. The HSI straightens like a Chi, maybe even better. I would highly recommend this straightener!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life, It heats up quick and get my thick natural hair straight within minutes. Its best to use oil ( argan, coconut,etc.) so the heat can get the hair really straight. I loved it so much my mom bought one and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing!! It leaves my hair super straight and shiny! I mostly wanted it because it can also curl hair. It does an amazing job curling! I am so happy with this straightener!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is my favorite! The price is extremely good and the product is very high quality. I have thick, long, wavy hair and it straightens my hair perfectly! It works just as good, if not better, than my previous $80 straightener!</li>
    <li> So surprised by the HSI, it was so affordable and works fabulously. I have always used CHI which I loved, but this is even better! I loved the extras included, pretty bag,  glove and the argon oil (my new favorite). Both me and my silky hair are very happy!</li>
    <li> I have been looking online for a straightener and finally found one at a good price. i received this item quickly and it was in great condition and was exactly what i wanted! i will shop from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold. Not to thin not to bulky just right. Heats up quickly and distributes heat evenly. I would recommend it to a friend and will deffinetly buy it again should anything happen after time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my dying Chi.  I was skeptical at first (I mean, the cost was so much less!) but the positive reviews made me take a chance on it.  Wow - am I glad I got this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly hair that tends to get frizzy a lot. Think Monica in Barbados in \\&quot;Friends\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s me.  My previous straighteners (including the Chi) would straighten my hair fine, but then, whenever it was a humid day, I&#x27;d end up with \\&quot;puffy straight\\&quot; hair later in the day.  That&#x27;s not the case with this HSI.  My hair looks smooth and silky for 2 days straight!  I use it after I blow dry my hair (and you should see that frizz ball...) and then I touch up my hair the next day with it, since I wash my hair every other day.  The straightened style stays that way for those 2 days.  It&#x27;s awesome.  I am also able to use this HSI to flip my hair out at the ends, if I feel like it, or flip it down, if I want a different look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the temperature settings on it as well, my other straightening irons did not have that.  It was either on or off, you had no control over the temperature.  When I am just touching up the ends, I don&#x27;t need to have it on scorching hot, so I like this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing - try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I won&#x27;t be going back to a Chi anymore.  The seller was great, too - delivery was faster than promised!  Bonus!</li>
    <li> I got this hair straightener about 3 months ago. The great review that it has and the acceptable price are the reasons I decided to buy this one over some other brands like CHI. It is a good one but not as good as I expected it to be. one of my friend bought a chi at the same time I got this and that is much better. the surface of it is kind of rough which hurts your hand at the beginning and if you increase the heat to some high level, it makes you hair so hot that you cannot touch it.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! It is amazing. I have owned it for a couple of months now (October 2012). I have very long (down to my waist) wavy hair that tangles. This straightener works just as well as salon straighteners that my hair stylist uses. I recently bought a Regis straightener, which broke about 6 months after using it (daily). It was over $100. This straightener is a much better price and works just as well, if not better. I will keep using it. If it breaks like the Regis straightener, I will update this review, but I doubt that it will. I usually use Unite 7 detangler (best leave in conditioner ever!), brush any tangles out, blow dry my hair for added volume, then straighten.</li>
    <li> I love how easy I can curl my hair with this! And straighten it too. Better than my chi. I also love the case that comes with it because it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
    <li> Works great.Makes for great straightner for on the road. Daughter used when home and she liked it and she&#x27;s picky about her hair. Wish would come out with 2 inch version.</li>
    <li> I use this straightener over my $300.00 straightener everyday. It was a great deal on top of how efficant it is. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! Seems to be of very high quality. It really is very nice! Heats up really fast and gets HOT! I love it!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Heats quickly works very well even on my thick and wavy hair... Great deal for this price!!!</li>
    <li> gloves are easy on/off, fit well but giving material which fits different hand types. They cover your hands right down to your nails so your skin isn&#x27;t exposed to the UV light.  I definitely recommend using them when having your nails done at a salon or at home.</li>
    <li> this flat iron is very sturdy and gets very hot! I think this flat iron works better that the Chi i have been using. The price is great! My only suggestion is that they install an auto shut off timer.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how this was going to do as it was on sale and fairly cheap. It exceeded our expectations and we have been very pleased with it. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell like it&#x27;s burning and does a really good job of straightening hair without pulling it out or leaving kinks. The oil that is included with the package is a great deal and leaves your hair super shiney!!!</li>
    <li> Does a great job straightening my hair. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I was also impressed with the storage pouch that came with my hair straightener.</li>
    <li> Great price fast delivery. Excellent straightener. I recommend  this hair tool for women with hard to straighten hair.  It heats up quickly and feels like a well crated tool.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item after borrowing my moms. This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I was not sure about purchasing as I had never heard of HSI before. I decided to go ahead after reading the reviews praying they were right. They were! It&#x27;s wonderful. I can straighten &amp; curl with it. It doesn&#x27;t pull &amp; gets plenty hot! I love it. I have very Hard To Manage Hair (thick &amp; used to be curly not sure what it is anymore!)&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs UP. If it had 6 stars I would give it one more. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bought for my girlfriend so these are her words:&lt;br /&gt;Have used for a couple weeks now and I have to say this is an excellent product that came with a nice accessory package - hest resistant glove, Argan hair oil and a very nice drawstring pouch. Heats up quickly and works like a charm. Would highly recommend at this price or even twice as much.</li>
    <li> Sorry I ordered this...only last a year, then plates started coming apart!</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with my HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener. It is by far, the most efficient hair straightener I have purchased to date and I am able to do my hair in half the time I once was. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many flat irons and this one does an excellent job for the price (I used a CHI iron before this one - equally good). Heats up quickly, lightweight, easy to use. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Honestly, by far these are the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever had..I really loved how good they straightened and curled..they gave me beautiful curls and when I wanted my hair straight it straightened right up..they didnt burn my hair or leave that burnt smell..I plan on purchasing from them in the future..and i received my item in two days..</li>
    <li> I was going to spend a LOT more money through HSN for a CHI flat iron with the same options as this Flat Iron and i was gonna pay 4 flex pays and each one would have cost almost as much as the total price of this item. I have VERY thick, coarse wavy hair... It is EXTREMELY resistant to any form of straightening... dry coarse texture...  and ive always wanted long hair but couldnt have it without using a STRONG relaxer which destroyed my hair... left it in a suspended state of China Doll straight with NO other options...  well i;ve been growing my hair out for many months..  I have had to fight it tooth and nail.. multiple salon hair cuts to tame it.. I use a LOT of straightening products and on occasion.. yuck.. strong chemical relaxers you need a gas mask and hazmat suit to use... switched to a chi smoothing relaxer..  smoothed but did NOT straighten hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well i think i can TOSS a lot of that out now that i have my HSI. I put a lil of the Argan oil sample in my hair.  Heated up the iron and gave it a go without overly high expectations. In 20 minutes i had my shiny, silky. and Pin straight!!!  and no heat damage.. I was SHOCKED that this 40 dollar iron had all these options and worked so well I had to struggle so much with my hair before,but NO MORE!! The packaging is top notch as well..  and the storage bag is to die for. Also the Argan Oil is a MIRACLE serum... When i say miracle im not kidding..  God actually answered my years of praying for my hair to cooperate... its always been a love hate thing .. its SO much better than anything containing any type of silicone and i will be ordering a 4oz bottle of the HSI Argan Oil as a compliment for sure.. I currently use Chi Silk Serum.. while it is effective..  it does NOT come into the league of the HSI Argan Oil... it may be expensive for the oil but you get what you pay for... it doesn&#x27;t take a lot.. I know my own hair texture and i can guarantee with the HSI iron it WILL close the cuticle.. make it soft.. shiny..  I haven&#x27;t even used my Expensive Chi Hairspray.. dont seem to need it.. hair moves naturally and then back in place..  In the past i had to layer my hair in smoothing and holding products..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve Never been happier with a hair tool and i&#x27;ve had MANY.. and i still just cant get over the price.... I&#x27;m a man but I&#x27;ve been in the company of a LOT of stylists and designers and h ave access to high end products.. but i hate always having to beg them to style my hair and then its gone once the nights over like Cinderella.. i pay much more for a cut and style at the salon than i paid for this Flat Iron.  Also no more next day disappointment after the salon when i cant replicate what the stylist did ,, because with my HSI i CAN replicate it :) quite easily and quickly actually.. Also I color my hair EVERY 4-6 weeks... i colored my hair a week ago and i wasnt thrilled with it.. well the combination of this Iron and The Argan Oil my my level 4 chocolate brown color brilliant and luminous..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the plates are of high quality.. very sturdy.. smooth.. i can tell they are very hard and also they FLOAT.. this is an IMPORTANT feature ladies and Gents who consider their hair their crowning glory. Since they \\&quot;float\\&quot; and move with your hair and rotate.. the iron is very easy to use and versatile depending on what you want to do with it.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong i have an ENTIRE line of CHI products and already own one of their flat irons. Im a die hard Chi fan...  but you really oughta give this bargain of an item a try.  I will always love CHI but  i am VERY interested to see what HSI begins to do with its product line... though i only needed the iron and the Argan oil and i REALLY like that the Oil is Natural...  penetrates my hair.. unlike my other products which are mostly silicone based and layer up and sometimes actually seem to dry my hair. I knew the argon oil was superior the second i flattend the first section of hair.  I saw some steam but it made no sound.. and and pulled iron straight through and unlike with my other iron with no floating plates i flipped under at the end of section all in one motion...  The section was flawless.. no second or third run through.  and shiny.. very shiny.  Also my style has lasted a few days ;-)de no sound.. and and pulled iron straight through and unlike with my other iron with no floating plates i flipped under at the end of section all in one motion...  The section was flawless.. no second or third run through.  and shiny.. very shiny.  Also my style has lasted a few days ;-)</li>
    <li> I was using a CHI before switching to this straightener (I only bought it because of the awesome price &amp; the great reviews).  I&#x27;m so glad that I bought it, I love it much more than my CHI!  :)</li>
    <li> Product is average (2.5/5) at best. Got an extra half star because it makes my hair shiny, when I finally finish straightening it. This iron doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to handle my thick, coarse South Asian hair. Even at the highest setting, I need to go over hair 2-3 times before getting the desired straightness. I would get the same result with an iron bought from a major retailer for half the cost. Haven&#x27;t tried the Argan oil, which will make it easier to return. Don&#x27;t bother with this iron if your hair is thick and on the coarser side.</li>
    <li> I received my HSI  &amp; I couldnt believe they were as great for the price. However I have been convinced you dont have to pay alot to receive a good product. I had been using CHI irons and was thinking about buying some FHI, however I am a new HSI user from here on out and I am telling all of my firends.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my hair I love it! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a flat iron. I like it better than my chi.</li>
    <li> After receiving this straightener as I was using it I loved it because it straightens my hair so nice and leaves it so smooth. My hair has never been so straight i recommend this tool for any type of hair and i hope you love it as much as i do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron after having a chi iron for about 8 years. I researched reviews on this product and made the decision to buy it based on the reviews and the price. I have been very satisfied with my flat iron after using it for about one week. My hair is much easier to style and manage. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t take long to heat and does an amazing job. i have thick, frizzy, curly hair and this straightens it in 30 minutes compared to my usual hour and a half with a $40 store bought straightener. i only have to go over one section of hair once! a steal for only $39.99 on sale!</li>
    <li> Better than I could have hoped for!!  Best flat iron that I have ever purchased. It heats up super fast and leaves hair smooth and silky, can even and a flip up or down for flare. Shipped and rec&#x27;d within 3 days.  If your thinking about purchasing this iron, do it - you&#x27;ll be extremely glad you did!!</li>
    <li> I have had this Flat iron for a little over a year &amp; it is starting to not get as hot as it used too.  I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron from the seller Blue Novelties for those who would like to know.I had never heard about this iron before, but I am so happy with it. I have 3C curls with a LOT of frizz and this iron gets my hair the straightest it&#x27;s EVER been in one pass! Yes it has to reheat for half a second every now and then, big whoop. It took 20 minutes to flat iron my hair where it used to take over 2 hours! On top of that, the company was so nice, mine was missing the argan oil, they replied to me within 3 hours on a sunday which was a holiday! Not only are they replacing my missing argan oil, but they&#x27;re sending me a second bottle of argan oil at no charge. To those of you complaining about the company, you should just email them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floating plates are 100% ceramic tourmaline. They don&#x27;t tug or rip at your hair. It heats up a little slow, however, this iron makes straightening my curly crazy hair so fast that doesn&#x27;t even matter. My only dislike of this iron is that the temperature dial isn&#x27;t labeled all the way around, you kinda have to guess, and it&#x27;s a little hard to get at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously for $39.99 (price I paid) for such a high quality flat iron, how can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this brand before and noticed it when searching for flat irons on Amazon.. I got this because my CHI just wasn&#x27;t doing the job and it got great reviews and the price was right.. This flat iron straightens my thick, frizzy, horse&#x27;s mane hair like a champ! Very happy with it! And the sample oil the comes with it smells amazing and makes my hair super soft..</li>
    <li> I accidentally left this on for 2 days (I&#x27;m not proud of it) and it didn&#x27;t do any damage to the straightener or anything around it! It didn&#x27;t even smoulder! I felt very stupid for leaving it on but thankful that I spent the extra buck for a good straightener!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this, but it won&#x27;t turn on. I shipped it back for a refund today.</li>
    <li> This product is great! The price is right and the product works flawlessly, I have had the same flat iron for years now, so it was time for a new one. Skeptical at first, but I am slowing loving it more and more! Great product for the price!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great. I can straighten my hair in half the time it used to take me with my old iron. My hair is soft and not dried out afterwards. I plan to purchase another one for a Gift soon. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a flat iron at a great price that does a great job.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to replace another model that had broken.  It is very sturdy and I love that you can adjust the temperature.  In fact, I like it better than my $100 CHI. I should have purchased one for myself!</li>
    <li> Bought for wife for xmas. And she loves it. Great product</li>
    <li> The best flat iron ever, Love it!</li>
    <li> We got this for a good price and it heats up fast and it presses well. I enjoy this ceramic hair straightener</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron/hair styler.  First of all, I received it very quickly (in 2 days, I think) and the packaging was very nicely secure in a box with the Amazon logo on the outer box.  The box that actually contained the styler was not damaged and actually had the serial numbers on the outside of it to register the product (which I did about a week after I received it). I opened the box to find a beautiful red bag, a glove (reminded me of the Michael Jackson glove wearing era) and a little sample bottle of the Argon oil (which is fabulous!) as well as the styler, of course.  Hands down this is the best flat iron I have ever used, point blank and the period!!! I totally ditched the one I was using which was from Sally&#x27;s that I paid $80 for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used if for the first time, I could not believe how shiny, smooth, silky and bouncy it leaves my hair.  I am African American with medium wavy/curler hair naturally however, I do have it relaxed and colored  so I do not need to turn the heat up to the highest capacity; I use it at about 350 degrees. Which leads me to the only thing I could say that could be an improvement, digital readout of the temperature.  Other than that, it is a great flat iron.  The heat in this HSI Styler is so evenly distributed and it does not smoke, like all of the other flat irons that I have used.  I want to purchase another one just to have a back up.  In a nutshell, I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay my hair is really curly. I have to go over it 3 to 4 time it get it straight but I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great , I have thick long hair and the time to straighten is almost half than my old one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed that this is much better than my old hair straightener that I had used for a couple of years. It usually takes me 30 minutes to straighten my wavy long and thick hair, but now, with this ceramic tourmaline hair straightener, it takes me less time to straighten my hair! Plus my hair feels lighter and smoother. I also use the Argan oil that&#x27;s included in the package and it adds a more smooth texture on my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was always wanting to straighten my hair but was uncertain which iron to buy.  I love this iron.  I feel safe using this, that it won&#x27;t damage my hair.  My hair looks great after I straighten it with this flat iron.  It&#x27;s so easy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many. This one was just average and took awhile to heat up. I have thick hair but already straight permed.</li>
    <li> Amazing product my GF is extremely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! I also love that the straighter comes with a bag to put it in when traveling or whenever and a glove and a sample of Argan oil. The thing I especially love about this is that it never pulls my hair out, and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in this one and hurt! That was an issue I had with my previous straightener. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great straightener...shuts off on me quite often, like an automatic cool down thing, then goes green again. My hair might be to thick for this, takes a lot for a real sleek look, I&#x27;m African Anerican with 13&amp;#34; of thick kinky curly hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. I have tried several but this one works great and is a fantastic deal.  I would recommend it to anyone!  It is rounded on the side of the ceramic heating plate and does a great job curling too!</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron, better than Chi. Came with protective glove and Argan oil which is incredible! I get compliments on my hair all the time when I use it!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best flat iron I have ever used! I will buy an extra for myself and one for each of my daughters. My fair was soooo soft after using this iron and beautifully straight. Great buy at any cost</li>
    <li> This is great! it doesn&#x27;t burn hair, and it works great for sealing keratin cure treatment.</li>
    <li> I like this STRAIGHTENER</li>
    <li> Awful! Doesn&#x27;t get hot at all! I ended up taking my broken sedu straightener out of the trash and using that to straighten my hair! This didn&#x27;t work at all. I will be returning it and spending the extra money on a new sedu straightener!</li>
    <li> Product works great on me and my two daughters.  We all have very thick hair and this does a great job.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and most have been positive but a few negative. Thought the Positives out weight the Negatives....was I wrong. My wife had the flat iron set to medium and the iron&#x27;s light went green for about 10 seconds and never went green again. Even with the temp set to MAX it never got hot enough. We are sending this thing back and never buying HSI again.</li>
    <li> A gift for my picky daughter...she raves about this straightener.  two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I received a used one so had to send it back for a replacement.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet because it&#x27;s a gift.</li>
    <li> The product is GREAT. The item arrived exactly on the day they said it would. And I absoloutely love it.</li>
    <li> Works very well and quickly gets the job done. Comes with a very nice sleeve for it and some great heat-protected gloves as well. Worth the purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron when my Chi finally gave up, as it looked like a respectable substitute and was quite a bit less expensive. It was a good choice. It&#x27;s a great iron, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for some time now. Heats fast and hot, feels solid and well made. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I can&#x27;t see the on-light as well as the Chi from the low angle of my counter, and have left irons on a few times in the past (Chi included). Aside from that minor issue, I&#x27;m very pleased with the HSI iron and would certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the smallest and best I have used so far. It worked really well on my thick hair and my mom&#x27;s crazily thick hair.</li>
    <li> For a price of 40$ i get a ceramic straightener that comes with a glove (which ive never heard of before or seen) AND argan oil. im so happy with this lightweight good quality straightener that comes with adjustable heat settings and it gets my hair straight with one take. fast shipping and good communication.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair straightener and read all the reviews, and decided to buy this on.  The price was right, and I really like it.  I also bought one for my daughter.  It arrived before schedule, I was impressed.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!  I don&#x27;t know why this got good reviews.  This is terrible and I&#x27;m returning it.  It is very rough on the hair and doesn&#x27;t slide over the hair easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who has wanted a CHI for some time, but because of cost, has had several $20-30 flat irons.  She is thrilled with this appliance and it was a fraction of what we would have spent for another brand.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I Like the temperature control, as I can turn it up for me and turn it down for my six year old.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfy will my HSI flat iron.  It straightens my hair in less time, lessens heat damage to the hair with less time.  I will recommend this product to others to buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I highly recomend it. It curls and straightens well and heats up well to straighten even thick hair. I like this better than my last straightner that I paid nearly 100$ for. This one I got for only 37.99!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in time before the holidays and is good quality. I just wish the temperature gauge was digital vs. the dial temp. gauge. Good price for the product.</li>
    <li> I dont write reviews but this one definitely deserves one! I was hesitant about the quality for the price but this flat iron is simply amazing! Straightened my ridiculously thick/wavy hair in no time and took out all the bumps. Plus it curls! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Works well, heats up quickly, solidly made, comfortable in my hands, comes with nice storage pouch. Nice product for the money. I do wish it would shut itself off after a period of time though because I forget.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the product</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that is hard to straighten. This flat iron works great! Leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> This is my second iron.I used other one for long time. I bought this one because of the positive reviews. however,,it doesnt make my hair straight that much.&lt;br /&gt;I usually can make my hair shiny shiny straight when I use iron. But this one didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know why but may be temper chart is low.</li>
    <li> I love the straightener. It works wonders on my hair. Most straighteners leave my hair feeling kind of dry. The argan oil, however, is an awesome addition! It leaves my hair feeling smooth and not dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it shipped very quickly, before the date they initially said. The box the product came in is also very nifty. I love that it came with a glove as well, although I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll use it because most straighteners can almost burn your skin, but I haven&#x27;t had that issue with the HSI, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Five stars!</li>
    <li> This is the first hair straightener I have ever bought. I wanted one that would straighten and curl/flip the ends. this one does of those things and does it well.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, highlighted blond hair. I use this iron with the HSI argan oil sample they sent with it, plus Oribe royal blow out and my hair looks fab.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and is easy to use. I think the price is wonderful, I would imagine it&#x27;s just as good at the chi or other really expensive brands. I could never justify&lt;br /&gt;spending over $50 on something like this, and this straightener was the perfect choice for me because of the quality and the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend you purchase it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift. It is a great product and the best straightener she has ever used. Only criticism would be about the weird placement of the On/Off and temperature switch; which is located right next to the heating plates... careful if you need to change the temperature or when turn it off, you can get burned easily. Other than that it is a great deal!</li>
    <li> I saw this flat iron advertised on another website.  It was on sale through Amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d take a look.  I read the reviews &amp; decided to take a chance on this flat iron.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The HSI just replaced my 3 year old flat iron &amp; is similar to what I was use to using.  I like the way it slides down my hair without pulling.  I also like the temperature setting.  The travel bag is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Just received my HSI Hair straightener today and the first thing that I did my tried it on my hair. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. It definitely leaves your hair looking very nice and silky, unlike other previous hair straighteners that I&#x27;ve owned. So far so good. If ever this hair straightener breaks or something, I&#x27;d definitely buy another HSI straightener.</li>
    <li> Wife is a hairstylist and needed a new flatiron. Her main requirement was a small form factor, because with her clientele, she needs to be able to get the iron close to the scalp without burning. This flat iron fit the bill and she&#x27;s been happy using it so far. I have to say I&#x27;m not really adept at the usage of the flatiron, but the finish is a really high quality, hard rubberized texture. I myself am a fan of high quality electronics and I would say the design of this flatiron, compared to the ones she previously owned, is superb. Kind of motorola razr-ish.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for just about a month now, and I really like it. It gives me long-lasting results and leaves my hair silky smooth. I am, quite literally, addicted to using it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Heats and cools quickly, works fantastic. Salon quality, I believe my hairstylist even has the same one?  I would recommend to anyone with any type hair.</li>
    <li> I recieved them in like 3 days. I actually love the flat irons. They work great. They also get hot in seconds... im very impressed!</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used instyler (Broke before a year of use), I&#x27;ve bought different types from walmart, target, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found a good straightener for my thick, curly hair until i found this one. I really like it because it&#x27;s easy to you and works like a machine. The smaller sections you go over the better the results.</li>
    <li> great flat iron! i have been using the chi for at least 10 years and it finally broke-i decided to try this product because it was a lot less expensive and had great reviews! will never pay $140 for a chi again. Would definately consider an hsi if youre looking for a great flat iron!</li>
    <li> The style, ease of use and the results. Are really nice! The packaging also gave you a sense high quality and great design and thought put into this product. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Looking for a flat iron I was a little bit skeptical because my CHI had recently started having problems. For how expensive the CHI is I expected it to last me longer than it did but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. So I found this one and read the reviews and it seemed to be about 80% of the reviews about this product were positive and the other 20% were negative. But I decided to give it a try anyways because it had everything I wanted. So I get my package in a VERY timely manner (fastest I&#x27;ve ever gotten an Amazon package) and very friendly customer service and tried it out that day. My hair looked amazing!! I perm my hair and haven&#x27;t gotten a perm in about a month but friends will ask me if I just recently got a perm when I straighten my hair with this flat iron. It&#x27;s an amazing product and an amazing price. This is for sure the flat iron for me and if anything were to happen with the one I currently have, I would buy another just like it.</li>
    <li> I have owned several straighteners,but this is by far the best one yet. I have had 2 professional flat irons that cost over $100 each and they did not heat up or straighten as good as this one.. I hope to get lots of use from this!</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve been a loyal Chi user, but when my last Chi went out I decided to order the HSI based on the great reviews and lower price. I received my HSI last week, and it&#x27;s just okay. It gets the job done, but I think I like my Chi better.  The HSI doesn&#x27;t run smoothly over my hair like my Chi did...it kind of pulls.  Also, although it&#x27;s nice that it has temperature control, I find that I have to crank the heat way up to get the same results I got with the Chi (I have course, wavy hair). Also, it would be nice if you knew exactly what temperature you were setting it to as the dial doesn&#x27;t have numbers on it.  Also, it&#x27;s pretty heavy.  One thing I do like is that I can get closer to my roots without burning my scalp, like I did so many times with the Chi. Overall, it&#x27;s not bad for the price but next time I&#x27;m in the market for a new flat iron, I think I&#x27;m going back to the Chi.</li>
    <li> Product heats up quickly and works great . Easy to handle.  Hair treatment that came with the straightener makes your hair feel like silk. Have been a CHI user for years, but  I like this one much better.  Shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> love it! great price. bought for my preteen daughter as a gift. perfect fit for her!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good flat iron for some time and have bought several from beauty supply houses that never really worked as well as the one my stylist would use on my hair.  I liked the features of the HSI and decided to give it try.  I have been nothing but pleased with my purchase!  I can create the same styles as my stylist in addition this iron will also curl or flip your hair!  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I tried 2 different straightners from Walmart and they did not work correctly. The hot plates did not go together flush and they just felt cheap. The HSI straightners plates go together flush and it is a very sturdy quality product. I wanted a straightner to curl my hair like my hairdresser does at the salon. This one does the job. I have fine straight hair and my curls last all day, and the curls are a million times better than the curls from a curling iron. I can even sleep on them and have curly hair the next day! This is a great product and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. It adjusts to different temperatures and keeps my hair silky.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this hair straightener so far. I cannot believe how healthy my hair is after using it!  It really works the way it says it will.</li>
    <li> loving it. couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad.  It does it&#x27;s job.  It does get extremely hot! I have already burned my fingers on it.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more then $40 for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair and it will curl my hair pretty well.  But Like I said you need to be careful with the heat because you don&#x27;t wanna burn your fingers or your hair.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! This looks nice but it snags your hair and doesn&#x27;t really have that smooth action I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail tonight. My old straightener broke so I was in a hurry to get a new one. Won&#x27;t turn on at all, extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this straightener since my Chi broke. I read the reviews and the price was right so I wanted to try it. So far it is better than the Chi! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> It was good with the price. I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first purchase on flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;It works good to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend and she loved it! She is African American and has coarse natural hair. She says that the flat iron made her hair soft, straight, and smooth!</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener as a surprise for my wife.  She loves it, says just one pass through her hair and it&#x27;s straight.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, makes my hair nice and silky... I&#x27;m African American and have really long hair, I also have two daughters with long hair and this iron did the wonders for us. I will be ordering two more for my girls, because they love it so much. Great product at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I bought this in June of 2011 (last year). I have thick frizzy hair. It worked okay for the first few weeks. The light would turn green to let me know it was hot enough. The green light feature quit working about a month after I bought it.  I moved right around the time I purchased it, so I thought maybe the change in climate was the reason my hair wasn&#x27;t getting as straight as with my previous iron. It wasn&#x27;t until I got my hair cut recently and the hairdresser used a flat iron that made my hair silky-smooth that I remembered how a flat iron is supposed to work. This iron straightens a little, but it doesn&#x27;t really do away with frizz like a good flat iron should and can do.</li>
    <li> Eventough I don&#x27;t have curly hair, it&#x27;s been hard for me to find an iron that gets my hair straightened cleanly. This iron worked really well, heats fast, and has a fair price.</li>
    <li> This straightener is AWESOME! I have very curly hair and I get great results in super quick time. I have been struggling with an inferior straightener and wish I&#x27;d got this one earlier. I don&#x27;t even use the hottest setting - it does the job without it so I feel like it is gentler on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the customer service is fantastic. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying this product, as I have always been a chi owner/user. I must say that this product exceeded my expectations! My only complaint is that is is a bit more weighty than the chi, but definitely works as well for nearly half the cost. Will purchase this product again, and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Excellent item 1st !! Flat hair immediately!</li>
    <li> I owned this flat iron for approximately 3 years and I was very pleased with it in all of that time. The flat iron was very well constructed and heated very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The coating on the iron seemed to add an extra layer of protection against the heat and my hair.</li>
    <li> I think so! I was amazed at how shiny and frizz-free my hair was. And this is only with passing the iron only once through my hair? And thanks fir the sample of Argan oil. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, works great on my hair!  So glad I purchaed it, I can definitely tell a difference in my since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have used many store bought flat irons before and have always been mad at wasting the $20-50 for each one. Many have damaged my hair and don&#x27;t work as well as the ones at the salon. I got this one on sale from Amazon and was incredibly happy at how great it works. I no longer use any other flat iron and very few other curling irons. This one does it all, straighten or curl my hair, just like the salon. I could not be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t waste over $100 on a Chi or something similar. This straightener is great. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair every day and have used many different brands - by far this is the best one I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Just received my flat iron. It works great. I am really happy with the flat iron. I also received a free sample of hair treatment. The Flatiron comes with its own bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener after reading so many positive reviews, and they were definitely accurate!  My hair looks smooth and shiny when I use it.  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple months now and the ends of my hair are not split or fried like other straighteners I&#x27;ve used before.  I think it helps that it has the adjustable heat option.  The straightener also came with a case and a small bottle of Argan oil, which I had never used, but absolutely love!  Great product at a really good price.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this flat iron and its fabulous. I have fine hair and other flat iron burns it really bad but with this I put it on medium heat, my hair doesn&#x27;t even feel hot but it straighten it really good and it stays nice and soft. I have chi which is nice but hsi is much better. I tried the new advertised coolway and I hated it. This is the best fat iron ever. If any one is looking for flat iron this is it.</li>
    <li> I have terrible hair.  Frizzy. Unruly. Every day is a bad hair day for me.  I just tried this flat iron, and I can&#x27;t believe that my hair is straight, shiny and manageable.  It really works.  And if I can use it, anybody an use it.</li>
    <li> This product out performs any of my recent flat irons.  I actually dreaded flat ironing my hair every day, which I needed for one bubbled up spot on the back of my head.  Now, with my new iron, this is not a chore at all.  The iron is effective and efficient.  It leaves my hair much smoother than other irons I have used.  Now meeting my daily duty of flat ironing is not as discouraging to me. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Did not work well on my med/long, wavy hair. Had to go over hair many times to get straight. Unhappy with performance compared to previous flat irons.  Did not meet expectations.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moIG04L9OJDZ6X]]Firstly, sorry for the shaky camera, I was doing it on my cell phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this straightener so far-- granted, I&#x27;ve only used it the one time but they say the first impression is key and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightened my hair in no time, which was striking to me because I had spent the entire day with oddly air-dried, frizzy hair. This is the smoothest and shiniest my hair has been since I got it cut professionally, so it&#x27;s super exciting that I can achieve these results at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things of note:&lt;br /&gt;- The lights here are pointing to the ceiling, not directly at my head, so my hair is pretty shiny. (I seriously can&#x27;t stop turning my head and admiring that shine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have not yet tried the oil that was included, so I only anticipate this will get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped seeing some results helps you in your decision!</li>
    <li> Fiancé bought this for her sister for her birthday. Great quality for the money she said. It&#x27;s super less here than at Target btw.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I asked for it for my birthday and was surprised to see it. I have very, very fine, but soft hair. It reduced my frizz and springy dead ends drastically. I had a cheap straightener before and now will never buy any other brand again. Love this! (Hate the oil that came with, but the red satin case is amazing :)!)</li>
    <li> not the best! disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love love love!!!!! These are amazing! I flat ironed two of my friends hair with these and the result...flawless!(along with my Leo of course lol) but great product totally worth $300 but they are only 40$..what a steal!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly/wavy, long hair and I was able to straighten my hair in less than an hour. It usually takes me about 50 minutes to an hour. The products works really well and definitely good for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I am impressed with the HSI Ceramic flat iron.  Everyone was talking about another brand, but for the savings I took a chance on HSI.  I have used it several times with the argon oil and am so very pleased with the results.  It heats up fast, is very easy to handle and light weight.  I love the bright red storage bag too.  Most of all my hair is finally in controll from the frizzies. This product is a winner for my hair and my pocketbook.  Bonus:  It arrived 3 days ahead of schedule.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Product works very well for price. I have not owned a straightener for myself before. Decided to buy my own after I  started to borrow my daughters. I think I like hers a little more but it was more expensive.</li>
    <li> Way exceeds my expectations! My hair is so smooth and it curls great also. Love the hair serum that came with it also!!</li>
    <li> There were many things to like about the HSI Flat Iron.  First, the dial which allows the user to control temperature up to 410 degrees is helpful for those who are concerned with avoiding unnecessarily high temperatures, especially those with fine hair or dry hair, who don&#x27;t want exposure to more heat than necessary to get that sleek look.  I found that I used the HSI at the 410-degree setting.  Second, the light which indicates when the iron is ready to use is conveniently located on the outside where it&#x27;s easier to see than on other types of irons where it&#x27;s located inside.  This is helpful for safety reason as it is easier to spot the light on the outside to check that the unit is off.  Third, the indicator light shines red while heating and turns green when ready; couldn&#x27;t be easier.  And finally, I like the sleek black look of the unit and the design of the grip.  I would buy the HSI again if I had it to do over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived quickly and well-packed.  And the seller was very concerned I was happy with the purchase--all-in-all a very favorable experience.</li>
    <li> This ia wonderful well built &amp; easy to use hair straightner.  It works well with all hair types.  The product looks, feels, &amp; performs like an item with a much larger price tag.  I am glad I bought it &amp; would recommend it to all who are interested in straightening hair with an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing i recieved it earlier than i thought and it does wonders for my naturally curly hair. Ive spent lots of money on flat irons over the years this is by far one of the best!! And at a great price!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Highly recommend! Had a hard time turning it on but after resetting it a few times worked smoothly...speaking of the sample of argan oil also does wonders! This is my first straightener and am so glad I went with this- very easy to use for a newbie with very curly hair to use!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener after cutting about 6 inches off my hair, since my hair was no longer really long it wasn&#x27;t weighing it&#x27;s self down as much and was doing all sorts of crazy things. I wanted an awesome straightener and looked at Sephora and the prices were outrageous. This item appeared to have all same stuff as the expensive ones at sephora had and I figured for the price I should give it a shot! I received the straightener very quickly and used it immediately and was in love. I loved that it came with the heat resistant glove, it makes straightening easier and safer, and I really like the carrying case it came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener is fantastic, I love that I can adjust the temp and it straightens and curls with ease. I have very very thick hair, even if its not as long as it was, and doing anything with this much hair takes forever but this straightener is so powerful I don&#x27;t have to go over any of the parts more than once and it gets the job done quickly. I also have hair that dries out easily but these plates are as high quality as I was looking for and does not break or damage my hair. I am so happy with this product I would have paid a lot more for this straightener but I am most pleased with the price. Great Product and amazing price! I am very please!</li>
    <li> I loved my old flat iron, but it finally gave out so I bought this one. I think I like it even better than my old one. No problems at all.</li>
    <li> Works a lot better than my last one that would get too hot in my hands. It is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love my new straightener! Not only does it straight my hair really well but it also makes beautiful bouncy curls!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my teenage niece. The one she previously had was broken by her little sister and her mother had paid a pretty penny for it.  The product not only was delivered in the timeframe listed by Amazon, my niece was truly ecstatic to receive it as a gift and she absolutely loves it!  I would definitely purchase from Blue Novelties again.</li>
    <li> This is a salon quality flat iron that even an amateur can get great results from! Great product. I would highly recommend purchasing this item- you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Caught on sale and she loved it.  Heats up and does great job. Comes with nice sleeve and glove and bottle of hair serum.</li>
    <li> Abosuletly love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i saw the excellent reviews and i want it to try it.. Every review was RIGHT!! I love it.. I was using a very famous brand for more than 10 years because i didn&#x27;t trust any other brand. I was skeptical at first but after i use it for three weeks my mind change.. it leaves the hair very silky and looks great, it heats super fast and very easy to handle.. i have no problems at all.. I highly recommend this hair iron..IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR TOP LIST :):) ***** five stars**</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best straightener that I have even bought! I have fine hair and it is hard to find a product that I love for my hair. It is so smooth and my hair style last all day! Plus I love the HSI Argan Oil that came with the straightener. Great Product!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE so you can give it to your girlfriend/wife. It&#x27;s way better than a blower, and it gets hot IN 2 SECONDS!!</li>
    <li> I have used CHI in the past and decided to try this product since both of my CHI&#x27;s quit working. This product does a great job on my hair.</li>
    <li> WoW is all I can say!!!! I was way nervous to order but I am so glad I did! Bought it as a back up for my Amika... WoW this one is just likey Amika but better!!! LoVe the swivel cord, glove, oil and fancy travel bag! 😊</li>
    <li> At first glance, this product looks great. However, after using it, I am not completely impressed. First, the straightener takes a really long time to heat up and it also doesn&#x27;t get that hot. Second, the end of the plates catch my hair and break it, way more than my cheapo Revlon brand straightener. Also, I wish it did have a automatic shut off switch. My hair feels smooth afterwards, but I think it is just because of the sample oil that came with the product. Overall, I feel this straightener is average and wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I saw the reviews and I just got it used it once and dindt like it at al!!!!!!! I&#x27;m really disappointed my sister has a CHI and is much better and much littler I really didn&#x27;t like this one, the worse I can&#x27;t return it, I have a 4 month baby and can be spending money and not using products, very sad I live amazon hit this hs really a bad impression for me</li>
    <li> This package arrived right on time, as always with any purchase I have ever had with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this flat iron, my hair has been so sleek and shiny! I was nervouse because I am used to using a 2in flat iron, but the 1in works wonders on my super thick hair!  Plus, I couldn&#x27;t beat the price in comparison to other flat irons, however I believe this one works just as well as other more expensive products I have used.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best iron I have used on my daughters course hair. I don&#x27;t have to pull it through muliple times...it just works and no burn smell</li>
    <li> This is the BEST Flat Iron Hair Straightener I have found! The unit heats up quickly and provides a smooth iron without scorching. I love the cord length that allows free movement while smoothing my hair. I have used several other, more expensive irons, and this one is defiantly the best!</li>
    <li> It works great- heats up quickly and moves through hair smoothly.  I love it, I have wavy hair and it straightens my hair great, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a nice flat iron.  I am a natural blonde with mid-back length fine hair, but have recently made the change to coloring it red.  Any heat styling can cause the red pigment to fade faster, so I&#x27;m glad this iron flattens hair the first time.  I only need to go over it once!  It heats up fast and goes from low to over 400 very quickly.  With other irons that I had purchased from department stores, I was using the high setting, but I did not need to with this one. The iron has a good weight, not too heavy and not too light.  The plates are super smooth, and I haven&#x27;t had any pulling or catching of hairs.  The plates also have a little spring to them so when you squeeze the hair it puts the right amount of pressure on it.  The 1 inch width is perfect for me, wide enough to do my hair quickly, but not so wide that I couldn&#x27;t do my bangs easily too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a decently long cord that swivels to prevent tangles which is nice.  I would give it 5 stars except for the new safety fuse box added to the plug (test/reset buttons).  This makes it difficult to plug in a hairdryer and irons at the same time unless you have multiple electrical outlets or an adapter for adding a plug.  I also don&#x27;t need the satin case that comes with it, but some people might like it.  For the $39.99 I paid, this iron blows others completely out of the water.  Great value for that price!!</li>
    <li> Two years ago I gave my daughter a CHI hair straightener, which I have enjoyed using whenever I visit her.  I mentioned that I was thinking of purchasing one for myself.  She told me about the HSI straightener, which customers review as better than the CHI and it sells for less than the CHI.  A few days later she emailed an offer for the HSI;  I ordered one immediately, and have been nothing but pleased since.  It is an excellent product!  I especially like that the heat is adjustable, as I have thin fine hair.  My daughter recently visited and tried my new HSI straightener. She liked it better than her CHI, and plans on making her next straightener the HSI.</li>
    <li> Wife hated it at first because it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;Chi Air&amp;#34;, but this thing is the same product, but cheaper and with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned and the price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picking on straighteners and recently took my good Chi one to my workout facility and bought this for home.  It heats up super fast and hot and was phenomenal on my hair that is short and thick.</li>
    <li> This straighter is the best I have purchased. I have used it to straighten and curl my hair, and it has worked wonders!</li>
    <li> Iron is great and Blue Novelties has the best customer service.  I will do as much business there as I can!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Heats up super quickly, the carry bag is great for travel and keeping it safe away from my kids as it cools down, and it the different heat settings are a great option.</li>
    <li> Have only used it once but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I received the product on time.  So far the hair straightener has been great.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing. If you&#x27;re looking for a straightener which gives you salon-finish, then this is the one you want to buy! I compared Chi, Ghd, and Hsi which are the top 3 straighteners and picked this one because you really can&#x27;t beat the price. I haven&#x27;t tried the Argan oil yet but I use a Chi heat protecting hair spray and the results were magical. I am from India and have really wavy/curly hair and since I have a lot of volume along with the curls, no straightener could make my hair look really straight  or make it last for long especially in the summer time. This straightener not only gives my hair a salon-like look, but also lasts. The little bag and glove are a nice add on. Totally worth the money, and great product! I am going to buy more for my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in a few months!</li>
    <li> As this was bought as a gift, I don&#x27;t have first hand use knowledge with it. My daughter has been happy with it. Her hair looks great :) and there were no issues with packaging or shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This straightener is made very well.  Durable.  Does a great job!&lt;br /&gt;I actually received this package on a Sunday.  I was very pleased &amp; surprised!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product. It does not heat to a temp that will straighten my hair the way I want it.  I have tried other ceramic flat irons equal or lesser in value and had better results.</li>
    <li> I found this flat iron very hard to use.  I have very thick, wavy hair.  Not only didn&#x27;t it straighten it well, but it was very difficult to manipulate.  Even running it through several times, I still had frizz.  I found it heavy for me and the fact that the heat controls were on the inside between the blades was annoying.  I will admit, I am just starting to learn to use a flat iron, but I&#x27;ve used two others with better results.  I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars because it came with its own case, a heat resistant glove and some oil.  Other than that, I&#x27;d find a product that didn&#x27;t weigh so much unless you have very large, strong hands.</li>
    <li> One teeny complaint. The temperature dial is nearly impossible to get to, so changing settings while using the iron is not possible. So, I set it at about the halfway point and it&#x27;s perfect - not so hot that I&#x27;m afraid of it, but hot enough to do it&#x27;s job. I have a freakishly thick head of hair (so my stylist says) and if I don&#x27;t get it straightened fully, it gets springy and wavy. This iron is very comfortable and easy to use. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> While I was disappointed with the initial shipment, HSI Professional customer service was truly outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I notified them that the item was not performing as expected, they indicated it was a defective item and promptly offered to send out a replacement at no charge.  I have received the replacement and I love my new Elite Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your exceptional customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had this product for a couple of months and am very impressed.  I thought it was a great price for the package I got, and so far so good!</li>
    <li> A must get! Amazing flat iron! Dont think about it twice! I have had it for over a year!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  It&#x27;s very well made.  Feels solid.  Like the fact that I can adjust the temperature.  Since I have fine hair I set the temp a little lower.  The only problem I have with it is if I get my hair a little too close to the end of the iron a hair or two will get snagged/caught somehow.  I&#x27;ve learned to keep my hair in the center portion of the iron plates..</li>
    <li> It gets hot fast and does a nice job. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best flat iron I have ever owned but its not bad for the price point. It does grab at my hair and pull hairs out but if I have a large enough section of hair it is typically fine. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, I would probably go back to the BabyLiss.</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this one without hairdressers recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for a great product&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice cover and so far is everything I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying I don&#x27;t ever do reviews. I had a chi for 5 years and it finally broke and I needed to replace it without paying a ton of money. I read the reviews and had mixed feelings due to some saying it wasn&#x27;t that great and some saying that it pulled their hair. I found this straightener to be great. I have curly hair and it I can get it done in the same time it took me with my chi for a third of the price. I definitely recommend this and I am very picky about what I use on my hair. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, it does its job well. I only gave it four stars because it catches the hair at times and that can be annoying.</li>
    <li> This straightener does a wonderful job leaving my hair very soft... I jus want to mention one thing, I did not have any trouble with the straightener&#x27;s initial start up.. I plugged it on, turned the little switch to ON, and the plates got heated up within very few secs... it has been a month since I purchased this product n it works well for me. I did not have any problem in receiving the prod on the estimated date and the working condition of the straightener as well.. hence I m giving it 5 stars..,</li>
    <li> It is a very good flat iron. It straighten my curly frizzy hair into straight sleek hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. As described.  Straightener only reaches 410 and ideally I would like it to reach a bit higher (which it says in the product description, so that&#x27;s on me) so if you need a 440 straightener look elsewhere. But for the price point it&#x27;s hard to beat!</li>
    <li> This a great flat iron at a great price! First off, it arrived very well packaged not even the packaging looked cheap. I love the red storage bag that it comes with and also the fact that the iron sits flat on the counter while heating.  It heated up fast and straightened my hair perfectly. It didn&#x27;t make any noise and didn&#x27;t snag on my hair like my previous Andis iron did.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now... Love it!!! Best flat iron I&#x27;ve had...  It does the job... Great price for a Great product...</li>
    <li> It usually glides very nicely through my hair. Although, sometimes it gets stuck, I have very thick hair.  Curls easily and heats up quickly.  Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> My hair is obnoxious to straighten usually.  This flat iron takes me no time to get it wicked straight.  It keeps my hair from feeling gross and dried out also.  Shiny straightness from a pretty awesome flat iron, can&#x27;t ask for much else!</li>
    <li> The straightner WILL NOT stay hot, and it takes a while to heat up... once its hot it does a good job but, you have to keep setting it down to let it heat back up...  not great but, the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Love it amazing on my hair! Super fast delivery thank you so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few flat irons, I thought this would be a high quality iron, from everyone&#x27;s review. I find myself disappointed. It does not heat high enough, I have to use it a few times to get the results, and does not really curl my hear. It&#x27;s to much of a hassle to return the item and for the price, I will add it to my bag of unused items.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this flat iron. I came from a Croc that for some reason just quit working after 3 years....but it was AWESOME while it worked!! This flat iron is mediocre at best. I don&#x27;t know what all these other reviews are based on...unless what they used before this was complete and total crap. Unfortunately, I based my decision to purchase off the other reviews before me and it was a mistake. I don&#x27;t recommend this flat iron unless you&#x27;re just ok with a step above crap.</li>
    <li> This straightener is so hard on my hair, as opposed to other straighteners that have ceramic. Even with the application of hair softener my hair is hard to manage. The only thing this product is good is for traveling through Europe because it handle 110 to 240 voltage, which my expensive ceramic straightener does not handle.</li>
    <li> Warms up really good, I use the highest temp on it love the iron. I use it to get my hair super straight or to curl my ends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this straightener 3 stars because it is a great straightener but I still have some frizz with it &amp; it does not curl my hair</li>
    <li> Perfect size and I love the carrying case. Looking forward to using it more!</li>
    <li> Love the different size options. I have thin/fine hair and this is the only iron I have used that the curls are tighter and stay all day</li>
    <li> My previous T3 iron broke since the spring popped off and the screw in plain sight was loose if I remember correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron doesn&#x27;t have that problem at all, the build is very sturdy and the feature that surprised me the most is the amount of time it takes to heat up which is not at lot! It makes iron time extremely quick combined with the smoothness of the plates. However the sturdiness can also take a toll on my hands since it can get a little heavy continually pressing down on the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The argan oil sample is also lovely, it&#x27;s good enough for around 5-10 uses depending on your length.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!  Makes my hair super shiny and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair.  Love the price too!</li>
    <li> Works great! My hair is more straight! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for my hair and very good price. The argan oil is awesome too. Works on my short hair!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this iron. I got it for her birthday.</li>
    <li> Well this iron is as described.  Seems like good quality. Doesnt catch and pull hair out. Have had for a month now so all is well.&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews said it worked as well as the Chi iron.  I dissagree.  My CHi was better, but i have had too many issues with my Chi&#x27;s.  Thats why i was willing to try somthing else.  Glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on this or I would have sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt straighten my hair like a Chi.  It takes much longer than I usually would take.  Eventually I&#x27;ll be buying another style of straightener but for now ill use it.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Im caucasian and I have thick, slightly natural curl hair that loves a 450 degree temp straightener.  So if your hair  is like mine think about it some more.  If you dont have a problem straightening your hair, this iron will work great.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  Great product and great vendor.</li>
    <li> Item came earlier than expected. It&#x27;s brand new and comes with a glove a oil to try out. Works amazing!</li>
    <li> EDIT: Would *not* recommend. The wiring broke down after 2 years, spend the extra money to get a nicer straightener! My first CHI lasted 5 years before I mistakenly used it internationally. Additionally HSI customer service never sent me extra set an oil as promised and stopped answering emails.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing like a new hair straightener. I&#x27;ve only had this for a little while but it makes my super thick/coarse hair baby soft. The swivel cord is super handy and I likwill having the temperature adjust knob on there too.</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener and the price is good. You can also curl your hair with it. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is that it seems to snag my hair sometimes.</li>
    <li> The product works exactly as I had hoped.  Mostly using it to straighten/fix wrinkled collars for dress shirts, but the girlfriend has used it a few times on her hair as well, and was very happy w/ the results.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  Works wonderful and is light and user friendly. I highly recommend! It&#x27;s great to have little case to keep it in too.</li>
    <li> My chi straightener broke after 5 years. I went to dollar general and bought a $20 one temporarily until I could save up for another chi. The one from dg wasn&#x27;t even worth the $20. I would literally straighten two sections of hair and have to wait for it to reheat. I use a straightener everyday so this would not work. I bought the hsi straightener based on the reviews and hopes and prayed it was worth. I use to be under the impression that unless it was on the pricey side, it would not work. I was wrong. This straightener, although I&#x27;ve only had it for two months, works just as awesome as my chi. Heats well, keeps the heat, and does not leave your hair fried. I was definitely blessed to have found this product for the price. Definitely a good decision.</li>
    <li> Not as terrific as my original one that I ordered from Amazon but I left that one at my daughter&#x27;s house for when I visit and then got this replacement. The temperature needed is about 380 degrees for fine hair. It works smoothly to straighten hair. I take it to the gym with me in the box because I don&#x27;t want the cord to get injured lugging it with all my other paraphernalia. It has a little satin cover but I could not fit in the flat iron with the cord into the the cover. It does have an extra long cord but my outlets are close by so that was not a necessity. For the price, it is fine and the ceramic plates are very smooth. That part is good. The low heat of 140 is of no use but around 380 worked. I recommend it but love my original best. I don&#x27;t know what that one is called because it&#x27;s not at home here to check. I will modify my review when I find out,</li>
    <li> Made my wife happy.&lt;br /&gt;Unit works fine and hoping it lasts longer than the other brands she has worn out</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron because of the great price and great reviews it got. I certainly was not disappointed. It straightens my hair and works the same as the more expensive flat irons I have bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick as well.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this.  I&#x27;ve never owned one before, but it heats up faster than my curling iron and I love that it tells me when it&#x27;s ready.  I also like the dial to have it hotter or cooler.  The glove is a great idea because it keeps me from burning the hand holding the hair.</li>
    <li> The straightener is amazing, I am fully satisfied with theHSI straightener n argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Amazon for giving it in reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The oil is amazing as well as the flat iron!! My daughter is bi-racial and this oil does magic on her hair! If I could give it 10 stars I would!!!</li>
    <li> I have always bought flat irons in the $30 range. I have very thick wavy hair, and the cheaper irons just weren&#x27;t cutting it. I started researching and had pretty much decided to buy a CHI. I found this on Amazon (when I got it, it was $38) and am SO GLAD I did. It is a MUCH better product than any other I&#x27;ve used. My hair gets flatter and less staticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a swivel where the cord meets the iron, so I find it easier to do different angles without the cord getting caught in my hair or in my face. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really notice a change in my hair using this. Great product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for us (seller was Beauty Change).  Got it for its great reviews but the iron snagged and burnt my daughter&#x27;s hair on first try.  It smelled bad (burn) and damaged her hair on medium setting.  Daughter&#x27;s hair is normal with slight wave.  She&#x27;s used other (expensive!) flat irons with no problems, including CHI and PYT.  Amazon and seller took it back no problem.  Seller was fine, just the product didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for christmas in 2012 and 6 months later bought myself one since she wouldn&#x27;t share it. I love it. It works well and does a good job.</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron. Can you say amazing. I recommend this flat iron to everyone with all different hair textures.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my employee and she is replacing one she had for many years.  She is a happy girl and says this is a great quality, the price was good and it arrived right on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Work like any normal flat iron(for this price don&#x27;t expect special effects) it irons hair well but doesn&#x27;t smooth them enough ( I have dry wavy hair type )and I am using the same brand argan oil .better would be add more dollars and buy better brand.</li>
    <li> Our $200 straightener stopped working so I ordered this one because I currently didn&#x27;t have money to spend on a more expensive one so I bought this. We were surprised to find it actually works better than our expensive one did! My daughter has really curly hair. One pass through her hair with this and it&#x27;s straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> HSI hair shampoo &amp; conditioner are great products. I&#x27;m very pleased &amp; would order them again. Peggy</li>
    <li> I bought it as it has great discount. Only use twice so far. Will update my reviews later.&lt;br /&gt;a good product.</li>
    <li> Not so good. Not easy to use</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a post on Facebook from my cousin.  Read the review&#x27;s and decided to purchase. I have not been disappointed.  This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who flat irons all the time, this product is great, keeps up with her daily needs</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product! It works great &amp; the price was great, too. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought a flat iron from Walmart 6 years ago and was still using it until I bought this product a few weeks ago. Compared to what I bought from Walmart ( which I really loved and it worked perfectly), this products is not good at all. It leaves my hair freezy, doesn&#x27;t straighten as good. Also it says that there is a travel size argon oil included, mine did not have any. I let the seller know but never heard back and was completely ignored. I hope any one looking at this product, finds a better seller/product and doesn&#x27;t be fooled by the title. Its not WORTH it!</li>
    <li> In love I can&#x27;t even brag about this enought I have super super thick curly hair and with one swipe STRAIGHT!!!! I&#x27;m off to vegas next week now I can hit the strip in style. I love it definently will buy other HSI products!! Works just as good as CHI if not better not to mention the price it&#x27;s a steal. To top it all off when I opened the box they sent me one with an LCD display and free case to carry the iron!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because it had such great reviews and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for my teen.  However, I think I should have because this product is not worth the $40 I spent on it. Very disappointed but my daughter needed it and she didn&#x27;t want me to return it so now she&#x27;s stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet but be careful it does get pretty hot.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  The packaging is hilarious as it looks like a sex toy package.  It also comes with one black glove.  Found that unnecessary, but quite funny.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order thia flat iron. Based on all the reviews and youtube videos saying how awesome it is. Ihave thick wavy and some what frizzy hair. The iron does not heat up hot enough like I thought it would. They include a glove which makes you think its going to get to get really hot. It will get hot dont get me wrong, but nothing like I thought it would. I have tried all the heat settings ..and have to go over the hair more than twice to get a smooth finished look. I guess you get what you pay for. Im going to have to splurge on another iron which is a bummer.</li>
    <li> OK so I am not going to lie but I am basing my whole review off of only using this thing once because I just got it in the mail today! My hair is super thick, really curly/wavy and VERY frizzy! With my old flat iron it would take me over an hour to get it nice looking but with this one it only took me 15 MINS!!!!!! So I am very happy to say that not only did this thing save me a whole lot of time but it was able to tame the wild beast that I call hair! I will update this if I run into any issues but I don&#x27;t think I will :)</li>
    <li> Seems amazing for the price but it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Flat Iron did not get hot enough to properly straighten my hair.  Maximum temperature is 410F which I found was not hot enough, I bought another iron with maximum temperature of 440F which works well.  My hair is wavy to curly, I&#x27;m white, and get a keratin treatment every 6 months.</li>
    <li> Great product...great price! I was searching for a straightener for my teenager and she loves this...I have been using it, too!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I started working again right before I bought this and I use it several times a week.  It takes me half the time if my old straightener.  I don&#x27;t have to wait while I am showering and drying my hair for it to warm up, it only takes like 2 minutes.  I am so glad that I found the deal in this that I did.  I am not sure my old one would t have last too much longer.  This has spoiled me for any other striaghtener.</li>
    <li> Works good. Didn&#x27;t leave kinks. Great price!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron and after reading the reviews, I was worried that it would be too hot for my very fine, thin hair.  I was pleasantly surprised that it isn&#x27;t too hot and it works great in my hair even at the highest temperature.  I don&#x27;t use the included glove and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  The oil is nice and smells good as well.  My favorite part of this iron is the quick heat up indicator - red to green.  It heats up really fast.  For the money, this is a really great buy!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. Love this iron...gets my hair very straight!!!</li>
    <li> The best hair straightener I have ever used! Worth every penny I paid for it on Amazon. ($39.00 at the time) My girls have purchased many others and they were all junk. This heats up fast, stays true to temperature, does not pull you hair when you use it, only requires a few passes before it is straight, and the glove it comes with makes it faster to finish. We have thick curly hair and it works beautifully!</li>
    <li> Gonna go against the grain and say I completely dislike this flat iron.  Bought it because of the glowing reviews to replace my cheap-o, awesome 4 yr old John Frieda flat iron (which, ironally, got horrible reviews).  This flat iron does absolutely nothing for my hair.  I have pretty straight hair to begin with, but like flat ironing it to make it look sleek, less volume and tame the frizz.  This does none of that.  Such a disappointment.  If somebody would like to purchase mine, I&#x27;d sell it for half the price.  Been used for maybe two months.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. My hair is thick &amp; there&#x27;s a lot of it. So it can take me a while to straighten it, but with this tool it takes me at most 30 minutes. It&#x27;s amazing. My hair is left soft &amp; shiny. Really great straightener!</li>
    <li> It gets stuck in my hair &amp; is hard to pull through. My hair is looking extra dead since i have been using it. I thought it was going to be a digital heat dial but it&#x27;s a knob &amp; only tells you if you turn it all the way up with 400+ so it&#x27;s just a guesstimate for the heat you turn it on. I mean I don&#x27;t have a mathematical equation of the heat I want to do my hair with but it would be nice to stay around a 350 range so I don&#x27;t completely sizzle. I should&#x27;ve just invested in a good iron.</li>
    <li> This iron is excellent, I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or breakage. It heats up so fast I can get through my morning routine in 10 minutes. Very happy!</li>
    <li> This IRON fried my color treated hair it gets caught in my hair at the ends it didn&#x27;t go thoroughly from top to bottom worst straightener EVER</li>
    <li> Causes hair breakage! Poor quality plates.</li>
    <li> I love it. This is my second one cause I lost my old one. It doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and it leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It heats up quickly, and it works great on my hair. With some flat irons, I have to run the straightener over the same section over and over to get it straight. With this HSI flat iron, I only have to do each section once, and it looks great! It definitely reduces the amount of time it takes me to do my hair in the morning. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> We have been very happy with this flatiron. Way better than our last. It gets very hot very quickly and yet doesn&#x27;t damage our hair. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick, and extremely curly hair.  I have used many straighteners, mainly because I want something different sometimes.  Years ago I straightened my hair everyday with a fairly nice straightener, but it took me about 60 minutes to get it straight and ended up looking dried and dead.  After this one I tried others, averaging similar times with similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this one a go based on the great reviews and am very pleased!  After ~20 minutes I look like I naturally have straight hair!  I highly suggest this straightener due to the price and the extreme effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick to straighten&lt;br /&gt;Easily does the bottom curl flip thing&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quick (room temp to the max 410 in about 3 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;Has a light letting you know when it is up to temperature&lt;br /&gt;Maintains the temperature&lt;br /&gt;The box is very convenient for storing things&lt;br /&gt;Long enough cord you don&#x27;t have to be right on the outlet&lt;br /&gt;A small amount of that oil does a great job&lt;br /&gt;Survives at least a few accidents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find out about it sooner?</li>
    <li> What a fantastic deal.  I love this flat iron, and I appreciate being introduced to Argon oil. Excellent service, excellent product!</li>
    <li> It pulls your hair not so smooth like other products, still thinking of returning</li>
    <li> This is the second one I bought.  Got one as a gift for my daughter last year.  With a new haircut decided a needed one for myself.  Easy to use. Heats fast.</li>
    <li> A lot better quality than what I was expecting! Super exciting!</li>
    <li> Love my straightener and would recommend it to anyone  I would buy it for Christmas gift or anytime gift</li>
    <li> I love this iron more than I love my CHI brand straightener. I bought 2 in the past few years, only because I dropped the 1st one and cracked a plate. It still works the same though, but I kept getting my hair caught in the crack. Considering I dropped it hard enough to crack it, but it still works -- I can&#x27;t complain. I leave it in my locker at work and have my new one at home. It&#x27;s a great product. I have medium thickness, shoulder length, curly hair. I blow dry and then finish with the straightener. I live in S FL and it reduces frizziness from humidity very well. I love it!L</li>
    <li> bought as a gift for my daughter. She loves the HSI professional flat iron. Heats quickly and straightens hair on one pass.</li>
    <li> Great straightener and a great price!!</li>
    <li> Its horrible. I cant believe so many good reviews! Plates did not meet evenly, touched only at the end pulled hair out- cracked when you tried to make the plates touch. My wife cant use it!&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re turning it back</li>
    <li> Had never owned a flat iron before, so after soliciting feedback from friends I decided to purchase this based on their suggestions and reading the product&#x27;s reviews.  Have to agree with everyone as I love it.  Just what I was looking for and as described, not to mention a great price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I know the recipient is very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I absolutely love this product. She has naturally crazy curly hair and this flatiron straightened it with no problem. I haven&#x27;t tried curling my hair YET, but I know that this will work great.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener for the price, good value! Heats up quickly, no tugging or pulling on hair. Can customize the heat setting so it does not burn.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed in this product. I chose it because it had high reviews and was half the price of a Chi straightener. To start off, I had to put the setting almost on high for it to get hot enough to straighten my hair and I do not have overly frizzy, thick or curly hair. Second, it takes a good five to six minutes to heat up. I have a straightener I bought from Sally&#x27;s eight years ago and it only takes about a minute to get extremely hot. Thirdly, this does pull hair when straightening. I tried using it with and without the oil that came with it and the result was the same. I decided to keep the product because I hate the hassle of returns. I probably won&#x27;t be buying this product again though.</li>
    <li> Would have given this 5 stars. I got November 6. It has been working well until now. It turns off by itself and I have to wait for it to heat up again.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! The best one I have ever owned! I have very course, textured, thick, wavy, frizzy hair and this straightener gets my hair so straight and so soft and shiny! I love the Argan Oil as well. I read so many reviews about this straightener and so many others and this one seemed just as good if not better and for a reasonable price! I am very happy with it and the results I get!</li>
    <li> My first straightener, easy to use, works great!</li>
    <li> love it, fast to heat up</li>
    <li> I love them. They look great, not that this matters. But they are stylish. They don&#x27;t stink or seem to burn even on the highest setting. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The flat iron is perfect. I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice quality of flat iron. I highly recommend this product. Overall extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Product came very quickly and as promised.  Very satisfied with product and service provided by company.</li>
    <li> It was very difficult to choose my new iron among all the options I had. This is a great buy! In less than a minute is ready to use, comes with a nice case for storage and is really light! This is very important since I have a very long and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recomended</li>
    <li> This is a good straightener, but it does &#x27;catch&#x27; on my hair a little bit.  Not as smooth as I would prefer but worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easily runs through hair. Added safety feature built into plug. Nice quality support accessories.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quick and cools off quick as well- I hate waiting !! , You can set up your own temperature. Depending on your hair condition, you want to iron it as low vs high temp.&lt;br /&gt;It does not damage your hair and straightens hair easily!!&lt;br /&gt;I do not have good skills and it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;The price is affordable - definitely bang for the buck!&lt;br /&gt; It is travel friendly as well, supports both 120v and 220v.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and i think it can be a great gift as well.</li>
    <li> first flat iron that I can use that actually works. I have very thick wavy hair and this works amazing. couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> Probably the best flat iron I have ever purchased. Works wonders on my hair and it&#x27;s a nice size iron.</li>
    <li> So I read the other reviews and it seemed like everyone for the most part got along with this straightener so I got one too. For what I need it to do, it works great. Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work well in singapore when it&#x27;s supposed to be dual voltage!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Perfect product!!</li>
    <li> Great quality iron and the packaging is very impressive.  Comes with a beautiful, thick satin case, free samples of Argan Oil Hair Treatment and glove.  The first iron I ordered wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough and I was about to email the seller, but before I could they emailed me to follow up on their product and service.  I explained the problem and they immediately Priority shipped another replacement iron, not even asking to return the other.  Excellent customer service and follow through.  The second iron works beautifully and I love it.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  :(  I was hoping this would help me save time with straightening my long, thick hair but it does no better than the one I bought at a local grocery store.  I really don&#x27;t believe it actually gets up to the 400+ degrees it says it does.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Iron works well.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I puchased an inferior brand a year ago that didn&#x27;t live up to what I needed or its claim. This brand is awesome!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works just as well as my old Chi that died right after the year mark. It would be nice if there was an auto turn off function for forgetful people like me, but this straightener is still amazing!</li>
    <li> I was at the Polaris Mall in Ohio when a girl who was selling the product demonstrated on my hair how great this iron is. I found it on Amazon for $60 less so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste any extra money on the product. I have been using it for about a week and the ceramic is burning off even at its lowest heat and the leave in hair treatment causes static. It straightens okay but I&#x27;m not happy with the overall product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely, love this straightener!</li>
    <li> The reviews I read on this product were amazing. I got it quickly and it came as described. However, I wasn&#x27;t &#x27;wowed&#x27; with the quality. It is actually the same as my old one in straightening power that I got at Ross for $40. So, I was hoping for an upgrade and a really nice flat iron. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works okay, but I&#x27;ve used much better. I have to go over my hair several times to get it to look nice which I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to do. But then again, it works well enough so that I don&#x27;t need to return it. I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed. I guess I got what I paid for. Just be cautious of reviews I suppose!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this flat iron.Everyone else was asking 160.00 or more.I am so happy to have a good quality flat iron that actually works and I could afford!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and occasionally like to wear it straight - with this iron it makes it possible and easy.  A great tool and an asset for long, thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best I have ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a loyal chi customer for years, but this flat iron? Let me tell you... AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy a CHI again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soooo soft and flat.</li>
    <li> I have to say the reviews really helped in making my decision not to by another CHI. I was worried at first because I have the world&#x27;s worst unruly hair. It is thick, coarse, and curly! I usually get my hair thinned out every other month-seriously. The HSI leaves my hair shiny and soft all day- before even applying the wonderful argan oil they supply with this purchase. I ABSOLUTELY would recommend this product to ANY CHI user. Its a great buy and its way worth giving it a chance!!! Hope my review helps you- like the several others helped me. Bye bye CHI- HELLO HSI!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great!  So far I am very pleased with the product and feel that it straightens my hair easily and quickly.  I love that it has various tempatures because I have pretty thick hair.  I am vey pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The heat is a little uneven.</li>
    <li> I love how smooth this straightener is.  It&#x27;s a great product for a great price.  It makes my hair look sleek and shiny and is better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve owned!  The only downside is that it does not curl nearly as well as I had hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading many reviews about several different flat irons. The reviews all said great things about this product. After recieving the product, just 1 day after purchase, I have to say I was very happy. The flat iron is brand new. It came in a sturdy box with a soft, red travel case for easy storage. It works wonderfully. It has settings for different hair types and heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Definately, a great purchase. Especially for the price. Very affordable and high quality.</li>
    <li> SO I&#x27;ve owned my CHI straightener for almost six years and have loved it.  When it crapped out on me a few days ago and started becoming unreliable, I came on Amazon looking for a replacement.  I saw that the HSI straightener had received rave reviews and for the price, figured why not try it.  My first straightener arrived and it was broken.  One panel of the straightener was HOT and the other plate was not.  In fact, I was able to touch the other plate with my hand with the straightener turned on.  Amazon was awesome.  I called them and there was a replacement at my house the next day.  The new straightener def. got hot - too hot in fact.  Just holding it from the outside and straightening my hair like I normally do with my CHI, I got a burn blister on the bottom of my pointer finger - not cool.  Despite how hot it gets, it&#x27;s not a good straightener.  I&#x27;m Indian and have very thick wave/curly hair.  I sectioned off just a tiny portion of my hair (my bangs) and ran the HSI through it several times.  It looked pretty straight after a few runs though (my CHI straightens my bangs with one run through and it&#x27;s six years old!) but as soon as I got outside, it got wavy.  So my assessment of this product is that it takes a lot longer to straighten your hair and when you&#x27;re done, there&#x27;s no guarantee that it will last through the day.  This is def. not what I expect from a high-end straightener.  Also, I never got the 5 ml bottle of Argain leave in hair treatment.  Another fail.  I really wish that I had stuck with what works and got the CHI instead of the HSI.  I guess you win some you lose some - right? Lost this one.</li>
    <li> I had been using the same straightener for ten years...my friend suggested I buy a tourmaline one. With all the good reviews this one got, I decided to purchase. I love how straight my hair looks now. Next step is product to control the frizzies!</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron, worth the price</li>
    <li> I like how smooth it goes through my fine hair but I don&#x27;t like the fact I have to have the iron on the highest setting to straighten my hair that is so fine and thin.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair that always frizzies no matter what. Been tired of using the same ole cheap straightener for Walmart that I get about once a year. Researched this brand and found great reviews. Seemed like a great deal with the freebies included. And I don&#x27;t regret it one bit! It&#x27;s smaller than the one I normally get which has a 2 inch straightener. This one is 1 inch. It was much smaller than used to but I am still Getting used to it. You can get under your hair real well with it being smaller and seems to straighten better that way. love it! And it was a great price on amazon</li>
    <li> I looked at lot of flat irons before making my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, wavy hair and i was able to straighten and smooth my hair in less time than with my chi. It is a very well made quality item at an excellent price, don&#x27;t pass this one up.</li>
    <li> The 1\\&quot; HSI Tourmeline Ionic Flat iron looks and feels like an expensive model, but the price was very reasonable.  After purchasing an expensive one that only lasted about 3 years, I&#x27;ve tried other brands, some cheaper and some a little more than the HSI, and none seemed to work as well.  I am very satisfied with this flat iron.  I also purchased the HSI flat iron stand and love how it safely cradles the iron right away when I&#x27;m done straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a phnemominal product. I purchased it to replace a salon style flat iron that I had for 5 years. I did a bit of research and this product had wonderful reviews, and had all the features i was looking for. The product gets very hot and very fast, which is a huge plus for me. The temperature control ranges from 140* and 410*. The product comes in a very nice red silk carry case for easy transport, and provides protection while traveling. product is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have used. Better than the Chi. I love that you can set the heat temperature on it.</li>
    <li> I got mIne with the box packed already opened and no glove or free sample of argan oil nor would the iron get hot therefore I&#x27;m returning.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this product for me after researching a range of reasonably priced, well-reviewed flat irons. It is - by far - the most useless flat iron I have ever owned or used. My hair is not even terribly curly, and even when almost fully straightened with a round brush, this flat iron does not do anything other than seemingly burn my hair, leaving it frizzy, dried out - but still curly! I have tried it with many different hair care products and on every available heat setting, to the same or worse results. My specific flat iron does not appear to be defective in any way; it simply doesn&#x27;t straighten hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unclear on how this received so many positive reviews, but would certainly not recommend it to anyone considering a similar purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Worked great, took less time to straighten my hair than it did with a curling iron. Heats up fast, so far it is an all around great product!</li>
    <li> A couple of things i like about the HSI Ceramic flat iron.  I like how you can adjust the temperature for the type of hair you have and Also like that it takes a shorter time for me to straighten my hair with this flat iron then it did with my Chi that i replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Over all i really like this product.</li>
    <li> I Love the temperature control, didn&#x27;t have that on my last straightener. Heats up very quickly. Handle doesn&#x27;t get too hot, so it&#x27;s difficult to get burned. Overall, very happy! I was planning on buying a CHI, but I don&#x27;t want that CHI any more. I love my new straightener and I can&#x27;t stop playing with my hair!!!</li>
    <li> I got the product the same day. THANK YOU AMAZON! The flat iron works well, you can adjust the tempature- I like mine on the hotter side as I have coarse curly hair. I have used it 3 times now, and it works great! The package came with Argon Oil- which I will buy a bigger botter of as I like the shine it gave my hair. The flat iron also came with a bag of its on and a glove. Very cool product you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> So, my sister had been given a &amp;#34;quik heat&amp;#34; flat iron for graduation about 10 years ago, and it finally is starting to give us some troubles with the wiring. We decided to replace it, and this had so many reviews, almost all of them raving about this flat iron. It was inexpensive, compared to other options, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I both have pretty thick wavy/curly/combo hair (I describe it as Mexican-Scottish craziness). This straight iron took almost twice the time to use compared to our last one, and left our hair looking frizzy. I felt it would even snag my hair, which was highly uncomfortable. Our hair also never looked completely straight. It was far too much effort to use this flat iron to get the look we were so used to with our other flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also used this for a few months, trying to get used to it, but finally brought out our old flat iron because we just couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore. We actually were looking for it the other day, since I&#x27;m going on a trip and would be more okay with losing this flat iron than the dying one, and don&#x27;t even know where we had put it. Oh well. Not too bad a loss for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think if we had thinner, tamer hair, the straightener would have worked better. We are only 2 people in the sea of reviews that haven&#x27;t liked this product.</li>
    <li> Love them!  I have thick curly hair and it gets it straight!</li>
    <li> I have searched for a flat iron that would heat quickly, be easy to handle and make straightening my wavy hair effortless....Buy this one!  It is hands down the best I have ever bought and even on my hair 1 pass is all it took.</li>
    <li> I bought the chi flatiron but when I was reading reviews to try hsi flatiron I decided I would. You won&#x27;t be disappointed it works just the same as the chi ! I love it!</li>
    <li> Got this for someone as a birthday present and they loved it. The only thing missing is that there aren&#x27;t as many features as the higher end model, which is double the price. Would&#x27;ve liked the LED screen and the Auto-shutoff, but to get those you have to pay double the price of this one. For a basic Hair straightener this is great!</li>
    <li> My family have all been satisfied with this straightener. I was so happy to find one for a good price with tourmaline</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my iron after reading all the great reviews, I even paid a little extra for overnight shipping so I could use it for a reception the next day. However I became quickly disappointed after receiving it. The iron feels like cheap plastic, and the temperature knob was loose and also made from cheap plastic. The plates pulled at and pulled out my hair, and didn&#x27;t feel very smooth to use. My hair was straight after only one pull through, however within 2 hours my hair was starting to frizz again and my waves began returning. It just doesn&#x27;t stand up next to my Karmin straightener. I&#x27;ll be returning this product.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with natural (relaxer-free) hair. I like the versatility this offers, but when I choose to wear it straight I want it done with ease and efficiency; and I want it to last. The HSI Pro Ceramic Ionic Flat iron does that. The unit used with the argan oil made my hair straighter and silkier than it&#x27;s ever been with any flat iron, including the CHI! The effect lasted for over a week, even on some rainy days in Georgia. I am completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than my Walmart straightener, I did have to pass over sections multiple times though and I hoped that would not be the case.</li>
    <li> Works well especially for the price, I still liked my brocato hair iron much better but it broke after three months of use. It this one lasts awhile it will be well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Fantastic flat iron!  Love it so much that I bought one for my daughter and my best friend bought one as well!</li>
    <li> did not get hot enough for my hair. returned it</li>
    <li> Thought that a more expensive flat iron would glide through my hair and make it shinier and more healthy looking.  It does about the same as the ones I pay $25.  This is no fault of the vendor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent straightener! It also curls really easily too. It heats up quickly and leaves your hair silky smooth!</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described.  Heats up quickly and works perfectly.  I have extremely thick coarse curly hair and with a couple passes this straighten and smooths my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product..Just prior to an upcoming Italy trip, my wife realized her flat iron was not a dual voltage product and therefore could not be used abroad. We read the reviews on this product on Amazon and had it in our hands 48 hours later. During our trip, we traveled with 3 other couples and found ourselves lending the product to others as well as my wife using it herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a very well made, well performing product and very happy with our purchase</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair. This iron pulled my hair and didn&#x27;t straighten it the way I needed it to. I feel like I got ripped on the price and the product.</li>
    <li> I always bought my daughter the her styler iron n was gona that day but than I seen this one n thought I would give it a shot well that was the best thing I did cause my daughter loves it even better than the her styler it made her hair straight n shiny price was great n it was really quick delivery it was money well spent</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron its sturdy and comes with a sample light weight oil and has the ability to dial up or down the temp. Gives great shine and it lasts for days.</li>
    <li> There was one day it seem like it wouldn&#x27;t turn on but it&#x27;s I now.  I love it also it gets hot fast.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 5 star because this product worked great on my hair took me 30mins perfectly straight I parted it in big chunks, I have thick curlly hair this straightner did magic I love it...</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! Doesn&#x27;t snag hair. It really smooths out to the tips. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell like it&#x27;s frying. Heats up very fast. Super great deal. Better than my Amika that broke in two years already. Love the free sample of argan oil. Love the box it comes in. Overall excellent excellent flat iron.</li>
    <li> Its a fantastic flat iron. I recommend it to everybody who wants to buy a quality product.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well for my fine hair, does grab hair sometimes but overall works great and leaves my hair straight for two days.</li>
    <li> Love this tool - does a great job and does not damage my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I have to add more words???</li>
    <li> I have never owned a nice flat iron- usually just buy a cheap one in store. I am in love with this flat iron. My hair is straighter than ever with this flat iron and it is actually staying straight unlike with my other flat irons. I am so excited to finally own a professional flat iron. I am thrilled with this flat iron, as well as the price.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!  I have fine hair but it&#x27;s curly,  and it works great! My mom who has fine straight here uses it also and loved it. I would recommend this for anybody and any hair type!  Especially those with fine hair!! 👍🏼</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and decided to try this brand since my CHI broke and would cost alot. Comparing prices I decided to buy something cheaper, but with good ratings. This does the job,but it pulls a couple of strands of hair. This does not happen offten, but it&#x27;s anoying.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and,have always bought a chi flatiron so,I was very skeptical. I have to say this flatiron was better than my chi. I will b ordering another one for home. Great priduct</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this flatiron to me. After years of using another brand, I can say this flatiron is fantastic. I love the how soft and straight it leaves my hair. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Delivered fast! Love this product as well as the price!</li>
    <li> Love my ionic flat iron, it is the best straightener. I love the different setting. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price.. It curls hair really smooth..snags hair a little bit  but otherwise they are good</li>
    <li> I bought this item so that I could use it when traveling abroad. I have only used it once and it definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional cosmetologist and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on professional flat irons and I&#x27;ve got to say this flat iron is just as good as the expensive ones and maybe even better because of the value you get with the price.. My hair is thick and this iron definitely works faster and the first time! I&#x27;m going to recommend this to all my friends!!</li>
    <li> Came on time and had no defects. Was EXACTLY what I had ordered. It works beautifully, tried it on myself and my younger sister .. WE LOVE IT .</li>
    <li> Just got it this past weekend have only used it a couple times so far but seems to do great so far. I have really thick and curly hair so I needed a straightener that would heat up high. I love the fact that it does not make my hair frizzy. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I use it occasionally &amp; always use protective spray. It smooths the hair without it looking frizzy. Nice tool. Comes in pretty red satin bag for storage.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using the same cheap iron for about seven years and I knew I wanted a new one but wasn&#x27;t sure where to go. I didn&#x27;t really expect the HSI to be any different than my current one so for the heck of it I bought it on sale and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was completely wrong going for the cheaper brands/models, this is nothing like them! It heats up so quickly to start, I&#x27;m used to waiting a couple minutes for my old flat iron to heat up but with the HSI it&#x27;s ready to use in seconds. I also have very thick hair and I still only need to go over each section once, not multiple times like I&#x27;m so used to. It really cuts down on the time it takes for me to get ready in the mornings. I can&#x27;t get over it! One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made on this site.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and was exactly as advertised but when i used it, it pulls my hair to the point i went back to my old flat iron. Very disappointed. I was so excited to get this and use it and it was a great price but i wont be using it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I came to US a day befor my son&#x27;s bachelor degree graduation and the ceremony was set for the next day at 8am. My hair had a nice cut since I left my country. I didn&#x27;t have much time in between arriving at the place my son lives and getting all set for the next day cerimony. So, as I brought my clothes all set, I woke up early and did my own hair for the first time in my life... The HSI professional work just perfectly... I looked liked I have came out from a hairstylist.. And besides taking care of my hair, I did also have time to care my daughter&#x27;s in law hair... Both our hair looked perfect. The product is worth while.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron, and for the price, this deal can&#x27;t be beat.  At first, it tugged my hair a bit, then once I made sure I sectioned my hair correctly before ironing, it stopped.  Because I have fine, damaged hair, I place this on the middle temperature and it works like a dream. I cannot imagine anyone not loving this flat-iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Black and Sicilian so my hair is difficult to keep straight. I&#x27;ve used other flat irons and this is by far the best. The price is extremely reasonable and it even comes with a glove so you don&#x27;t burn your hand while straightening. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for even the frizziest of hair.</li>
    <li> Gets hair really straight without burning or pulling. I would recommend these to anyone and have done so already. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!!! I&#x27;ve never been good at curing my hair until I got this tool, now I am curling my hair like a pro!!!</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast, straightens perfectly with the first time, very compact. The only drawback - no automatic shut off but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> It takes much longer to heat up than any iron I&#x27;ve used before, however it does a good job on the hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron! Good quality and heats up fast! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Really,  far better then expected.  Heats up so fast. Works wonders on my thick course hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this hot iron!  It does a GREAT job at straightening my hair as well as using it as a curling iron.  Exceptional value for the price!</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener. I have really thick curly hair and this is the only  straightener that  works on my hair. It can  take up to an hour with any other and this one it took me 20 to 30  mins.</li>
    <li> I really like my new flat iron. I recieved it when it said I would. And it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been much of a flat iron user before, but I started getting some natural (and frustratingly located) wave/curl in my hair. I have a cut-style that looks best with very straight hair. Since blowdrying with a brush didn&#x27;t seem to maintain the straightening for very long, my stylist suggested a flat iron. I have loved how my hair looks when she flat-iron styles it, so I started researching and chose the HSI here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been wonderful. My stylist said it&#x27;s important to get one with temperature control, so that was a feature I specifically looked for. I keep the temperature at about 2/3 it&#x27;s maximum (about 350 degrees) and it works perfectly. My hair keeps its perfect straightened shape all day, it&#x27;s fast and easy, and it flattens out &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; spots too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy. Great quality. No problems with shipping.</li>
    <li> Works very well; I am glad I purchased it :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome.  I was looking for a new flat iron for my shorter haircut and this one works perfectly.  Nice and smooth, no pulling or breaking of hair.  And no more burnt fingers from using a straightener that&#x27;s too wide!  Highly recommended at a great price.</li>
    <li> The best investment I&#x27;ve bought for my hair....ever.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;The most satisfied I&#x27;ve ever been with a hair product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful little flat iron. Heats up really quickly. Then it straightens and/or curls. If I make a mistake with the curl, I can straighten it back out or curl it a different direction. I keep it at 50% or 75%, and it hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair at all, even if I don&#x27;t use the Argan oil. Fast delivery from Atlas.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest and best flat iron I have ever used...it deserves every 5 star review it has received!  Thank you for such a wonderful product and such great customer service.</li>
    <li> I was never a flat iron user before, until I purchased this. I am so happy with this product and the price. Straightens my thick hair quickly and easily. Five star product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She used for 2 times and after that it stopped working. So I returned this item. It might be a defective one which I got.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to try a flat iron and after a fair amount of research, went with this one. I am a complete novice but was still able to get close to my stylist&#x27;s look on my first attempt. Easy to use, travel bag a nice plus.</li>
    <li> Just got it and definitely love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this straightener because of the reviews and no regrets because it works really good! After I used my hair was real smooth!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Use with argan oil for the best results. I have very thick and wavy hair, but this works very well.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair and you like it extra straight this is not the right flat iron for you.  Even on the hottest setting it took at least 4 or 5 times to get it to the straightness and flatness I&#x27;m used to.  It also felt like it was pulling on my hair, almost a grainy feeling every time I did a section.  You pay for what you get so I&#x27;m sure it works well for those who don&#x27;t mind every piece not being straight but I returned to buy a little higher priced flat iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron after weeks of research on it, I have really thick curly puffy African American hair͵any regular flat irons do not work... when I tell you one pass gets your hair straight and shiney͵omg I love my flat iron! And for the price this flat iron is heven! I highly recommend! Also to add I am 100% natural (hair) and I have no heat damage 😀</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. Works well.</li>
    <li> I used to swear by my Chi, but this straightener is fantastic! It heats more slowly than the Chi, but I have it set on the highest setting (my hair is super-thick), and it straightens much more quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron straightener based on the glowing reviews, but I was really disappointed.  The iron definitely does not glide down your hair, and it almost feels like it&#x27;s going to pull your hair out.  It also didn&#x27;t straighten my hair, which I found surprising. I have very thin hair for an Asian, and my hair usually curls and straightens really easily.  I ended up returning the product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I saw all the positive reviews and decided to try it, especially with the affordable pricing!! Def recommended!</li>
    <li> I thought this flat iron was great when I got it. Three months later it is not working. To late to return under the 60 day return policy. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  I was able to use it in Europe without a problem!</li>
    <li> Works great. No auto shutoff. Temperature can be controlled which is a big plus. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Works really good and the price is very reasonable!  I would recommend this to anyone on a budget or who needs a good flat iron</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this flat iron.  I have used it to both straighten and curl my hair.</li>
    <li> great value. I was suprised by the difference a new flat iron made - not sure if it was just the newness of this or the type of material.</li>
    <li> Flat iron arrived on time and was everything I expected.  Works great and handled perfectly while in Italy.</li>
    <li> I, along with many others, purchased this flat iron because of the glowing reviews. This product sucks!!! It pulls my hair out, does not get hot enough and does not stay at the temperature it should. The iron feels quality in that it is sturdy and heavy but it leaves my hair frizzy. I actually just gave up today and put my hair up it was so bad. I am  faithful CHI user and I will be going back my first CHI lasted 6 yrs (that was pre children) and my second Lasted almost 4 yrs. I will be going back to a CHI. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the good reviews there are also a good amount of negative ones. This thing will torture your hair. DONT BUY ONE!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it... It&#x27;s the first time I buy a flat iron online and I was very satisfied by my choice. I usually get my flat irons from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and usually pay more then $60 for a so so flat iron. HSI professional flat iron was a great choice and a got it on a great deal...it leaves my hair straight, smooth and shiny.... Love it!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this flat iron, I had the same revlon for 7+ year and decided it was time for a new one. Unfortunately, I doesn&#x27;t work well with my curly hair, I spend alot of time going over the same piece of hair to get it straight,  the iron will not stay @450. And shuts off in the middle of straightening, it doesn&#x27;t curl or flip. My old one worked better.</li>
    <li> Came with argan oil, a heat resistant glove and a beautiful red drawstring type bag for the iron.&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself is amazing.  Gets super hot (I keep it at the midpoint setting) and does  the job of straightening my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, especially for this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several straighteners and this is by far my favorite!! My hair is thick, has a natural wave &amp; some serious frizz to it. This straightener worked like a charm on it :)</li>
    <li> I had purchased one prior and my daughter used it when she was visiting. she loves it. high adjustable heat and professional grade love it</li>
    <li> Would give it 4.5. Works v well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item as described.</li>
    <li> This was bought because the reviews were over the top positive. For me it wasn&#x27;t great. Spent twice as long doing my hair than usual and at the end my hair was not completely straight:/</li>
    <li> Works great. Didn&#x27;t burn my hair and left it soft.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times, but I&#x27;m not all. I have somewhat thin ( pretty frizzy in the humid weather) shoulder length hair and I find that I need to have the straightener on high to get it to get my hair looking decent.  Also, when I pull my hair through...it doesn&#x27;t pull but it feels rough against the ceramic.  I asked my daughter to use it (she&#x27;s a pro at straightening her hair) and see if maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong...can&#x27;t see what in all honesty. In fairness I will write another review if it&#x27;s me, if not, then I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
    <li> It works really well! It heats up quickly, and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up. Returning.</li>
    <li> So far I love this straightener!  Gives my hair a nice shine with each use.  Heats up really quick,  straightens really quick.  Seems to be gentle on my hair.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced great straightener that does exactly what it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> The straightener works well enough. But sometimes I leave it on for one last  touch-up before I leave the house in the morning. I have then forgotten to turn it off as I hurry to get to work. It does not have an automatic shut off. I have come home to an extremely hot straightener, along with anything near by. With modern technology, every straightener should have this safety feature.</li>
    <li> We have not heard from this woman, so I cannot comment on how she received it or used it. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Iron works great. Does not snag hair and leaves it looking/feeling smooth. The floating plates are nice and it does a perfect job at curling your hair!!! I love the glove that came with it ( I thought I would never use it, but when you go to use it as a curler you will be beyond happy to have it). It makes a great 2 in 1 hair styler. Only thing I did not like was the cord (where it attaches to the actual iron it is so stiff and the cord seems to get tangled easy, but it does not bother me much) the pros out way that downfall. I am one happy camper.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t get it.  Does not seem like it gets very hot, and it catches my hair with each pass.  Unfortunately, not pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Comes with a cloth case and glove plus sample of hair lotion.  Heats up fast and works really nice!</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for some time now, and it still works like a champ.  The controls are on the inside of the handle, which I like, so that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my styling, and it has an adjustable heat so I can have just the perfect setting.  The outside doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle, another nice feature.  All in all, a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Its the best! Leave your hair smooth, and i love the freebies!!! It was an excellent product for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually been able to use it much, but the veiw times i did i loved it. It also works very well for curling hair!</li>
    <li> As described, fast ship</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple times, but so far it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener because of the reviews which were really good.  I used it twice and was not happy with the results.  It took me twice as long as with my old straightener.  I had to go over every piece several times and still I was not happy with how my hair came and or felt.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time!  Very pleased with the product so far.  The price was much lower than I had seen it elsewhere</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! I have hard to straighten hair and this works great. Quality product. Heats up fast. Nice to be able to control temp precisely. Love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron based on the mostly good reviews and was happily surprised it worked better than I expected! I have fine wavy hair which is not ideal for straightening, but this iron worked great without much effort. My old iron (really old) had teeth which helped with hair as fine as mine. I was looking for a new iron with teeth, but could not find one anywhere. I read the reviews here and gave it a shot. It straightened with just 2 passes. I thought the glove was a little hokey until I used it and realized it helps a ton. The sample oil was nice, just keep in mind it is just a sample. I usually put a little coconut oil in my hair anyway. I love this iron so much I am ordering one for my best friend too!</li>
    <li> The product came to me broken. Looked fine, but once I plugged it in, didn&#x27;t work. I tried for 20 minutes and nothing. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> I received the iron and it worked well the first time but then it did not, The light never turned green as to indicate that it was ready. The seller send me a new one but the same thing happen w/the second one. I was dissapointed withe the purchase but the seller was very nice.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a gift and she loves it, very easy to use and her hair feels soft after words</li>
    <li> Ok, so here is the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good- I love this straightener- it works really well on my hair, I only have to take it through my hair one time and it is completely straight. Because of this, I also think my hair looks healthier than it has in the past, given that I don&#x27;t have to run a straighter through the same pieces over and over (breaking and fraying the ends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad- It broke after one month. I don&#x27;t know what this issue was, or whether I just got a bad version, but it stopped working very suddenly. Yes, that was unfortunate and inconvenient. BUT, then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Great- I e-mailed Blue Novelties and explained my dilemma. They sent one note back to try and troubleshoot, and after I responded that the product still was not working, they immediately overnighted me a new one- no hesitations, no hemming and hawing, I had a new straightener in hand in less than two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to summarize, I really like the product. I am not sure what caused my first one to crap out early, however, I am very pleased with the seller&#x27;s customer service and would still recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to, and comes with a handy glove so you don&#x27;t burn yourself. Have i used the glove, no. who has time for that?! It does warm up quick and the dial on it lights up so you know it is on. I&#x27;m left handed though so it shows on the other side :-)</li>
    <li> For fairness I will start out by saying that I am not a hair product snob. Before I bought this product, I owned a $20 Conair flat iron I bought at WalMart in 2005. (I didn&#x27;t use it much any more and I could hear my hair crying in agony when I did.) At the time I bought this, my every day hair routine was to blow dry with a round brush and hope for the best. I was often disappointed with my appearance by mid-morning. Then I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the product: I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day for the last 6 months and it shows no visible wear. It opens and closes smoothly and the plates slide through my hair easily. I have not used the heat glove or the argan oil so I will not comment.&lt;br /&gt;As for features and function: While the heat dial is tucked between the plates, making it difficult to get at, it stays put while in use. Every few weeks, I check to make sure that the dal is set where I put it originally and it has never moved. Some people prefer more distinct settings for different hair types, but you really only need to adjust this once, so start low and increase slowly until you find your sweet spot. It is a little annoying that the plug is the same large size as a blow dryer. I only have on outlet in my bathroom so I can only plug one in at a time. However, this makes up for it with the fact that it heats up very quickly. My routine with this is to blow dry my hair, plug this in, and go make a pot of coffee. When I come back 2-3 minutes later, it&#x27;s ready to go. The iron does switch back and forth between \\&quot;heating\\&quot; and \\&quot;ready,\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t really notice any change in performance. I have medium thick wavy hair and it just takes a few quick passes for me to flatten my hair. With my previous, cheap flat iron, it would not hold the style all day and I would sometimes use it 2-3 times a day. This iron holds my hair straight all day and even through the night. Also, you know how sometimes you&#x27;re watching tv and a girl will take her hair out of a pony-tail and it&#x27;s straight and perfect and you think \\&quot;Yeah right! Her hair would have a huge kink in it!\\&quot; I can flat iron my hair with this, put it into a pony tail for a couple of hours, take it down, and have it be perfectly straight again. I was NOT expecting that and I was amazed. Usually my hair kinks if I pull it back for more than 10 minutes. Needless to say, this holds a style. The first week I had this, I got several comments that my hair looked really nice, so it makes a difference even on my hair that I&#x27;d been blow drying straight. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I&#x27;m glad the price is back down to $40 so I can buy one for my sister.</li>
    <li> It is a great straightener...works great and heats up fast.  It handles easily and is the perfect size for my hair.</li>
    <li> I recieved the item in a timely fashion. It would not work. I tried every outlet in the house and pressed the reset button. One of the cermaic plates looks as if the item might have been used prior to me recieving the item.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great.  It doesnt pull my hair out like my other flat iron.  I just wish it had a regular plug instead of the big plug that takes up so much room on the outlet.  Now I have to unplug my hair dryer before I can use the flat iron.  Kind of inconvenient.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener gets hot really fast and works really good so far. I have recommended it to several of my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about two weeks now and it&#x27;s given good results. For the price, it just makes it all the better! I don&#x27;t have any complaints on it, except when it first arrived it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I just hit the reset buttons on the plug part and it started working perfectly.</li>
    <li> I found that this straightener works well when its hot. I&#x27;m not sure if I have a defective one or not but it seems to cool down after a few minutes while I am using it, so I have to set it down and wait for it to heat back up to the right temp.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good quality, reliable product, I recommend this flat iron. Price is reasonable too. I previously had a chi, I prefer this product hands down.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I used this product. After reading all of the amazing reviews, I couldnt wait to try my new flat iron when I received it. However, I set it to the highest setting and it will not get hot. It keeps turning off without even touching it. It took me 3-4 times as long to do my hair with this iron because it keeps turning off and will not get hot. I thought maybe I had to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34; so I attempted to use on another occasion, but I was faced with the same issues. I went back to using my old broken one unfortunately. I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> When I FINALLY located the package where lasership left it (sigh, thankfully it wasn&#x27;t stolen), used the iron and I am very happy with the purchase.  Great price, good value.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife, she loves it, it is a dual voltage and works greate.  She wanted the one that works in eruopean countries, and this does the job.</li>
    <li> The straightener is the perfect size to straighten or curl my super-straight hair. The variable temperature control and easy-to-grip surface also helped me through making 48 double-ended synthetic dreadlocks just fine (although, next time, I&#x27;m using my new Shark steamer to save wrist twisting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this fairly often (1-2 times a week) and it curls my hair in such a way that it stays wavy for at least 2 days afterwards, which is a miracle! It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great flatiron, leaves hair silky soft, I use it a lot on my weaves and its the best, only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the grip, the cut outs sore my fingers when used for a long time, it should have a different grip. I love it otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;The argan oil, no smell which is great but it didn&#x27;t work magic, regular virgin olive oil works better,</li>
    <li> Very good product. It comes with a case and a small bottle of Argan Oil, which I thought was a nice addition.  My hair seems to be a lot smoother with less frizz.</li>
    <li> I am a Chi lover. But mine in the past have had trouble working. Usually the wire. I saw the reviews for this one and they were great an the price was affordable. It works as good as the chi if not better!</li>
    <li> Received with good shipping speed. Arrived in a good looking box but unfortunately the product didn&#x27;t work. I tried to fidget with it but it didn&#x27;t get hot. The red light on the handle would appear then it would turn green then immediately the red light would disappear. The entire time the flat iron never even got hot or even warm. Very disappointing :(</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! I bought it because of all the great reviews on Amazon and the price was more than affordable. I have gone through flat irons in the past and so far my favorite one has been the Tourmaline ceramic iron by ION. That iron is about 80+ dollars. This time I was looking for the ION or something similar. The recent irons I had before the HSI was the ceramic Iron by Sephora and the Solia. The Sephora was cheap however it worked better than the Solia for my multi ethnic thick hair. I needed something that would get my hair bone silky straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the HSI is getting the job done. The plates are thick so the iron is kind of heavy but I like it because it feels more durable and I feel like it is actually straightening my hair. Its built to last so if you drop it I doubt you will crack it. I also like the little perks it comes with; the hand glove, the argon oil, and a red silky pouch to place your iron in when you are traveling or what have you. If you are looking to save money and a iron that will get your hair straight this is for you!&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase this hair straightener for a fraction of full retail price, I got it for $39.99. I have only had the straightener for approx. 3 days and already I am less than impressed. This works no better than a straightener I could have purchased at Sally Beauty Supply for $39.99 and would not have had to wait for it to arrive or pay for shipping. In my opinion it straightens no better than flat irons I have purchased previously at Sephora, Ulta or Sally Beauty. For the money it&#x27;s a good but, however, do not set yourself up to be amazed. I had to re-run the straightener over the same areas of hair multiple times to get it straight. I do not have curly hair, my hair is naturally straight.</li>
    <li> This is THE flat iron hair straightener all others strive to be.  This flat iron hair straightener is unbelievable!  It straightens my frizzy hair to the point that it&#x27;s silky and shiny and STRAIGHT.  I have NEVER had anything straighten my hair like this, not even chemical straighteners!  I love it, I just wish I had bought it years ago.  If you want a flat iron hair straightener like the PROS use, get this and be prepared to be impressed.  It&#x27;s better than the ones THE PROS USE!  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good, but not quite as hot as I would like.  But if left a few seconds more, it works well.</li>
    <li> This works great have had Chi&#x27;s in the past and this price is much better.  Comes in a great silk bag and has a long cord.</li>
    <li> good, but not excelent</li>
    <li> I have yet to use an iron that really gets my hair super flat, but this product does what I need it to do.  Heating takes a little to get to the temp I need it to be &amp; I can flatiron my whole head in 15 mins. I&#x27;d recommend it for the price.  Very durable, too, having dropped it on accident a few times.</li>
    <li> Best iron I have ever owned!  I can tell the difference between steel and ceramic plates.  My hair stays shiny and I have found that I don&#x27;t need to use pre or post hair treatments when using this.  My hair has not been damaged since using this iron.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hard to control hair and this straightener has worked amazing so far! The best one I have had yet. I have tried several other brands and they don&#x27;t even compare to HSI.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair often but when I do I know I can count on this flat iron to get the job done. It heats up quickly, straightens with one or two pass throughs, and it curls pretty well also!!</li>
    <li> One of the best things I have bought for my hair. I use the medium setting and my hair is soft and shiny. I have pure white almost shoulder length hair that I wear straight and turned under at the end. I have not color or perm my hair in over 25 years. I receive comments on my hair color very day. \\&quot;Is that your real hair color?\\&quot; Sigh...Now I get compliments. It is faster than my curling iron and so much nicer results. The price was awesome. Beautifully packaged. Highy recommend for untreated hair for sure.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product..I highly recommend it for ladies who what to style their own hair like the salon...quality flat iron that comes with a convenient case.</li>
    <li> I am so happy w/my flat iron. it makes my hair beautiful. I had been thinking about cutting my hair short but now I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a straightener for awhile now and decided to purchase this based on the Amazon reviews. 3,000 people can&#x27;t be wrong, right? I have used this straightener twice and I was in awe at how amazing this thing is. Amazon, please make that 3,001 satisfied buyers. I have never heard of HSI before, but this straightener is clearly better than any name-brand straightener I&#x27;ve used in the past. I plan on buying the blow dryer as well.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is ok don&#x27;t see what the big deal is ..it works as good as any straighener i ever had</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this product I read a lot of the reviews. Most really liked the results the&#x27;d gotten so I decided to give it a try. I was in love with my old flat iron but after trying this product, it was out with the old and in with the new. I dont even miss my old flat iron. I am black and my hair is naturally curly and it coils when wet. I don&#x27;t get relaxers so my hair is super thick. I wanted somethng to give me that extra sleek, straight look. I knew after the first use that I had found what I was looking for. No one, including my own hairdresser has ever gotten my hair this straight. My hair is shiny, soft, and easier to manage because of this flat iron. I use to go to the hairdresser every two weeks not I can go every 3 or sometimes longer. There are times when I don&#x27;t go at all and am able to save some money. I would definitely recommend this product to those who are a little hesitant.</li>
    <li> I received my flat iron and was unsure about what all the hype was about.  Turns out I received a defective one.  However the company sent me out a new one right away and I have to say this is the best bit on money I have spent in awhile.  My naturally unruly hair is now sleek and straight.  This product definitely does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> This is a very good flat iron and value for the money.  The last flat iron I bought cost $120, but this one did just as good a job, if not better.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not sure why there are so many positive reviews for this product. Aside from looking nice the performance is just awful. The only redeeming feature is the small bottle of argan oil they throw in for free</li>
    <li> It actually makes my hair shiny and smooth. There is a major difference in my hair when I use this I love it. No more frizz or fly aways or even have to go over the same strand twice! The oil helps out 100%!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely needed this! It works so much better than my old flat iron that my niece forgot to return (teenagers). I also had a Instyler that I was in love with, but I like this much more because it can do what my Instyler didn&#x27;t like spiral curling. I also love that I can adjust the temperature! Great product overall! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is just what I expected.  It came quickly and it works perfect!  I got a great deal on it and am very happy to say the least!  It&#x27;s a solid flatiron, looks great and it has great heat but can also change it if it&#x27;s too hot for your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s amazing how it works, it really is professional... I used to flatten my hair in like 20 minutes or more... now in 5 minutes I&#x60;m ready to go!! There&#x60;s no doubt its money well spent. 100% recomendable :)</li>
    <li> Great quality and durable. Red light turns on when it&#x27;s on. Easy temperature button. Heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great size and straightens hair very well. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars bc I had some &#x27;fly away&#x27; hair in the front when I was done straightening. I didn&#x27;t used to have as much with my other flat iron but maybe it&#x27;s bc this one is ceramic? Either way, my hair looked great and it was really easy and quick to do. I have A LOT of hair and this flat iron really sped things up.</li>
    <li> I needed to upgrade my straightener and this was the perfect one to purchase on a budget.  Highly recommended; adjustable cord and heat settings are grea.t</li>
    <li> I have thick medium-length hair that has seen more than it&#x27;s share of color treatments and struggle to keep it looking nice.  This iron heats up really quickly and ready to go in seconds.  The adjustable temperature control is a plus and the ceramic iron glides smoothly even through my hair.  As described in one of the reviewers videos, it only takes about one or two swipes to get smooth, straight hair, so it&#x27;s much easier on my hair now.  This is a great product for the price and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron when my CHI gave up the ghost. I did tons of searching and finally settled on this product after much thought. Here&#x27;s my basic opinion -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is extra long. This allows it to be a perfect iron to use when styling another person, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The heat range is quite wide allowing for ideal use on many hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This iron was capable of making my hair very shiny and left lying perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A good weight, not light, not heavy. You know it&#x27;s in your hand, yet if you&#x27;re not paying attention and whack your stylee, you&#x27;re going to leave a mark!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Comes with a one year warranty. Just be sure to double check that the retailer is &#x27;allowed&#x27; to sell HSI products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; NO AUTO SHUT-OFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The plates themselves do take a moment long to heat up and require a few seconds extra between ironing layers of hair to get back up to heat, very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Seems like you must do smaller/thinner layers of hair, no big bunches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sleek look allows you to leave it out and it not be a hideous eye sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The plates are \\&quot;floating\\&quot;, this is supposed to allow one to maneuver strands of hair, honestly it allows loose strands to be caught and pulled easily, could be painful if your&#x27;re not paying attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this iron is usable every day, heats up while I&#x27;m doing other things nicely. Love I can lower the heat for my daughter and then turn it up to scorch my own hair. This came with a free small bottle of hair oil. LOVE it. I got this on special and paid 30 dollars, wonderful price, would buy it as a gift and as long as it lasts or the warranty is honored, will keep my good opinion. We&#x27;ll update if something goes wrong!</li>
    <li> I replaced my chi iron (after ten years) with this no name iron. I didn&#x27;t want to spend 100 bucks on another chi. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and it is working pretty well. Really no difference fr my old chi. It actually gets hotter which is nice.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever bought in my entire life and i have course curly hair.</li>
    <li> The HSI is everything everyone said it would be. An excellent choice. Straightens amazing. Love that it comes with its own case for easy storage. Super fast to style your hair. I wolud definetly recommend to all looking for a good device.</li>
    <li> This straightener was purchased to replace another of the same brand which I had purchased a year ago and which lasted only six months. I had purchased another, cheaper replacement but was never satisfied with the results. So I decided to purchase another of this brand to see if perhaps the quick death of the original was simply an anomaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally frizzy hair. This straightener smooths it very well. The best I&#x27;ve tried. I have taken my hair from a frizzy mess to straight and smooth without needing to take a shower and dry it \\&quot;straight\\&quot; first. Lovely tool. I hope this one lasts.</li>
    <li> Great value. Works as well as a professional flat iron but not the high end price. My only complaint is that it is a bit bulky and heavy.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical that this flat iron could be better than a Chi, but once I used it I was convinced. The ceramic plates made my hair so silky smooth! The only time my press comes out good like that is when I go to the salon. I have been using the same flat iron for over three years now, so it was definitely time for an upgrade. The price on Amazon was excellent. This flat iron is worth $200, but I only paid $35 on Amazon. There is even a Groupon deal for $45 right now. The argon oil that came with it was wonderful! Definitely the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I used to have a CHI turbo straightener, which lasted quite a long time, but I repeatedly dropped it on my bathroom floor and eventually it broke (totally my fault, obviously). I was prepared to buy another one to replace it because it worked perfectly on my medium-length and long hair (I used it throughout many hairstyles/lengths). However, I decided to check out if there were other options on Amazon, just to try something new. I saw that this one was rated very highly and decided to give it a shot. After using it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve decided that the CHI Turbo handled my hair much better. I feel like this straightener gives me many more kinks and requires me to go over sections multiple times, which then makes my hair frizzy and unkempt. I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for many years and have had a lot of practice, so I think maybe this straightener just doesn&#x27;t work well with my coarse Asian hair. If this one breaks, I will probably go back to the CHI, but it works decently for now.</li>
    <li> I have only had one other straightener--Revlon 2&amp;#34; with gold plates. It does a fine job but is quite big and I was looking to have a smaller easier to travel with iron. I also was hoping to get something a tad bit hotter but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to get hotter even on the highest setting. I have a lot of hair that is wavy but fine in texture. On the highest setting it is okay but I have to go over the hair (very small sections of it) multiple times. I am used to taking big chunks with one swipe in the other and the job is done in 10-15 minutes. With this it takes closer to 30 and still doesn&#x27;t straighten as well. I had high hopes given the reviews but I am just too lazy to sit there and take an hour to straighten my hair properly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for mothers day.  It was recommended by a co-worker.  She loves it and I&#x27;m loving the results!!!</li>
    <li> Is the best I ever use , I just started to use hair straightener for 9 months now and got 2 hair straightener by Revelon,  this is the third one and I should have got this one first and save a lot of money , because this is the best !!! Its makes my hair nice and shiny now frizzy and dull looking. I just love it love it love it !!!!!!!.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really tried to like this flat iron, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  No matter how hard I try to get it to the right temperature it just doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s either lukewarm, or burn my hair off temperature.  I don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews for this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Its just too much!! I love it! It brings gloves, an special oil and a lovely bag for it. Incredible price and great product! It also has a year warranty! Perfect iron!!</li>
    <li> Although this item works well it is larger than my old iron and weighs more, liked my old iron better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  It smoothes out her hair very nicely.  Her hair stays smooth even though she doesn&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works well.  It took me several tries to get the hang of using it but the product itself is worth the $$$</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron several weeks ago.. Just started using it the other day and I love the iron. It straightens my hair and also gives me that curl I want on the ends. This was a great buy I would recommend everyone to buy this flat iron..I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase! Glad I did my research on this product on YouTube..those ladies were not lying about this flat iron!!</li>
    <li> Great!!! This wave, straight and curl your hair + looks shiny and healthy and not burn and frizzy like with another brands...</li>
    <li> Ok over 3000 reviews you can&#x27;t go wrong! This flat iron is great. My hair stylist was going to buy this for me but amazon of course had for a much better price. I have long fine hair and it works great with out over heating my ends. It doesn&#x27;t take me much time with this flat iron to get my hair done. I also purchased the blow dreyer that goes with this and works great as well. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this item!</li>
    <li> Very good product! Not too harsh on my hair either, compared to others that i&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Would recomend this hair product to other people, family or friends.</li>
    <li> Very good straightener, straight hair in a single pass,even on curls hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase, and I recommend it! It heats up very quickly, can be set at different temperatures. Most is that it does not damage my hair, they are all soft after one pass. Do not hesitate!</li>
    <li> The Tourmaline Flat Iron does wonders to my hair. I&#x27; m loving it.. In the morning all I have to is... Plug it in and withing 15 minute I am all ready to</li>
    <li> Love it you can not find a better flat iron for the price!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your quick delivery. This was a gift and came in on time. I have bought one of these HSI Pro Ceramic Tourmaline about 6 years ago and mine is still working great! I really like this product and therefore, I bought one as a gift. Hope my niece likes it.</li>
    <li> thrilled with this product. love the red soft holder for it- so nice when i&#x27;m packing up (which is a lot) to throw it in and not have to worry about it. like the weight and think the price is right for this product. would highly recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> The previous flat iron I owned was nearly twice the price of this product and performed about the same as this one. I am incredibly satisfied with the quality and performance of this straightener in that it does not dry out or burn my hair when used. With the help of a little coconut/argan oil, this product does a satisfying job of leaving my hair with a soft, silky finish. The only critique I have is that it seems to take a lot longer to heat up compared to my other straightener on the same heat setting. But I can look past that because this product is phenomenal in quality for the price. Definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> I think the HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat iron is a very good product and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> It heats up really fast and straightens my hair within seconds.  My hair stays nice and smooth without feeling dried out from the heat.  I also like the automatic shut off feature where if you leave it on for too long it shuts off.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I never really write reviews, but I feel like this is being a &amp;#34;#1 best seller&amp;#34; I needed to. I&#x27;m used to Chi straighteners but I wanted to get a new one to switch it up. After reading all the reviews on so many straighteners, I decided to buy this one. It was a waste of money. The straightener does not get hot enough. It also slightly snags your hair at the ends so you can&#x27;t go too fast when you are staying you&#x27;re hair. I have really healthy long virgin hair and I feel like this straightener slightly damaged my hair. I will say that the oil and the glove they sent were great! But if you are looking for a reliable, non damaging straightener, keep looking or just stick with the one you&#x27;ve always used! Hope this helps someone! I have no idea how this straighten got such high ratings!</li>
    <li> Nice product, fast shipping, as expected.</li>
    <li> Ordered this straightener because I was traveling to Europe (Holland, France, Italy, and Greece) and I needed a straightener that I could ensure worked in those countries. I decided to buy this straightener since it would work in the US as well as overseas. It worked indeed as promised in all the listed countries as it worked in the US, all I needed was an adapter (no converter). Overall it&#x27;s a great straightener and what I love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t overheat or burn your hair.</li>
    <li> got this for my friend, she really loves it.  no  crimping or burning on the  hair during  the process, would recommend this product for you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist your time buying it. this the worst straightener hair I&#x27;ve ever tried. I bought it because I saw many good reviews so I just ignored the bad ones. But when it came and I got to try it, OMG, it&#x27;s horrible, the temperature drop all the time, it never stays for more than 1 min in 450 degrees. Just lost my time with this product. Fortunately Amazon&#x27;s refunded me back.</li>
    <li> I am not one to leave many reviews unless I have a tidbit of hopefully useful information. I am a 40 something surgery nurse and gardener who has worn a ponytail for 20 some years. Yes, my hair styling routine had gotten lazy and I had my hair all one length. I was ready to actually have a style and ended up going to 4 different stylists in a year. I wanted visible layers! What I got was razor cut layers that were supposed to shape my face and did not work on my hair. What I did know is that I didn&#x27;t like what these people were doing to my hair. What I didn&#x27;t know until the 4th girl, was that there have been alot of advancements in hair straighteners and dryers...hmmm. She showed me how to use a paddle brush and my hair was still frizzy after drying so she showed me frizz control solution and a newer straightening iron. Who woulda thunk it. I am not one to give up on an appliance of any kind until it dies on me and I have to replace it. Little did I know that my wet to style remington 1&amp;#34; curved plates was extremely outdated and was causing the problem!!!I now love my hair and my stylist because she took the initiative and the time to explain the benefits of an upgrade!!! Hairstylists are like nurses in that all people need discharge instructions in order to have a successful recovery. So please hairstylists, if you are wondering why people don&#x27;t come back after an initial visit...take the time to chat with your client while you are cutting to see what the expectations are AND what kind of antique appliances they are using at home! It may just get you more returns!!!</li>
    <li> Worked just as expected and a great value</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and the price is just a real bonus. I have very fine, treated hair and it works just great.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very, very dry.  I have tried many products to minimize split ends and breakage as well as styling techniques to minimize the amount of heat applied to my hair.  I have NEVER had the results that I have gotten since I started using this product line.  I LOVE it all...shampoo, conditioner, thermal protectant and leave in treatment.  I have resumed using my blow dryer and curling iron.  I simply cannot believe the difference!!  I absolutely love having long hair again!!!</li>
    <li> Though it was in working condition, had lot of scratches and looked used/old product. There was some kind of oil on the joints.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Tames my mess quickly and  has a very nice travel heat safe bag too!</li>
    <li> This is not a good flat iron. There are several things I do not like about this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is heavy. My previous flat iron was a lot lighter and easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;2. The plates do not close evenly, because of this the flat iron continued to snag and pull out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. The temperature dial is only labeled by the highest and lowest temperatures, so it&#x27;s hard to tell what temperature you are actually flat ironing your hair on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to using my FHI until I can save for a more expensive flat iron. I&#x27;m really disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I have curly medium length hair that needs a lot of heat to straighten out. After a good blow dry, this does the trick. Several heat settings makes this iron perfect for whatever day my hair is having. Love the pouch that came with it and the travel size argan oil. I just ordered a big bottle because it is excellent!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as great as I read it would.</li>
    <li> Great straightener!! Use daily and still working great!</li>
    <li> Very nice straightener, heats up fast, you can change the temp and has auto turn off. I have very curly hair and it works great. Best part I did not have to spend a lot of money on a good quality straightener!</li>
    <li> Great price, but honestly left my hair frizzy because it doesn&#x27;t tame humidity. The argon oil it came with barely helped either. It does the minimum job, but my hair isn&#x27;t like silky straight. It looks puffy even though my natural hair is pretty tame and slightly wavy so not super curly or thick.</li>
    <li> Delivery arrived right on time! Straightener looks chic and works really well even on extremely thick hair. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now, and so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;There was a bottle of oil, a glove, and a small pouch as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get that hot. It does the job, but I don&#x27;t feel the heat. I just go over my hair more than normal.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale and am very happy with it. I&#x27;m not sure I would have purchased it for regular price. But I saved over 50% and glad I did. It was normally over $150 and I paid $69 plus free shipping. It gets very hot and straightens hair effortlessly. Does not have automatic shutoff.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it.  Great product. mel961</li>
    <li> I purchased this ceramic flat iron for my own use at home.  I have dry, thick, curly hair.  It leaves my hair so shiny and soft.  I had bad experiences with flat irons in the past and it lead to breakage.  This iron, is so easy to use and the temperature goes up to 450 degrees.  I normally use the temperature setting of 400 or 430 degrees.  I use a spray on heat protector that increases the shine afterwards.  I also like that it shuts off after a certain amount of time and heats up quickly.  I just recommended this flat iron to my coworker who loves the way my hair moves and shines.</li>
    <li> It works fine.  It&#x27;s not as wide as I&#x27;d imagined.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
    <li> Nice straightener.  Wish it had automatic shut-off.  The glove and holder have come in very handy.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Thank you i am very happy</li>
    <li> excellent price, great tool</li>
    <li> Call me pleasantly surprised! For the price, I did not expect this quality. Purchased for my daughter who has very curly &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair. It blew through her locks and left them bone straight and beautifully shiny. Heats very quickly. Variable temps. Even heat on the ceramic plates. Well constructed - no corners or uneven areas that could catch or pull hair. Swivel cord is a plus. So far, we&#x27;re very happy with this flat iron. If anything changes, we&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
    <li> This are really good flat irons!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these flatirons. Did I tell you how much I love these flatirons? They are not only very light and easy to hold, but they heat up very fast and when you curl your hair with them the curls last and your hair has a shine. These flatirons are the best!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works really well and straightens my hair in one go! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fantastic! I can do my hair in 30 minutes which I have never been able to do with my standard hot plate flat iron. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon in a long time. I&#x27;m so glad I picked this flat iron</li>
    <li> This straightener gets plenty hot and is much more convenient than my last straightener (the buttons on my last straightener were on the outside so I would sometimes accidentally turn it off). However, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it glides through my hair...it just seems a little rougher than other irons I&#x27;ve used. Not that it&#x27;s painful, or looks like it&#x27;s damaging my hair, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth when I use it.</li>
    <li> It works well. I like the digital thermostat. It leav es your hair feeling silky smooth. I would recommend this product for the price.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not the flat iron for me.  The on switch is on the inside of the iron and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve forgotten to turn it off when I am done getting ready.  But what&#x27;s more dissappointing is that the unit doesn&#x27;t maintain its heat so getting ready in the morning takes a bit longer.  This may be a better product for those who don&#x27;t require the high heat intensity to get the smooth look that I&#x27;m trying to create</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;Basically works as well as the $20 straightener from a drug store that it replaced. All of the results show smooth hair because of the oil they give to you for free. In which case, go buy a bottle of argan oil and save your money on this straightener. A really good hair straightener can give you those results without the oil, as it claims to do. But this is not that straightener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American with extremely fine hair - not damaged or thinning, just baby fine, which hair stylists love for some reason.  I try to perm my hair no more than 4 times a year; however, I cannot stand when my edges get that &amp;#34;un-permed&amp;#34; look to them.  I have tried EVERY edge control, jam, jelly under the sun with no success. They all either flake or refuse to lay falt for longer than 5 minutes.  I have a regular sized flat iron, but it&#x27;s not good for my edges, and I tend to burn myself when I get too close to my scalp. After reading some of the reviews for this flat iron, I decided to give it a try.  I was AMAZED at how my hair look after my 15 min flat iron job!  My hair looked just as good, and even better, than some of my relaxers.  If I wrapped it at night, I was able to maintain my &amp;#34;permed&amp;#34; look for about a week - at this point, a few days would have been a success in my book. Also, I was surprised at how close I was able to get to my scalp without feeling the heat or burning myself - that is a rarity for me.  This flat iron is a definite must for us fine hair people!!</li>
    <li> I own (and love) a 450-degree HSI flat iron, so I bought this for my annual trip to Europe. It worked perfectly for a month and I have started using it at home. It&#x27;s great - and the price was fantastic.</li>
    <li> Wow. I used this  and my hair is huge and poofy and curly yet dry and frizzy, usually with the flat iron i used from the drugstore it took like over an hour to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This arrived quickly, and when I unboxed it it came with a nice red satiny baggy, which I still dont know what to do with, and a heat protecting glove which i dont use.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt use the argan oil sample since I dont use products with harsh silicones in it that arent water soluble.&lt;br /&gt;I straightened my hair in about 30min with this and it was shiny and soft and my hair didnt break as much as it did with my old flat iron, oddly. Im very impressed with the plates on this. Only question is how long it will last! Only in time can I find out.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!! I like that I can turn knob to the temperature I need.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because I wanted to curl my hair with it, I have no patience for curling irons/wands, and my 2&amp;#34; ghd is just too big to use for curling. The nice things about this straightener are that it heats up relatively quickly, and you can control the temperature. However, this straightener did a terrible job of straightening and curling my hair. After using it my already frizzy hair was extra frizzy and, when used as a normal straightener, did not do a good job of straightening. I was hoping the HSI professional would be a cheaper option for me to style my hair, but unfortunately I will most likely pay more money to get a better quality product.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with my purchase and the quality of my flat iron when I use it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. It Doesn&#x27;t glide through hair as easily, but for my budget and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length fine hair and needed a flat iron that I could control the setting on.  This professional iron is great!  Nice digital screen to control the temp.  I can set it low for my hair, but higher for my daughter, who has thick, long hair.  I haven&#x27;t had to turn it up high enough to use the glove that comes with it, but it&#x27;s in there too.  The Argan oil that comes with it is just a very tiny packet, but I got a few uses out of it and it&#x27;s good stuff.  You can curl your hair with this very easily, as well.  It glides thru without pulling or tugging and breaking your hair off!  I definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of reading before buying this flat iron.  I have never had one before and I needed a decent model that would be easy enough for me to use.  I read another review suggesting that the great price on this model was because it was an older model.  I think that if that it true, the older model was great and am thrilled to have it.  I like the heat settings available.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to upgrade from my crappy straightener!! It heats up quickly and does a fantastic job!</li>
    <li> Awesome iron for awesome price.</li>
    <li> I recently went and chopped all my hair off to a pixie undercut. I couldn&#x27;t find a &amp;#34;serious&amp;#34; 1&amp;#34; flat iron for the life of me, it shipped fast and saved me from a few bad hair days :)</li>
    <li> It a good Straightener but it does straighten my hair like my old one did.  It works well on fine hair but my hair is a bit more thicker and kinky than most types of hair. I ended up giving it to my little sister because her hair type is perfect for this Straightener and it works great on her!!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron it gets hot fast.  The oil was in a packet but you guys  sent me another one which by the way was opened and spilling in the package.</li>
    <li> I found that this hair straightener really does live up to its name. I definitely feel as though I just got my hair professionally straightened after using this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself only takes around 3-4 minutes to fully heat up, and you can choose the temperature that is suited to your hair. I also like that there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;sleep mode&amp;#34;, which is a timer that let&#x27;s the iron know when to turn off after a period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this flat iron over the expensive CHI brands because it gets the job done just as well, (maybe even better), and for this iron&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s a shame not to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I am quite the connoisseur of straighteners, after reading the reviews i thought i would give it a shot. It not only pulls your hair out, but it leaves it very dry and brittle feeling even with a heat protectant. My hair is pretty straight to begin with I just use a straightener to cut down on the frizz but this product was not much help!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!  I have very dry blonde hair, so I really needed an upgrade.  This is a great product, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron straightener!! I have never used a flat iron that runs through your hair so perfectly and keeps a strong lasting hold all day, even for days. Instead of tirelessly running the iron over and over through your hair, I only have to do it a few times for a perfect look that I desire. It works so well it saves me time. So with my highest recommendation of all flat irons,this one by far, is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, it actually didn&#x27;t pull my hair. but it&#x27;s not something to use everyday because I don&#x27;t want my hair to break.</li>
    <li> This iron is a solid economy option - for the price, it&#x27;s very good value. Without the Argan oil I found that my hair didn&#x27;t glide through the plates as it does with much more expensive irons. But if you&#x27;re happy to use the Argan oil each time, you will probably be happy with this product - especially on hair that isn&#x27;t overly thick.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. It heats up fast, is lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price. Very professional finish to the hair.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I owned</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with my HSI Professional ceramic straightener. Thank you so much for the price and quality of my product. I will by one for my daughter next month.</li>
    <li> Love that it is a great iron that I can change heat settings to lessen chances of heat damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> Very Light. The electronic display makes it super easy to read and adjust the heat settings. Makes the process very pleasant.</li>
    <li> This iron is amazing! I have really thin, curly damaged hair, and this iron leaves it flawless!! It&#x27;s even better now that I&#x27;m using Paul Mitchell&#x27;s heat sealant spray, I think it&#x27;s called spray and soft. Those two things combined turned my normally coarse unruly hair into a soft waterfall of majestic goodness.</li>
    <li> Flat iron arrived quickly, very easy to use. Heats up fast, adjustable temp. Seems to be working great, and a good value.</li>
    <li> Kept pulling my hair while straightening.  It&#x27;s ok for the price but definitely not better than the chi. Good for people with little or thin hair I think.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightner, does the trick, straightens hair very well. I just don&#x27;t like the fact that the cable is so super long, it gets in the way.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Best flat iron I have every purchased.</li>
    <li> Works great.....just what I expected.Got it quickly too. So far does exactly what it should straightens. Works better than the Chi I had previously.</li>
    <li> In general , I feel this one works fine and worth the money. Just not as good as Chi. I used Chi iron hair straightener from my friend and felt so great: It heats so fast and you see the perfect straightened hair. I guess that is why Chi is so pricey.&lt;br /&gt;This iron takes a bit long before you see the green light and while you are using it, it keeps returning to red. But with the sale price, I cannot complain.</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron exactly as described and in a timely manner. It gets super hot and gets my super curly hair straight without hesitation. I have mixed hair and it used to take several tries to get it straight with my last flat iron. I  am very satisfied and shocked at the price.</li>
    <li> It feels and looks professiona and works well.  It is better than other expensive products I tried in the past.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much since it cost less than $40, but needed one for my daughter. Surprisingly it did. It heats up uniformly and quickly straightens the hair- avoiding the damaging part of using a straightener. I loved it so much, I ordered 2 more.</li>
    <li> Heats up so fast and works really well to straighten, curl, flip, etc. I&#x27;ve never seen such a good price for a professional product like this.</li>
    <li> Great product, good value.</li>
    <li> l really love this flat iron. It straightens my hair in one pass and I like the adjustable heat setting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years and still works amazing</li>
    <li> First of all, holy moly fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the straightener is just okay. It is definitely not a $200 iron, and I wouldn&#x27;t pay a dollar more for it than I did. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m disappointed, but the reviews on here make it sound phenomenal, and that just isn&#x27;t the case. It does get hot enough rather quickly, but the plates are not as smooth as I&#x27;d like them to be, and the iron DOES snag the hair. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily pull it out, but it snags every time you pull it through. My hair is wavy and rather thin and manageable, so it is not due to the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, okay iron for the low price. Don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> oldest Grand daughter loves it</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron, comes with extras, I love it! Works great on my frizzy hair, Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, excellent buy for the money!!</li>
    <li> Good iron.  Safe for hair.  Im a professional stylist and this is a very good deal for the quality.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for the price.  Goes through hair much more smoothly (without catching and causing split ends) than retail store flat irons.  Does not have auto shut-off.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!  Shipped very promptly and exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> I like my product...my ends get stuck towards the end but other than, it&#x27;s a great buy! Fast Shipping. A</li>
    <li> After reading so many rave reviews, I had very high expectations for this product. It does heat up quickly and does the job, but not noticeably better than a cheaper straightener. The glove, pouch and oil were nice additions but not something I really need with a straightener. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fine product but nothing to brag about.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! GREAT value for an inexpensive price!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It does a great job straightening, but my favorite part about it is that I can curl my hair with no kinks because the wand is rounded. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Very very satisfied. The price wad too good to be true. But it was. A professional straightener for a wal Mart price. I love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, works very fast.  Be careful on the highest setting if your hair is damaged, it will singe it a bit - but this is clearly stated in the directions.</li>
    <li> Product just as described works great! Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Heats up in an instant!  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product is good but not great.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse hair and it straightens quickly &amp; easily in moderate sections.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and does a great job. I would have given it 5 stars if the plates inside were a little longer.  I&#x27;m still very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. When the box was opened,  we noticed the oil that was included had leaked out. The flat iron works great. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for another flat iron that cost me twice as much as this one. It works better than the one I had replaced. I am now a loyal customer. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works well, allows me to add a little curl if I want or go straight for the straight hair I want !</li>
    <li> Great product! Was nervous to buy because on a super sale but, best flat iron I have owned and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I did what is said it would do it straightened my hair like I just got a perm. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It works, although, I have had better ones. It doesn&#x27;t seem to straighten the hair with the first or even 2nd swipe. I liked the oil stuff that came with it. It arrived on time and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> My other straighteners used to make my hair smell like it was burning. The HSI Straightener does not make my hair smell. You have to make sure you completely dry your hair before using it otherwise it doesn&#x27;t completely straighten and I notice a couple dents in my hair that aren&#x27;t completely straight but, for the most part, it works.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price. My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I straighten my hair everyday and have tried multiple straighteners and this took a LONG time to straighten because it didn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t require multiple passes to straighten my hair (I have fine hair but lots of it).</li>
    <li> This product is fine - it works as stated.  I wish, however, I had bought the one with auto shut off.</li>
    <li> Definitely nothing like a CHI, but it does its job. I like the temp gauge &amp; it pulls out my hair less than my other flat iron, but still not a CHI. The argon oil also opened during delivery so I had to clean oil off of everything.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I couldn&#x27;t find a flat iron that worked well with my thick curly hair and after reading the reviews, decided to try this one.  I am very pleased with it and find that the comment that the handle gets hot during use seems not to be true for me.</li>
    <li> Love this, I&#x27;ve had it for a LONG time now (more than 2 years) and it still works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great heat controls, and comes with a safety glove and a tiny bottle of argan oil hair smoother. A great buy, really pleased!</li>
    <li> For those of you who are looking for a run-of-the-mill, drug store-ish flat iron ... this tool is perfect.  Although, I&#x27;m not sure why you would pay $30 + for something that is comparable to a 15.00 Revlon unit.  This purchase was really my fault, thinking I could go from a GHD to *this* ... but I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?!  Maybe it&#x27;s a good deal because they want to get their name out there.&amp;#34;  Haven&#x27;t we all learned that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is?  Wish I would have listened to my better instinct!&lt;br /&gt;  The worst part about the iron is the way this company attached the heating plates to the iron; it snags your hair ... EVERY TIME.  There are little edges to the plastic holding in the plates - and your giving your hair a good scraping every time you run it through a section of your hair.  Talk about split ends and damaged follicles - my stylist asked me if I&#x27;d been using an outdoor stick and household iron to style my hair.  Not good.&lt;br /&gt;  Avoid this &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; my friends - I fell for the hype, but it won&#x27;t happen again ... I&#x27;m going back to GHD.</li>
    <li> I like the box and Argan oil that came with the flat iron. The iron itself is very cute and very smooth running through my hair. Most importantly, it is easy to use and works very well. I would buy it again and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as descibed and actually delivered earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the HSI flat iron.  It heats up amazingly fast, in under a minute.  I set the temperature at about three quarters of maximum.  It straightens and smooths quickly and I have had no problems with burning.  The sample of Argan oil was a pleasant surprise.  I had expected a small one-use packet, but actually received a small bottle that lasts for several uses.  The bottle is perfect to save and refill to use for travel.</li>
    <li> I have super long wavy hair so I like that this is light weight and the heat level is good enough to tame my hair. I have had higher temperature flat irons so that is why I gave it 4 stars only.</li>
    <li> Great straightener!!  Probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than my previous flat iron and does not seem to get as hot but I am told this is better for my hair and my hair does seem to have less split ends.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and leaves my hair feeling smooth. It makes it look naturally straight even though I have curly hair. But it is a bit heavier than my previous straightening. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is a high-quality flat iron. After reading reviews on several different flat irons this is the one I chose. I don&#x27;t know that it works far better than any other flat iron but it does work very effectively and the fact that it came with the argon oil was a definite plus because I had no idea there was such a thing! I am pleased with the product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am new to hair ironing and I bought this because the one I had wasn&#x27;t working well. I have thick, wavy, often frizzy, hair. I&#x27;ve only used the HSI Professional once but I definitely liked the results and my hair has stayed fairly smooth overnight. Good product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience purchasing this product .&lt;br /&gt;It arrived promptly ( faster than expected) the mail packaging was In good condition. But easy to open .&lt;br /&gt; The item works as discribed ,easy use, does good job  and was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I want To  mention it has slightly rounded edges, so No square lines in your hair. Nice smooths lines.&lt;br /&gt;The hair oil is so good I&#x27;ve already order more.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this seller or the product .&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good iron for the price and like the idea of the travel bag!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. . .only problem I&#x27;ve had is it pulls my hair, I just noticed it is because the ceramic plate is broken lose from the top. Other than that it was great.</li>
    <li> Great for the Price!! Works well. I would like to get a large barrelled  curling iron (1 1/2 inch) in the same brand. Do they make a curling iron this size?</li>
    <li> Its a good product, and well worth the price. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for travel only, since it&#x27;s way more compact than the one I own especially with it&#x27;s little pouch and does convert to worldwide voltage, but am now using it every day and will give my old one away!  It&#x27;s amazing but even more amazing is the support I got from Blue Novelties.  The first one they sent me kept getting caught in my hair but I figured it was a case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; and was going to live with it and just use it for travel until I got an email from them insisting that they wanted me to be 100% satisfied with my purchase--I wasn&#x27;t and told them after which they sent me a replacement which is perfect.  Obviously the other one was defective.  This behaves just like the one my hairdresser uses on me--incredible!</li>
    <li> My daughter is a professional hair stylist and this was given to her as a gift. She said it is the best flat irons she has used and people often ask where did she get them. According to her these are some of the best curlers out there and her clients absolutely loves them.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Heats up very quickly, the cord is very sturdy thus far (Been using for approx 1mo almost daily with no issues). Makes my old straightener look like a barbie toy &amp; I paid just as much for my old one! I recommend this to anyone &amp; would buy the brand again if anything ever happened to my current one. And the special price I bought it at, I almost feel like I&#x27;m stealing it was such a bargain! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Got this for a couple reasons for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She needed a new one&lt;br /&gt;It was the best rated&lt;br /&gt;If it sucked and she didn&#x27;t like it easy return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it no risk so just buy. She seems to like the adjustable heat.</li>
    <li> I found this product through a friend who let me use hers. I have NEVER felt my hair so smooth and silky than it was after using hers - I have hard to control thick, coarse, curly hair and this iron made it salon soft - beautiful. Normally it would take me up to an hour to flatiron my hair, and it&#x27;s just below my chin (A-line) but with this, I was done in less than 30 minutes. One pass over each section was just about all it needed - not pass after pass after pass like I&#x27;ve had to do with my other irons. I needed to own this!  I found it here at such a great price and it&#x27;s a tool that actually works!  I will say that this iron is far better than any other high priced, top named flatiron out there.</li>
    <li> Fairly decent for the $40 I paid for it. For me, personally,  it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough even on the highest setting. However,  I am mostly satisfied with it. I owned a Chi for 8 years and this is a good substitution.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  This is my first flat iron hair straightener, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  I didn&#x27;t want to cheap out, but I don&#x27;t use this every day (I&#x27;m more of a pony tail girl), so I couldn&#x27;t justify spending a ton of money on it.  I just got it for styling my hair for special occasions (I I love flat iron curls!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews before buying it and I&#x27;m glad I decided to disregard the negative ones.  I don&#x27;t think it has any design flaws.  My hair slides smoothly through the plates without catching.  I have very straight, brunette hair.  It&#x27;s not super fine, but it&#x27;s not extremely thick, either.  I also love that it comes with a cute little storage bag.</li>
    <li> I have had a chi and also a few cheaper brands. This is by far the most superior. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. I have straight fine hair and it works magic.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have very think hair and it only takes one stroke and my hair is straight. No burning f any kind. Very much worht the money.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected and exactly as described. The hair straightener works very well! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flat iron. It is definitely of good quality and well worth the money.  I had an inexpensive flat iron. It is worth paying more for something like a flat iron I have found.  Especially if you want it to last.  I especially enjoyed the little &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; sample I was sent.</li>
    <li> Really good product.. works wonders! At first I was kind of hesitant to buy cause the price was so cheap but when I finally decided to get it and used it, I fell in love with it. It heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> I love it ! And its a great price.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality not top notch</li>
    <li> Good iron for the price---takes a little bit to heat up all the way but works well</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. It&#x27;s compatible to a Paul Mitchell or GHD.</li>
    <li> Product won&#x27;t even turn on. Fighting for my refund.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This item did no meet my expectations! I returned it</li>
    <li> This tool is like the one my stylist uses,I love it and the price was great.I have very fine hair and with all the settings, doing my hair was no problem.I highly recommend this one!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It does a good job for a $40 dll iron but please DO NOT compare her to a CHI or better quality ones.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon service it&#x27;s great, I received it the following day. However  I tried the hair iron this morning in a small piece of hair and you can see how it damages the ends of your hair right away, I can only imagine how my hair would get damage with often use.  I&#x27;m returning this item and buying a CHI.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! Great service and shipping!!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Very affordable and reliable. This is now my go-to straightener!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it still works like new.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I do not have to use high temperatures straighten my hair eventhough I growing out my perm.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron!!! In love with it. Ordered one for my daughter and friend. Worth every penny :)</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase of the HSI Professional Flat Iron my hair comes out so great using this iron along with the arrigan oil my hair is so silky shiny and looks so much heslthier just by using these products! So very happy i decided to buy this!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I&#x27;ve been wanting a flat iron for a quite some time but didn&#x27;t want to spend top $$$ for it. Was happy to see it was offered by Amazon at a very good price. The product is packaged very nicely and looks great. I think I need some practice styling my hair though which shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult. It works different compared to curlers. I know how to create volume with curlers. Not sure about the flat iron yet.</li>
    <li> It heats up really fast and has done a great job straightening my hair!  I love the oil and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The best flat irons I have ever used...They leave my hair looking very silky and bouncy....I recommend these for any hair type...</li>
    <li> I replaced my 10 year old CHI with this iron. I did not have the money to pay for a CHI. I read all of the reviews and felt pretty confident in my decision to purchase the HSI flat iron. I have used it a few times and it works as well if not better than my CHI. I love that it has adjustable heat. I would not hesitate to purchase again or recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron.  The glove is nice too.  It works great on my naturally curly hair.  It leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Iove the adjustable clamp and long cord. Also love not getting burned from a curling iron anymore!</li>
    <li> Very well made, heats quickly. This iron is everything the reviews promise and more. I love the swivel cord feature.</li>
    <li> Flat irons was great however Trial oil was not what expected it was in a tiny perfume sample pack not a bottle</li>
    <li> They are the best for the price.  They work wonders and make your hair shine.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased.  Definitely did the job as I have very thick hair and the shine it brings out is great!  Have received many compliments on my hair when I straighten it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> My wife had a Chi iron that broke, so she tried this instead of another $200 one, and she thinks it&#x27;s just as good. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Chi!</li>
    <li> Works fine. Seems to loose heat after a while of using (had around 1-2 months now and have had to turn up dial slightly)  Takes a while to heat up fully but overall, solid little guy with great price.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews, cross checking with You Tube videos. I have to say I am very happy with this product. Although it lacks a dial to tell exactly how hot the flat iron is, I experimented moving the dial until it reached the desired heat setting. My hair looks great and I could not be happier. I recommend this product and thank everyone for the reviews that gave me the confidence to buy and use this product.</li>
    <li> i had a Chi, wanted to buy something comparable. love it and still use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I am very happy so far with the HSI flatiron. I am anxious to see how the dual voltage works on an overseas trip!</li>
    <li> Iv had the flat iron for about 3 weeks now, and it all of a sudden won&#x27;t turn on. It&#x27;s broken</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener. I ordered one originally that I was not overly happy with. I contacted Blue Novelties and they were very helpful. The replacement iron is great! I would highly recommend both the business and the product.</li>
    <li> So I gave the HSI Pro Flatiron 5 Gold stars because it works like a charm and i only paid $30.00 for it WOW! Its great quality you can tell once you unwrap the product and take it out the velvet case that it comes with that its going to be a joy to use. Turns on and heats up in a flash. Its also great for travel not bulky nice and slender.&lt;br /&gt;BUY BUY BUY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this straightener for a few trips outside US, and a definite plus is that it works on 110 and 220V.  But the hair doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it does it does with the CHI straighteners, which is what I use when I am not traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this three years ago and it&#x27;s still working great! I have extremely thick and curly hair and it does a really good job of straightening without having to spend too much time. The only downside is that I have noticed that in the past year it hasn&#x27;t been staying hot for as long (It takes me around 30-45 mins to straighten all my hair and I usually take one or two breaks to let it heat up a little more). I was originally choosing between this and a CHI but went with this due to Amazon reviews and I don&#x27;t regret this decision.</li>
    <li> I originally received a defective unit and they reached out to me and got me a new unit ASAP. The new unit arrived and worked great. I not only ended up with a great product but their customer service left me with a great experience. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This thing comes pretty darn close to being as good as my Chi and I never thought that I would replace my iron within anything esle but another Chi. This thing provides a sleek finish and I love the scent of the oil that came along with it.  I didnt give 5 stars because even though the gage says it reaches 400 degrees I dont think that it actually gets that hot.  I didnt have to use the glove that came with it.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no way this is a $200 straightener!  I bought this because I thought I&#x27;d be saving $160, but the quality of the straightener is less than a $40 straightener.  It feels like cheap plastic.  It does straighten, but I&#x27;m disappointed in the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Heats up nice and quick.&lt;br /&gt;Makes ur hair super shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;May turn on on its own (i accidentally pushed on button in drawer) so better to unplug even tho it automatically shuts off&lt;br /&gt;Hair may get stuck in btw ceramic plate and iron so avoid extending hair out of the plates</li>
    <li> I googled &amp;#34;top flat irons&amp;#34; and found this one so highly recommended. I was super excited that it was half the price of the one I really wanted. I read all the reviews and everyone seemed so satisfied. I hated it. It took twice as long to straighten my hair with this HSI ceramic flat iron than it did with my 10 yr old Chi ultra. I thought it was just a bad first run, so I borrowed my friends Paul Mitchell flat iron. I did the left side with the paul mitchell and the right side with the HSI and I had to run the HSI over my strands 2-3 more times than the Paul Mitchell. It was also a rough run through, I felt like it was catching and pulling my hair. I ended up returning the HSI. I&#x27;ll pay double to do half the work.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when this came in because I&#x27;ve heard great things about if, but mine doesn&#x27;t work. It won&#x27;t heat up. I hope they will give me refund.</li>
    <li> i bought this product because it also workded overseas.  I checked online and amazon reviews and bought two.... i am glad because the product works really well and price was awesome!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my niece to replace her &amp;#34;croc,&amp;#34; and she has complained relentlessly. We think her hair looks adorable, but the whining is killing us! Her Mother is sending it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a CHI flat iron for about ten years (well, two over ten years time). I always thought they were the best and I begrudgingly tried something else this time. I didn&#x27;t have the money for the CHI, so I bought this one instead. I LOVE IT! I like that it shows the temperature and it works really well. I also find it easier to handle. One concern: the buttons are not on the outside, but next to one of the ceramic panels. I&#x27;ve gotten use to it, but it threw me at first and if small logistical things like that really upset you, you might not like it. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase though. I&#x27;ve only had it a few months, but I use it every day. And I hope it lasts as long (or longer) than the CHI I originally had.</li>
    <li> Great product and value for money.  I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to spend more money to get a better product but these are fantastic.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is just OK.  It&#x27;s price is good, but it doesn&#x27;t function the way I had hoped. The main thing I don&#x27;t like is the narrow opening of the wand; it&#x27;s a little tricky to get it wrapped around your hair.  Also, the opening is so narrow that turning the wand on/off and adjusting the temp is not easy...not easy to get your finger in the slot and not easy adjusting or seeing the temp.  Although it heats up to 450 degrees, it doesn&#x27;t not seem as hot as my U.S. Chi that I burned up in the wrong electrical outlet in Rome.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed over all.</li>
    <li> I purchased a salon straightener that cost $150, and it never really worked, so I just used my curing iron to get rid of my fuzz which, obviously, worked only &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  I finally replaced it with the HSI straightener, and it works great!  The oil that comes with it is very important to the over all look as well.  I am extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> The temperature doesn&#x27;t stay at what I set it to.  Mine goes to 450 degrees but when I&#x27;m using it the temperature starts to drop and I have to constantly put the temperature back up.&lt;br /&gt;I have long really thick hair and it takes me about 30 to 45 mins to straighten. I know it automatically shuts off when you don&#x27;t use it for a while but I don&#x27;t understand why the temperature drops when I&#x27;m using it!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this straightener, one for myself and for my cousin &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;. The HSI PROFESSIONAL is a great product, what an amazing deal.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to using a CHI. The price is so much better, but the quality is just as good... if not better!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend purchased this for me, and it did a decent job straightening my hair, though not as good as the Sedu flat iron I had previously. Unfortunately, it suddenly stopped working after 6 months. Note that I only used it once or twice a week, so it&#x27;s truly unacceptable for it to stop working after so few uses.</li>
    <li> great product, very easy to use, quicker reaching the temperature than other brand which I used before. I love it.</li>
    <li> I needed one desperately. This one came at a great price. It heats fast and it does the job. Would recommend to my friends. :)</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It warms up quickly and stays hot! Perfect becaue I didn&#x27;t have to spend 100$ or more to get it !!</li>
    <li> This little straightener has mmultiple settings and super fast heating! The cord twists around at the source and does not get all kinked up.. You can use it while traveling over seas too. Would absolutely recommend this any day!</li>
    <li> I bought one a few months ago, and just bought another one. The first one has a digital screen display and a button (on/off/heat selection). Now the second one doesn&#x27;t have a digital display, and has a jog dial to adjust the heat in stead. I paid the same price though.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, hair comes out super shiny and no bad smell!  Only issue is it doesn&#x27;t have a lock button and I wish it has the led indicator.</li>
    <li> It works okay but not as smoothly as my 12 year old Chi which I had to get rid of because it burned out. Wish I had spent the extra money to get the Chi. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I choose the product after much research on the plates. I will recommend it to anyone with long care that cares enough about the long term exposure to heat.  It gets hot really fast and I love the red sack that comes with it.  I am still wondering if there is a cordless version of this I can only think of how wonderful would that be :))</li>
    <li> Works great for me! I use it at the highest temp and my hair looks like a hair stylist did it. Since I&#x27;m definitely no hair stylist! Didn&#x27;t take long either.</li>
    <li> I had recently purchased this straightener for my daughter and decided to try it for myself before purchasing.  I had a less expensive straightener and didn&#x27;t have the best results.  My hair is thin and straightens quickly.  My daughter&#x27;s is thicker and has a natural wave to it, but the adjustable heat setting makes this a great product for both of us.  It left my hair smooth and soft, without drying it out or pulling on it.  The iron presses together evenly, without the gaps from other irons.  It has been a great product for both of us.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for about a week now and it works wonderfully.  It works especially well when you use it with the argan oil that came with it.  Gives your hair a smooth shiny finish!</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best by far. It works wonderfully. Never pulled hair and always have a smooth shiny finish. I have very fine thin hair and its still the best straightener I have ever used. Only complaint is I have had it for a year and half and it just quit working. Warranty only last one year so a little disappointed with that. Bought a different straightener this time and not as happy possibly thinking about buying another hsi.</li>
    <li> Does not stay hot thru the whole straightening process. I can only do half my hair then I have to wait for it to reheat. The whole unit gets hot and is hot when you are holding it.  My hot tools straightening iron is a lot better then this one. I was expecting this one to be better.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron...easy to use and heats up quickly. It looks good too. The purchase came exactly when it was expected.</li>
    <li> As a newbie to flat ironing this unit is easy to use, heats up super fast, is not heavy and is dual voltage.  Best of all possibilities!  The glove and carrying pouch are great, very helpful additions.  Arrived quickly and have been happily using it ever since!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Grear product for the price! Would definitely recommend! I&#x27;ve only used high end straighteners and this one compares to all of them!</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with this HSI  Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. The iron heats quickly, is easy to handle, does a great job on my hair and was not expensive. I couldn&#x27;t ask for any more.</li>
    <li> We are really happy with this product. It arrived on time, and in perfect condition. This is the third time we are buying this product. First two we bought just based on Amazon Reviews, and we gave them as gift. Our friends gave very positive feedback about this product, thus, I ordered for myself. It is really good, and do the work in less than a minute. I always use the HSI oil before using the flat iron. That makes a lot of difference.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this flat iron straight it perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Thank-You!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. She is happy with. Her only complaint has been that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt her hair.</li>
    <li> Love it,  probably the only straightener that doesn&#x27;t burn or have the burning smell of burnt hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair shinny love it</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this flat iron. The other day I put my hair up wet all day but wanted it down at night. This flat iron removed the &amp;#34;kinks&amp;#34; from my hair being up all day. Day to day I&#x27;m not getting all the hype but was impressed with that one detail.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I love HSI professional . I like so much that order one for my daughter and one for myself.</li>
    <li> Heat up fast, went through hair real smooth, only took about 2-3 passes per section. Glove and case was a great touch.  will buy another for my daughters.</li>
    <li> Money saving, no more salons</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this straightener is amazing cause I&#x27;ve had better. The best straightener I have ever had was a sedu.  After you were done you&#x27;re hair looked and felt so smooth and amazing.  I guess u get what you pay for though.  It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s just a regular straightener that does the job.</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron is amazing!! I absolutely love it! It heats up very fast. I have thick, natural wavy hair that tends to frizz and look dry about 2 hrs. after styling..but not now!! MUCH better than my Chi!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Heats quickly and performs well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 14 year old daughter. She&#x27;s got thick, course, kinky hair and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful professional style straightener!  I love the heat control knob.  This makes it very fast and easy to switch temps.  I also like the snug fit of the panels...this helps the hair stay put while straightening.  Once straightened my hair looks great and stays smooth even in high humidity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the straightener for a few weeks now and I love it! I had a chi before and it lasted me a good four years but I didn&#x27;t want to buy another because it was so expensive. This straightener works just as well,it was very cheap and it came with argan oil! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the money but not as good as a chi hair straightener. My gf testifes to this.  Good buy tho</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron. Cord gave out on my old Chi. This one is highly rated and nicely priced. It works well. Has a temp control. Comes with a nice bag for traveling. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I am so satisfied with this product, my teenagers have always used a Chi and this is as fab as the Chi. The price is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who has teenage girls or anyone who straightens their hair.[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]</li>
    <li> The straightener comes as described and works perfectly. Very ergonomic also. I got it in 3 days, with a starter of HSI Argan oil bottle, free of charge. I am super satisfied with the product and the service.</li>
    <li> I love this iron, its so easy to use and makes my hair very silky and shiny, would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This replaced my CHI that I&#x27;ve had for at least 7 years. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month but it works great! So far, I think it&#x27;s worth the money and the reviews are accurate!</li>
    <li> I ordered it, and it said new!! I got it and it had scuff marks on it and it deffintely looks used. I was very upset. The straightner does not keep my hair straight. It takes almost 5 min. To heat up. Im am not happy at all.</li>
    <li> I love the new HSI Flat Iron!!! It works great, and I&#x27;am very pleased with my purchase. It doesnt feel like its damaging my hair like so many of the products out there. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought an expensive straightener before and wasn&#x27;t sure which brand or style to go with. I&#x27;m glad I came across this one and after reading reviews I was convinced. It&#x27;s easy to use, fast, and gives amazing results. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my chi for over 5 years!! i loved it. I wasnt sure what i wanted to replace it with until i read all of the reviews on here. So i bought this one... and im not disappointed. I think its better than my old chi to be honest. My hair is very shiny and soft. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have not yet tried the straightener because I purchased it as a back up to my current straightener. However, I am extremely pleased with the customer service that they provided. It was great to have so much contact with a seller on Amazon. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Maybe not the worst straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned, but in close runnings. The worst part about this flat iron is that on high heat settings, after you straighten one strand of hair, it goes back to the red (not ready) light, and instantly cuts off heat.... You have to sit the flat iron down and wait for the green (ready) light to come on. In the end, my hair looked great. But took probably FIVE times as long as any other straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have never used a chi but this was a big step up from the cheap $20 hair straighteners that you find in the drugstores.  One thing I don&#x27;t like about this is my hair gets caught on the sides of the plates.  Other than that, for the price it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> The same day I threw my old flat iron straightener in the trash, I saw an ad for this iron.  I ordered it and it arrived even quicker than I anticipated!  At first, I was put off because the iron was smaller than my previous one, but once I used it I knew it was a huge improvement!  I could feel from the weight of it that it was a better quality iron.  I love it!  It works smooth and fast.</li>
    <li> I searched high and low for the perfect flat iron and I stumbled across this product. I&#x27;ve never heard of HSI, but then again I&#x27;m not really into a lot of the main hair care and styling brands. After reading the reviews and looking at the price, I decided to buy it. This is my very first flat iron, and after using it everyday since I&#x27;ve gotten it, I&#x27;m so happy with my decision. It leaves my hair softer and silkier than their metallic counterparts. And the most surprising thing is that it heats up SO fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside part stays cool enough to handle, which makes straightening and styling a breeze. I also love the glove that comes with it to protect my free hand from the heat of my hair while styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about it--the temperature control, fast heating, swivel cord, and the amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, HSI Professional :)</li>
    <li> After my expensive flat iron died, I decided to take a chance on the HSI Flat Iron. I could not be more pleased! It works better than the more expensive flat iron and does not dry out or fry my hair in the least, which is fantastic since I have extensions. It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with a great travel bag and sample size of the HSI Argan oil. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have wavey hair.I have never before use a flat iron that straighten my hair like the HSI. This is the best flat iron I have ever used!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice Iron.  Wish it had auto off switch.</li>
    <li> My order came with a small sample bottle of argan oil, which I loved, and a glove. I received the order sooner than expected. In regards to the actual product, the only issue I have with it is the heat. I have to use it at 400 F degrees (maximum heat setting) which I hate because I know the damage it&#x27;s doing to my hair but it becomes more difficult to straighten my hair if I use it on a lower heat setting. I have &#x27;Kerri Russell&#x27; hair so it&#x27;s not really hard to straighten just very tedious. I was using a herstyler straightening iron before switching to this one and I could set the temperature close to the lowest heat setting and it would get the job done. I feel like this iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other irons I have used in the past which may be a good or bad thing but despite having to use it on the highest heat setting it is functional. Also, I chose this iron because when I did a search for it, it came up as a tourmaline ceramic iron , but nowhere in the packaging does the word &#x27;tourmaline&#x27; come up. So I think it really just is a ceramic iron. Overall it&#x27;s an okay product but I was content with how well the shipper or distributor of this product delivered.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Granddaughter ,and works perfectly , great quality, easy handling, very professional, incredible price, and my granddaughter looks very nice,</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener because my other straightener wasnt doing the job anymore. I really like how smooth and shiny this straightener makes my hair look and feel. So far so good!</li>
    <li> We love this flat iron!  My daughter has wavy hair and I have very curly dyed hair.  It works great on both of us.  We are very pleased with it.  I was surprised how well it worked on my hair.  Anyone with naturally curly dyed hair knows how hard it is to straighten it and it look good.  This iron is great :o)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my HSI flat iron - would recommend to a friend.  The product does not feel light-weight and cheap yet it is not heavy or cumbersome to use.</li>
    <li> I have always purchased the cheapest flat irons possible. However, I&#x27;ve also loved how the professional stylists always have the best flat irons. So I decided to research and find a professional flat iron hair straightener. Luckily, I found HSI The Styler at a reasonable price. It works great on my thick hair. My hair is so thick that other straighteners hardly worked, but the HSI gets hot enough to straighten my hair on the first couple of strokes. I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone with thick or course hair, or even thin hair since it has an adjustable heat setting.</li>
    <li> Works just like the $100.00 dollar mall irons.</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my mother in law.. She seems to be very pleased and as well as I because I saved alot of money.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was easy to use. I feel that it is presented well and the bag to keep it safe is cute as well! I would recommend the HSI flat iron.</li>
    <li> I used this once when I first got it and it worked okay but didn&#x27;t get very hot.  I pulled it out again about a month later to use and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  I&#x27;m past the time period allowed to return the item so I am left with a broken product and am very unhappy.  Would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> What an amazing flat iron at an equally amazing price, plus it came with argan oil and a glove to use. This flat iron truly compares to the $200+ models found out there, it smoothed my hair in minutes and when I was done (like 3 minutes total for long brown hair, it looked like I just had a professional blowout. I went out to dinner that night and received comments on how my hair looked so health and full! I am so please with this purchase, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have uneven wavy hair, parts of my hair are really wavy while other areas are straight.  Instead of straightening it with a brush and blow dryer, I opted for this.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy the larger size flat iron because of the weight while holding it.  My sister has a bigger iron but it takes the same amount of time to striaghten your hair properly.  She prefers this one over the one she has.  This also had a free sample of hair lotion, wasn&#x27;t enough for my whole head of hair since my hair is around my waist. I used it around my bangs and it actually does give some kind of healthy shine to it.  Also include is a travel pouch. I was quite surprised on the quality of the flat iron. The plastic is more rubberized and easy to grip without worrying you will drop it.  It didn&#x27;t run hot when I had it on the highest setting, not that I could feel.  I looked at the iron plates and it didn&#x27;t leave stains from the use of the oil like other flat irons.  I haven&#x27;t had it that long so I can&#x27;t really comment on the durability or how long it will last.  But I figure it would last longer than I expect because of the quality of the material used to make it.  If you have Long hair, curly hair, thick, coarse or combination - expect to take some time doing your hair properly.  I forgot to mention that the on/off button and heat controls are on the inside of the handle so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accident settings change.  A drawback is if you have larger hands, you could burn yourself accidentally if you are not careful but the controls are distanced far enough from the plates that I wasn&#x27;t too worried.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works wonders on my spiral curls!  In no time flat I have straight shiny hair.  You can tell this is a professional flat iron.</li>
    <li> Read great reviews on this item and decided to try it rather than a Chi and other \\&quot;professional,\\&quot; over priced straighteners. The results are fantastic. My wife can tell a difference between the tourmaline and basic ceramic plates. It feels healthier and less frizzy. The floating plates are also a great feature to ensure even heating. Although simple, the swivel cord is really nice to have too. Comes in a nice package including sleeve, glove, and oil.  The adjustable heating knob is perfect for all types of hair to get the best, customized experience not at the expense of your hair. Would buy again and recommend to others. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several expensive flat irons for my daughter and she is really pleased with how the &#x27;HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch&#x27; compares to the Paul Mitchell and Chi that she has used.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does a great job at straightening my hair without leaving a burned smell unlike the Herstyler</li>
    <li> got it on time a great price and my daughter was thrilled with it i couldnt buy anything close to that for the price</li>
    <li> I loved the package it came in, the argon oil smells really good compared to others that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t dislike the HSI Professional straightener but I can&#x27;t say it is better than a Chi.  I have the setting up to highest setting and u would think it would burn my hair or be to hot to the touch but it does neither .  I do wonder if it really gets as hot as it states it does.  The good part is my hair is fairly straight so it does not require extreme heat to get it mostly straight but it takes several strokes to get there.  I paid $40 ish dollars and u feel I got my money worth but if I paid what they are suggesting retail price be I would ask for a refund.  So I rate it average!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 23 y o daughter for Christmas.  She had an inexpensive one that she didn&#x27;t like very much.  She loves this one and has been using it everyday.  Heats up quickly and gets very hot.  Hair appears shinier as well.</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it is not the same I ordered . I do not know if it is ok or not .</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing!  It arrived very quickly, and the argan oil sample and travel pouch were very nice as well.  Recommend very highly!</li>
    <li> I have very very thick, very curly, coarse hair. I have never been able to affectively straighten my hair before. I have tried many different forms of straightening and flat irons over the years but my hair has never been truly straight. After over two hours of straightening my hair would still be bushy and there wouldn&#x27;t be movement or much shine. I&#x27;d always be disappointed and feel like straightening wasn&#x27;t worth the time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I tried this! It&#x27;s fantastic! I read so many reviews that I thought just maybe it really works....and it does! It&#x27;s unbelievable! My hair looks like I was born with straight hair. And instead of taking hours it only takes about 45 minutes. That probably seems like a long time, but I have so much hair. I bet it&#x27;d take a lot less time for an average amount of hair. My hair is soft, shiny, has movement and stays straight until I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this twice now and I only have one complaint. While using it, it will turn off and the reset button will pop out. But I just have to reset it and it&#x27;s good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I love it! If you feel you have hair that a flat iron will never work on give this one a shot. It might just finally do the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my mother and she loves it. It works very well and the price was great.Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have tried several straighteners. This one actually works~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the ultimate consumer :).....and finally found a product that delivers....</li>
    <li> Works great.  Daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch .&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied with the description prior to buying it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful product and works very well on my thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to use it easily and it gives me the results I seek, Shiny Straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
    <li> I had previously spent upwards of 300$ every couple of months to get my hair chemically straightened, but this produce does allow me to skip that. I can dry my hair on lower heat setting now and still get the frizz out. The flat iron does not catch and pull my hair like others due and leaves it shiny and straight. I just took about 10 minutes for this step after blow drying, and my hair is very thick and long. It&#x27;s better than the one at my salon.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife. Nice solid feel, easy to hold and looks expensive. Wife loves it. Makes me look like I know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that great of a straightener but for the price, it&#x27;s pretty good. A lot better than the ones you would get at Walmart.</li>
    <li> this flat iron allows for temperature options, it is powerful yet gentle on the hair.  I like the dual voltage.</li>
    <li> Forgot to review... nice and excellent product</li>
    <li> After reviewing many hair straighteners, I decided to go with the HSI model as it was top rated on Amazon.  I had used one before that worked really well WHILE it worked, but stopped working after a day.  This one was not even half as effective as the one I had originally used.  It is EXTREMELY awkward to adjust the temperature control as it is INSIDE the iron.  They could not put in on the outside where it is easily accessible?  It took many pass through s in order to get any straightening, but the absolute worse part was that at the end of every attempt to straighten, it would pull/pinch one strand of hair.  EVERY TIME.  It was kind of like a mini-torture and I cringed after each pass.  I did think it might stop, but it happened every time.  The only reason I gave this two stars was that I did like the pouch, glove and conditioner that came with it,.  Alas, I am sending it all back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sedu and Chi brands and I have to say that this one is missing the mark. I guess you get what you pay for. It didn&#x27;t move through my hair as smoothly as the others and didn&#x27;t leave a shine like the others. It had to go back.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener as a gift for my daughter. She is very happy with how quickly it heats up and it does a great job of straightening her medium to thick long hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best flat iron around. It is as described and works incredibly well. We have used other flat irons and they are not as well constructed. Save your time and money and just go with this one.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and often flat irons just kink it and don&#x27;t give me any body. This HSI is amazing! With the curved edges, I can use it for curling or straightening. I used to use several irons with my straighter, now I use one tool for my hair, this one! It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, and the style and even waves/curls last all day long. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made for a styling tool. I haven&#x27;t tried the oil in my hair yet, as with fine hair, it can be a challenge, but I use the oil on my tattoos and on my face for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I tried the Argon oil and it worked nicely on my fine hair without making it all limp and sad. Just don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
    <li> It works really well! I love it :)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this item, it looks and feels like a good quality hair straightener and does a very good job. I have never used an expensive hair straightener myself(just seen my daughters) so not able to compare the use of the two but very happy with the outcome on my hair with this one. The little bottle of oil that came with it is a bonus and will buy buying more of the same oil.</li>
    <li> This straightner is wonderful! And you just cannot beat the price. i have very naturally curly hair. i was so shocked to see it turn out beautifully smooth and straight with this product - and without any damadge!</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  I bought this on a lightening deal and feel that I paid a fair price for it, but it does not have features I would expect it to have given it&#x27;s list price.  For example, the temperature selector shows that the iron heats to 410 deg at it&#x27;s highest, but gives you no indication on the dial any other temp at any other point from beginning to the 410 deg mark.  The iron comes with a satin case for storage and a heat resistant glove to assist with certain styling techniques.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It heats up quickly and does not pull hair. Leaves hair very smooth and straight.</li>
    <li> My Chi died and I didn&#x27;t want to spend another hundred dollars to replace it so, after reading the reviews on here I decided to give this one a try.  It really does a good job straigtening my hair, which is thick and semi curly.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced straightener.</li>
    <li> I spent years straightening my hair with a curling iron, because I couldn&#x27;t conceive of how a straightener would really make it look any different. And I still can&#x27;t tell you how it does, or what the difference is. But it does, and there is one. I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments as I have since I bought this -- definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This really is a fantastic flat iron. I actually have four flat irons and this one is the best. (I travel). It&#x27;s very well made, doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair. Heats up really fast!</li>
    <li> I feel silly writing a review considering the huge number of reviews that have already been posted, but here goes:  At 65, this is the first time I&#x27;ve considered straightening my hair; however, I really wanted a new look!  I thought this process would be very expensive, but was pleasantly surprised to find such a good price on a quality hair iron.  Although I have nothing to compare it too, it works very well, is easy to use and my hair&#x27;s condition is better than ever (no frizz or dryness and lots of shine).  I read all the suggestions on how to best dry and straighten hair, but I don&#x27;t like to spend that much time; therefore, I made modifications to suit my needs and still get great results.  I let my hair dry naturally for as long as possible and then blow dry it without a brush, so my hair is curly/wavy when I get down to business.  In addition, I don&#x27;t pin my hair up in layers during the straightening process.  I used the Argan sample and ordered a 4-oz. bottle; it appears to work as intended, so I don&#x27;t plan to try other leave-in products.  Despite my &amp;#34;shortcuts,&amp;#34; I manage to get straight hair fairly quickly and have received rave reviews from family (husband) and friends.  I feel younger and more sophisticated with my new style.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item on December 8th and it was great until it stopped working this morning.  I have no idea why and would like a replacement as it is only two months old.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It does not work; I mean it doesn&#x27;t even turn on!! The red light appears, indicating that it is receiving power but, it does not heat up at all...zero.cold.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality flat iron.  The temperature control feature is excellent and the glove protective of my hand.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy and this straightens it out without burning it. I had a Chi before, but this is ten times better! I love this product and will recommend it to everyone! I love it!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she claims it&#x27;s the best straightener she&#x27;s ever used. Because of that, and the low price, I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a new flat iron!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I have not used the oil yet but curling my hair with a flat iron is super easy!</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron as a gift from my big bro. Extremely happy with it, very smooth and gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, I was very pleased! I loved the straightener and it worked very well. Then one day, I left the iron plugged in on accident and came back a few hours later to see the red light on, even though I turned it off. The iron somehow turned back on itself and almost could have caused a fire in my home. The heat caused a slight burn mark on my counter top and this weird white color started to spread on it. I was very disappointed and returned it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> It would be better if it had an automatic shut-off.</li>
    <li> New post 2/17/2013&lt;br /&gt;Blue Novelties sent me a new iron to replace the defective one I initially received on 1/28.  Unfortunately, the package was short $0.15 postage and USPS would not deliver.  After going back and forth with the post office for about a week I finally received my flat iron on 2/12.  Blue Novelties did credit my account a small amount to compensate for the hassle.  Ultimately, the flat iron works just as well as my chi but this was by far the most complicated amazon transaction I have ever been apart of.  I&#x27;m sure my experience was an isolated experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New post 1/28/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service department at Blue Novelties (amazon seller) contacted me after reading my review and is sending me a new iron free of charge.  I&#x27;m hopeful that this one will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original post 1/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chi iron was starting to look pretty worn back in july so I bought this as a replacement.  I finally got it out of the box today (the chi lasted another 6 months) and only one side of the iron gets hot.  It&#x27;s too late to return it to amazon and the warranty says I have to pay $20 shipping and handling to get a replacement.  Not happy and will be contacting the manufacturer tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of the rave reviews. The shipping was insanely fast, I got it the day after I ordered it (that is what the star is for). Less than a month after use, I plugged it in to get ready for a date.. and it didn&#x27;t turn on! I thought it could have been my outlet, but when I plugged a curling iron into the outlet, it turned on fine. I tried to reset it, but no luck with that either. When it worked, the straightner was great; however, it can work great all it wants but if it breaks after less than a month, it is worthless. Bummed out, sending it back today.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed. Pulled hair during use</li>
    <li> Okay, I was satisfied with this flat iron. I bought it because of all the positive reviews. It was delivered Sept. 24, 2012. I have used it not more than once a week on average. Yesterday it worked and today it is totally dead. It won&#x27;t turn on. The reset button doesn&#x27;t work. I have always turned the iron off and unplugged it as soon as I finish. I think a product should last more than 4 months.</li>
    <li> Not amazing... switching to this from my CHI makes me miss CHI. It takes a longer time to heat up and doesn&#x27;t straighten as quickly. It also feels like it&#x27;s pulling my hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of my first flat irons and I really like it.  It heats up extremely fast and is easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking dull and it even adds some curl nicely if you would like.  My hair is medium length and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought when I saw the real product. And the seller shipped a small gift which is a surprise to me. I like the red bag inside the box, very handy for travel. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly!  Straightens efficiently.  Really doesn&#x27;t curl up or under as I thought it would.  For the price, it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between it and the CHI. It gets hot very quickly. Only have to go over the hair once in order for it to be completely flat. That says a lot being that i have unrelaxed African american coarse hair. It is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was thoroughly disappointed in this product. It takes forever to heat up, then as I&#x27;m doing my hair, I have to stop several times to let it heat back up. It doesn&#x27;t move through hair smoothly either. I would compare this straightener to a cheap one you&#x27;d buy at a drugstore. It&#x27;s worth $30, but not the $250 they state as it&#x27;s original price. I&#x27;ve already gone back to a Chi straightener.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as an early Christmas present.  A nice hair straightener has always been at the top of her wish list, but she has expensive tastes, unfortunately.  She has always wanted a Chi, but now that she has this one, she actually prefers this one to it.  At $40 this is a really great deal, since similar products of this caliber can easily go for twice that price (if not more).  The iron itself gets hot very quickly, and she&#x27;s able to do a lot with her hair that she couldn&#x27;t do with her previous straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good deal on a great product.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy a higher price flat iron. I looked at the CHI, but could not get myself to spend $80-$100. I saw the reviews on this and thought for $40 I would gamble. It was no gamble at all. I love the Iron and the heat controle setting. I like the rounded shape that allows me to do a curl under or flip out. If you are considering a great flat iron order this one!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my fiance and she loves it.  Easy to use and I love the look it gives her.</li>
    <li> I love it! Perfect product, perfect service. Thanks</li>
    <li> It is alright not the best the for the price I would say its okay. My hair is very wavy and it does do the job but it takes awhile.</li>
    <li> Got this October 2011 and it died 2 weeks ago. Worked great while worked - got hot fast and straightened great.&lt;br /&gt;Turned on one morning, light comes on, but doesn&#x27;t get hot. Reset it and tried in different plug-ins to no avail. Missed the warranty by one month. This is pretty sad in my book - won&#x27;t do any good to return since just went out of warranty. Be warned - poor quality to not last but one year.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It&#x27;s amazing on my hair and leaves it soft. I don&#x27;t feel like it is damaging my hair like some flat irons do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron sometime last week and have been using this since. Shipping was 3-4 days. Packaging was thoroughly packed right. Free items included with purchase consisted of black Heat resistant glove, red silk straightner pouch, and 5 ml of argan oil. Cant beat that! Threw out my old iron due to this fantastic iron/results. Did not see as many split ends from this particular iron as the old iron caused. Straightens, smoothes, and adds shine to hair with one slow glide without hair protecting products although such products are advised (I wanted to test a few sections of my hair without any hair products interrupting my test). I have wavy, puffy aka frizzy, a little below the shoulder length hair and live in Houston, TX. The current weather condition is humid (YES N DEC)and although its humid out, my hair still stayed intact quite well. Not as straight and sleek once finished straightening hair, but that&#x27;s due to my crazy hair and not using Biosilk serum. But MY results from this particular iron has taken over my hair world and will be the only iron love of my life;P  A SIMPLE MUST HAVE STRAIGHTNER!</li>
    <li> This product met and exceeded my expectations. I bought as a gift for my daughter, she loves it!!! I will be purchasing one for myself shortly. Great product at a great price!!![[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]</li>
    <li> I purchased this through a lightening deal and I am so happy I was able to grab it for the price it was listed at. Every woman should have a ceramic flat iron. It is so much better for your hair and you definitely notice the difference. It takes less time to straighten my hair (I have thick, wavy/curly hair) and it leaves my hair feeling soft with a little shine. It doesn&#x27;t feel like your burning your hair. It&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
    <li> When I first got it, I liked the straightener. However, part of the plate of the bottom has chipped and I have only had it since November 2014. Other than that it&#x27;s a nice straightener. Curls pretty good without leaving dents but sometime snags my hair. Overall nice straightener.</li>
    <li> I received this a couple of days ago &amp; am truly In Luv!!  Totally gives the look I want and even today during a rain storm, No Frizz!!  Takes a bit to heat up, but once it does the results are Awesome!!  My hair is High Lighted and bleached creating a beachy blonde streaked effect  and gets the heat treatment Every Single Day. This item makes my hair super smooth and  Gorgeous!!  A huge Merci for all the encouraging reviews. Cheers,  Zoe</li>
    <li> Great product for a fantastic price.  I usually have straighteners on the highest setting, even with Argan Oil, however I only had to have the HSI straightners on half way.  Easier to use and straighen faster and smoother than others I have paid 3X as much for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Chi for a long time.  I noticed it didn&#x27;t work as well as the salon flat irons.  So I decided to get a new one and came cross the HSI.  I read all the great reviews so I decided to order it.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works very well...my hair is course and wavy and it easily straightens my hair.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this hair straightener - I needed a smallish sized one (as opposed to the bigger, fatter style), and this is perfect.  My hair is pretty thick and I was spending too much time using the blow dryer - once I got the hang of using a flat iron, I spend half the time on my hair now.  I am 62 years old - it&#x27;s never too late to learn something new!</li>
    <li> I usually spend $150 but this at $40 is a huge bargain. I&#x27;m thrilled with the money I saved and having the same great quality. It&#x27;s nice that you can control the tempreture.</li>
    <li> My Babyliss Pro Titanium iron just stopped working and when I saw this one and the price and the tons of great reviews, I purchased it. I saw a lot of reviews saying how much they liked it more than the CHI, well, the CHI is crap....I worked in a beauty supply store open only to licensed cosmetologists, so I sold all those salon products and tools and there is a reason not many hair sytlists use a CHI, and it&#x27;s sold at every drug store and walmart and target...it&#x27;s not a salon standard iron. I would say the HSI is comparable to a CHI, it heats up in about the same amount of time and you have to constantly go over your hair to get the waves out, but it never gets completely straight. It is SUPER heavy. My hair is about to the middle of my back and has just a little wave to it. It took me about 20 mins to do it with this iron and all it ready did was smooth the wave down, not straighten and my arm hurt from holding the heavy thing. I suggest to anybody who wants a good flat iron that will make your hair shiny, completely straight and barely takes any time..get a titanium iron.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great!  It does straighten my hair quickly.  It leaves my hair shiny and smooth.  I only wish it was just a few degrees hotter.  I do however recommend it.  It is a great product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> An excellent flat iron! On par with Chi or perhaps better. Besides the excellent price, this flat iron heats up quickly, slides easily through your hair, and its round body offers a comfortable grip. The same round body also makes it really easy to add a wave or tons of curls to your &#x27;do. I watched a few customers reviews on this item before purchasing and one woman described how her hair remained straight even after having it up in a bun or pony tail all day. This is totally true! My hair reamins soft and silky while keeping its straight shape even if I push it behind my ears. The only downside to this item is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off switch. However, it has a convertable voltage (great for travelling overseas!), a reset button on the plug and comes in a nice case with a free bottle of Argan oil! The HSI is an amazing flat iron that I recommend to anyone, especially if you have hair like mine that is stubborn when it comes to straightening.</li>
    <li> Ordered the HSI Flat Iron on Friday and received it on the following Monday.  Was packed well with no dents or dings.  Upon opening the box found not only the flat iron but a bag to store it in, a glove to handle when it is hot along with a sample bottle of oil to try on your hair.  Plugged it it heated up quickly and evenly.  My hair came out smoothly and soft without a lot of work.  Wonderful product would recommend it to anyone from the easiest to manage to the hardest hair to manage.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  It gets very hot, which is great for my hair type. It reminds me of the kind used in salons.  It also allows me to put actual curls in my hair as opposed to just bumping the ends (like normal flat irons).  The only tiny thing that I do not like is the temperature does seem to vary a bit.  It will start off really hot then slightly cool off and you can tell by the difference in the curl. Usually when it does this, I just put it down and let it reheat for a minute or two and then I start using again.  I have multi-textured hair and it does a great job with letting me curl my own freshly washed (and dried) hair in a quick amount of time and without repeatedly running it through the hair. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. Had my first one for several years and left it in a hotel. Got another one and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron hair straightener for my daughter for a Christmas.  She was extremely happy with her gift.  She has used hair straighteners in the past and she was very happy with her gift.&lt;br /&gt;The styler ceramic straightener was delivered as promised in excellent condition.  It also was in a very nice cloth pouch making it easier for travel.  I would recommend purchasing this product from this Amazon seller Blue Novelties.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived promptly and I really like the sample of Argan oil that came with the flat iron. The flat iron seems to be good quality but I find it to be much heavier than my old one. If you have an extended period of use your arm might start to get tired.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this straightener - no loose plates to catch her hair and it only takes one pass to straighten her hair.  An added bonus is how easy it is to curl hair.  The swivel cord actually works, no worries about a twisted, tangled cord.  The adjustable heat setting and user-friendly handle design are also appreciated.  I would recommend this straightener to anyone looking at a Chi, save yourself the extra money.</li>
    <li> I had been a Chi fan for about 8 years now.... until my Chi finally gave up on me.  I was really iffy about going into a new name brand BUT I took the plunge and ecstatic that I did! I am hispanic with thick curly hair and this flat iron worked better than the Chi! And for the price? Who can go wrong? :)</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for each of my teenage daughters. They are mixed and have thick, unruly hair. Both loved the straightener, even more then their Chi. I may have to buy one for myself. I have seen these in the mall for $200, so this is a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been buying products from Amazon for a really long time and have always been satisfied until I bought this straightener. I was really excited because of all the great reviews I read. Unfortunately, my excitement did not last because first, I received it very late (something that has never happened before) and then after using it about three times, the plates broke. I set it down this morning, and apparently it has no resistance whatsoever because I know I did not slam it. I am definitely going to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought Tourmaline flat iron for my daughter in law for Christmas and they were on sale so I bought me one too. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price. When I used it for the first time, my husband even noticed the difference. I was amazed how it made my hair feel as well as look. My daughter in law loves it as well. She&#x27;s the one who made me get it in the first place. I would definitely recommend it above any flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned and I purchased it at the right time.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my 17 yr old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  Says it makes her hair feel soft and shiny, not fried or frizzy at all.  She would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am not an expert on flat irons, but I think this is a pretty good one compared to the ones I have had in the past (bought at Ulta &amp; Sally Beauty Supply). I like that it has an On and Off switch instead of a button so that I know for sure that it is off when I leave the house. I also like that it came with a fancy looking storage case and a glove so that you don&#x27;t burn yourself when the flat iron is at it&#x27;s highest temperature. It is also nice that there is a dial for the temperature ranging from 140 - 410 degrees and a guide telling you which temperature you should use for your hair type. The only negative thing I have to say about this flat iron is that even at 410 degrees, it does not seem to get that hot; although it still flat irons my hair just fine. Maybe that is a good thing that it is not getting hot enough to burn my hair or smoking because it&#x27;s too hot. All in all, I think this is a good buy if you can get it on sale. I would not pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my HSI Flat Iron. I just started using it about two weeks ago. (Merry Christmas to myself!) I haven&#x27;t had a hair cut since August, but I love my hair now again with my HSI. My friends, family, and coworkers even commented on how nice my hair looks. I usually straightened my hair anyways, but obviously the flat iron I was borrowing before wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job. Fantastic investment on myself at a great price! Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I usually wear my hair curly, and don&#x27;t do much with it. But my hairstylist straightened my hair after a cut, and it looked so good I had to buy one. This is a really easy size to work with. It makes my hair look so shiny and healthy! I did a lot of research before buying this and read a lot of reviews on different brands and types of straighteners. The tourmaline is supposed to help keep your hair healthy and so far so good. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, just on special occasions when I want my hair to look sleek and smooth. I use a heat styling spray prior to using this as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she loves it. Just seeing the quality of it has me thinking about getting two more (one for my mother and one for myself). I would definitely recommend this product and look into other products of this brand.</li>
    <li> This flat iron left my hair so soft, sleek and straight. It also heats up fast. Only thing is it can pull alittle of your hair but overall it is great and worth the money! I highly recomment it !!</li>
    <li> This was a christmas gift. Being a guy, I&#x27;m clueless about flat irons. I bought this strictly based on reviews, glad I did. Pretty solid, does not feel cheap, girlfriend loves it. I win</li>
    <li> Update 6/25/2015:  After about 7 months, the straightener has stopped working. Highly disappointed.  Her Chi had been going for a couple years before it was accidentally broken.  This one just stopped working as effectively as it had been.   ______________________________________________________   The subject line is what my wife said the first time she used the iron.  When our toddler accidentally pulled the old name brand iron off the countertop it was time for a replacement.  I wasn&#x27;t about to pay another $100 for an iron so my wife came across this one on Amazon.  After the first use she was ready to cast her vote for this unit over the name brand.  It&#x27;s only been used for a few weeks so can&#x27;t gauge whether it will last as long as the previous(which had been going strong a couple years now).  Bottom line is this appears to be a quality iron at around half the price of the name brand.</li>
    <li> I always buy products that will last a long time. I took a week to do a lot of research on hair straighteners and customer reviews on the product. I couldn&#x27;t find a single bad review on this straightener and they dated back some time too. I opened the box as soon as it arrived to test it out and I loved it. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week but it is working great so far plus it came with a free satin carrying case, argan oil, and a glove to style your hair with. The plate is curved so you can go for the pin straight look or you can curl the ends. Great purchase and even better price!</li>
    <li> After I read the reviews, I was super excited about to get this iron.... how disappointing ! first, it doesn&#x27;t straight your hair well (and I don&#x27;t have a rebel hair) and second, the &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; that did on your hair it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour and I don&#x27;t live next to the beach or something... the only good thing? the shipping !</li>
    <li> When I opened the package the argon oil cap wasn&#x27;t on all the way and it spilled on my case and booklet so I didn&#x27;t get to try the argon oil  I&#x27;ve heard so much about.  The flat iron is great though and they heat up quickly.  I plan on buying one for my sister soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update so its been a while and I&#x27;ve sent about three emails to the seller about my order and I have yet to get a response. Again great flat iron though.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener most straighteners won&#x27;t straighten my hair very well ( very curly hair) but this one is awesome!!! And the shipper is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Does not automatically shut off, which I think is very unsafe.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this item for my you get sister because she needed a straightener. Later on my older sister, after trying it out asked me to get her one too! It is the best straightener I have ever used and is doing a good job replacing my Chi that broke recently. I would highly suggest this item it is a good price and very good quality.</li>
    <li> Quit working the second time I used it. Wouldn&#x27;t heat up anymore. And even the time that it did work I didn&#x27;t understand why it had such great reviews. It wasn&#x27;t smooth nor did it curl my hair very well. I didn&#x27;t send it back because I didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with the headache of it all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot. I have straightish hair already and this does nothing for the frizz. Not a good buy.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I bought this less than 2 years ago and it has already stopped heating up completely. I am so disappointed. I thought it was a great product, it heated well and did the job. One day last week, I was using it and i noticed that it started to cool off. I plugged it, let it sit for a few days and tried it again. Nothing! For the amount of money, I would think it would last more than 2 years!!</li>
    <li> I like the flat iron, but it does pull hair when you use it. I did love the price though, and the temp. is nice on it too.</li>
    <li> brilliant profesional straitners would highly recomend</li>
    <li> After purchasing numerous flat irons, I finally have one that does what I need it to do. After using it on my relaxed hair it is as shiny, full of body and smooth as when I leave the salon. The real test will come when I use it on my daughter&#x27;s thick and natural curly hair. I will write another review on the outcome of that.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to replace a cheap broken one.  I am African - American and I have a head of hair that can be quite unmanageable especially close to when I need a touch-up.  I used it and I was so happy with the results.  My hair was straight but still full of bounce and shine.  I especially love the glove it comes with, no more hot hand.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. I had previously been a loyal Chi devotee, but when I accidentally lost mine on a trip and needed a replacement, I searched Amazon and found this one on sale at a seemingly too-good-to-be-true price. But I took a chance and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I AM SO HAPPY I DID! This straightener is amazing and leaves your hair really smooth and shiny in addition to the normally expected functions of a flat-iron. For this price and at any comparable pricepoint to the Chi, I&#x27;d highly recommend this HSI instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love!</li>
    <li> This is my first straightener, so take lack of expertise into account, but I think it&#x27;s an excellent product! First, it heats evenly and quickly.  It takes about 30 to 40 seconds to fully heat for a medium setting of 10-15. This is enough for my fairly thick, fine, wavy hair.  The swivel that the cord attaches to is a nice feature as well. It keeps the cord manageable in our small bathroom.  I&#x27;ve had this for over two years and it&#x27;s still going strong with moderate use.</li>
    <li> it has great temperature, leaves your sleek and straight aswell as shiny, it seems like if it was done profecionally</li>
    <li> I love this straightener, unfortunately it fell off my dresser and broke in half. Careful handling with the plates! But other than that great purchase and quality at an unbelievable price.</li>
    <li> It is as good as the expensive flat irons for half the price. This makes it the perfect iron. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift not even a month ago.  I read great reviews on here and was so excited to get it.  It worked really well the first couple of times I used it.  Then it wouldn&#x27;t heat up, then when it would heat up, it heated really slow and makes a crackling sound while it heats up.  The temperature does not get warm enough to straighten my usually fairly easy to straighten caucasian hair.  I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times total.  Such a disappointment!  I love the sample oil that came with this hair straightener though!  I highly recommend that!</li>
    <li> These straighteners work perfectly in both the US and the UK.  All you need is a plug converter to use them in the UK, they will automatically convert the voltage, no switch and and no need to buy a voltage converter plug.  These were such a great buy for a great price, they work on my hair nearly as well as my gold plate chi flat irons. Must buy for travelers!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works amazing and is at a great price! I really like the argon oil and carrying case!</li>
    <li> This flat Iron has a good weight and a dial to control the temperature. Long tangle free cord.  It heats quickly and evenly. I got it at a fantastic price. I love the way it straightens my hair. I also use it to curl my hair.  One heat resistant glove and a nice carrying case was included.  There was also a sample of Heat protectant Argan Oil.  I had to by more because the oil was just that good. It left my hair straighted, shiney and healthy looking. This iron works great on my Afro/Am hair.  So much better than a CHI iron and no where near the expense.</li>
    <li> heats up quickly and works well! great value</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful hair straightener!  I have very curly, long hair and this does the trick perfectly! Also the oil that comes with it, amazing!</li>
    <li> The price can&#x27;t really can&#x27;t be beat and the product works well. I like that the edges are curved so I can use it to curl my hair. It doesn&#x27;t have an auto-off timer, which causes some anxiety. It also doesn&#x27;t work on hair that is even slightly damp (it&#x27;s constantly humid where I live so this is actually a bummer). But if you have easily dry-able hair and a good memory, this should work great!</li>
    <li> I was not too impressed with the hair straightener.  I have thick and wavy hair and it was difficult getting all my hair to be pin straight with this product.  It took longer than usual. I had to repeat the process to get semi-good results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these a year, absolutely love them. They work great on African American hair. I have coarse hair and my daughter have curly spongy hair, after using these both of our hair shiny and bone straight..</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because other flat irons were actually drying out my hair and taking it out. I really wanted a top notch flat iron that wouldn&#x27;t take my hair out! I&#x27;m so glad i made this purchase. I&#x27;m a college student and so I&#x27;m usually very thrifty, even when it comes to personal items. I wanted to get a CHI (because I love all their products) but couldn&#x27;t afford it. This is better than a CHI in my opinion (and cheaper). I also want to note that I am African American and I usually have to get it relaxed to straighten my hair. It straightened my hair with no problems and the rounded ends make it super easy to flip your hair or style it any kind of way you desire! Another great thing is it literally came in the mail 2 days after I ordered it! Super duper pleased</li>
    <li> This flat iron worked the very first time, but every time after it will only get lukewarm even at its highest setting. Very disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> I asked for this flat iron for Christmas and picked this particular one because of all of the good reviews. I was very disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It was quite heavy&lt;br /&gt;2. It didn&#x27;t flatten my hair or make it smooth (I have thin, frizzy hair but have regular Keratin Complex Treatments)&lt;br /&gt;3. It pulled my hair out!!!!!!! Some of my hair would actually be stuck in the plates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have returned this item and now I have to start searching for a new one :-(</li>
    <li> Mi esposa esta encantada con sus pinzas las recomienda para todo el que quiera lucir una cabellera lisa y con cuerpo</li>
    <li> I bought this styler for my daughter and she loves it. It works much better than her other brand styler.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener. High quality and works well.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is the absolute best I&#x27;ve ever used! It straightens my hair really well and I only have to go over each strand once or twice.  Also, I love the carrying bag that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a really good quality hair straightener and finally found one that is not super expensive! I definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Works great! I have very tight curly hair and I am able to straighten it or make waves/loose curls in a single pass. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> So far my wife loves it, she broke her old one of this model and I bought this one as just an every day surprise.</li>
    <li> I am loving my straightening iron. This replaced one I&#x27;d had for about seven years that finally kicked the bucket. I was looking at buying the same model, but really wasn&#x27;t up to paying hundreds of dollars. The reviews convinced me to try this and I&#x27;m a fan. The heat is consistent, it&#x27;s easy to use and is up to the level of quality I expect from a much more expensive straightener.</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up quick and makes great curls!</li>
    <li> the temperature can be changed by yourself.  but sometimes it could not get the goal that I wish for  especially  when I get up in the morning having messy hair</li>
    <li> BIG DISAPPOINTMENT...Beware this magic wand will only LAST you 2 months. I&#x27;ve only used this once a day for 15mins, but then after 2 months,  the product FAILED. I wish we have an option for zero STAR.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd straightener from this brand. They work great and they get to a high heat so it works well with my hair.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is amazing and the price could not be passed up! I really love it! It really does what it claims!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky straight!</li>
    <li> Love this product! One of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve ever owned, and the price is great! I love it!</li>
    <li> The product is very good. Even more though, the straightener I ordered had a short in it or something....so I got into an email correspondence with Blue Novelties.  The representative emailed me several times, offered a replacement, and I got a new one within 2 or 3 days.  I was very impressed with the customer service. I would not hesitate to order from them again.</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s a gift to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I live in a 220v country but travel regularly to the 110v world.  I have been holding off on purchasing a flat iron because: 1) all the really high quality ones I was looking at in stores were only good for one voltage or another, and 2) I worried about damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that my new HSI Professional iron does a great job smoothing my hair (I also use it for corkscrew curls) without damage, and so far it&#x27;s been working great no matter what the power source!  I like that it has a number of different temperature settings, it is quick to heat up, and the digital display is easy to read.</li>
    <li> Needed a dual voltage flat iron to take on a trip to Europe. This straightener exceeded my expectations! Worked perfectly in the other countries with a wall plug adapter. No problems at all! Use it mostly to curl my hair and have found it to be my go-to hair tool instead of my Chi. The order came with everything listed in the description (straightener, glove, pouch) except for the Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Received straighter within delivery dates. The straightener works well-heats to 450 degrees, which is nice (my last one didn&#x27;t heat that high, and it took forever to straighten my hair.) The only thing  I don&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;plates&amp;#34; on the straightener sometimes catch and pull my hair.</li>
    <li> Finally used this and it is a very nice flat iron.  However, it is huge!!  Heats quickly and does a great job of straightening.  I would prefer a smaller version.</li>
    <li> Great straightener!  I have curly hair and this does a great job straightening.  Heats up quickly and the price was very good for this quality of a product.  I would not hesitate to buy again!</li>
    <li> Have been using this Flatiron for about a year now, this will be my 3rd one, it is simply amazing&lt;br /&gt;I have used SO many different ones in my 13 years of being a hairstylist, and this is by far the BEST one I have ever used, now all of my &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; stylist use it as well&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes my hair super smooth and straight and it lasts much longer than my previous straighteners. I got a free sample of the argan oil along with the straightener and that has added a subtle shine to my hair - so double win!</li>
    <li> When I got this flat iron I was SUPER excited because of the great price and reviews, but it is not all that it has worked up to be. It says it goes up to 410 but mine does not get close to that. I could buy a cheap Walmart flat iron for cheaper and the same quality. I was disappointed when I received this.</li>
    <li> for my daughter-she likes it</li>
    <li> Works well only down fall is it is missing a page or two of styling hints.  Don&#x27;t use you Tube etc</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I am a novice and first used another brand name flat iron. I was so disappointed it didn&#x27;t work on&lt;br /&gt;my thick, coarse hair I thought I was doing something wrong. Then I got this iron, and after a few minutes my hair is pin straight, and still straight hours later :) I&#x27;m glad it came with a glove though because my clumsy self accidentally touched a plate - ouch. And I wish the controls weren&#x27;t on the inside of the iron (?). But VERY satisfied with the end result!</li>
    <li> I got a new flat iron to replace my old one.  When I got this one it had a case and also came with a glove and buttons which my old plug and use one did not.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but it works great and heats up really quickly!</li>
    <li> My flat iron was shipped super fast. Got it in two days!  I have baby fine hair and have had trouble finding an iron that didn&#x27;t burn my hair, even on the lowest setting!  The HSI heats so evenly and consistently, my hair is not damaged during the styling. I use it to mostly curl my hair and it gives a great curl to my fine hair. So glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I would never buy this again. Never dropped it, always had it in case and took care of it and only had it for about 3 months and it stopped working. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this straightener. I went and got another CHI after this stopped working and I am so happy with my CHI...should of spent the money on a nice straightener to begin with....</li>
    <li> Works great! I have thick and long hair and it works wonderful on making it straight.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Straightens very quickly, but didn&#x27;t eliminate the frizz in my hair until I did 3-4 passes through the hair.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price.  For the exact same product at my local salon they wanted $115 and they told me what a great price it was!</li>
    <li> Just bought around a month back,So far so good.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and works well.  The ability to run on domestic 120 volts as well as internationally 100 to 250 volts is critical to us.  Cheap units were unsatisfactory in the past, so we moved to a $100 unit that didn&#x27;t warn it was 120 volts only, anywhere we could find (until the $100 unit got fried on a trip).  This less expensive unit works better than the expensive one.</li>
    <li> Over the  years I have tried many flat irons (including a chi). I have long thick curly hair. They all worked ok...but none of them made my hair silky straight. Some even damaged my hair. I decided to try 1 more flat iron.  So glad I did!! What I noticed first is the HSI seems to be sturdy and made well. It heated up quickly and the temp can be adjusted. I put mine on the highest setting. While my hair may never be silky...its pretty darn close! I didn&#x27;t have to keep passing it thru the same hair over and over to get it straight.. 2 passes seem to work.  It made my hair straight, shiny and smooth and not dry. Glad I bought it! And it wasn&#x27;t expensive!</li>
    <li> got this as a replacement for my wife&#x27;s paul mitchell flat iron that bit the dust.  this one is a ton better - per her - at it heats quickly and hotter than any one she ever had before!</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron specifically because I needed a new one AND so I could take it with me to Europe (UK and France).  I tested it out before leaving for the trip and it worked wonderfully. Much better than the old iron it was replacing. I was disappointed however that it didn&#x27;t work in Europe like everyone said it would. It barely even got warm. So I lugged this thing around in my backpack for two weeks with messy hair because I couldn&#x27;t style it.  In the end, it was vacation so I didn&#x27;t waste time making myself look perfect...but I was frustrated that I could have just left the thing at home. Not sure why it malfunctioned. I tried two different converters with it.  But in the States, this iron makes wonderful styles both curly and straight. Since I did need a new one to use at home It is still a positive purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have tried many different types and found this one to be salon quality at a fraction of the price. Leaves hair smooth and shiny.. I prefer the hottest temperature and found that it does not burn my hair at all. I would recommend this product to those looking for a great salon quality flattening iron!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST iron I&#x27;ve used so far. Beats any other iron I&#x27;ve had. I finished my hair in a matter of 20 minutes, which is usually very difficult considering I have very curly hair.</li>
    <li> Terrible! One side failed to heat.  Purchased for a trip and had bad hair the whole time!!!!  It didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I have pretty straight hair once I blow dry it but there&#x27;s always some odd curve so when I broke my chi I thought I&#x27;ll try a cheaper cost one. Let me say that cost does not always reflect quality! It sleeps my hair to perfection and stay sleek all night even in the Houston Texas heat/humidity. Perfect straightener!!!</li>
    <li> Great straightner. Good quality. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 12 year old daughters birthday. I wanted an easy to use straightner for my daughter.  We have another 7 year old 3&amp;#34;  straightner ( not this brand) that wasnt that effective so we wanted a higher quality iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definately did the trick and is fast and easy to use for young and old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and works well.</li>
    <li> I have owned this hair straightener for years. I have mangled a few and broke them due to my carelessness. I keep buying a new one. It&#x27;s works great. Easy to use. Feels great in your hands. I prefer this one over my beauticians. And she has an expensive one. I convinced my mom to get one and she still has and loves hers. Can&#x27;t beat the value for the price. It even comes with a hear glove and oil.</li>
    <li> Coming from a family who only uses a chi iron we decided to try this out when our chi broke because we couldn&#x27;t beat the sale price and it works great! Heats up fast and works extremely well :)</li>
    <li> This straightener works pretty good.  I wish it would stay hot as I am using it on my hair.  I feel like I have to let it sit a minute or two to catch up.</li>
    <li> Awful product. Quit working 7 weeks after I bought it. Does not warm up enough at all</li>
    <li> I expected to purchase a Chi flat iron to get a high quality flat iron. I have extremely curly hair and after reading the reviews on this iron I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m amazed at the high quality of this flat iron at such a reasonable price! Great product!</li>
    <li> The highest setting does not straighten my curly hair sleek straight like my HerStyler iron does. Only for little to no curly thin hair. Not for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this flat iron with so many higher priced ones on the market. I was pleasantly surprised. Quick heat up. Works great. Sometimes I wish the plate was longer, but it certainly gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Hair is staticky after using not glossy :(</li>
    <li> Arrived minutes after I pushed buy, or so it seemed. Great product, love it so far.</li>
    <li> On time and good price.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron better than my Chi.  I have fine straight hair and this iron give me lift and body!  My hair looks full and I don&#x27;t burn myself with this one like I was always doing with my Chi.  It arrived promptly and was securely packaged.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my doughtier&#x27;s  21 birthday. She loves it. Better quality that she had before, heats faster and MUCH chipper.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, love how it keeps my hair straight in Ohio summer humidity!</li>
    <li> This product has gotten really good reviews but honestly, I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed. The quality is telling of how much you paid for it, it feels a bit cheap and not sturdy. Only time will tell how long this will last...</li>
    <li> For years, I&#x27;ve used a CHI for both straightening and curling.  People always ask me what I use to get such perfect curls.  After my CHI was finally worn out (4+ years), I tried to give this HSI a shot based on good reviews. It did not serve me well for curling, at all! It&#x27;s too rigid and the hair does not slide well around the barrel.  It&#x27;s OK for flat ironing but I still prefer the CHI - it&#x27;s much smoother and worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I would give it about 3 1/2 stars.  For the price it&#x27;s a 4 however, its heavy so I rate that a 3. I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday and she has very thin hair but in order for the iron to work it has to be on the highest setting.  I am a hairstylist and I can&#x27;t use it on thick hair like I can my chi. However, for young teens this is a great starter iron.</li>
    <li> Great product so far, I have thin curly hair and it straightens my hair perfectly</li>
    <li> My only regret is that there is no way to determine the exact temperature as is the case for other flag irons.  You have to guess based on a dial that goes up to 410 degrees.</li>
    <li> great gift for a mom who is always on the run</li>
    <li> I have really coarse, dry and curly hair. This straightener worked great! I did have some kind of fluke defect but Amazon took care of it right away and sent me a entire new straightener!</li>
    <li> I got my flat iron a couple of days ago, and first off noticed that the metallic sticker that seals the box was tampered with, indicating that I had not received an unopened product.  The flat iron looked new though, so I didn&#x27;t think too much of it until I went to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is defective, or if this flat iron is supposed to not get very hot.  It barely warms my hair, and I tried different outlets and adjusting the temperature knob and all of that.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with this thing, it doesn&#x27;t flatten hair worth a dang.  I guess you get what you pay for, and this thing is cheap as dirt and performs like it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and invest in a quality product.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend likes it, says it gets the job done. Great price for this product!</li>
    <li> First of all, it was a GIFT, and I then asked the young lady did she like it, and she said YES, 5-stars!  The price had been REALLY reduced, so that was a nice &amp;#34;touch,&amp;#34; too!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It works wonders. Its does exactly what it claims.... the heat on this baby gets up there.... and you can go from frizzy to bone straight in seconds..... I enjoy it......everything else has been put away....</li>
    <li> Amazing I love it it&#x27;s very very good 😍😍</li>
    <li> I paid $39 for this flat iron and feel like I got a quality iron for the money I paid. I like the rounded edges as it gives me an opportunity to create a little bit of texture on the ends. If you are looking for a solid iron at an affordable price, this is it. I would not recommend this at a higher price point, however, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I believe the original price was over $100 and I do think there are better products out there for that price.</li>
    <li> This product works really well.  The digital screen makes it easy to control the temperature, know when it&#x27;s ready to use, and remember to turn it off.  The last straightener I bought was more expensive, but did not work nearly as well.  The posh carrying bag is a nice touch too!</li>
    <li> Does the job. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly enjoying my hair straightener. Works like a charm. Doesn&#x27;t take but a few minutes to heat up and the results are wonderful. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! Couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for myself, I have semi curly hair.( my hair is medium length) the flat iron has done really well straightening my hair.my daughter &amp;#34;loves&amp;#34; it!! She has shoulder Length hair and pretty fine hair. She has been using a Chi flat iron and likes mine better. She said she&#x27;ll by this one when hers goes out. I would highly Recommend this flat iron, it has several heat settings and a really nice sleeve that it goes in when not in use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair straightener for over a month now and I cannot rave enough. It heats up quickly and works WONDERS for my curly hair. Perfectly straight and shiny EVERY TIME! It&#x27;s a great value and works just as well (if not better than) more expensive name brands. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife because of the reviews on here but when she used it, it just didn&#x27;t stand up to the CHI</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have had.  I broke my last one and ordered another that night.  I had it for four years and dropped it many times so it was about time.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the product and how long it last.  Before I was going through a flat iron a year with the other brands. I love how straight it gets my hair and the adjustable heat settings.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair iron for traveling, so I loved the fact that it was dual voltage and also came with the heat resistant bag, which is so useful when traveling and on the go. Great iron!</li>
    <li> I have very course, wavy, hair and it takes a lot of heat to straighten it. The HSI ceramic flat iron works great.  I haven&#x27;t had it long, but so far, it has cut my straightening time in half.</li>
    <li> This is a steal at the 39.99 price. Excellent flat iron. Fast heat. No snagging of he hair. Overall I am very pleased with this product and how well it works.</li>
    <li> Really great flat iron. It gets super hot and cools down fast! I bought the hsi hair serum along with it which I love. Together the two work great and I&#x27;m very happy about it. I do however wonder if down the road it will start to make my hair smell burnt (a problem I had in the past w my chi).. I&#x27;m not sure if I just need to use another heat protectant or if this is just an inevitable concern as the iron ages/is used.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned. And the argan oil is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy a chi, but I saw this on Amazon and read the reviews. I couldn&#x27;t expert any more, and the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth every cent</li>
    <li> I was looking for a duel voltage flat iron for our trip to London, but had to try it when I received it to see how I liked it.  I liked it so much, I use it on a daily basis!  It has a guide to your hair type as to the temperature you should use, and as long as you get it hot enough, it&#x27;s phenomenal!  I have naturally wavy hair and this is the only tool I&#x27;ve found to straighten it.  Keep in mind though, if it&#x27;s humid, or raining, no matter how much hair spray I use, my hair curls right up, but if it&#x27;s a nice, &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; day, (which we don&#x27;t get a lot of here in Michigan), it stays straight all day long.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny and then some! Leaps and bounds better than my other flat iron..I only wish I had bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> Love it, fast shipping!!!! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, leaves hair smooth and shiny. A great product. Love the price! Wish it had automatic shut off but not enough to downgrade to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical about how good this flat iron was for the price, but I assure you it is a high quality flat iron. And it works wonderfully.  My course hair is now smooth and silky.  I had been using a more expensive off brand flat iron that I bought from a beauty supply store and it mostly just burned my hair.  The HSI styler not only costs less than the other iron I was using, it is much better.  Definitely a great buy and compares to other professional quality irons I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase so far! It heats up fast and straightens nice and smooth. My only con is the mouth doesn&#x27;t open as wide as I am used to... not sure if that is standard or not. Not a huge deal tho. I don&#x27;t see any problems happening with this product! The HSI oil is great and I love how it works too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had flat irons before, but decided it was time for an upgrade.  The HSI has been working great for me.  I don&#x27;t mind the dial heat setting, it gets to the point...hot,hotter,etc.  Prior to the HSI, I&#x27;ve never used an oil on my hair for a flat iron.  This has also been working well for me.  My hair is naturally unruly, and with other products my hair would start to frizz by mid-day.  With the HSI, my har stays smooth all day long, and it&#x27;s been very humid lately.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> The pros:  It gets really hot, heats up quickly, and has a nice long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:  it is NOT smooth.  It pulls on my hair like rubber bands and I can feel it giving me split ends as I run it along the strand of hair.  I wish it were smoother, because no other straightener I&#x27;ve had does this to my hair.  I hate using it because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for I guess!</li>
    <li> I have thick frizzy hair, and went through at least 3 straighteners in past year, but this one makes my hair look silky smooth WITHOUT no products. heats up fast and smooth straightening the hair.  Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a straightener.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron but the first time you use it leave it on for like 10 Mims and then do your hair ....buy leaves hair very nice</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair and this flat iron works wonders to help me get my hair not only straight but smooth and not frizzy. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon for such a great price!</li>
    <li> After getting a short haircut, my wide straightener just wouldn&#x27;t work. This is exactly what I need. It heats up quickly and works great. It has a good range of temperatures, even one gentle enough for kids. The only thing I would change about it would be to add an auto off feature for those of us who are a little forgetful. I actually bought a second, for when my first one dies in case I can&#x27;t find this one anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Heats up super fast and and gives my hair awesome shine all day! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is more show than go.  Best part about it is the cool red puffy pouch that came with it.  The straightener itself does not work nearly as well as the Chi.  I returned it and went to Ulta to buy the Ultra Chi on sale for $99.  The silky way the chi runs over your hair leaves it feeling soft and smooth.  If I was not an avid hair straightener user, I would have thought this straighter was fine....but I know better.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this iron worked great at smoothing my curls out. I just combed out a piece of hair, ran the iron over it a couple of times, and I have smooth, straight hair. I like that it has very high settings so I can adjust my heat depending on how curly my hair is at the time I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, looks and feels professional quality. It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife after her retail store purchased flat iron died.  She was in love with this iron after the first use.  She doesn&#x27;t have hair that requires the glove and solution, but she has used it and says that it works great.  She is not hard to please, but she is very honest with her evaluation of products.  I, like others, was skeptical because of the price/quality ratio, but the reviews convinced me and I have to say that I am happy with going forward with the purchase.  Should we have any issues in the future, I will be sure to edit my review.  Until then, no news is good news.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give a negative star review if I could.&lt;br /&gt;I got this flat iron at the end of last November and at first it worked well!  In the past few weeks I noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t straightening... I figured it was because I desperately needed a haircut but even after I got my hair done,  it still did nothing!  I turned the temp all the way up and I was able to touch the iron (it&#x27;s supposed to go up to 410 degrees). I just tried to do a return or an exchange for the item but of course it&#x27;s ineligible for refund as of the end of January.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY&lt;br /&gt;SAVE FOR SOMETHING THAT WORKS&lt;br /&gt;thanks Amazon...I&#x27;d at least like store credit towards something useful..</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife and she is very pleased with it. For an affordable and very good product, you cannot go wrong with the HSI Flat Iron.</li>
    <li> First, the positive. The purchasing process was fantastic and easy.  Fast shipping, good communication.  Thanks!  Unfortunately, the actual product shipped is virtually worthless if you&#x27;ve got less than 35 minutes to straighten your hair.  I have long, fine hair that straightens pretty easily.  I&#x27;ve used the HSI 3 times now and, each time, it&#x27;s taken me over 30 minutes to straighten my hair.  I counted, and between virtually every pass through your hair, it takes between 24 and 27 seconds to reheat..... BETWEEN EVERY PASS.  This means the first run through my hair looks great, and then, unless I want to wait a 1/2 minute every time, each successive pass is less effective, so my hair is totally wonky - totally straight in some places and still wavy and/or frizzy in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes before work to stand around and wait for my flatiron to re-heat.  Spend the money and get one that stays hot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and liked it for the first week and used itching the free bottle of arigon oil which made my hair smooth. after using this iron for a month I notice my hair is damaged and I have nothing but split ends. I have always had nice hair And never had split ends so I was mortified. And then another month after that I notice my hair was being pulled out!!! The reason for that is the plate became loose and isn&#x27;t secure like it is suppose to be. I would like to know how I can get my money back for this junk?</li>
    <li> Do not buy this straightener. It will fry your hair. Over time your hair will look disgusting and frizzled. Spend a little more money and get something better.</li>
    <li> I purchased two HSI flat irons because of the good reviews I had read and the great pricing that was offered. (I will be giving one as a Christmas gift).  I really didn&#x27;t need a new one, I was completely happy with the one I was using until I used the HSI flat iron.  It heats up extremely quickly! My hair does not get caught in the plates and ripped out :) like would happen with my other flat iron. It leaves a smooth finish to my hair. I also like the fact that it came with a carrying bag. Great product for my very fine straight hair.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I have extremely curly hair and usually need several products in my hair in order to straighten up. However, with my new HSI flat iron all I need is a little bit of Moroccan oil!</li>
    <li> I took forever to choose a flat iron as there are so many to choose from and I tend to research WAY too much. I recently got my hair cut shorter in kind of a curved under bob (I had brain surgery back in May and there were several shaved areas). My stylist did a great job so the spots can&#x27;t even be seen. The shaved spots have grown back quite a bit, however I&#x27;m going to keep it shorter as I really like the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly realized that I would need a new flat iron to keep my coarse hair smooth and to curl the ends under. I&#x27;m so glad that I chose the HSI. What a great gift this would make for the holidays!. The packaging is beautiful. A nice red box, a satiny red sleeve to keep it end - handy for traveling. It even comes with a sample bottle of their Argan oil and a heat glove if you are concerned about handling it when hot. The oil is super - I may very well order a larger size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curl lasts for quite awhile so if you need to skip a day or more of washing your hair, the style lasts! I&#x27;m so pleased with this and with the small touches such as the oil, I think I&#x27;ll buy one or two for gifts for the holidays. I highly recommend this flat iron for so many reasons. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Really works great. Best ever. Quick delivery also. Have tried many others and this one works quickly and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was a complete wast of money.  The third time I plugged it in it was dead. I Tried the reset button etc.  Nothing. Expensive mistake.</li>
    <li> Along with the argan oil that this iron comes with, it&#x27;s a great value! I gifted one to my mom and ordered a new one (which didn&#x27;t start at all) but Amazon was great about sending a replacement quickly. Leaves hair shiny and silky. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my first flatiron, and my hair stylist said to make sure I got one with ceramic plates, which this one has. I was glad to find it because it was a way more palatable price for something I&#x27;m not sure how well I&#x27;ll use. So far it&#x27;s worked very well - even in my inexperienced hands. And my hair shows no wear and tear for using it. Came with a nice travel bag and a glove to protect your working hand! Although, the only piece of the iron that was hot were the plates, so I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed the glove. Easy to use, though I did have to hit the reset button on the plug first - that was a little odd. I also like the sample of Argan oil.</li>
    <li> This is actually the second HSI straightener I have bought in the past year.  Yes, second...only because the first one got stolen by one of my very jealous friends!  I pride myself in being beyond knowledgeable about hair products and tools, in that I worked in a salon for many years and all of my closest friends are stylists.  I used the CHI for years and then switched to the very expensive Paul Mitchell flat iron.  I originally bought the HSI as a back up to my Paul Mitchell, but loved it so much that it has become starting team!  It heats up quickly, does not snag hair, and does more in one pass than most straighteners do in 3.  I love it and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new ceramic iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased around 6 different brands of hair straighteners,and this is by far the best I ever owned, there is  nothing that I didn&#x27;t like about this product, I like it so much that I will purchase another one within this week, just to have one in home and one when i travel.</li>
    <li> This is my first hair iron. At first I did not expect much as long as it can work. But when the product came, it is really in high quality. I especially like the feature that it can work on both 110V and 220V. Very convenient when travel. I will keep using it for a long time. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because it had really good reviews on Amazon as well as other web sites.  Amazon definitely had the best price.  I received the item in 2 days with Prime shipping and I was not disappointed.  The flat iron feels very well constructed, not lightweight like some others I have looked at.  The first time I used it was amazing results.  I have thick, very naturally curly hair.  And I do mean a lot of curls! This iron straigtened my hair perfectly and in most places with just one try.  I would definetly recommend this product and it even came with a carry bag and heat proof glove.  Very nice!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!  It is high quality, heats up quickly, and straightens easily. I have wavy, frizzy hair and this straightener makes my hair so smooth.  I have had several people ask me if I did something new to my hair since I started using it.  A great buy!!</li>
    <li> This product has much quality. It&#x27;s easy to handle, heats very well, and did an amazing job on my hair. The Argan oil  effects on my curly hair made me search high and low for more of it. It has a silk like effect on my curls and tamed my hair very well. It works very well with the flat iron. I am so happy I didn&#x27;t spend a lot for this item. This product is proof that you don&#x27;t have to spend major bucks on quality. I believe this product is very competitive and I plan to have this product and the HSI Argan Oil for a long time. I am highly pleased!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of HSI before ordering, but I will definitely buy any other hair tools that they make. The iron heats up quickly and has floating plates. It works like a dream. This is the best flat iron ever! I highly recommend it. i found it online and I can&#x27;t believe the price definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This iron is great! The temperature controls are super easy to use and it makes my hair look great without burning it.</li>
    <li> Bought this on Amazon and I love it. I have always beeb a CHI user but this product is over half the price and works very well!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent  flat iron, I love it! Good flat iron for permed African American hair. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Truly outstanding straightener! My hair looks like I had it done in a salon. Love the oil that came with it...makes my hair soft and easy to style. Also, it came two days early! Love that! Thank you for the affordable and amazing straightener.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this straightener. It heats up fast, and styles really well. Leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me and I don&#x27;t really know how I feel about this product. I plug it in about 20 minutes before I&#x27;m gonna use it. The problem is that the red light keeps coming on. Then the green light comes on,  then red then green lights. It keeps taking turns. Can anyone tell me is this normal? And if so, why does this happen?</li>
    <li> Great quality! I love it!!! I&#x27;m using it every day and leave my hair shine, smooth and super straight!</li>
    <li> This HSI Flat Iron is great!  It gets very hot and straightens my hair perfectly.  I use to have a Chi and would have sworn by it however the plates started pealing and it just didn&#x27;t seem to be doing as great of a job as it use to.  This flat iron is the perfect size, temperature and look.  My hair is very thick and frizzy and it takes me about 10 minutes to straighten all of my hair.  Also, based on researching others out there this one doesn&#x27;t even compare with price.  It&#x27;s such a good deal!</li>
    <li> This straightener is top-notch.  Not only is it amazing quality, it is affordable.  I am very pleased with the product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After researching irons and reading reviews, I ordered the HSI Ceramic Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;I previously used a Chi and was happy with it for many years. I was hoping the HSI would work just as well. To my surprise, the HSI iron exceeded my expectations. It is a superior product. It feels great in my hand, heats quickly, and straightens my course, curly hair with ease. The packaging was great, and the glove and oil was a surprise gift. I checked the iron out with my Paul Mitchell stylist/educator, and he concurred - HSI makes a great iron. To top it off, the price/value was fantastic. Amazon came through again - value, quality and free shipping. I highly recommend this flat iron - you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> really cannot believe this flat iron is only $39.99. It is worth every penny. I have used other flat irons, the INSTYLER, and brushes to get my hair straight. This works better than anything I have used-PERIOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have below the shoulder, wavy, frizzy, thick hair. I have a lot of hair. I can flatten my hair in 5-10 minutes with this and it stays straight for 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not hesitate to buy again or tell my friends This is the One.</li>
    <li> this is the worst flat iron I&#x27;ve used.  I was so excited because of all the rave reviews, and was disappointed when it took forever to heat up and then did a terrible job w/ my hair.  I don&#x27;t have difficult hair, average texture and thickness, I only have a slight curl if i air dry my hair, It&#x27;s mostly the frizz I hate. it&#x27;s usually not very hard to get it straight.  Also it pulled bits of hair as I flat ironed no matter how small of a section I tried to do.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron. It heats up quickly and works just as well as the super high priced brands. Very pleased! I have thick hair and it worked great at taming my waves.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Almost like the ones they use at a salon.  My daughter likes me to use it on her because it is cool to the touch and won&#x27;t burn her ears.</li>
    <li> I was amazed by this flat-iron.  I got professional results that lasts for days using this flat-iron.  It comes with a glove which I came to quickly appreciate once I used it.  It achieved very high temperatures and gets excellent results with minimal effort.  By far, my favorite!</li>
    <li> I am very please with the quality of this product. It seems not only very durable, but it is also not an ugly appliance on my vanity. It works wonderfully on both my fine and slightly curly hair and my daughter&#x27;s very long and very curly hair. The glove that comes with it is a necessary and useful addition especially for straightening someone else&#x27;s hair. I could not ask for more from this product.</li>
    <li> Does a really nice job! I can straighten my hair in record time, and it leaves my hair feeling soft and conditioned,instead of dried out. The plated don&#x27;t leave my hair overly warm either, which is awesome. Heats up quickly, and has a great location for the controls which prevent you from accidentally changing the settings as you straighten your hair. Overall, very pleased. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Chi flat iron for 3 or 4 years and was content with it until it was lost. I had to decide if I wanted to pay $95-$150 for a replacement. I did not so I figured that some other brands could/would be as good at a lower price. The Chi has succeded in building a &#x27;brand loyalty&#x27; that means if they lessened their quality, no one would notice. I ordered a HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for like $38 and it works fine. That long, fancy name means nothing to me but the product provides the results I want. Bottom line, available funds &#x3D; product selection NOT hyped-up brand &#x3D; broken budget.</li>
    <li> Hello, I Ordered on October 27th recieved November 6th (10 days later) with free supersaver shipping. I ordered this item while it was on Gold box deal for 29.99 for my wife. She loves it. Says it made her hair feel very soft and managable. Not like straw like her old one. I&#x27;m happy that I picked a good gift this time. :)&lt;br /&gt;The item looks and feels very sturdy while being light also. Has an on and off button and temp control that works well. (my wife says)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review. I would buy another for the regular price 39.99 anytime. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> The reviews are unbelievable and the price is right, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try... But the product is not that impressive. I have a lot of normal thickness wavy hair. It had gotten really healthy and I got to where I could let it air dry and it would look darn good, so I was excited to be able to style it and have it look even better! (My last hair straightener cost $50 from sally beauty supply and lasted 6 years, but broke about 4 months ago) This hair straightener really didn&#x27;t seem better than a cheap-o from the drug store. Also, it calmed my hair down, to make it less wavy (it looked good if I wanted wavy hair!) but certainly did not \\&quot;straighten\\&quot; it by definition, and it also made my hair feel more like straw after a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hate to write a bad review for what I think is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but I returned this product because I found the reviews that claimed this was better than a chi or ghd to be really deceiving, and I&#x27;ll probably just dish out some cash-monies to get a good and reliable hair straightener next.</li>
    <li> This product had great reviews so I ordered it but I am not very happy with it. The straighter is great, it doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair at all. The only problem is that is doesn&#x27;t stay heated while I use it.  It gets annoying letting it reheat while trying to get ready for the day, I just went back to using my old one.</li>
    <li> Total knock off item.  It snagged my hair, barely straightened it, and just overall something I probably could have purchased from a drugstore.  I had to go out and buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Started to search for a Chi but purchased HSI based on other reviews and of course the awesome price. So far I am not disappointed. Works great! Works quickly, I do not have to pass through the same hair over &amp; over. Leaves hair nice and shiny provided you use some type of heat protectant but that goes without saying. Definitely would purchase again and I have already recommended to my hairstylist and a few others while sitting in her chair. The only drawback I can see is the plug being too big. I cannot plug it and my dryer in at the same time on the same outlet because they both are the big &#x27;reset&#x27; size plugs. But easily solved I just unplug my husband&#x27;s shaver on another outlet in order to warm the HSI while I dry.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a flat iron.  I have fine, relatively thin and straight hair...hence no need for a flat iron.  Or so I thought!  I read a hair stylist&#x27;s blog about curling and styling your hair with a flat iron and wanted to try it out.  However, I didn&#x27;t want to pay $130 for a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure would work.  After reading the great reviews on the HSI flat iron I decided to give it a try.  What a great choice!  I ordered it late on a Wednesday evening and received it on Saturday...2 days before promised!  It came just as described.  I&#x27;ve tried a few of the different techniques from the blog on myself and my daughter and they all work perfectly.  I can put a lot of curl in my hair, do a simple flip up or turn down of the ends or just make it really smooth and straight.  It&#x27;s quite versatile and simple to use.  Which is great because my daughter&#x27;s and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl well at all.  I normally have to hot roll it or use a curling iron that heats over 400 degrees to get any curl to stay.  This is so much easier than either of those methods and the curl stays all day/night.  So glad I tried this flat iron...well worth it!! *Still using this flat iron daily 3 1/2 years later.  Zero issues...great product!!</li>
    <li> I also have never heard of this company but purchased this flat iron after reading the other reviews.  I am glad I did.  Good quality product, well put together.  I would definitely recommend this product if you are considering a flat iron.  Also arrived quickly, two days before stated shipment date.  A+ for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After using this straightener for a couple weeks I have to say I love it.  I like the fact that I can set the heat at different settings.  I also like the way the oil that came with the straightener makes my hair look great.  I would buy this again and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Straightener really flatens hair.without cinging or damaging ends.. I have only used it for a week or so but is working.great so far</li>
    <li> My flat iron that I&#x27;ve used for years finally bit the dust so I was in the market for a new one that wouldn&#x27;t cost me a fortune but still be a great product.  I hopped out to Amazon to see what other reviewers rated the flat irons and low and behold I came across all the great reviews for HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightner.  I had never heard of this brand before but now that I own one and have used it, I LOVE IT.  It was package very nicely including a carrying pouch, a heat resistant glove and a small sample of their Argan oil.  The iron itself feels like a top quality product, meaning it doesn&#x27;t feel lightweight and cheap.  It has a nice long swivel cord that I think is a nice feature, along with a temperature control setting in degrees (not low, med, hi).  And let&#x27;s not forget to mention the Argan oil sample that is included.  My hair is a little over processed and really dry but the combination of the oil and the straightner makes it silky smooth and soft.  So not only do I love the straightner, I love my hair again.  If you are in the market for a straightner definitely give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I bought the straightener after reading the other reviews. And I am more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly, and even with the middle heat you just need to go over every region just once, which is a lot healthier for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The straightening lasts longer than with my other straightener.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very happy that I got this one and can highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair-straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I visited my friend who had it, and I loved it, so I bought one of my own.  It heats up super fast.  The plates heat really evenly.  My hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Better than a CHI any day!  This is the first and only flat iron that will straighten my hair after letting it air dry (when it&#x27;s at it&#x27;s craziest).</li>
    <li> I am a low maintenance type of person when it comes to styling my hair.  I don&#x27;t want to spend an hour or more trying to tame my fine but curly hair.  So when I decided to buy a new flat iron I was advised by more than one person that a CHI was the way to go.  However, I was hesitant for two reasons.  The first was the price, I refuse to spend a fortune on a hair styling tool that I won&#x27;t use everyday.  And two, not everyone sings its praises. Upon reviewing customer reviews I saw that a lot of users were less than thrilled. So when I saw the HSI I decided the price was right and I must say I LOVE IT!!!  It heats up quickly and does as good a job as any flat iron found in professional salons.  It even comes with a glove to prevent burning your hand when handling newly ironed hair while the the tool remains cool to the touch.  And bonus: it comes with a sample bottle of Argan oil (which is fantastic). I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone who wants the great results without the exorbitant prices of its competitors or hard to handle tools that don&#x27;t perform well.  The seller Blue Novelties is fantastic, shipped extremely fast and provided great customer service.  If you&#x27;re on the fence hope this helps.</li>
    <li> It is true what other reviewers said that the style holds for days!  I have very dry hair so only wash my hair every couple of days.  I can go 4 days and my hair is more protected than with other flat irons.</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME product.  It is of great quality and priced extremely well. It heats up quickly and leaves hair feeling silky.  Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is top quality. I love that you can control the temperature. It works quickly to straighten or even add curls and wave to my beautiful head of hair.</li>
    <li> Love the dial a temperaturenon this iron!  My hair is very fine, this iron let&#x27;s me adjust the heat to a lower temp!</li>
    <li> My daughters both said how happy they were with this straightener. One of them used to use a CHI straightener and she said that this one was every bit as good as, if not better, than the CHI. The price was certainly better! The iron heats quickly and works great. Would not hesitate to purchase another.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever used and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I have used all price points in the past (Chi to Remington) and this is my favorite.  I have very thick, long hair and this takes me half the time that it normally takes.  The only downside is that there is no automatic turn off if you forget to turn it off - so be careful! All in all, I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightner, I have used several others and they do not compare. I recommend this product to anyone who uses a straightner, the little bottle of Argan oil, I received works great also, I love how my hair looks very shiny and is manageable.</li>
    <li> I have owned some very high dollar flat irons in the past, but when my last one broke, I needed one fast and affordable. I found this here on amazon and decided for such a great price, it was worth a try. I honestly feel that it works just as good as the last $200 flat iron. I love the argon oil that it came with as well. Nice little addition.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, but a LOT of it that has random kinks and waves in the back that are surprisingly hard to tame for someone who has &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; hair. After cutting it off a few months ago I had so many more problems, so I began the quest of trying to find a new straightener. It&#x27;s not too bulky, gets hot fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t singe or burn my hair. I use a little dab of argan hair oil and it works well with the straightener. Doesn&#x27;t take me forever to get through my layers and layers of hair, but at the same time doesn&#x27;t damage the more fragile hair around my face. Better than more expensive irons I tried out before settling on this one!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener, and you can not go wrong for the money!  No point in spending hundreds of dollars, this HSI iron does the job and quickly!  No more frizzy hair, but a smooth, straight look.  I haven&#x27;t tried curling my hair yet with it, but it is very easy to use and seems effortless to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Great price, Great on hair.  My daughter uses it every day and has no problem with damaged hair.  I would recommend you use a hot iron spray for the hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly, course hair and this iron did very well. Took about an hour for the entire procedure (my hair is shoulder length) which I thought was excellent considering other irons usually take at least 2 hours or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice carrying case and box, and a glove in case your hands can&#x27;t stand the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warms up quickly and has a status/indicator light that changes colors when it&#x27;s ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair came out super straight and soft, and lasted a long time without frizzing or curling, even in the rain and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this iron. Nice professional style without having to pay the high cost.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this iron would be Great and it is.  It does get very hot, which is what I wanted.  I have curley hair and at times can be tough to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I do not like about this flat iron is that it does not turn off automatically after an hour.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a real ceramic straightener, doesn&#x27;t burn your hair at all. Makes your hair looks really shiny and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;It also curls the hair very well. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s the first flat iron that has left my hair smelling weird. Again I love them!!</li>
    <li> Love love love. HSI products live up to their claims. This is the best flat iron I have purchased thus far. I love the curved plates as they curl my hair under nicely.</li>
    <li> Great product great value for the price!</li>
    <li> I love it, it works great and it leaves my hair silky and shiny. I don&#x27;t feel it burning my hair at all.</li>
    <li> This flat iron really works!  My previous flat irons did not work as well and dried out my hair.  This one locks in the moisture and is easy to use, so takes much less time.  I love it!</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t attest to how robust and long-lasting this flat iron is, I definitely love using it!  The argan oil that comes with the flat iron is very nice as well, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged or look fried like it would without it!  The controls are placed in a somewhat odd spot, but after finding a good temperature, you shouldn&#x27;t need to mess with them anyway!  Definitely a good buy, especially for the price, and I&#x27;m glad to have a working flat iron again!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my CHI flat iron.  It works very well and the ability to choose the temperature is a great bonus.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the recommendations below.  However, when I received the product and turned it on high heat, I waited 15 minutes and it never heated up (and therefore, it did not straighten my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it and now I still need a hair straightener... Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a nice styler.  It&#x27;s light and not too heavy.  It comes with a very pretty pouch for travel and storage.  A wide range of heat settings.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. I bought it because it was small &amp; dual voltage, since I was going out of the country&lt;br /&gt;I needed this. It heats up quickly and can be packed in the sleeve provided while still hot. I have now made&lt;br /&gt;this my primary straighting iron.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. It is just nonsense how the product is so over-rated. I regret buying this in May and would return it if the supplier does free return with full refund. I was away and had not been able to test it so far.</li>
    <li> Very nice straightener</li>
    <li> Love it, and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really like the straightener. But I do have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding it pulling the hair and not really curling the end under. I do love that I don&#x27;t have to go over it 2 or 3 times like my chi to get it straight. This does it in one pass.</li>
    <li> I have very kinky curly hair and it works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried several straightners, to cover three girls of different types of hair, they have all been returned.  So far, the HSI has been doing a fabulous job!!  Well, worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  It&#x27;s everything that&#x27;s promised. My hair is very curly, it works great, very quick and my hair stays straight until wet.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> The HSI Hair Straightner works great.  It is easy to use and straightens my hair makes my hair look straight and shiney. It is a lot better than my old hair straightner and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Did as was expected.  Great product.  I wish the knob and switch to power and change temperature were clearer/easier to get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great travel bag.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of flat irons, I love this one I have dry fine hair it doesn&#x27;t seem to break my hair off as much</li>
    <li> Have had this flat iron for a little less than a month now, and really seems to be working well.  It heats up quickly, and does a quick job smoothing and straightening my long hair.  It seems like I can get my hair done faster now than with my old flat iron, and the smoothing effects seem to last longer.  I do like the long cord on this flat iron too.  As I do have long hair, it would be nice if the plates were a little larger though.  However, it really hasn&#x27;t been that big of a deal so far.  The price was certainly reasonable.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My only problem is that it does not have an auto-off feature, but it does a great job and comes with a lovely case!</li>
    <li> Had it for over a year. Works great!</li>
    <li> Well, I can honestly say the price attracted me plus it looks like good quality.  I got it pretty quick and have been in love ever since. :-) Now i want to find a decent priced curling wand.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener. Good price. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like my other one!  I also like the 1 inch.</li>
    <li> Came fast. Works really well. Perfect size.</li>
    <li> Good product &amp; good price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new straightener a couple of months ago when I came across this one. I have a couple of straighteners already, of which this one had the highest temperature option, so I was expecting this one to be able to straighten my hair quicker than the others. I have thick hair so sometimes curling or straightening it can take some time depending on the straightener I use. After reading the great reviews about this straightener I was expecting a salon quality straightener which was going to make my hair look great. Although the packaging, look and the price of the straightener were great, the straightener itself is okay. It takes longer to straighten my hair with this one and it doesn&#x27;t make it look as nice as some of the other ones I have. I&#x27;ve only used it about two or three times since I got it and now it just sits in the box under my sink. I&#x27;ve gone back to my old one since then. The HSI straightener is not the best one for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it thank you so much! Communication was great and needs were met. Yay!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner for my daughter and she loves it! The beautiful silky bag that comes with it is gorgeous !!!!! It&#x27;s alot better than a CHI !</li>
    <li> Did it&#x27;s job, I get nice straight hair and I like the oil it comes with</li>
    <li> Love it! Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Ok so im hispanic and i have curly hair that gets frizzy because of all the damage i have put on my hair(over bleaching dying,fusion extensions ect) ive tried many hair straightners that claim to give you that salon look but after 2 hours my hair would get puffy and frizzy losing the silkiness.after trying this product i love it it makes my hair bone straight and it last the whole day wich i love i also get so many compliments even my ends that are super damage look pretty silky wich is what i wanted!i do put oil before straightning my hair i put paul michell skinny serum oil that also helps make it softer,but all in all this is a good product ive had more expensive hair straightners that left my hair looking emberrasing!im only given 4 stars because ive only have used it twice since i bought it.but im sure its gona remain the same quality so i would recommend this product to anybody who has damage hair or frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I have super thick and curly hair. The only flat iron that has ever worked on my hair is a $250 Paul Mitchell iron. I am a Mom so I definitely can&#x27;t spend that kind of money on a hair product, just get that luxury when my stylist uses it on my hair. I searched and read many reviews on this and finally decided to buy. The price was great so I thought why not. I was MORE than pleased with the results. My hair was so silky and straight after using this flat iron. I also used the argan oil provided (I already use this type of serum) and it worked great as well. This iron does get very hot so the glove is a fantastic included bonus! I was also impressed by the fact that my hair was still straight and smooth the next day. With my old iron (which was a very high quality one I purchased at Sallys for $70) didn&#x27;t straighten my hair nearly as good and it was also frizzy again by mid day. I would recommend anyone to try this. Oh! It also makes beautiful curls! I curl my hair with it a lot and you can get tight curls or sexy beachy waves. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> One of the best straighteners I have bought so far. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Expected longer durability</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!  Sleek and excellent performance. This flat iron works very well, it heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn or damage my hair.. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use this over seas yet, but I really like the dual voltage that is built in and doesn&#x27;t need to be manually adjusted to change voltage, just use a plug adapter and your good! It is nice to be able to take my usual equipment with me anywhere. I would definitely buy this unit again!.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  It heats up very quickly and straightens my hair well.  It is very simple to use and compact.</li>
    <li> It straightened my hair. But the plates aren&#x27;t smooth so it ripped a TON of my hair out. I had hair all over my bathroom when I was finished.</li>
    <li> Works well; doesn&#x27;t catch strands of my hair in the edges of the plates.</li>
    <li> She loves it and it&#x27;s still going strong to this day. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  It heats up fast.  I wish it had a little heavier heft.  I take it when I travel and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent flat iron. It works great on natural hair as well as chemically treated hair. This product includes a glove and argan oil. It arrived in a timely manner and was packaged nicely. The reason I did not give this product a full five stars is because I don&#x27;t really notice too much of a difference in this flat iron compared to my previous cheaper model.</li>
    <li> It pulled on my hair which hurt. Gonna stick with my chi...</li>
    <li> Love it! As good as my professional iron that was well over $100.</li>
    <li> Works well.. Not as great as I expected from reading everyone else&#x27;s reviewed prior to ordering.</li>
    <li> Good product. Especially for the price. You really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. Great value.</li>
    <li> Okay in a bind but not very good for your hair!</li>
    <li> I have used many flat irons over the years including chi. The HSI is the best I have ever used! Keeps my curly frizzy hair silky straight all day. Even in rain!!! Thank you HSI!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the money. I give it a four star, I don&#x27;t like where the on off switch is located. I feel that I have to be very careful not to burn my fingers when turning it off because it&#x27;s under the top of the Handel right buy the hot pad. My old straightener on off switch was on top of the unit, other than that it&#x27;s a five star product.&lt;br /&gt;All and all it works really good so far. This is the first straightener I bought that wasn&#x27;t 100 dollars or more! I know you pay for what you get! But then why did all my expensive straighteners break in the first year?  I&#x27;m tired of buying straighteners every couple of months! I&#x27;m looking forward to this one which is priced so competitively and hope it lasts much longer than the rest I&#x27;ve bought. I didn&#x27;t write a review right away cuz I think straighteners need a break in time to reach there true heated temps. I would recommend this product if your looking for a straightener thats light weight, gets hot and gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;This HSI product so far seams to be very reliable!&lt;br /&gt;A Thanks to HSI for producing good quality merchandise!</li>
    <li> The flatiron is great. It is just the right size and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Very nice -- my hair loves the Argan oil sample also.</li>
    <li> love it. I have natural  untreated  African American hair  and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> BIG PLUS BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE HEAT.  EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace my chi.... It&#x27;s a decent flat iron but it does pull my hair and does not leave it as straight as the chi did, with that being said it is less than half the cost of my previous one and I will continue to use it daily.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter as a gift.  She must love it, she uses it all the time and leave it laying around.  Typical teenager.</li>
    <li> This is a great hot iron.  I was skeptical how good it would be, I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipipng.  Works like a charm!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It got my super curly, natural hair very straight, I&#x27;m extremely pleased. It gave me a salon look, probably the only flat iron I&#x27;ll be using for a long time. (If you know how to staighten your hair correctly you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem) You can&#x27;t beat the price, I definitely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> It came very quickly and is a great flat iron!</li>
    <li> Bought this less than a year ago. The green light always flickered. Today it died completely. Can&#x27;t plug it in at all. I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cause a short in the house!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  It heats up quickly and works great.</li>
    <li> So far this iron is working great.  Make sure you check the setting of heat on it, some people were complaining it wasn&#x27;t hot enough, I wonder if they knew enough to turn up the dial.  I have thin hair and I like the softer heat on my hair but my dial is on a lower setting.  It can go much higher for thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for PYT that I had for almost two years but then lost it.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Have had so many compliments on my hair since started using it. Thanks for a great product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Bought this and a chi at the same time. This one tugged at my hair and left it frizzy while the chi glided through and left it soft and smooth. Wasn&#x27;t my greatest purchase so I returned it right away.</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener I have bought so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter &amp; she loves it.  After going through multiple chi irons I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money.  This is a great quality iron especially for the price.</li>
    <li> not used yet! but feel good!</li>
    <li> Great product, great deal</li>
    <li> I am not at all happy with this iron.  It pulls my hair unless I take extremely small sections of hair to iron at a time.  I&#x27;ve been able to cover more area with other straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past....not so with this product.  The seller was &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34;; the product was delivered quickly and as pictured.  I&#x27;m mad at myself for not taking the time to return the product within the 1 month time period.  MY BAD; not the sellers or Amazon&#x27;s.  However, my 2-star rating of the straightener itself stands.  I was very disappointed with the overall performance.  I have thick, course hair and my hair frizzed immediately after using it.  I did play around with temperature settings, as well, but nothing seem to work for me.  I&#x27;m more disappointed in the fact that it felt like it was pulling my hair every time I passed it through - and again, it&#x27;s not as efficient as other irons I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Sorry, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and glides through hair. It feels like a professional grade flat iron at a cheap brand price.</li>
    <li> Great buy for a fantastic flat iron!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Works great and looks great. I returned the Chi I had purchased before finding this deal. No regrets!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works better then expected!</li>
    <li> It works really well and heats up so fast.  Glad I purchased this iron!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, no issues with it but have not used it a lot yet so still getting the hang of it.  Argan oil scent is a bit strong for me as I&#x27;m sensitive to smells but was a nice bonus.  Glove is way too big so not very useful.</li>
    <li> Fantastic straightener! Works well on my hair and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once.  I&#x27;m trying to take it easy with the heat settings.  I have thin, fine hair and t worked pretty well on my hair on a lower setting.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on 7/2/2014 it stopped working on 8/19/2014. I plugged it in and turned it on, no heat, no red light. I have surpassed my 30 days for return. :-(</li>
    <li> Good price for a good quality flat iron. I&#x27;ve yet to use this on my European vacation just yet, so I&#x27;ll update my review after my trip!</li>
    <li> The plates didn&#x27;t glide through my hair as smoothly as expected, got caught on the ends a bit and pulled. Definitely heats up quickly. Kind of heavier than my previous straightener. Maybe I just need to get used to it, I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I&#x27;m not in love so far, but the one I had before for 4+ years was finally showing wear so I got it because it was the #1 bestseller in beauty. Almost wish I had just bought another of the same one that I have rather than this one. Again, maybe it takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Its your personal saloon.. try it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who wanted a CHI but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100.  She absolutely loves this HSI.  Loves it.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far but it appeared to work really well.  Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Love this hair straightener. I have puffy, curly, wavy hair and using this straightener with argan oil makes my hair soft and straight. I use to own an infinity flat iron and it worked well, until the spring broke and now it doesn&#x27;t hold itself up. I bought this one because of all the good reviews and 40 bucks seemed like a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve had it for a week and I love it! The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t have auto shut off and it has a brand new smell that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. :)</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron. I had another brand and model that gave out on me after 8+ years. This was an affordable and trusted brand name. Although it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my other flat irons, it is a great hair tool. I can adjust the temperature up to 400+ degrees which I need for my very thick hair. The swivel cord is helpful to keep it from tangling up. I have only used them a few times so far but I really like the results.&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine-medium hair, you will definitely love these. If you have really thick hair like mine, you will be satisfied with the results. The pouch is a nice addition but it&#x27;s difficult to get the cord in the pouch with the flat irons in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was given a trial with a $140 flat iron in a mall. I thought I could do better and I did with this flat iron. All my research showed 100% ceramic is the best and when I found this one on sale for under $40 I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My curly, frizzy hair is straight and silky from the time I do it until the next wash. It can last three days if I need it to. Friends wonder what new product I found and they are amazied that it is a flat iron not a conditioner. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this flat iron. I love how manageable and for the first time reliable my hair is now.</li>
    <li> Good product, shipped fast.  Would recommend product to friends.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!  It heats up in seconds, is super easy to use, and works beautifully.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The only design flaw I can think of is that the controls are on in the inside which makes them hard to see.  Also the glove is kind of silly since it&#x27;s hard to burn your hand.  Regardless it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;m not really a hair person but I use mine frequently.</li>
    <li> I left my old iron at a hotel on a trip taken this summmer... :(  very sad, because I loved that Iron.  One side was flat and the other was rounded a bit and was just really easy to use.  So trying to find one that makes me equally happy is proving to be tough.  This iron had many great reviews so I bought it.  At this point, I am not happy with it.  It&#x27;s heavy and the heating plates aren&#x27;t very long.  I don&#x27;t know... at this point I don&#x27;t like it.  Will have to keep searching I think.</li>
    <li> I am a complete klutz when it comes to hair management.  This product made it easy to straighten my hair.  It was sent in a timely manner and was easy to operate and I liked the bag to store it in.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. I have 2 teenage daughters and not only do they love it but a fiend of theirs liked it so much she ordered one for herself.  She even liked it better than Chi brand.</li>
    <li> Pulls my hair bad... Quite disappointed</li>
    <li> I really like this iron it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out when ironing and it makes my hair very soft. Thank you so much i recieved it so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irene</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and straightens my hair well! I would definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Very Impressed with the quality of this....in fact I&#x27;ve purchased two!</li>
    <li> Heats up pretty fast but just doesn&#x27;t seem to glide through my hair like my daughter&#x27;s NuMe does.  But it&#x27;s ok.  Nothing I&#x27;d send it back for.</li>
    <li> Great item, my wife loves it! I was worried because she&#x27;s picky about the straightener. But she says this is a really good one and it works great. Just as good if not better than the really expensive ones</li>
    <li> Gets really hot, which is good. Speeds up straightening time. I like the storage pouch. Shipped quickly</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener and thought it worked great for the price. About less than one year later one of the plates stopped working. So I contacted customer service a year after buying, telling them a plate had burned out and they said I must have gotten a defective one. So they asked for my address and three weeks later I received an upgraded model for free! This new model is the pro and works amazing. Ive used MANY straighteners, cheep ones CHI and other expensive ones but this is by far the best for the price. And 5+++ stars for customer service.It doesn&#x27;t get any better than receiving an upgraded replacement after a product failed me. This is how all businesses selling a product should act!</li>
    <li> My wife was going to spend $150 on one from her salon. I found this product and have never seen so many good reviews. Needless to say, this satisfied her perfectionism that accompanies her in the bathroom for 2 hours every morning.</li>
    <li> The product was received exactly as expected - works phenomenally well!  I was pleased with how quickly my order arrived to my home!  I highly recommend this product and manufacturer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK the plates are hot but not as smooth as my previous CHI</li>
    <li> Good product for the money - not nearly as effective as the more expensive flat irons but a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener as a gift for my adult daughter.  She says it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever had; better than the Chi straightener that she paid $200.00 for!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Every bit as nice as the flat iron I paid $125 for.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as I expected. This was the first time I have ever used a flat iron, but it does a great job of smoothing and calming my frizz! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have to keep reordering these because I keep knocking them off my counter and the ceramic breaks. Not a knock on the iron though, I don&#x27;t expect it to withstand such abuse. Great price for a great result.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it I bought it cause of the reviews my chi had stop working and I needed one after I purchased this I was very disappointment don&#x27;t work as I thought it would work my hair doesn&#x27;t get straight at all !!!</li>
    <li> Great flatiron at an amazing price.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron seems to work just as well as my previous flat iron which cost over $100. I have had this item for a few months now. The flat iron heats up fast, seems to be good quality, and does a great job straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> For the price, this has worked fairly well. It heats quickly and does a decent job of straightening as well as getting beachy waves. My only major issue with it is that it can really pull and snag my hair as I&#x27;m using it. I&#x27;ve tried different heat-protecting styling products, thicker sections, thinner sections, serums, oils, etc, and in almost every instance, at some point of each section, it will catch and pull. Not only is it painful, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a silky smooth look. At first I thought maybe it was just my own user error, but I&#x27;ve had other flat irons that never pulled. If it weren&#x27;t for this one issue, I would have given it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe so many people liked this flat iron.  I like my Revlon ceramic straightener much better and it was a few dollars less expensive than this.  This flat iron is quite heavy and the on/off switch is in the middle of the straightener so it&#x27;s a pain to turn on and off.  Furthmore, it pulled my hair badly.  I lost more hair in the few days I used this than I normally do in a month.  My hair is very healthy and my hair stylists have always told me my hair strands are fine but I have lots of them.  Maybe this just wasn&#x27;t made for hair like mine.  I, of course, returned it.</li>
    <li> I have been using an AMIKA flat iron for about 4 years. Absolutely loved it. I found this one which looks and is very similar and the price was just so much better. I was weary at first, because I really loved my AMIKA black flat iron just like this one, but I&#x27;m cheap so I decided to buy it. I have been using this flat iron for about a week and it works even better than my AMIKA one and it&#x27;s lighter. My hair feels ridiculously soft and it gets really straight. Heats up really fast red power light turns green when it&#x27;s all the way hot cord rotates so it isn&#x27;t stuck in one position getting bent. This is a great product I hope it lasts as long as my AMIKA straightner did. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it lasted longer. This is really a great buy. It also came with a little bottle of argan oil leave in conditioner and I will be purchasing a bottle of just the oil as soon as this one gets close to running out. I put the oil in my hair before drying. After drying and straightening my hair it&#x27;s so super soft and shiny. Doesn&#x27;t leave a yucky residue in your hair like some oils. It&#x27;s great. Everything about this purchase was great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the amount of reviews influence your decision to buy this product. I did like it for the most part, however I was expecting more out of it. I do not like the temperature dial I have no idea what temperature setting I&#x27;m using, and I really wish it had an auto shut off feature. The price is great but it&#x27;s just like any other hair straightener I&#x27;ve used. The only difference is that it only works very well in conjunction with the Argan oil leave in hair treatment. The oil is very thick but if I don&#x27;t use it I can&#x27;t achieve the silky smooth results I want. If I use my regular product(s) my hair feels dry and damaged. I guess I&#x27;ll have to start buying Argan oil as long as I use this straightener. You&#x27;re better off buying the digital version of this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener!  I bought it for travel but have decided to use it domestically and for travel.  It is VERY nice and better than the others I have owned which were more expensive.  I actually gave away my CHI flatiron because I like this one better.  It is a great quality product at an excellent price.  I highly recommend it and love that it is dual voltage!  I use it daily (naturally wavy hair) and even so my hair is very healthy.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully, shipping was fast and the iron heats up quickly!</li>
    <li> Been using for about three weeks.  Does what it says and works very well.  I&#x27;ve had straighteners over $100 and I can&#x27;t say I think they&#x27;re any better than this product and I paid a fraction of the price.  I primarily use for smoothing hair after blowing it out.  I don&#x27;t like to wear it pin straight but I&#x27;m confident this product could handle that style if I tried.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this iron, it pulled my hair and didn&#x27;t glide smoothly.</li>
    <li> Nice straightener!  I like the adjustable heat setting.</li>
    <li> The HSI PROFESSIONAL Flat Iron is a good value compared to flat irons costing twice as much.  I&#x27;m using the flat iron to bring shine to my hair and curl rather than straighten.  Occasionally I have to repeat the process on the same section of hair.  Other than that, I am very pleased with the flat iron/</li>
    <li> Best flat irons ever!!!!! I love the argon oil that came in the box..I order a bigger one...I don&#x27;t have a relaxer and these flat irons make my hair so soft and shiny..I get so many complements on my hair</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have thick and curly, wavy hair and this flat iron makes my hair so straight and silky.  The travel size argan oil makes my hair especially smooth and straight.  I recommend this flat iron to anyone! Especially to people with hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. My hair gets pulled each time I try to use this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a trip to Europe as it is dual voltage, and that worked out great. I have heavy wavy hair and my hair did not move easily through the plates and did not straighten as well as my primary flat iron, it will be a good backup and travel tool.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it!! Great fast service</li>
    <li> Every beautician should get one!</li>
    <li> Best deal! Owneded for 3+ years and hasn&#x27;t let me down yet</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, product exactly as described, GREAT QUALITY flat irons!! Worked way better than my previous set!</li>
    <li> This is my first straightener. Since it had such good reviews and the price is right, I decided to give it a try and am quite happy. Need to use it a few more times and figure out the right temp to straighten my hair. First setting was not hot enough.</li>
    <li> I like that yu can adjust the temperature. It took some getting used to with my short hair, but i love it!</li>
    <li> This was a good buy, smart choice.  It is a very nice quality and came with a nice case, a glove, and a small sample of argon oil.  I would recommend this straightener.  Very good price.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works fairly well, but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected it would. It takes longer to straighten my hair than it did with my last flat iron.</li>
    <li> works great easy to use. only wish it was automatic shut off.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! Have bought many others for more money and they didnt work half as well!</li>
    <li> My hair is usually straight very little wave. I used this flat iron once and it pulled my hair. I&#x27;ve never had so much hair pulled when straightening. By mid day my hair had a wave in it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener! Everything I wanted, excellent quality! Shipped &amp; arrived sooner than expected too.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works just as good as the Chi flat iron and for half the price!!!</li>
    <li> My wife needed a professional grade flat iron to style her hair, as the cheap, generic models just wouldn&#x27;t do it. Sure, she can go to the local salon and for $7 the stylist does a wonderful job. (We live in S America where services tend to be inexpensive, but goods can cost an arm and a leg). After reading many positive reviews, I decided to get this model for her as a surprise. She absolutely loves it! And besides styling her own hair she is able to help out with family members who also have difficult hair to work with. There&#x27;s really nothing else I can add here. It&#x27;s apparently the older generation, but for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;The seller, Blue Novelties, sent me a brand new in the box flat iron. Everything included as advertised. Since I was making a turn and burn trip to the US, I used my Amazon Prime to get it delivered lightning fast. So, everybody came through, and my wife and family are super happy.</li>
    <li> Works great and has enough heat to straighten.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> So many reviews for this flat iron. And they are so good!!! I had been using my chi for 5 years. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to. So I jumped on here and read some reviews. I went ahead and bought it.  I am a black woman with coarse relaxed hair. It&#x27;s very thick. This will get your hair straight but it won&#x27;t stay that way. At the first sign of humidity my hair puffs like an angry cat. The bulkiness of the iron won&#x27;t allow my roots to be completely pressed straight. And the plates are short which means it takes much longer to do my whole head.. also the iron smells funny and emit fumes that make me cough. Nothing else in my regimen has changed. I am very disappointed.  Guess I&#x27;ll try for a baby bliss. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These flat irons are amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;They really do give u that salon look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed I will never go back to any other flat iron again .&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these flat irons for all hair types they work!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works great with my hair.</li>
    <li> this product was supposed to convert to euro wattage.  blew up first try.  waste of hard earned money and I had to find another iron.  All i found was smaller and my hair looked bad for 2 weeks in Spain.  worthless to me...</li>
    <li> I have owned several different hair straighteners costing well over $100.  I chose to try this one mainly because of the high ratings from other users.  I was a bit skeptical because of the low price, but willing to give it a try due to a very tight budget these days.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came with a glove, velvet storage case, and a small bottle of argon oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this for about 2 weeks, but so far I am very happy with it.  I have found that it heats quickly and retains its heat very well.  I am pleased with how sturdy it is and it doesn&#x27;t seem to catch and pull on my hair like my old one did (different brand).  Some may complain that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off feature,  but come on - for only $40 bucks this is one of the best flat irons I have owned.  I do appreciate the on/off switch so I can leave it plugged in and easily switch it on and off as needed.  There is also an indicator light that let&#x27;s you know when it is heated to the selected temperature.  When you first turn it on, the light is red and once it turns green you&#x27;re all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an excellent product.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, I say go for it!  I highly doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Works perfectly without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> Although I have only used this flat iron for a short time, it certainly meets my expectations.  Heats rapidly and does a good job on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great price,  and it worked very well all over Europe! I just bought an adapter and used it in Denmark,  Netherlands,  France, Italy,  and Germany. I highly recommend for girls with curly or frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I took this flat iron to Europe with me and when used with a simple adapter plug it worked like a charm.  It&#x27;s not a small, lightweight travel iron, but is well worth having with you when you need to be sure your hair will look good.  I have fine, permed hair and need an iron to finish and shape curls after blow-drying.  This iron did a great job - not too harsh, easy to move along the hair strands, and well insulated to prevent burned fingers and scalp. The hair oil that came with it was a nice bonus.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is HORRIBLE!!!!! I&#x27;ve had 2 CHI flat irons in the past, and my last CHI only last a year so I decided to try something new. The flat iron pulls my hair out and doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight. My hair frizzed 10 minutes after straightening it and I hadn&#x27;t even gone outside yet. You get what you pay for so this purchase was an epic Fail!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Used one day delivery - arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;This is the iron used at the beauty salon I frequent.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great! Just what I expected!</li>
    <li> easy to use. heat up fast</li>
    <li> I was super excited about all the rave reviews on this product, but I have to say that I was kind of disappointed. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to get that hot, and as a result, doesn&#x27;t really do that great of a job straightening my hair. I don&#x27;t have super thick or coarse hair, and I&#x27;ve tried doing itty-bitty sections. All in all, kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading everyone&#x27;s positive comments, saying it works just as well, or even better than the chi.  I&#x27;ve had my hsi for more than a few months to give it a fair trial.  IT DOES NOT WORK LIKE MY CHI.  although you have the ability to change the heat setting, somehow it still doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair as well.  my chi used to eliminate my bed hair in one try, whereas I use the hsi multiple times and I still walk around with bumps all over my head.  once my hsi breaks, I&#x27;m going back to my chi.</li>
    <li> Perfect flat iron for the price. It also comes with a bit of treatment oil and a heat-proof bag, so it&#x27;s easy to store right after using. I use this at the gym and throw it in my locker afterwards without having to wait for it to completely cool down.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> So far so good .have no complaints</li>
    <li> Straightens amazingly withvery little effort on very frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Works well, causes a little static but heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Like it.  Weird spot to turn it on and off though.</li>
    <li> Love the straightener. Get super hot and tackles the worst hair.</li>
    <li> bought this for my GF, and she loves it. Says it the best iron she has ever used.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener for my wife, she like it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Heats up so fast and makes straightening my hair fast with no frizz!</li>
    <li> Very good, easy to grasp, does have different temperatures easy to adjust</li>
    <li> I loved this straightner. It curls very well and the curls will stay on for couple of days but they will become wavy. My hair is very frizzy so this product worked for me. It straightens fast and my hair stays straight until I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> The HSI works great and came promptly. I have had no issues so far. I would give it 5 stars but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it proves itself over time. The oil that it comes with is really nice and smells really good.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it an it works better than others she have tried an wud recommended to anyone great product</li>
    <li> I had an amika straightener for several years but sadly after numerous drops on a floor it finally met its match.  This had high reviews and a good price so I gave it a try.  Its not bad.  It doesn&#x27;t glide through my as easily as my Amika did thus your hair ends up with a slight crimp.  Not a big deal just go through with another pass and it straightens.  It also doesn&#x27;t curl my hair as easily.  I used to barely have to turn the straighten to get a good curl.  The HSI definitely requires much more turn to make a decent curl.  That being said the price is great.  It does its job for the price.  If money is not an issue I would chose a different straightener.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great buy, but I have used better flat irons</li>
    <li> Its an amazing straightener dont get me wrong. I would have liked for it to have an auto shut-off setting and also I wish the plates could close. But other than that his straightener functions really well. Makes hair shiny and super straight. Does not tug, slides right through the hair. I have had this for about a year now. Its perfect if you dont mind it being open and the fact that you have to manually turn it off. I personally think its better to manually shut if off. I feel more safer. But the problem is if you are forgetful to shut your straighteners off then dont get it, i dont want u to burn down ur house!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this iron.  I had not used one before and  probably would have benefited from additional operating directions.  The iron is easy to use, and does a good job of either curling or straightening  ones hair.  Loved the red carrying case and the job it does on my hair.  I have not ordered anything from this company previously and was very happy with the process.</li>
    <li> Okay so not only is it ceramic, which means it won’t fry your hair, it’s good for travel because it uses all world power supplies. Have you ever gone overseas with your hair straightener and thought, I’ll just try it for a moment and see? The smell as your world burns is far from exotic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this baby will travel.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in condition described. Works great!</li>
    <li> People of Amazon, you have steered me wrong. First off, don&#x27;t buy this product for more than $40. The original price of just around $200 seems like a scam, its definitely a rip off.    Here&#x27;s why I am so disappointed:  1) The on/off switch. So hard to get to! They include a glove, which I think is weird. But now it makes sense. Since you&#x27;ll be grazing the hot irons to turn it off, you&#x27;ll need protection. WHO PUTS A SWITCH ON THE INSIDE, next to the plates? Ugh.  2) The temperature setting is hard to see, since its on the inside of the iron. AND, you can&#x27;t set a specific temperature. Need 400 degrees? Good luck, I have no idea what temperature is defined on their knob range. It&#x27;s dumb. Its like taking 3 technological steps backwards.  3) Is it hot yet? No idea. There is no indicator light or noise to tell you when your iron is done heating up. Give it 60 seconds? 90 seconds? I don&#x27;t know.  4) My hair snags at the end. This is so frustrating. This has never happened to me before. The pulling and damage it causes is unbearable.  5) I invest in quality heat protector products, but they are no match for this flat iron. My hair went from healthy to damaged in one week.    I need to find a replacement and return this. I can deal with most things, but the hair snagging and pulling (and the resulting damage from that) is a huge deal breakers. SO disappointed.</li>
    <li> Worked great, came as described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It took out strans of my hair as I ran the flat iron through it</li>
    <li> So far I like this product, It has setting where you can adjust the temp, easy to handle. overall good product.</li>
    <li> I have bought my girlfriend 2 in the past 1.5yrs this past one only lasted 3 months. Very disappointed. The last one only lasted 5months with minimal use</li>
    <li> I like it make my hair really straight but it burns it to the max I had only used it 3 times and I have split ends already</li>
    <li> works like a charm every time</li>
    <li> Purshased this product on the 19 septemebr recieved it 24th septemebr!&lt;br /&gt;works like a charm my straightner heats up less then 30 seconds to the extream heat!! really impressed with amazon, i was a first time buyer and will be back</li>
    <li> Super fast shipment! Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the straightener itself, I think it&#x27;s not as hot as I would like it to be. I know you can adjust the heat settings so I will play around with that to see which is best for my hair. Otherwise it&#x27;s just like the CHI except less expensive. Good enough for me as I don&#x27;t plan on straightening my hair all the time.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, good quality! I highly recommend this flat iron</li>
    <li> Perfect my hair is silky straight !</li>
    <li> Amazing product, extremely satisfied!</li>
    <li> Works well!  As advertised. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this flat iron and was perfect for our recent visit to Oxford and London!  Highly recommend without reservation...</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Very luxgerious extras. Easy to use. Should have bought one a long time ago. And this is a top of the line flat iron, according to my beautition.</li>
    <li> Its good for the price. It is lighter in the hand than my Chi was (before it broke...)and it doesn&#x27;t get as hot in my hand so its much more user friendly. I could straighten my hair in 10 minutes with the Chi and this one takes a little longer, about 15 minutes but I am okay with that because it was about 1/3 the price and its easier to handle overall.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my HSI straightener. Works very well even with thick hair. The long cord is very convenient too!</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipment.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Good product. Need to have it on the highest setting to straighten, but it works once turned up. Seems like it&#x27;s very good quality.</li>
    <li> my wife needed a new flat iron.  she loves this one.  does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron makes my hair so soft I have tried so many this by far is the best I might order another for gifts.</li>
    <li> Great service and works really good.  Great value!</li>
    <li> Love the adjustable heat, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know long term reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/12/16 Update:&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong! I only wish it had an auto-off function.  It does a great job on my hair, which is naturally curly, and is about midway down my back.</li>
    <li> It performs as promised.  I am very delighted with the iron.  Have not a complaint in the world at this time.  It heats quickly; has variable temperature setting. While not necessary, the packaging adds a positive note to purchase.  As a non hair professional...am uncertain of need for glove...help.  I have a much smaller iron that cost almost as much as this one.  The HSI is &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; above my smaller one.</li>
    <li> Love my iron .Heats up quickly and does the job. I can use as straightener or curler since it has swivel cord .tiny oil bottle is great wish it was a bit bigger but nonetheless it great!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. I stepped on it and broke it. i need it so bad that i glued it back together expecting it to be used once more and  two years later, it still holding on. For the price i paid, i could not have asked for more. If the one i have were gonna go down, i would definetely buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron based on Amazon reviews.  Thank you guys!! It&#x27;s as wonderful as described and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It came with a heat glove and a small bottle of Argan oil.  The case/sleeve for the iron is not only functional, it&#x27;s a beautiful satin red!</li>
    <li> It is really by far one of the best flat irons I have ever bought and I use it almost every day! It doesn&#x27;t burn your hair or dry it out, if you read the directions and find the right setting for your hair type you will not be disappointed. The price seemed way to cheap and it is to me just as good as a CHI! 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> Can only straighten very small sections of hair at a time. Does not completely eliminate frizz. Good for curling.</li>
    <li> Wife says it works good.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this, it works better than the more expensive ones!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this flat iron! I used to have a Chi and won&#x27;t ever buy again. The Chi fried my hair. Now, my hair is always soft and flat, like I want it. I&#x27;m also going to purchase for 2 daughter in laws for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Its a little heavier than my last iron, but i love it. Heats up fast; on off switch; heat control dial.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i find weak is the power cord which is thin, and doesnt swivel at the iron end.</li>
    <li> Really like this product, and good price</li>
    <li> Not the best straightener for taming flyaways.</li>
    <li> It works great! I have no complaints. I usually buy expensive flat irons in the store for $100+ so I was thrilled that I found this online for so cheap. It lives up to my expectations of expensive flat irons and it was half the price! What more could you ask for??</li>
    <li> i got a really good price on this hair iron, so i can&#x27;t complain. however... it&#x27;s definitely not worth the full price if anyone has to pay it.&lt;br /&gt;i had a Ginalli (which recently stopped working because the cord is loose, however it still works if i can fix the cord) and it took far less time to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;this hair iron works fine, but it&#x27;s not wow! even though it&#x27;s the same size as the other one i used to use with one only works well on small strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;not a bad product at all, just not grrrreat</li>
    <li> Does not get as hot as says it will but works.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!!!! Bought for my wife who wanted a chi. She loved it!!!!! Said that she liked it more than the chi and couldn&#x27;t believe the price.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a flat iron that would be fast and deliver great results. I&#x27;m so pleased with my purchase. I have long, curly hair and with the previous flat irons I use to own, they wouldn&#x27;t give me the sleek, straight look I so much desired. I&#x27;m very glad I was able to find one on this site and that it actually straightens my type of hair fast and without any bumps. My hair also feels soft. For the price, it makes things even better. I loved it so much that I had to write a review and five star it! So if you&#x27;re out there wondering which flat iron to buy I&#x27;d recommend this one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wish it would be a notch hotter. I believe it would do a better job. Because it&#x27;s thin you can twist it for a curl</li>
    <li> What a great find! After buying (and tossing)several flat irons that crimped weirdly, burned my hair and skin, tangled and were a waste of time I was sure I would be disappointed again when I ordered this one. But for the price...why not? Nice surprise...little velvet storage bag, awesome grip and size, even a swivel at the cord base so no tangled cord! And it shines and straightens&lt;br /&gt;long hair beautifully. My daughter uses it herself and from past experience was terrified to burn her neck again....no worries....because of the nifty design you can literally touch the irons edge to your scalp w/ no burning. Love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron when it was $39.99 with prime shipping off Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did as I see the price shot up $10! I used to think a flat iron was only for straightening your hair, something I do not need, but when my hair stylist used one to curl my hair I immediately went searching for my own. This thing is awesome, and I will never be using a curling iron again! And since there are only the 2 metal plates that get hot, you aren&#x27;t risking burning your hands, face or hands as you can so easily do with a curling iron. I have even used this flat iron on my daughters hair- very safe, fast and easy to use. The only thing I find remotely annoying is that the power switch and temp dial are both located on the inside of the flat iron, close to the inside hinge area- which can make reaching it a little bit of a nuisance. Overall I think this is an amazing product and price! Highly recommended for all your curling and hair straightening needs!</li>
    <li> The flat iron straightens hair well however the cord that plugs into the end of the flat iron does not stay plugged in properly. It does not fit in the hole correctly, and it comes unplugged while straightening. I was very unhappy with the outcome of the purchase considering how long it took to ship and the poor customer service experience I received. It&#x27;s almost as if the product was used prior to me receiving it, and I have started the return process.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old flar iron was . Until  used the HSI the styler ceramic flat iron. It got my hair super straight. I felt like i had just left the shop. It left my hair feeling smooth shiny and bouncy. I hesitated on buying it at first because of the low price. But i read a couple of the reviews and decided to order it. I have fell in love with this product and have recommonmended it to my friends. I have medicum corse style hair . its naturually straight ad once i flat iron it , I don;t have to for a couple of days as long as i wrap my hair. i haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in about 5 months. I only get them twice a month anyways . But buy this product . You will love it.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is awesome! Heats up quickly and straightens or curls hair wonderfully. Even better because of the cost!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hot, so fast!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this flat iron to anyone.  The product arrived quickly after I ordered it.  Nice touch to incluce both a glove and a storage bag along with a free sample of a leave in Argon oil conditioner. The iron is very easy to use and leaves my hair very smooth.</li>
    <li> When my previous flat iron started to not heat up all the way I began the hunt for a new one.  My hair dresser suggested a babyliss but I didn&#x27;t like what I was reading review wise and kept looking.  I stumbled across ths bad boy a couple times and the last time I ran across it the price had actually dropped five dollars but the reviews where still singing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later it arrived and contained argon oil (I personally use NOW argon oil instead), a heat glove, and a carry bag for the iron.  Plugged it in and sure enough it had been tripped before it left the factory.  I hit reset (red button on the plug) and it promptly started heating.  Some reviews complain the light is on the bottom but I personally heat on the side anyways so it i didn&#x27;t really notice.  Having a ton of thick course hair I turned it all the way up.  The light is red until fully heated and then switches to green (not off as some reviewers said).  It does go bavpck to red after a couple passes as the heat is pulled into the hair but give it a second and it will be ready again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In twenty minutes I was able flat iron my massive head of hair and it looks like I just got back from my hairdresser.  I&amp;#60;3 it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps DO NOT use at full heat for anything that&#x27;s  not super thick and course! You will burn your hair!</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a professional grade straightener but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the high price.  When I saw this amazing deal I grabbed it.  I am very satisfied with the quality too.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron heats up super fast. Excellent product for straightening hair in a short time. Wonderful performance. Will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> and then I was disappointed. I read many reviews before purchasing this straightener.  I really needed a new one with my think wavy hair, so I was very anxious to try this one with the great reviews.  Yes, I had read some awful reviews as well, I was confident I would be happy with my purchase and it would at least be better than the 3 year old $20 special I had.  Well I was wrong, the straightener doesnt even get as hot as the one I was replacing, and now I have to return. Hopefully I dont have to pay for shipping back. very disappointed...</li>
    <li> It is great for $50. I mean it package itself is awesome. plus it work great will done! love it</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews, not disappointed.  Heats up fast and hot and like the curved ends for flipping hair under.  Works great!  Received it quickly!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s so worth the money. It heats up very quickly, it straightens perfectly and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> This straightener can easily be compared to to the CHI straightener... Same performance same results... . You wont be able to tell the difference.... I don&#x27;t use my curling iron anymore for I can use this to straighten my hair, waive it, flip it, or curl it with one easy step with no frizz once you get the hang of it....Great product for a steal !!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron through the seller Trending and Trending.  Be aware that this seller is not an authorized seller of HSI Products.  I received my flat iron within the shipping time promised.  It looked great- brand new, everything it came with looked brand new and in good working condition.  However, the flat iron was defective.  It barely heated up, even when put on the highest (410 degree) setting.  I tried getting this product to work on two separate occasions before I contacted HSI Professional to alert them.  HSI was great to work with.  Even though they did not sell me the flat iron, they took my Amazon invoice number and checked the seller and informed me that the seller was not authorized to sell their products.  Then they offered to sell me the same item at the same price I paid for it on Amazon.  HSI Professional&#x27;s customer service is outstanding!  After going through this ordeal, I took the time to read through all the reviews posted about the seller- Trending and Trending- and noticed that many other people who ordered this same product through this seller, had the same problem as me- the flat iron not heating up.  I would recommend making sure your seller is authorized to sell HSI products before purchasing from them to avoid what I went through.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Flat Iron during the lightening deals to replace my 12 year old flat iron.  I&#x27;ve tried several others and I really like this one.  Although it comes with the protective glove I&#x27;m to lazy to put it on.  The iron doesn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair like some of the other ones do and it heats up lickety-split and reheats quickly between passes.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My straightener died which we all know happens. I did alot of research, asked friends, and read reviews trying to decide on a new one. I settled on this one based on all the rave reviews but I was not pleased. I have very thick curly hair that I straighten and this just couldn&#x27;t seem to cut it. After using it my hair was still wavy and not straight. It was also very bulky and heavy compared to what I have used before. I guess for the price I should have known better but thought it was worth a try. I ended up buying a different more expensive one of course. If you have thick hair and spend alot of time straightening this isn&#x27;t for you. Needless to say I haven&#x27;t touched it since trying it once. Hope this helps all you thick haired people out there like me.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this flat iron because the price seemed great ($39.99) for how good the reviews were. The price was down for a short time, I guess, cause I see it&#x27;s back up to $60 now. The shipping was super fast and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it when it came. I plugged it in and turned it to the highest setting. It took less than a minute to heat up which was great. I pulled a section of my curly, frizzy hair, and started at it. It pulled my hair where it&#x27;s more fine. I had to go over each section multiple times to achieve a straight look. I did not get that silky shine like the pictures show. Actually, this flat iron is worse than the Jilbere iron I bought at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply over 5 years ago for $30 and I use it on a daily basis! I was under the impression that this could curl your hair too. Well it doesn&#x27;t. I looked up tutorials and everything. It does not curl and it barely straightens. I did not do anything differently to my hair than I normally do. Maybe I got a bad product? I don&#x27;t know, but I am returning this item. It&#x27;s absolutely not worth $40, especially $60. I will go back to Sally&#x27;s and get another Jilbere. Do not waste your money on this! They make you pay return shipping too! Very disappointing! :(</li>
    <li> After i used this great flat iron&lt;br /&gt;I order two more for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;Its really amazing make my hair silky, straight and shiny</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener based on all of the great reviews I read on Amazon. It worked well enough, but nothing really impressive. Unfortunately a few months after buying it it fell off the table while it was hot and the ceramic broke. It wasn&#x27;t even on tile, just carpet. I probably can&#x27;t blame it on the manufacturing, since it was my fault it dropped on the ground, but it wasn&#x27;t anything amazing while it was working, either.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product, especially the price.</li>
    <li> Heats pretty well and does its job great! First one was defective but the seller promptly sent another one, and it turned out to be plain perfect. Great customer support. I&#x27;d recommend to get the large bottle of the oil that&#x27;s included with the iron, it leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I had a flat iron before and it did not do anything for my hair. This works like a charm! Heats up very quickly, does a great job, really straightens the hair. I am so happy with this product, would definitely recommend! The argan oil included with the iron is great, too! Thank you!</li>
    <li> A little heavy,not as good as others,but gets the job done.this was just a less expensive iron until we buy a better one.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. My hair is naturally very coarse, curly, frizzy, and super thick. Not only can I straighten my hair, but I can curl it. I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair, and I surprised I was able to do it so well. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to get this one at first, since I was thinking about getting one that had been the only one to work in my hair. I&#x27;m so happy I decided to take a chance.</li>
    <li> I like it because you can adjust the heat temperature, and it&#x27;s fast. I&#x27;ve tried the hair straightener my friend uses and she is very happy with it - the performance of mine seems to be better. It does damages a hair though, but all of the hair straighteners are harmful in that respect (regardless of the commercials), so if you are using good hair protection heat treatments it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> My Turboion Croc finally broke after dropping it one too many times, so I needed a new iron. I was happy with the quality of the Croc but based on all of the great reviews for the HSI, I thought it would be fun to try something different. I found that it did not straighten or smooth well and the plates also pulled on my hairs. I also missed the digital temperature feature on the Croc. It seemed I had to use a higher temp to get the same effect, but I can&#x27;t really be certain because the dial is so small and hard to see. I think I prefer titanium plates and the digital temp feature so I&#x27;m returning it for the BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium. Hopefully that will work much better!</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering the HSI Flat Iron.  I am very impressed with this flat iron.  My previous flat iron was pretty much shot and I did not realize how bad it was until I got this new HSI flat iron.  It works wonderfully.  My hair looks great and with very little effort.  I have very wavy hair and with my older flat iron, I would have to go over my hair several times to get it straight.  With this HSI Flat Iron, usually it only takes one pass, occasionally twice.  I would totally recommend this to anyone considering it!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> this is the nicest flat iron! I love how hot it gets I use it to curl my hair and it does a perfect job!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I love it.  It is nice and hot and is very easy to use. It came with a cool bag to put in so when I&#x27;m done I can put it away.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I barely write reviews but this was packaged nice the red pouch was cute. It heats up quick. Love love love the Aragon oil it comes with plan on ordering it in a bigger bottle! Arrived on time too.</li>
    <li> 3 months in and it&#x27;s broke</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price.  My daughter loves it</li>
    <li> The instructions said the product had A, B, and C heat settings for different heat/hair types. It did not. What it did have was a knob, very inconveniently placed between the tongs so you could guess what heat you were at. God help you if your guess was too hot because you&#x27;d probably burn your fingers trying to change the setting. The on/off switch is hidden in there as well. A lovely satin bag was included for storage however it was so small it was nearly impossible to squeeze the unit and its cord inside. I used the product once, wasn&#x27;t happy with the results, and have tucked it away in case any house guests are desperate enough to find a use for it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, curly hair.  I was worried that this iron would be too hot and burn it, but it is a great iron.  The temperature control is very good, and my hair gets straightened very quickly, without burning.  I would recommend this to people with fine hair.  I also like that it has a bit of a curved edge, so I can flip the ends under.</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this item.  She says it feels light and comfortable in her hand, and is easy to maneuver.  The flat iron heats up very quickly, and does a great job straightening her hair.  The no-tangle cord is nice and stores safely in the included pouch.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say except that I have no complaints. Straighter works great (I have thick wavy hair). It arrived&lt;br /&gt;quickly, no issues with product or process. I would most def recommend this product. Even my roommates are already asking to borrow it....!!!</li>
    <li> Hair sticks at ends. Thought it was my hair till I tried another. Its okay as a back up.</li>
    <li> So I received my straightener the day it said I would and I just used it yesterday. Can I just say that my hair is still super soft, free of frizz, and super shiny. I bought this one as a replacement to my old one that I&#x27;ve had for over 5 years and it ranks #1 just as my old one did. I so was not expecting the bonuses within the box like the argan oil and the heat glove but I love them. Thanks to the seller for prompt delivery seeing as I needed it for court the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. if you have frizzy coarse thick \\&quot;unmanageable\\&quot; hair this is the product for you</li>
    <li> I have only had my flat iron for about two weeks. I have not used my old one since :) everyone compares it to their chi unfortunately I do not own one due to their hight price and I have 2 small kids to care for. I always thought all flat irons were the same I mean after all it it just two hot plates right?? WRONG...HUGE difference thanks to my friend that showed me her flat iron. As the one I purchased did nothing and I have SEVERAL that do not work. (I was amazed as I have struggled for a long time with my hair!) I do have a Remington which I love...like I said I have not used this flat iron since receiving the HSI..and I actually paid more for my Remington than I did for the HSI. My only problem now is keeping my daughter from running off with it :) I did also buy the HSI argan oil which I really like as well. You don&#x27;t have to use the oil to get the great results from the flat iron, but it does help to protect your hair and it smells good :) I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great product at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only paid $45.00 for my 1\\&quot; flat iron through blue novelties it was brand new and came with te free sample of argan oil and the travel bag....so SHOP around!!!! I see when my review went up it was selling for $129.00?????</li>
    <li> Works really well for my fine, frizzy, wavy hair, only problem is it doesn&#x27;t hold its temperature hot enough like its supposed to.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have had.  It works very well and the red sleeve is pretty and makes me feel pampered.  I think it was a good deal through Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t snap in between plates. Straightens and curls quickly. Hair doesn&#x27;t smell or burn. Just disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get my free bottle of argon oil. Other than that fully satisfy.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I recieved my flat iron in the mail last night that I woke up extra early this morning just so that I could try it out!  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had the settings right so I re-read the instructions and readjusted the settings wondering if maybe that might help-unfortunatly, it didn&#x27;t.  The iron did not get hot, I have an over the counter iron that I bought at Wal Mart for under $20 that totally exceeds my expectations in regards to the heat and how beautiful it leaves my hair.  This iron did not do that.  I guess I must have got a dud and this is normally the reason why I&#x27;m hesitant when buying things online because of all the hassel in having to try and return it.  Everything that was advertised came in the package and it all looked &amp; felt very high quality, only problem is-the iron does not get hot and that&#x27;s what I need in an iron, something that will flaten my hair and give it that shine when I use my $20 iron.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is as good as my old Chi iron,if not better!...and for a fraction of the price. It does a great job with my daughter&#x27;s long, curly hair. I love the long handle and the curved edges. I can straighten or curl the hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Wife likes it she was concerned that which ever straightener she got would not have the heat to tame her naturally curly hair. This one is up to the task it does a fine job and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because of its rave reviews on Amazon and I&#x27;m terribly disappointed! It&#x27;s a mediocre hair iron, it takes forever to iron your hair with it, and it doesn&#x27;t do a great job. (And I know how to iron my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would go so far as to suspect the company of fabricating reviews!</li>
    <li> Great product and my daughter loves it she is very happy with the results and also likes the way he hair feels and how quick she Irons it</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and just received it a few days ago.  It looks great and heats up quickly, however, when I go to straighten my hair, it inevidibly snags and pulls hair out!  EVERY TIME!!  I thought this was a great value and with all the seemingly positive reviews, I figured I would give it a go.  Nope.  I definitely got what I paid for.  A sub par product that wasn&#x27;t worth the $50 plus shipping.  I contacted the seller this morning and this evening, and as of now (7:30 pm)have yet to hear back.  I need to return the item so I can put the money towards a new CHI.  Hoping to hear from the seller (Blue Novelties) soon so we can resolve this issue.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my wife, and she advised that it is a great product, works well and advised that it is well worth what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and works great. Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and heats up in no time. Just be careful because it does heat up really well. So make sure you check your temperature setting.</li>
    <li> The HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener is exactly as described. It costs half the price of the Brand-name hair straghteners and does equally as well. A great value.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great, easy to use on my hair, does a wonderful job in only minutes.  However, I would recommend that the control buttons (on/off and temperature) be larger and located someplace other than inside the flat iron!  For us women over 60, we need larger buttons and easier to manipulate.  Put them on the outside where it would be easier AND safer.</li>
    <li> It sucks and does not work, huge gap between plates. Do not believe the hype!</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist who has been a CHI straighter user for years now.. I haven&#x27;t been happy with the newer models of CHI (I think the quality has gone down since they have gotten so popular)  so thought I would try something different. When I saw the outstanding reviews for the HSI and the incredible price point, I had to give it a try. I&#x27;ve only had it a week so far, but I already like it BETTER thank the CHI! I can adjust the temperature where I need it and I feel as though I don&#x27;t have to run hair through as many times to get the sleek straight look. I also like that it came with the heat protecting glove and the protective sleeve! I always love freebies! Also, the fact that I got it for such a great price through Amazon, if it doesn&#x27;t last as long as my CHI, I won&#x27;t be so upset and Ill just buy another one! So far, I have been very happy with my new HSI straightener!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know why the ironing bars move. it just looks really cheap. and doesn&#x27;t work much better than the old cheap one i have. just spend 100 and buy a brand name one.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing straightener. My hair looks so smooth and shiny when I use it.</li>
    <li> I am black and have EXTREMELY dry, curly/fuzzy hair.  I wear it natural in the summer but in winter, I set it on rollers.  I wind up wearing a head band most of the time.  During the holidays last year, my little sister used a CHI flat iron to straighten my hair.  She purchased it at Marshall&#x27;s for $59.99.  I loved the results, but Marshall&#x27;s after the holidays didn&#x27;t have much left on the shelf.  I headed to Amazon and read the reviews CHI flat irons but the ones for this product were more favorable.  Well, it has exceeded my expectations!  I have not tried the Argan oil that arrived with the flat iron because I had finally found a new line of hair products that keep my hair moisturized.  It works great with the products I use!  It heats quickly and makes my hair straight with little effort.  Sometimes it remains straight for days.  The price, $49.99, is an incredible bargain.  I cannot recommend this product enough and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my hair!</li>
    <li> Love my new curling iron! Having just moved back to the US from the UK, I knew I needed a high-quality iron to match the intensity of my British one.  The HSI is great because it gets quite hot (450F) without the burning sensation I&#x27;ve had with other products.  I use it to both straighten and curl my hair and have gotten tons of compliments already. The Argan oil that was included was also awesome, making my hair feel shiny without being oily.  It also seems to have helped combat a lot of split ends.  The only downside is that sometimes 1-2 strands of hair get stuck somewhere in the iron which is somewhat uncomfortable.  After using the HSI a few times, though, I seemed to get the hang of it and haven&#x27;t had that problem recently.  Would definitely recommend it, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of straighteners... this one is a close second to my favorite I have- it heats up FAST.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavier than most straighteners, but for some reason- it just makes it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron on a whim.  Big mistake!  One of the plates quit working after 5 months of use.  I treated it well, never dropped it and used it about 4 times a week.  It is not even worth the free Prime shipping .</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron, easy to use and love the fact it has temperature settings. Would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of my sisters recommendation.  It got my natural kinky/curly hair straight. People who know me thought I got a Perm.</li>
    <li> This simply didn&#x27;t get hot enough to offer any kind of real lasting power.  The clamp didn&#x27;t seem to hold much hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- UPDATE... FOUND THE PERFECT FLAT IRON... BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium 1 1/2 \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have had a expensive flat iron for the past 4 years, it is sort of dying on me however, so I saw this and ordered it. I put it to the test with my hair.. It is super curly, but when i shower and just kinda let it go, or sleep on it (like i did today) it tends to be even more difficult to straighten. This flat iron took a little longer to heat up then I am use to, but once it did it only took a run or two down each section before it was smooth. I took away one start due to the fact that it tends to pull on your hair, and it gets a bit annoying when trying to do your hair.</li>
    <li> I didnt like this flat iron, my cheaper one worked better but maybe cuz its meant to not hurt tour hair but i didnt feel or hear that sizzle wen you know your hair is being starigtnes flat. I had to go over it 2 sometimes 3 times but maybe cuz my hair is thicker! :)))</li>
    <li> I dropped this ~3 feet the second week I had this and both ceramix plates popped right out and parts cracked.  I&#x27;ve had CHIs for years and dropped them regularly without them breaking.  This is a fragile flat iron.  If you can be very careful with it, it would be a good product.  It gets very hot and heats up pretty quick.</li>
    <li> The only thing that sold me about this product was the PRICE AND the reviews. But I feel that the reviews are a bit overhyped. I expected unicorns and rainbows to come out of this thing but..it was just a regular hair straightener. I feel that this straightener is no different than any other Target brand (or any other low end) hair straightener. It&#x27;s okay. Nothing special. And to know that this was once priced at almost $300-$400?? That&#x27;s just ridiculous. If I had paid full original price for this, I would not have been a happy camper. But because I bought it at $40...it&#x27;s forgivable.</li>
    <li> Well this was shipped very fast!! I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I just wanted to say that the straightener was brand new in the box it has a  very small bottle of some sort of oil and a free pouch plus a HSI glove so you don&#x27;t burn ur hands when ur straightening your hair. Plus the company shipped a free wifi extender! So that was a plus!!! I&#x27;m very excited to use this straightener and will update my review as soon as I do!!! :-)</li>
    <li> A longer iron which is nice but it&#x27;s narrower.  Plates are smooth.  I would rather have a digital readout of temp or a setting instead of the turn dial that is somewhere between &amp;#34;ice cold and fry your hair&amp;#34; setting.</li>
    <li> I bought this one year ago and although I love how well it straightens it eats my hair.  My hair will get stuck under the iron and will snap it.  I have tried being very careful and pulling a small section away from my hair but it still snags.  If it weren&#x27;t for this I would have given 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I have very thin yet super frizzy hair. This straightener works great to smooth and shine. Heats up very well, temperature is adjustable. Comes very nicely boxed with a glove, silk carrying bag, and even an oil sample. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So glad I found a quality straightener for my thick hair. It heats up fast and is do easy to use!</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for my CHI which finally broke after 3 years.  I couldn&#x27;t afford a CHI at at retail store, and I didn&#x27;t want to get one on here and be sent a fake, so I went in search of another brand.  I considered HSI because it was on the Amazon &amp;#34;recommends&amp;#34; list.  It had such great reviews and I have very thin/fine hair, so I loved that the temperature could be adjusted.  It was a fantastic price so I went ahead and got it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product had great packaging and my coworkers commented that it looked like a very expensive product when I opened it.  When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t much like it.  The plates grabbed at my hair and, while it didn&#x27;t necessarily hurt, it was just a weird feeling.  After another try, I realized that I was gripping the plates too hard (like I used to on my CHI).  After I stopped doing that, it glided through my hair.  The Moroccan oil made my hair feel great, but the serum is too thick and weighs down my thin hair.  I have the heat set to just blow half way and it straightens my hair in just one pass (my hair is normally a weird wavy-ish mess after drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife after her CHI that she had for about 5 years died.  She is very happy with the product and says that it is on par with much more expensive brands.  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> It works good and it came fast the only complaint I have was the package it came in was wet an the straightener was a little wet also I think it should be packed  better.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and I have tried many, I love this one more than my CHI. It basically just glides through your hair with ease, making it look shiney and smooth. They tried to sell me this at the mall for about $200.00 so its a great deal on here. Im extremly picky when it comes to my hair but i would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I owned a CHU flat iron for a couple years and it stopped working. I wanted to try a new product and found the HSI on Amazon. I read the reviews and they were all positive so i decided to purchase it. I am very pleased with the product. The HSI gets nice and hot and really works well in flattening my hair. I love this product and would refer it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this at such a great price, however, I have used it now about 10 times and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot anymore.  It worked great the first few times I used it but now its not working so well.  Dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> This may work for some but not me. I found it too big and bulky, I needed something more compact for travel and storing.</li>
    <li> I got the HSI Straightener through Groupon. First, whoever came up with the idea of originally pricing this thing at $199.99 had to be kidding themselves... This straightener is worth maybe $35.&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse, thick wavy hair. I have been straightening my hair for about 10 years now, and on an every day basis, so I&#x27;ve gone through many types of straighteners. Though this one works I&#x27;d say, okay at best, it is nothing in comparison to any of the others I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;My first complaint would be the weight. It is quite heavy, if not the heaviest straightener I have owned. My second complaint would be the thickness of the handle. It has a weird feel for me when I&#x27;m straightening my hair. I just feel like I cant get a good grip on it despite the no slip grooves. Lastly, would be the temp setting. There is no indication of what temperature your flat iron is at unless it is all the way up at the hottest setting.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the flaws, I&#x27;d say this flat iron is good for people who have maybe never owned one before or don&#x27;t straighten their hair everyday, but for me, It&#x27;s a no go.</li>
    <li> nice packaging. good  price but did not like the product.  the mechanism to open/close was tight and it squeaked/made noises that were annoying.  also, don&#x27;t feel that it did the job as well as other flat irons that we own.  will return.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron as a replacement for one that was broken while traveling. (HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very solidly constructed, has adjustable heating controls and heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Way better than any iron I have purchased at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Salon. I was very hesitant to buy this but I am so happy I did. I don&#x27;t love CHI&#x27;s because they pull my hair, and I had an AMIKA but the corners chipped off. I have curly hair- like from the root curly. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair everyday because its just a lot of work. But I straighten the tops and curly the bottoms to get a sleek wavy look. Anyways- very happy with this purchase. I was nervous doing it but happy I did!</li>
    <li> I am used to chi irons, but unfortunately mine died unexpectedly.  I decided to try something different and decided on HSI.  It heats up quickly, it has a green light telling you when it&#x27;s ready and I really like it in an ergonomic sense, but I just don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as the chi.  I have curly hair and followed the setting instructions to turn it to the highest heat level and the red light never turns green at that level.  My hair does smooth out, but it takes more passes to get it as smooth as before.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a good iron and best for people with wavy hair, but just not the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I received the iron very quickly and was extremely happy with the purchasing experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She uses it for her hair and our two daughters from time to time. She loves it, says it is the best one she has owned.</li>
    <li> Love it I am glad I read the reviews before spending an ungodly amount of money on a curling iron. If you buy this get the argon oil to go with it. The two work well together especially for African American hair. It leaves your hair shiny and silky. Love it, love the price. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and item as described. I bought from you since the HSI official website stated that you sell 100% authentic HSI flat irons. And you sell it for a great price too! Thank you so much! Would definitely buy from again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different hair straighteners in my time, and truth be told this was my last one i was going to try, i loved how i could start off on a low setting and make hotter as needed, my hair has never gone straight with a home straightener, so i was very pleased with how it turned out, i will be trying this again soon just to check on the time and the settings etc, but within 25 mins i was basically done with my hair, i&#x27;ve never been able to get the frizz out like this before and be done with all my hair basically in less than a hour let alone 25 mins. i would suggest this hair straightener to anyone that hasn&#x27;t been able to find one for their hair. Good luck :) i&#x27;d say its well worth the price! And the glove that was sent with the straightener love it, i would of burned myself so many times when doing the back of my hair!</li>
    <li> Great value compared to other choices. Does a great job and works as described. Great choice for our teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> This straighter gets super hott!!! I have not had a problem with it yet :) it gets hott really fast. I have very thick wavy hair and it gets my hair super straight and makes it feel so thin and light LOVE ITT</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd flat iron I have purchased and by far my favorite.  It heats quickly, comes with carrying bag and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons. Heats up fast and works great. I recommend this product. Good for course and curly hair</li>
    <li> IT WENT BAD AFTER 2 USES. I tried reset as per suggestions but it doesnt work. I wished I could return or exchange it</li>
    <li> I thought I would try the HSI Flat Iron after reading a number of favorable reviews.  I was replacing my CHI flat iron which I paid more than twice as much for, after the hinge mechanism broke.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the HSI and I liked the grip finish right away.  The first time I used it to straighten my crazy, wild shoulder length mop the HSI tamed it down into a nice sleek bob in a few minutes, without overheating my hair, as the CHI tended to do.  I am very satisfied with my buying decision.</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up so fast! Takes half the time to do my hair than my previous flat iron.</li>
    <li> I, a faithful Chi owner, became fed up with the life span of my flat iron. In 9 years, I have owned 8 Chi irons. For the $100 price tag, I wanted a product that would last longer than a year or so. After reading rave reviews how this is the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Chi only better, I bought it. It worked okay. It got hotter than the Chi, but took just as long to straighten my hair. The iron was heavy and the style was so-so. Nothing bad but definitely not Chi-level or anything to rave about. Then, after just over 1 month, it broke. I plug it in, the light turns on, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot. I can lay my hand on the plate and feel next to no warmth. No, it&#x27;s not a short in the cord. No, I didn&#x27;t miss-use it. No, I didn&#x27;t drop it or twirl the cord. It&#x27;s been on my bathroom counter since day 1 and has never been moved other than plugging and un-plugging it. This product is simply not well-made. Even if it were still working, I would give it maybe a 3. Being that it quit working a dozen times faster than my Chi (which is now only $10 more on Amazon) it was NOT worth the money at all. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Spend the extra few bucks and get a good, trustworthy, name-brand product. ;)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It has lasted me 2 years so far. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I would like this straightener better if it had a regular plug-in.  The straightener continuously shuts off and I have to restart the adapter on the plug.  Don&#x27;t recommend this straightener because of it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my hair straightener. I am new at using these so I do need some practice to get the results I want but this is the perfect size for my hair length and I love that there is temp control. There isn&#x27;t anything that I am unhappy with. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Honestly, my $15 flat iron works the same only my hair runs through my walmart one easier. I am very disappointed. My step daughters Chi works so much better. I was fooled by the high rating.</li>
    <li> This works very good, love the price.</li>
    <li> I got this for my significant other and she is very particular about her flat iron. She has another brand of which I will not say that she says is much better but is nearly triple the price of the HSI. This is her spare when she is at my place and she said that it does the trick.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this. It is everything the reviews say it was and the price was wonderful. Been looking for a flat iron for years now and couldn&#x27;t stomach the price tag on most. Thanks to Amazon, this little beauty arrived with no regrets.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter so we would both have our own flat iron. The argan oil is very nice too - it made her hair so silky smooth and soft looking. I just may have to get one for myself! Great price and on time shipping. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, lightweight,heats up quickly, and comfortable in my hand. Received flat VERY quickly after ordering. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.I am happy with it and would recommend to others. LOOKING FORWARD TO OR DER ONE MORE</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. I&#x27;m am heading to Europe for a month and needed one to bring with me but I loved that this one also works at home so I could use it all the time. It straighteners my hair perfectly and it stays all day and I love the way it curls my hair. I actually want to do my hair just to use it!</li>
    <li> after using this for a couple months. I used this on my daughters natural hair . it worked find with me putting on  350. I put weave in my hair and tried to straighten it did nothing. This flatiron is good for hair not weave</li>
    <li> Works great! Curls, straightens, reasonable price. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> My daughters love it and said it was the best they had ever used. Easy on the hair and to use. They also liked the glove to keep them safe and burn free.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and the delivery was awesome. I got it in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it has good reviews. It looked bigger in the picture but the plate is too small to capture a good portion of my hair. I have a jet black, long, silky, shiny hair (Asian hair) and its hard to use this product on this kind of hair. Not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought one 2 years ago &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it ever since &amp; even when a freak drop broke it, I immediately bought another one</li>
    <li> I will never buy a different hair straightener! This is my third one in 5 years. The other two broke for accidental reasons but the straightener is great!</li>
    <li> heats up quickly and does a nice job of straighening my hair</li>
    <li> Love my new hair straightener! I had a Chi before this one and can&#x27;t even tell the difference. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> This is better then the $20 straightener I got from Walmart for sure BUT I used to have the Chi (lasted me for 7 years) and this one does not straighten near as good as the Chi. All the reviews were over the moon for this product but I&#x27;m definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love the oil and iron really straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter is thrilled with her new HSI flat iron. She has very thick curly hair, so of course she really wants straight hair. With this flat iron she achieves that--perfectly straight hair. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive the product and was impressed with the packaging that included a special travel bag for the flat iron.  I have naturally curly hair that is hard to keep straight during the humid summer.  After reading both positive and negative reviews, I decided to try this flat iron.  I was disappointed.  Immediately I noticed it pulled my hair as I used the iron.  I could feel and hear the pulling.  It straightened the curls from my hair, but the frizz was still there and continued to worsen as the day wore on.  I chalk this purchase up to a lesson learned.  Stick with products you know work even if they are a bit more expensive.  I then bought a Paul Mitchell and absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener so much! I went through 5 conair hair straighteners before this one and I&#x27;m never looking back! It&#x27;s the perfect temperature and is very sturdy! Just don&#x27;t leave it unattended on a pillow like I did! RIP pillow!</li>
    <li> 2 years ago i purchased a very expensive name brand flat iron. Within months, one side quit working. I managed to use that for the remaining time, until now. I spent $100 less and it does a much better job than the expensive junk i purchased before. Love the argon oil that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, good bye old one.</li>
    <li> I bought the product recently. This woks pretty well. Easy to handle. Provides a smooth and shiny straightened look. Overall very satisfied with this product for the money spent.</li>
    <li> Works amazing.  Totally worth it for the price. Just as good as the one I bought for $100. Love it.</li>
    <li> I needed a new straightener but usually don&#x27;t spend more than $30 on one.  This was the deal of the century  regularly $200 on for less than $40 and free shipping!!!!  Price was great and then the quality matched it!&lt;br /&gt;I have hair than can become wavy and somewhat unruly, especially with spring and summer humidity.  This straightener conquers that issue with little effort or time.  The unit heats up quickly which is great on days where I get sidetracked getting ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;No regrets so far!</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery of a quality product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Loved it and came in handy while I traveled overseas to Europe - perfect size for travel. Great product - thanks!!!!!</li>
    <li> for my gorg hair. this is the answer!</li>
    <li> This was my first flat iron purchase. I love it. It does exactly what it said and comes with a nice bag, too.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener!  It heats up quickly and only takes minutes to do my hair.  I have fine, thin hair and this straightener makes my hair look silky and healthy.  It is a great product for the price.  I spend about 20 min max to straighten my hair.  I would definitely recommend this to others .</li>
    <li> A little heavy but Love it!</li>
    <li> This iron does such a fine job.  The thermostatic control is perfect.  Thank you so much for such a fine product.</li>
    <li> I just tried the product and it&#x27;s great, better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used before.  Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the dual voltage flat iron that I have been seeking for international travel.  It is fairly small and light, and the dual voltage works perfectly.  It is also a very high-quality flat iron, comparable to my regular everyday one.  My previous, inexpensive travel iron was really tearing my hair up with split ends.  I plan to enjoy this one on my travel from now on.</li>
    <li> Best feature is the really fast heat up time. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, good size, and easy to use. Great product.</li>
    <li> gave it as a gift and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Tugs on hair, not as smooth as my Sedu flat iron.  Quick to heat up. Need to turn on button.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flat iron. It has adjustable heat settings, temp remains consistent and can straighten my hair in just one pass. I used to own a CHI and I noticed that with the CHI the heat does not stay long, i have to repeat ironing 3 times to get my hair pin straight. The worst part of the CHI is that my hair gets caught on the side of the plates. I hate that! The HSI glides smoothly and does not pull my hair strands.The HSI is hands down the better choice and for half the price of a CHI, it&#x27;s definitely a steal.</li>
    <li> Love the iron, makes my hair straight and shiny!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this straightener. It is easy to use and heats quickly. It does a great job on her hair. It came well packaged and when promised.</li>
    <li> Took this to Europe with me and it worked beautifully.  You plug it in to your electrical adapter and it automatically adjusts to the voltage.  Six weeks and multiple countries with no problems.</li>
    <li> I researched many flat iron straighteners before deciding on this one. So far, I am very pleased with this product. I get the same results as the one my daughter purchased for over $100.00 some time back. I was able to adjust the perfect heat setting to match my type of hair and it works great to curl it just enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too impressed. I have one better</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flat iron of all the ones I have purchased over the years.  I love the on/off buttons and heat settings.</li>
    <li> Its&#x27; not great but it&#x27;s good and pretty cheap. I feel like it dries my hair out a little more than my last one and doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight as well but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I have never used a flat iron before, I usually keep my hair short and I wanted something that could help me get beach waves rather than curls. I purchased this one with a gift card I got for my birthday. It works great, heats up quicklyand doesn&#x27;t leave a kink at start or finish. The shipping time was shorter than estimated too, which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> I reviewed many Flat Irons and this one was rated high. Unfortunately after trying the HSI I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the unit I received.&lt;br /&gt;When closing the iron on my hair the two sides did not touch. I had to squeeze very hard to get the Ceramic  pads to touch solid on my hair. Then at the end (tip) of both sides there was a place where my hair catch in it and pulled and hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the flat iron I received was defected....I just know I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this straightener.  I had been eyeing it for months and I am SO glad I purchased it. I use this to straighten AND curl my hair.  It&#x27;s so easy and doesn&#x27;t take long at all!  This straightener gets HOT so use heat protectant. The heat can be adjusted for those who need a lower heat setting.  Most flat irons I&#x27;ve used you have to go back a couple times to get the hair straight, but not with this one.  It gets it done the first time and leaves your hair so smooth and shiny.  And it lasts for days!  I will never use a different brand again.  If I could give this more stars I would.  The oil that came with it is amazing as well and I will definitely be purchasing that too.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and this flat iron makes my hair look like I used chemical to straighten my hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have had  to practice a bit with this as I have not used one before.  Leaves hair shiny and smooth.  i have wavy to curly chin length hair so have a little difficulty with short hair in back but overall seem to do a good job.  My daughter in law, who has used a flat iron for a long time, LOVES it and says it does a better job on her hair than her own iron.  Great price.  I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back is the case it came with...the iron and the cord does not fit in it so for travel not all that useful.  Are you supposed to cover these to protect them??</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It tames my most unruly hair days. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> For the money this cost you cant go wrong!!</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron.  I&#x27;ve never seen my hair this straight.  I do not have naturally curly hair but I do have a perm that is growing out.  This iron makes my hair soft and straight.  I can actually see the layers from my hair cut.</li>
    <li> Love it. Only need one sweep over a large section of hair and it&#x27;s straight. I have normal hair and it takes 15 min to straighten. I bought another straightener before this and returned it when I fell in love with this one</li>
    <li> I bought this product 6 months ago. Works well for the price you pay. However, after dropping it on the carpet accidentally the parts fell apart and broke. This product was made with cheap parts so I am highly disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my HSI flat iron! Before purchasing it I read several reviews of very satisfied customers, so I decided to give it a try. The HSI warms up in no time, and used in combination with the Argon oil that came along with it, it leaves my hair shiny and soft. This iron is very easy to use, even for a first time user like me. My favorite  feature is that the HSI is also dual voltage, which is very important to me as I frequently travel overseas. Just came back from a two week trip to different countries in Europe and the HSI performed with no issues (just use an adapter for the country you are in).  After purchasing this iron I tried my friend&#x27;s Chi and like mine way better. If you are looking for a reasonably priced, excellent product that can be used in a different voltage, search no more!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a recent trip to China and an upcoming trip to South Africa. I liked that it is dual voltage so I&#x27;m able to use it here in the States when my current one breaks. It works really well. Heats up fast. I like the heat proof travel sleeve. Makes it easy to pack. My only (slight) gripe is the plates are not as smooth as my other flat iron. It still works well. My hair looked great for the whole trip but the feel was a little different than what I&#x27;m used to. I def. recommend.</li>
    <li> My 1st flat iron, works great!</li>
    <li> Came very quickly, super high quality and an AMAZING value for the price.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, she loves it. Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, she has bought other brands in the past and they have no lasted her that long for some reason or another, but she is really happy with this brand. Happy wife, happy me!!!</li>
    <li> Straightened my hair the first pass through.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use and price was excellent</li>
    <li> Fantastic, exactly what I was looking for--great quality straightener for a reasonable price. Plus the travel bag and heat glove are super handy. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Ireland. The fact that is dual voltage means I will have it as a back up for my current flatiron now that I&#x27;m home. It did the job but I like my Solia better. The HSI doesn&#x27;t run as smoothly through the hair.</li>
    <li> Used it 5 times so far and it works great!</li>
    <li> Love it! Just as good as my old Chi.</li>
    <li> I am getting ready to order a Chi.  I bought this iron due to the great reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it takes a long time for me to straighten my hair.  I will heat it up until the light turns green, but as soon as I pick it up the light goes red. I have had it for several months, but as it gets older it gets worse.  I am glad everyone else has had luck with it, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this product better than my chi which is saying a heck of a lot. The product glides effortlessly on my curly hair and straightens without any of the nasty smoke and burn smell.</li>
    <li> love love love this product. you will see how this worked out for your hair. Be smooth and silk!!I love the argan oil too, very helpful for my hair. Just get it girls!</li>
    <li> Great flatiron very happy with quality my daughter has course hair and it makes her hair silky and smooth great product!!</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes after reading all the wonderful reviews on this straightener. Price isn&#x27;t an issue for me, I just wanted the best- I decided on this, and when I got it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it pulled and tugged on my hair! I was very disappointed and returned it. It&#x27;s a very attractive, sturdy iron, but it just didnt come through for me. I found something I am much happier with, so it all worked out.</li>
    <li> I have very unruly hair and am very picky with my styling tools...this one is amazing! I bought it based on many positive reviews and I am very pleased! My hair straightens very easily and holds style well; it also takes half the time of my previous straightener.Finally, the price is great...I am going to order another one for my daughter!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this vendor and item, super fast delivery.  I have never used a straightener before but have watched my stylist use it and always like how my hair looked. Very fast heat up, no waiting. So I tried it out and amazingly I have been able to turn out a nice result and getting better everyday.  The iron is easy to use and the swivel cord makes it easier to get around especially to the back of the head. Very nice touch including the pouch, glove (I was nervous about burning my hand) and argan oil sample. All round very pleased with purchase and recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my favorite flat iron broke. I thought I would give it a chance bc of all the positive reviews. BUT so disappointed in the product. I have to keep it on for hours before it gets hot enough, snags my hair, not easy to clamp with one hand, takes forever to &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; and still leaves frizz and my hair does not get as smooth as my last flat iron was able to. I am super disappointed and unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great and very reasonably priced. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t flat ironed my hair before so I can&#x27;t compare with many other brands. However, just days after buying this HSI I also purchased the Amika Mighty Mini Very Cherry Styler from Sephora. It is a tiny flat iron that heats upto 400F meant for bangs. I found it much more effective in making my hair flat and smooth. I also tried the Royale flat iron at a mall and it also made my hair straight and smooth in just one pass - of course, a sales assistant was doing it and I know they are experts at demonstration (maybe the heat was higher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the HSI, it didn&#x27;t heat up much and I emailed HSI with my issue. No response! The second time I used it, luckily it heated up properly but I still find that I need to pass the iron several times down my hair to see any effect. It also barely lasts a few hours. Otherwise its easy to use and manouver. You would have to be very clumsy to need the glove! I also like the satin bag which is meant to hold it, although it would have made sense to make it a little larger to accommodate the plug and the glove.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she says its incredible!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, after reviewing many straighteners, especially Chi&#x27;s I was able to determine that this product was just as good or even better than the Chi.  I gave the gift early and she loves this product, I hear everyday how great of a present it was.  I am glad that I choose this product and would recommend the HSI Flat Iron to anyone that was in the market.</li>
    <li> My hair: curly, long, fine strands (but a lot of them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron because of the smaller plate size.  I already have a 2\\&quot; CHI that I LOVE, but I wanted smaller plates to allow my hair more movement after it&#x27;s been straightened (as opposed to the super flat, super straight hair from my CHI).  I planned to buy another CHI until I saw how fabulous the reviews were for this iron and the amazing deal offered on Cyber Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron gets nice and hot very quickly.  One of my primary concerns when buying another iron was that it would pinch and pull my hair on the sides of the plates.  Many other straighteners do that.  The 1\\&quot; HSI does NOT ever pinch or pull hair.  It leaves it shiny, straight, and soft.  I also love the satin sleeve that allows the flat iron to cool safely.  It is excellent for portability!  I used to cart my big chunky CHI to work for a little daytime hair sprucing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great straightener!  I am very, very please with my choice to buy HSI instead of another CHI or any of the other brands out there.</li>
    <li> Great product made to last! I&#x27;ve had the HSI Flat Iron for over a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this straightener. High quality and does not damage your hair. I use with Organix Moroccan Argan Oil and that keeps my hair from getting damaged. Hair is soft and very shiny with no tangles. Other straighteners left my hair feeling a little &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; and tangled, but this one works great. Really like the extra long cord. It also curls my hair very nicely. Since the curls hold really well, I don&#x27;t have to use any product on my hair. This keeps them soft and bouncy. Would definitely recommend. A very good deal.</li>
    <li> exceeded expectations. the decription of the product matched the results.&lt;br /&gt;well made. happily surprised by the complimentary hair oil and glove.  sturdily built this product should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this styler for my sister in law for christmas and she loves it.. I have never heard of it but she was totally wanting it and said that it was a great styler!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a perfect little flat iron. It gets my hair super straight. And it comes with it&#x27;s own travelling case and glove. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had been considering WAY more expensive flat irons -- my hair is thick and it is long so I have tried several brands of flat irons and have not been happy with many of them.  The very first time I used this flat iron, I had more compliments on my hair than I have had in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;The included glove to help protect your hand against burns, the box it comes in, the silky pouch to keep it in...all were extras that made me feel like I got a STEAL on this flat iron!</li>
    <li> My Chi iron broke and I got this one to replace it. I had the Chi for a number of years but it was a top rated product when purchased and it held up wonderfully. This iron, which was soooo much cheaper is just as good and soooo much more affordable! I liked it so much that I got this one from this seller as a CHristmas present for my friend who has naturally curly hair (Mines is thick and frizzy). The seller ships super fast and the product came in perfect condition. You can&#x27;t go wrong at this price!</li>
    <li> THIS HSI FLAT IRON WORKS GREAT ESPCIALLY FOR THE PRICE I WAS LOOKING FOR ... THEY EVEN OFFRED TO SEND ME A FREE OIL FOR THE FLAT IRON.  MY GIRL FRIEND LOVES IT ... IT DOESNT TKE LONG TO HEAT UP AND IS SAFE BECAUSE WE HAVE KIDS... I SUGGEST ANYONE WHO WANTS AN AFFORDABLE FLAT IRON THAT DOES THE TRICK , AND NOT HAVE TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS SHOULD CONSIDER THIS HSI STRAIGHTENER.</li>
    <li> I went to a mall last week and was really impressed by the ISO flat iron only to find out it was $300.00! I was disgusted at this price and decided to look on Amazon.com to see if I could find a more reasonable flat iron. Well I did and am completely happy with my purchase. I read several reviews about the HSI iron and was very skeptical at first but decided to try it out. I had never heard of this brand. Not only does it work amazing but I don&#x27;t have to use several products that weigh your hair down in the process. I just let my naturally thick hair dry and then flat iron it. I have shoulder length hair and am able to straighten in about 10 minutes and it looks as good as Jennifer Anniston&#x27;s!! Well I 100% percent recommend this flat iron if you want an amazing flat iron for a minimal cost. -Kristina</li>
    <li> I just received the HSI Flat Iron and I really like it a lot.  It works like a professional quality product but at a VERY reasonable price. My hair looked softer and silklier right away, it certainly tamed the \\&quot;frizzes\\&quot;. This Iron gets an A+++ from me...</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once since getting it but it appears to be of good quality. I have been wanting to get myself a nice decent straightener for some time now and saw the HSI (The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch)on one of my blog websites as a a good deal so I ordered it. I have thick primarily straight hair but I wanted to be able to get it real straight once in a while. This product seems to be perfect for the job. Comes in a timely manor and in store packaging. I would recommend. In addition this seller has contacted me several times to make sure everything is good (which shows they care about a good reputation!)</li>
    <li> I have never been one that spends too much time on my hair but I got a style that kinda requires it so I found this &amp; ever since I love every bit of it. Its easy &amp; fast &amp; that what a mother of 3 needs.</li>
    <li> Great straightener and an even better price! I have thick long wavy hair and it straightens it perfectly. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I think this is an excellent flat iron! I&#x27;ve never owned any high end flat irons (like the ones from CHI) before so I can&#x27;t compare this to those but this is definitely way better then the flat irons from drugstore brands like Conair and Revlon (even the ones that also claim to be ceramic). And it&#x27;s not that much more expensive then the ones you get from the drugstore so I&#x27;d consider this a much more worthwhile investment. My old \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; flat irons would leave my hair shiny right after I straighten it but the next day my hair would be incredibly dry and brittle. I&#x27;ve had this HSI flat iron for around a month now and have been using it pretty regularly and that has not happened yet with this flat iron. I also like the temperature range this flat iron has, 140-410. It&#x27;s nice since I have naturally fine, straight hair that occasionally gets a little wavy from being slept on or tied up so I like to use a lower heat setting (around 200) so that my hair doesn&#x27;t get too damaged. But I can also turn up the heat when I want to curl my hair (usually to around 300) and it has a swivel cord so I never have to worry about the wires tangling up together. Overall this is a great flat iron and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is super. You can control the heat setting to your preference and that makes a huge difference for those of us with thicker curlier hair types. It works effortlessly and heats up fast. My hair is done in under ten minutes. I have shoulder length hair, by the way. It costs less than the Chi and in my opinion works better. I returned the Chi to try this and I am much happier with HSI.</li>
    <li> Update : AMAZon &#x3D; AMAZing customer service. My money was refunded . No questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;But the seller seems to have ensured that the review was marked Unhelpful so that it lies at the bottom of the negative reviews!!&lt;br /&gt;Also , the way the price of this fluctuates (39.99-- 49.99-- 59.99)makes me distrust this seller even more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reallly wanted to love this one ! I had contemplated a lot before buying this one !&lt;br /&gt;The reviews always seemed somewhat unreal to me, but still the optimist in me took over and I went ahead and bought this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what happened.&lt;br /&gt;I got a lemon or the other reviewers got some other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The one I received seems to be a refurbished one !&lt;br /&gt;  The box was secured with a scotch tape !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously ??? Have you ever seen even the cheapest product with scotch tape ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. The box itself is a cheap cardboard kind of box, Nothing that you see with a product that is supposed to be $299 or even 50  bucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly , I dont care much about the packaging. This is just to give a perspective.&lt;br /&gt;The real problem starts afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The make and feel of the iron is not very great. Not bad , but just average&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. One of the plate has a small chip in it . It is not a huge one , but nonetheless it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The Iron doesnt heat up to what it says. Especially if you dont take the dial to max temperature.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly straight hair. I need a flat iron for just removing the frizz and add some shine.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I never need to go the max temperature . My hair will do with much less heat, but not with this one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. It would snag and pull my hair. I tried with my regular heat spray as I did not want the results of the included Argan oil to impact my review of the iron- which is my primary purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Solia before , and it would take 5-10 minutes for me to be done.&lt;br /&gt;But this one took me 25 minutes and still I was not completely done.&lt;br /&gt;The light would turn green for some time, but then would be going red again after few seconds. This would keep on happening all the time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. If you use the iron with the oil provided alongwith , the results are a shade better, but then I dont want to buy that for now. I have enough product with me and dont want to buy another one. Also , again , the results were not what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. The Glove is provided is kindof useless- The iron doesnt get hot enough !!&lt;br /&gt;  But anyway , thats a freebie , so nothing against the glove itself. I would never buy it separately though- definitely not at price it is on Amazon! Again a super inflate price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. The pouch provided looks nice&lt;br /&gt;  But again, thats a freebie , so it would have been a happy addition, if the primary product was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. I tried contacting the seller, but did not get any response . So , unfortunately , this would have to go back</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift - great price and my friend loves it! Would definitely buy for myself. Five stars for sure.</li>
    <li> Great affordable product. No need to spend hundreds of dollars on a straightener anymore. Also I really like the glove</li>
    <li> My previous straightener was a cheap model from a big box store.  My mom had a CHI straightener that was fantastic.  After realizing how bad mine was.  (I was satisfied, until I tried the CHI).  I purchased this one on a lightening deal, or deal of the day on impulse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  It works just as well as my mom&#x27;s $150 CHI straightener.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t upgrade sooner!  It heats up immediately and leaves my hair silky smooth!  I don&#x27;t use it too often. Maybe I&#x27;ll update the review after I&#x27;ve used it more regularly and for a longer time.  But currently I can say it is completely comparable to my mom&#x27;s expensive CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for a while now and could not be more impressed.  The quality is certainly equal to the more expensive straighteners I&#x27;ve used.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She has been raving about it for almost two months now.  Best one she has ever used.  She raved so much about the hair oil that came with it, I bought her that for Christmas.  Buy, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS FLAT IRON FOR MY DAUGHTER B/C I GOT TIRED OF HER USING MINE AND NOT BRINGING IT BACK. THIS IS A GREAT FLAT IRON FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED, I PAID ALMOST $200 BUCKS FOR THE ONE I HAVE, AND GOT THIS ONE AND IT WORKS JUST AS WELL ON MY HAIR AND GOT IT FOR LIKE $40 BUCKS</li>
    <li> I got the HSI flat iron for my daughter for Christmas after reading all the reviews and the product rating. All I can say my daughter loves this flat iron. It makes her hair extremely straight and looks bouncey (FYI, she is mixed.). I also appreciate the fact that it came with argan oil to protect hair, as well as, glove for holding iron. Highly recommend product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 17 yo daughter but I think I use it more then she does. Works well and doesn&#x27;t fry the hair.</li>
    <li> I researched many flatirons before I decided to purchase this one. I&#x27;m very satisfied thus far. I am biracial and do not have Caucasian hair. My hair is naturally wavy, yet coarse. As such, I need an iron that can get to my roots and make them bone-straight...and that is just what this iron does. It takes me only a couple of passes per section, and it leaves my hair silky. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to point out: I read some reviews where people stated it did not work because it didn&#x27;t get hot enough when they plugged it in and switched iit on. That happened to me too, and I nearly flipped out, but if you press in the red reset button on the plug, the heat will then come forth.&lt;br /&gt;One teeny tiny complaint, but not big enough for me to dock it a whole star...the criss-cross pattern on the iron where your fingers will be primarily grasping it, can get slightly uncomfortable.  Because of the length and thickness of my hair, it takes me about an hour to completely straighten. Some other people may not have to use it that long so it might not be a problem. I started using the glove it came with, which I know is a heat protector for your hand, but hey, two birds, one stone.  The glove helped eliminate that.&lt;br /&gt;The little argon oil sample they sent is not bad. I used it on my ends at night before I wrap my hair. In the morning my hair feels great and looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best iron for the money.</li>
    <li> I was using an instyler and my hair is very thick and curly. I could never get my hair to lay flat before using the HSI straightener. It works fabulously. It heats up hot enough to get my crazy curly hair straight. Even problem area in the past are straight and flat. I highly recommend this for the value and quality. ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! Great product for an even better price!</li>
    <li> This is a good flat iron but its not a chi. If you want a real chi the buy one. If you&#x27;re looking for a decent flat iron the try this one.</li>
    <li> Ifinally found a flat iron that leaves my hair silky and smooth in literally mo time and no extra effort, This is ia great flat iron and highly recommended. Great customer service as well.</li>
    <li> This straightener was a disappointment. It didn&#x27;t heat up well and didn&#x27;t straighten her hair. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been very satisfied with this straightener! I bought this as a replacement for an older flat iron, which took forever to straighten my hair and didn&#x27;t get as hot. This heats up very quickly and works great at straightening my hair. I love the adjustable temperature feature. It leaves my hair shiny and sleek. I would buy this straightener again if I needed a replacement. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a good straightner for my very thick hair. I was a little disappointed after getting the straightner and reading all the reviews prior to buying. This is an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; product but still looking for something better for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted a flat iron that not only flattened but flips and curls too! I bought this product because of the reviews and price. I am so glad I did. I used it to curl my hair and I have to say it works better than a curling iron. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a Xmas present she loves it and i also noticed her hair has never been that soft after using a straightener before and not to mention how fast she straightens  her hair now and the little bottle of oil it comes with really works too she loves it so much i just had to buy her a bigger bottle of it. For the price this straightener works great better than her old $300 straightener</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good straightener according to the reviews. it does not get hot and it pulls your hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener I bought one back in September of 2012 and it is still as strong as ever! I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new straightener that will last for years and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because I needed a new one, and it looked like a great flat iron for a great price!  And boy is it!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about four weeks now and I love it!  I have naturally curly hair and it makes it straight and shiny!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The straighter is OK, I was expecting a better product based on websites rating.</li>
    <li> I have curly frizzy hair and this straightener works perfect for it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, only time I had to replace it was when I dropped it pretty hard on concrete so totally my fault. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone. Both my mom and I each own one and the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned! My sister in law used it over the holidays and now wants one of her own. It seriously is the best product out there for a fraction of what others are.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my HSI flat iron! I&#x27;ve never been so impressed! I can go from frizzy to sleek straight in minutes!! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Worth the money, bought a cheaper one before and it ripped my hair out.  This one works great and I get my hair done faster.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron ever. I have super thick wavy hair and this flat iron smooths it out in no time.</li>
    <li> love it...makes my hair nice and shiny...best flat iron ever!</li>
    <li> This product was purchased instead of the In-Styler product. As a straightener it is perfect but the one thing that I wish it had was the option to put on a round brush for curling hair. Obviously the price was right! I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how long it will last but so far so good!</li>
    <li> got here before estimated delivery day. heats up quickly...doesnt snag hair and leaves my hair soft and silky. i can blow dry and straighten my wavy, shoulder length hair in about 15 min. im of mixed race (black and white) so my hair is incredibly thick. i literally run the iron once or twice over a section and its completely straight. gets the baby hairs near the front of my head also with no problem. so impressed with this product and its a steal for the price. do yourself a favor and get it</li>
    <li> As far as I know, this is a quality product.  I bought it as a gift for my wife.  A little back-story, she had bought a professional hair straightener ten years ago and it finally died out.  I have bought her several hair straighteners that did not live up to expectations.  Much to my relief, she is satisfied with this one.  From one husband of a picky wife, I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Item is just as described and works awesome. Better than the chi! Would buy it again. Shipped fast and bought extra asa gift and the fell in love with it too! A+++++!!!!</li>
    <li> works better than most similar straighteners out there and still works well. No issues yet after a couple of months use.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Works in all hair types!! My daughter is a kinky curly and it makes it nice and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better than my expensive Chi!</li>
    <li> I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t get her in time for christmas but it did and my daughter loves this flat iron.  It goes for a much higher price than what I paid.  Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because I started using a straightener to curl my hair, but my skinny straightener wasn&#x27;t very good at straightening...I wanted something that could do both, but at a good cost. This was my answer! I did quite a bit of research, and this was definitely the best I could find. It works great. It gets hot enough for straightening and is narrow enough for curling. It also has any easily adjustable knob to get the temperature just right. The light indicator to show when it&#x27;s heated is also really handy! The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut-off function. I&#x27;m pretty sure that would make it the perfect straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus--it comes with a travel bag. That means that I can straighten my hair in the morning, put the still-hot iron in its case, and throw it in my suitcase if I need to pack up (I travel a lot). It&#x27;s much easier than using a t-shirt or some other article of clothing.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;There is no way this iron is worth the retail price. This flat iron takes way too long to heat completely and my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight all day. Maybe this doesn&#x27;t work as well for me because I have a lot of hair, and it&#x27;s long and thick. But I had a Chi before this iron and it worked very well with my hair. Because I read reviews from people comparing this iron to brands like Chi, I expected similar quality. But because I only had to pay $40, instead of the full retail price, I can&#x27;t rate it any lower than a 3. If you don&#x27;t want to pay more than $40, this is a good iron. But I expected better quality, so I was disappointed :/.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product all too hot for what it claimed to do. I bought it more for curling as it says it can be used for this purpose, but it makes odd, kinked/jagged curls which do not look natural at all. When I used it as a straightener, it made my hair stick out kind of funny instead of being soft and lying naturally. (For the record, I have fine, untreated hair.) So, it didn&#x27;t curl well, and it didn&#x27;t straighten well either. I also don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto-off option; that&#x27;s handy for when I get the thought at work \\&quot;oh dear, did I turn my curling iron off??\\&quot;. I&#x27;m returning it and will look for a curling iron instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gf for Christmas and she loves it. uses it every day and her hair is perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought this hair straightener as a Christmas gift, to replace a cheap store bought model. It gets hot like its supposed to with adjustable temp. settings and can also be used as a curling iron. She loves it. Thank You</li>
    <li> Gets very hot and straightens quickly.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This thing did not heat up very well at all. I would not recommend this iron to anyone unless they want to play a cruel joke on that person. The small light constant changes from green to red, like what the heck does that even mean? Is the temperature  fluctuating? This thing does not straighten at all. On top of that the plastic it is made out of is super cheap and the dial is a cheap piece of plastic. I will be returning this pile today!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and it works great so far!  Results look professional, hopefully this will hold up.  Read the reviews before purchase and they were all good.</li>
    <li> There is a reason that this is a best-selling product.  I bought this to replace my broken flat iron, that was also considered &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;.  From the first time I used this, I realized that my other flat iron is a piece of junk.  And all this time I was satisfied with it!  That said, this iron makes my hair look smooth and shiny.  The plates glide through my hair, unlike the last one.  I love this product!  And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because it had awesome reviews. I don&#x27;t understand why they are so great. This flat iron is terrible! It pulls your hair and it doesn&#x27;t even straighten that well. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I always buy chi curling irons. Didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money this time. So I took the chance and bought this one. I have long and very thick hair and this straightener gets hot super fast and straightens great!! Save ur money don&#x27;t buy the chi brand.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron. Great product well packaged, great design, works really well and greats up fast, doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good falt iron for years now. A friend gave me her old Chi years ago and I used that for at least 3 years till it broke. After the chi broke I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy a new one so I got a cheapo flat iron at Target and it sucked...fried my hair and since I have pretty curly/wavy hair it would always be frizzy after straightening. I did a ton of research and found the HSI the price was good so I decided to buy it. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 2 weeks and its AWESOME! My hair is shiny and straight with no frizz to be found :) I love that it has rounded edges too and I can use it to curl my hair as well. The argan oil is an awesome perk too and smells great! I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my hair since I started using the HSI :) YAY!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  So it must be good. End of story.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this straightener you can straighten and curl your hair with it it has no auto shut off i strongly recomend It</li>
    <li> Great product. Very pleased with the results it gives me. My hair is smooth and shiny after use. Love the oil that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Great product...quick delivery</li>
    <li> After reading SO many reviews of this straightener, I decided to get it. It heats up very quickly (red light turns green) and does the job to quickly straighten my hair without and tugging or pulling. The plates are great quality and does not burn my hair or leave any weird crimps. The only thing I wish were different was the cheap plastic material. It feels as if it may break if i drop it once, so I&#x27;ve been very careful with it. Other than that, the product works great just as described.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great!  Super hot, better than all the Chi&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. especially for the price. The only downfall is that I have to set it super high to get my hair super straight.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this flat iron after only one use!  No fly-aways, my hair is soft and my hair turned out great!  I read the reviews and was convinced with this many people with so many positive reviews this must be a winner.  I can handle the price of an off name brand flat iron that works as well as it does.  The only thing I am not sure of is the dial for the temp....not use to that because I have had digital before.  I knew when I bought the flat iron it wasn&#x27;t digital, it didn&#x27;t sway my purchase. A bonus with the flat iron is a travel case and hot glove is included!  As always, Amazon Prime got it shipped in no time!  Great service!</li>
    <li> Works beautifully! Exactly what I was looking for, and the oil was a great addition;) I also received the item very quickly, impressed...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  She said it lives up to the claims in the listing 100%.  The price was also very reasonable for the features offered.</li>
    <li> Label me a new fan of the flat iron, especially the HSI Professional salon model.  Excellent straigtening and curling capability. Sleek and stylist design and heat settings up the 425 deegress.  Very impressive flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> I shopped around for a flat iron for a long time. They all were so expensive and I was afraid it would damage my very fine, very thin hair. This has an easy to use gauge so you can set it at a low temperature if you want. And it heats up really fast. Definitely recommend this product. Received it quickly too.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and was looking for a good straightener that would do the least amount of damage  to my hair. This one has done the job. I feel like my hair is smoother than before when I was using a cheap drug store straightener. I can adjust the heat on this one. Overall great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product due to the cost.however..I have used 100 dollar straighteners that are on the same level as this product. Not to mention is comes with sample argan oil, a glove, and a gorgeous high quality sleeve to put it in. Simply stunned by the value.</li>
    <li> My husband gave me this flat iron to replace my old one and I absolutely love it, the hair on the back of my head is very hard to straighten, but this flat iron makes the job easy and is long lasting. It also leaves my hair shiny and silky. I also very much liked the pouch that comes with it and I think the glove is really useful when you want to curl your hair, so you don&#x27;t burn your hands when turning the iron.</li>
    <li> No item has arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No item has arrived. Please indicate the reason as soon as possible. thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very much</li>
    <li> I have looked at many flat irons and have a cheap one from Target for my daughter but was hesitant to buy a more expensive iron. A friend bought this same deal and we both love them!</li>
    <li> This iron is very good. It makes my curly hair very smooth . I would recommend To Any one that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a chi</li>
    <li> I have been using this particular iron for about a year now and absolutely loving it! Cords are not breaking up, it&#x27;s working perfectly fine and does a great job. Looking forward for buying a sleeve for it - it takes time to cool down and if I need to put it into my purse on the go its a little inconvenient while its still hot - everything for having it w me all the time!</li>
    <li> I used a Chi for years and when it finally went out on me I did a lot of research before purchasing a new iron. After reading the reviews I thought this was a smart purchase and the iron was on sale for $39.99 which I thought was a great deal at the time. I have really long wavy hair and was excited to try the HSI. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed to find it pulls your hair out while using. I never had that problem with my Chi but I have had that problem in the past with other cheaper brands of straighteners. This iron is by far the worst though. Very disappointed, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t reach too high temperature but even that it works great, comes with a hair therapy and a glove</li>
    <li> Everything i was hoping for and more!! Great price, great product and fast delivery. Deff reccomend!!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the flat iron.  It came with a very nice holder and small hair product which works very well. The iron heats up in seconds to your preferred temperature and is easy to use because of the size. It also works very quickly and hair turns out really smooth due to the fact that you only have to go over it once. It is definitely the best flat iron that I have tried on my thick, course, unruly hair.</li>
    <li> Very good straightener at a great price!  I have purchased these as gifts as well.  Everyone loves them.  It does get extremely hot so be careful not to burn yourself.  Probably not good for really young girls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many flat irons in my life, very costly ones at that. However, this flat iron is a god send. The price is more than reasonable, but its the flar iron it self that pays for it self 5x over. Leaves your hair soft and extremely shiny!</li>
    <li> I have only used this item once but so far it works great. It leaves my hair, sleek, shinny, soft and beautiful.It definitely lives up to the reviews i see here on amazon. The iron plates slides over my hair nicely and best of all unlike the old iron i was using my hair doesn&#x27;t burn. That is a huge plus for me as i tend to stay away from flat irons because of this very reason. Being only a owner for less than a day there is not much else i can say except that it works wonders on my kinky hair. I will give it a few months before posting another review but i doubt my initial perception will change.</li>
    <li> My Remington straighter from Walmart gets hotter &amp; has anti frizz feature and an auto shut off, this one is nothing special ... Like the Handel grip... But using my old one again ....</li>
    <li> Love that you can change the temperature of the straightener. It&#x27;s the perfect product if you want Salon results. It also comes with a case cloth case and glove.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron...&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that is hard to curl and straighten.  This seems to work well.  My only complaint is that it is hard&lt;br /&gt;to read the temperature and set the temperature.  It would be great if it were measured in degrees  - not dial up or down and lit up so you could&lt;br /&gt;tell more easily.&lt;br /&gt; Delivery was prompt and secure.&lt;br /&gt;Aargon oil sample included was a nice idea</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s price point is what caught my eye. I was in the market for a new flat iron. This one had all the amenities I was looking for. After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase this one. It is easy to use, straightens and gets rid of the frizz, which is important. I live in a high humidity area. . I was pleasantly surprise to find it not only came with the Argan Oil, but also a heat resistant glove. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron after reading most of the reviews for it.  I had planned to buy a Chi but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money and this one, at first glance, seemed to inexpensive.  The reviews settled some of that worry for me.  I have very fine thin hair and wanted something that would smooth it out after I had curled it, so this is great because it has a temperature setting that the Chi didn&#x27;t have and I can keep it on a low setting to avoid doing damage to my hair.  I would highly recommend it and buy another if needed!</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. You don&#x27;t need to do your hair over and over, one time is enough. It came when I expected it and thats a plus.</li>
    <li> I got this HSI ceramic flat iron because of all the great reviews on Amazon.  The reviews were right and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  It heats up fast and glides smoothly through my hair.  I would definitely recommend this if you are considering purchasing a new flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair that isn&#x27;t difficult to straighten when on the higher settings. This straightener arrived as described, but it didn&#x27;t not reach its highest temperature setting, didn&#x27;t stay hot...ever, and the plates pulled at my hair never leaving it smooth or straight. The seller replaced it and I still had the same problems, so I upgraded to the elite model and it works phenomenally. I strongly recommend spending the time and money on the newer model. Thank you Blue Novelties!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, still need to learn how to properly curl my hair with it but I like it a lot. Definitely better than what I had before.</li>
    <li> I love how this straightener gets hot quickly, it also does a wonderful job making my hair smooth and silky :)&lt;br /&gt;I love it much more than my old one and it doesn&#x27;t get caught on my hair and pull it like several flat irons in the past have.&lt;br /&gt;It is versatile in doing flips and curls.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this product :) Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Just used it once but works very well considering the humid climate. My hair is a mixture of thin and course and the straightener made it very smooth and shiny without using max heat.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my hair care / wear products and helpers. It heats up quickly and can be used with hair of different thicknesses. I have medium hair and do not turn the heating element all the way up. It is very easy to use!! No need to push lots of buttons etc... Simple and easy ... GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron and am very happy that I did!  It is much easier to use than I thought it would be and, along with HSI Argon Oil, leaves my hair soft and silky.  I selected this product partially based on other reviews and I have to concur with them.</li>
    <li> I love this staraightener. It moves smoothly through my hair without snagging. It heats up fast and leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth. The only con would be that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> It is amazing and better than I expected!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and arrived faster than expected.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but it&#x27;s every bit as good as the Chi it replaced.  Great deal.  5 months later: I&#x27;m wishing I hadn&#x27;t bought this.  It&#x27;s functional, but by now there are two major problems: 1) The cord is so tangled I have to stop and untangle it every time I use it, and 2)  It really started catching and pulling my hair after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> It has lived up to the great reviews I read when looking into buying a new flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is my first hair straightening iron.  It is easy to use, has temperature control and performs as expected.  It is sturdy and nice on my hair which is color treated.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Only have had it for 3 months and it quit working</li>
    <li> Bought this item instead of high end and expensive straightner with high hopes because of all the reviews. Mine came with stained plates, and a horrid smell everytime I turn it on. I emailed HSI company directly from their website and have yet to receive a email back when they promise you a 48 hour response. It&#x27;s now been 7 days. I am not going to waste $ paying to have the 40$ straightener shipped to return, but I will be buying a nice Chi or Sedu straightner. If you&#x27;re considering this item because of the reviews and low price, seriously do not waste your time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  I hoped it would be a good buy but it turned out to be the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron as my previous one stopped working after many years of use. I decided to try this flat iron as it had many positive reviews, and it did not dissapoint! The iron heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t snag hair and leaves my hair very shiny. I&#x27;ve had it for only a few days but loving it so far!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It heats quickly and the temperature control is very efficient. Just one pass leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny. I also love that it does not give my hair that \\&quot;ironed out\\&quot; look. Hair looks natural. It&#x27;s light and easy to handle. I am 100% satisfied! It is also very reasonably priced - so great value for money.</li>
    <li> Love it! Thank you for awesome price.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m one of &amp;#34;those&amp;#34; people. You know, the ones who got a defective flat iron and wrote a poor review without first contacting customer service. Well, I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. I emailed the company about the problematic flat iron and received a response quickly. They sincerely apologized for the inconvenience and my replacement flat iron is on its way to me in less than 24 hours from the time I wrote them. Since then I have deleted my previous review and give you this new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let me tell you about this hair straightener. It comes in a fancy red bag with a little argon oil. The straightener appears to be well made and is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. It&#x27;s simple to use and has a light that goes from red to green to let you know when it&#x27;s ready to use. The problem was mine was just not getting hot. I have given the product 4 stars for now since I can only review the costumer service and aesthetics of the product and will update my review when I have the chance to try my new one!</li>
    <li> This iron has far exceeded my expectations.  It arrived practically the next day and the quality and level of heat is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 - one for each of my girls...the feedback I got was...it&#x27;s good, but the other one was better &#x3D;( ...not sure what the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; one was though...I don&#x27;t use it myself so I cant give any other review on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews i&#x27;ve read but I was so disappointed after purchasing this flat iron! I have long thick hair and since I&#x27;m not a morning person I was looking for something that was smooth and would heat up fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- it comes with the aragon oil and the bag&lt;br /&gt;- cute design&lt;br /&gt;- the cord was easy to move around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- it pulls my hair like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;- it takes a while to heat up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not happy with the purchase. I gave it a week of try and returned it. Ended up buying Sedu Revolution and I am extremely happy with it! I had an older version of Sedu that i was using for 5 yrs and bought a newer version of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.  Her older stepsister had a Chi, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much for her first one.  I researched and found this one that looked like a good product and ordered it through Amazon.  The service was great and it got there right on time!  When I called a week or so later to ask her how she liked it, she told me it was better than the Chi!!!  I am purchasing another one for my other granddaughter this week.</li>
    <li> Came a day and a 1/2 after I bought it. In a nice box with the glove and oil. Love how fast easy and nice it works. Better buy then other expensive brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> First this arrived very quickly! Next it may be a cheap price but it is not a cheap product! It works like a dream! love it! I have fine hair and it guides right through! It came very quickly and I love love love it! works well also on my daughters very thick hair! Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome deal, heavy duty comes with heat glove and hair serum and heat bag, heats up super quick with adjustable heat</li>
    <li> Product as expected and works well. In retrospect I would purchase one with automatic off switch rather than relying on my memory when I&#x27;m rushing out the door.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a difference to work with a professional product.  It does the job very well.</li>
    <li> I just keep touching it!!  My HSI professional straightener just arrived this morning.  I have a cheapo flat iron that I use infrequently due to the amount of damage it does to my hair.  My hair is fine but prolific and naturally curly.  One of the things I noticed right away with the HSI is that there was no hair on the floor after I straightened (with my old iron there was a LOT of hair afterward).  This makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HSI did a very nice job and heated up very, very quickly.  I really like the digital read out and the discreet controls out of the way of accidental bumping. The screen turns green when it&#x27;s heated up.  I&#x27;m happy with how it glides through my natural curls very easily.  I did notice a slight pull on my hair at the ends, that may be a technique issue on my part.  Maybe I should be letting up a bit on the grip toward the ends.  Anyhow it was lovely straight all day.  Now it is evening as I write this and having touched it A LOT all day, I notice there are some slight waves and more volume at this point than I would prefer. I used a leave-in-conditioner and a small amount of argan oil before straightening.  I don&#x27;t know if this affected my results.  I will happily be using it again (and AGAIN) -it is addicting to see all the curls tamed into submission.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline:  It straightens quickly and smoothly overall.  It heats up quickly.  It appears to do no damage to my fine hair. I am happy. I registered mine online with the company, and it registered perfectly.  It&#x27;s the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One slight bummer is that the box says it comes with a free sample of argan oil.  There was only a heat-resistant glove inside.  Fooey.  However, it did come with a beautiful red satin storage pouch that I really love!!</li>
    <li> The delivery was on time, the packaging was very nice complete with all the free items. The problem was that this particular unit  came  defective  on the lower plate, it had a wide gap between the ceramic plate and the ceramic plate stop, my heair  got stock in there. I wanted to have an exact replacement but this future is no available on the menu for this product. The only option that I have is to return it. This has me very disappointed since this product it  looks good and has a very good reviews.</li>
    <li> My daughter always uses a flat iron and she recommended I buy one. This is my first flat iron purchase and I love it. My daughter says she much prefers mine! It&#x27;s solid in the hand, great width, works fabulously well. We just did our own hair with it for another daughter&#x27; wedding. (Shipment was speedy and well packaged.)</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my mom on mothers day. She really likes this flat iron. Her old one broke after a year and it was more expensive than this new one. The HSI flat iron feels like it is sturdy and made to last. I bought it because it had a 4 1/2 star rating from over 1300 reviews and the price was right. i would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> My last iron just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I felt like my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay straight through most of the day and my hair was still frizzy. Someone this iron takes away my frizzies when i use it! it would definitely recommend people buying it! :)</li>
    <li> When reviewing the reviews, I expected way more out of this flat iron.  It&#x27;s OK and works fine but I was hoping it would have gotten hotter.  I do have thicker hair that is curly so it&#x27;s a little harder to get my hair straight.  I will keep it because it does work fine but had bigger expectations.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up very fast and I really like the bag for keeping it in. Seems to be extremely good quality so far and I may order another one for my daughter. The price was great too.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Works great, fast, won&#x27;t fry your hair. Very good price for what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I have previously owned a Chi iron.  After two years, it quit heating.  I was going to purchase another Chi, but I thought I would take the chance at the HSI, because of the reviews and price.  I am very happy with it.  It heats quickly and it works very well on my hair.  I get a nice shine and no frizz.  I would recommend the HSI to others looking for a less expensive iron that is well worth the money</li>
    <li> Mah Baby! Seriously the best flatiron on the market.  My friend has a billion dollar, super fancy, Chi.....well, this one is better.  To give you background.  I am a mixed chick, African American, White, and a slew of other things. My hair is natural and relaxer free.  Think Scary Spice, youngsters, look her up.  Any who, this flatiron gives me the relaxed look without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this thing.  It works great WITHOUT snagging and ripping out hairs, is there any more I could ask for?  Actually yes!  It has a temperature control knob that works!  I have really fine hair, so I use a lower temperature and it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a swanky storage bag (oooooohhhhh red fake satin) and a sweet Michael Jackson glove for one hand only.  Does anyone know what that glove is for?  I guess I could wear it while using the product?  I could also just not touch the hot part.  Something it DOES NOT come with, however, is that hair oil sample or whatever.  I do not care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no hair product expert, but this thing is cheap and works great.  Hooray!</li>
    <li> Even better than my CHI!! I was so surprised how great this worled. Its great for curling your hair with a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I always buy a Chi and when I tried for the very first time I fell in love. It made my hair super soft, im the type of person that has ocd with having bumps or I guess a few waves that my past straighteners have never helped with. BUT THIS ON DID A PERFECT JOB! I only paid $37 here on amazon and I will no longer go back to the expensive CHI&#x27;S AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> Everything was done in a professional and timely manor. very good very good very good very good very very good</li>
    <li> I first purchased this flat iron for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  After hearing her rave that it was the best flat iron she ever had, I had to order another one for myself.  I have to admit, she was not exaggerating.  It is by far one of the best I have ever tried, and the price cannot be beat.  I own another one that is 4x the price I paid for the HSI, and the quality does not compare.  Very happy with this purchase.  Will most likely buy another for my niece.</li>
    <li> I was sucked in by all the high reviews on this product, but I really wonder who they came from. All three of my daughters and I tried the product and were very disappointed. It&#x27;s awkwardly designed, pulls your hair and leaves it frizzy, and just doesn&#x27;t work well. Very disappointing. Fortunately, the return process was great!</li>
    <li> But after a few times of use,  one plate just stopped getting hot. Only 1 plate is warming which takes forever when using it. I will try to call the manufacturer for warranty since it has not been a year yet since I bought it. It looks like no phone number to call for warranty issue but just email.&lt;br /&gt;I  just hope that they will correct this issue once I submit the complaint.</li>
    <li> Love it! Awesome and Fast Delivery. Thank you Rochelle Marie with Living Simply Rich</li>
    <li> I purchased this back in October 2014, it worked great for the first few months. About a month ago it started losing heat, now I have to wait a couple minutes between each swipe so it can reheat. Because of this issues it now take twice as long to do my hair everyday. I would not recommend this product and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> My bf  bought me this straightner, I was very excited because I read all the reveiws. When I got it I was disappointed, the straightner didn&#x27;t get hot enough. And every time I tried to straighten a piece of hair, I felt like it was pulling my hair. It wasnt smooth at all. I am in the process of returning it.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my teenage daughter. I am a stylist who normally buys professional expensive styling tools. I had to give the HSI a shot due to the awesome reviews . The verdict.... She loves it! That comes from a girl who has used Chi, GHD and a U Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a month but hopefully this little gem will last! Thanks HSI!</li>
    <li> Got the flat iron for my girl and she uses it everyday and is really happy with the way her hair comes out looking after</li>
    <li> High quality, easy to use hair straightener. Just as easy to use for curling! Would highly recommend. Even comes with a cute bag to keep it in.</li>
    <li> very good product, My daughter uses this and loves it.  10 more words required so i&#x27;m typing this o k</li>
    <li> The iron worked fine the first time I tried it.  However, when I unpacked the box, the sample of oil had spilled all over the red satin bag.  A sealed plastic bag around the oil sample would have saved the mess if not the loss of the sample.</li>
    <li> This is great to made my hair straight. Good products, great value and good customers service. Will refer my friends.</li>
    <li> This is just like the super-expensive ceramic, ionic hair straighteners, but about 1/5 the cost. My only issues with it is that it can work up a house-filling hot smell when it&#x27;s heating. I don&#x27;t know what kind of cleaner to use on it that would make that stop, but otherwise, this is a great tool for hair.</li>
    <li> My wife had been eyeing this hair straightener for a while and finally found it here on Amazon. She was so excited to find such a high-end straightener for a great price. Over the last several years she has only had cheap ones from Walmart and such so this find made her very happy. She has enjoyed using it and loves the quality of the product and the results. I have one happy wife.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap off-brand model for a few years and never realized how bad it was until it broke and I upgraded to this one. WOW! It doesn&#x27;t yank my hair, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy, it gets hot right away and stays hot. It is a great styler. I usually only have to run it across a piece of hair once to get it straightened. I like that you can adjust the heat (since I have thin hair I don&#x27;t need it as hot as women with thicker hair). My hair is so much softer now that I have this straightener and I only wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> This ceramic flat iron is great, I love the way it makes my hair so smooth. Great buy too....I priced the same product at the stores and it was much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The iron gets hot really fast but it also cools very quick after you&#x27;re done. I would buy it again...I don&#x27;t have very thick hair so 1 inch iron is perfect size for me.</li>
    <li> As a mom of 3 I am always in a hurry to get ready this straightener seems to take a while to heat up, when it&#x27;s hot it seems to do well but needless to say less than a week after I bought this I gave it away :/</li>
    <li> After the first styling my husband said my hair looked great! It was really easy to control the heat and it did not snag my hair</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I found it on ebay for $54 including shipping. it works way better than any Chi I ever had.  this is the only brand i&#x27;ve used besides Jilbere &amp; Chi &amp;  i&#x27;m so happy with it because it straightens my hair really well, &amp; although the plates get hot, the flat iron itself doesn&#x27;t (like the Jilbere burnt my fingers). in comparison the Chi seems like a piece of junk.  the HSI is a really well-made quality product that works great, for a great price.  you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT , SHE USUALLY GOES THROUGH ONE A YEAR ,THIS WAY BETTER QUALITY AND GETS WAY HOTTER THAN THE OTHERS</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron based on the excellent reviews and have not been disappointed. It works as well as the more expensive, well-known brands. Definitely a winner!</li>
    <li> Heats up and cools down really fast.  Leaves hair smooth and shiny.  Only complaint is that my hair seems to catch when I get to the ends, and pulls a little bit. Minor and worth ignoring because it is such a quality product.</li>
    <li> I love my tourmaline flat iron straightener and i love that it came with the protector glove and bag plus the oil, its all good.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Works as well as more expensive ones. For really curly hair as mine, it does the job more quickly than many others.</li>
    <li> After my old flat iron died, I scoured the internet looking for a flat iron that was of good quality, but wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.  The HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron is AWESOME!  My old flat iron would leave kinks in my hair, but that&#x27;s not the case with this one! For $50, it was a great investment!</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews on this product I decided to purchase, my previous flat iron that I loved gave out after 6 years. I have very long think curly hair, don&#x27;t get me wrong it gets my straight but it I have to go over it a few time. My two biggest complaints are 1: it pulls my hair, it doesn&#x27;t just glide through it. It pulls it the whole way through. 2: the handle is very uncomfortable and rubs you hand raw while using it. Mostly I don&#x27;t like that it pulls my hair, but hey at least my hair is straight. I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.. One other thing that I&#x27;m not very happy about it that 2 days after I made my purchase the price dropped $20, I guess that&#x27;s just life but it still sucks. Would I recommend this product to a friend or buy again? Probably not.</li>
    <li> Excellent straightener, excellent customer service.  Ordered it and it was delivered promptly.  I also used the Argan oil which was sent and that is absolutely fabulous.  The straightener heats up quickly, straightens easily without drying and burning my hair.  I have split ends from my old straightener and coloring my hair,and my hair is very very wavy with a lot of friz, so I still have to use a lot of products on my hair. But I have noticed that with using the argan oil and this straightner, my hair is sooooo much more smoother and shinier and takes half the amount of time getting it straight and smooth then it did before using these two products. JUST LOVE BOTH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST A SIDE BAR:  BUY THE ARGAN OIL AT YOUR LOCAL DRUG STORE....WAY CHEAPER THAN ANYTHING YOU WILL FIND ON AMAZON OR ONLINE....IT&#x27;S THE SAME THING AND THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN HOW IT WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I have only bought cheaper flat irons at Target before so this was my first professional flat iron. So far it does exactly what it advertises. I am very happy with the product. It heats up quickly and the ceramic tiles wrap around the edge so you can flip or curl ends. It doesnt appear to automatically shut off like my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Novelties is the company that provided and shipped the product. I chose free shipping through amazon but when I received the postal slip that it was at the post office it said postage was due. I emailed Blue Novelties and they responded within a day and apologized and replied if I did indeed have to pay that my account would be credited. I did pay the extra $5.65 for postage and emailed them with a picture of the postage. There was no hassle what so ever and Blue Novelties was apologetic and issue a credit immediately. I would not hesitate to buy through Blue Novelties. They were prompt in replying, apologetic, and issued a credit immediately.</li>
    <li> Good price, great look, great results is my experience with blue novelties and the product. I needed a flat iron and they gave me an excellent alternative. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love it but was broken when received.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well. I have coarse Asian hair and after using this, my hair was pin straight and extremely smooth. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron!!! So perfect and exactly what was described. Shipping was fast too!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is one of the best that I have purchased and I am a Stylist. It beats the M.P., CHI, etc... without a doubt. The price is amazing for such a great product and shipping was definitely on time. It leaves hair feeling soft and silky, it&#x27;s a must have for the Hair Dependent Straighteners:-)</li>
    <li> Thanks it works wonderful for my daughter hair. I appreciate it and it does great for her hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned but I was being picky about which one I wanted to buy, making sure to read all of the reviews.  This one looked like THE one to own, combining price with rating, and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed!  It gets nice and hot really quickly and makes my hair perfectly straight, even the frizzy kinky parts.</li>
    <li> The 2 HSI products I purchased were an HSI flat iron and a HSI Flat Iron holder. Both items beat my expectations. I have very natural curly long hair. With the new HSI 1 inch flat iron I was able to make my hair strait and silky with one swipe of the flat iron, instead of the 3 to 4 swipes with my previous professional (Expensive) flat irons. The holder came in very handy while i needed to separate more hair, no more laying the flat iron down on the sink and fumbling around to pick it up. Both items made straightening my hair a breeze and made the whole process faster, I can now do my hair in 20 minutes instead of 45 minutes. Both great products and seller is definitely highly recommended. AAAA++++ Outstanding</li>
    <li> I think I like this one better than the Chi I have used for the last 3-4 years...it finally broke&lt;br /&gt;I hope this one lasts at least that long, glad I bought this one</li>
    <li> I have always purchased CHI hair straighteners, with the same result. They&#x27;re great for almost a year and then they quit. I decided to try the HSI Straightener. I love it! Works just like the Chi, but even better because it has temperature control. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. I checked out this product very thoroughly before purchasing it and thus far, I am a convert.</li>
    <li> Works great price is great to</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener I bought. I bought CHE hair straightener before but that was not HSI product and neither dual voltage.  And it was more expensive than this.&lt;br /&gt;This HSI CHE hair straightener is dual voltage and makes my hair straight faster, I do not have to keep straightening my hair over and over. The temprature get high enough to straighten the hair in one stroke.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using in India for last two months and it&#x27;s still working just as good.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for less money:)</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter who&#x27;s been begging for a straightener.  I now use it often because it works so well. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> although very pleased my flat iron, was not so happy about the edges of it, the sides where the iron meets the top appear to be chipped, and on occasion have snagged my hair, other than that, its great, tho I still don&#x27;t know what the glove is for.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and within a few minutes the flat iron is hot and ready to go.  Less time than using a hair dryer to straighten.</li>
    <li> I was in between relaxers when a stylist trimmed and straightened my hair as if she relaxed it.  I just had to know what she did. She told me she flat ironed my hair. Wonderful! I went to Amazon and searched. I saw quite a few good reviews about the HSI ceramic flat iron and made the purchase. I was hoping I would receive the flat iron before my next wash. Sure enough! I received the iron and it was securely packaged. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick the flat iron heated up...love that! Using the flat iron on a small section of my hair was okay, but not as straight as I would get with the curling iron. I raised the heat, waited for about 5 seconds and went over the same section. Still not right. I raised it midway, waited about 5 seconds, and this time I got the effect I was looking for. That section of my hair was not only straight, but it also had a silky shine. I like the fact that when I increased the temp, I didn&#x27;t have to wait a time for the iron to reach the higher temp. This is my first flat iron purchase and I have not tried anything else to compare, but I am quite pleased with this purchase, especially with the way this baby heats up! July 2013: I just had to add to my review. My sister came for a visit in July and she wanted me to shampoo, condition, and style her hair, which is something we do for each other during our visits. I used my HSI flat iron and her hair was shiny and soft...just beautiful. She loved the results and wanted the flat iron. She was only here for a week, but I purchased one for her and it arrived well in time before her departure. I called her to see if she still liked the flat iron results and she said she love&#x27;s it. Her hair even feels softer now that she is back in her humid state. She wants another pair for backup! May 2016: Well, I&#x27;ve lost temp control of my flat iron. The red light never changes to green anymore and the iron heats to 400 and will not go down, even when I have it at the lowest setting.  I posted again just to let you know this iron lasted me 3 years. When there is mass production of an item, there will be some lemons roll out, so I was fortunate to get a good pair. BTW, my sister&#x27;s iron is still working.</li>
    <li> You receive a lot with the purchase....straightener, oil, glove, draw-string bag. After I purchased the product, the price decreased and the seller refunded me the difference. I would buy from them again for the sheer fact that they are trsutworthy in an increasedingly unreliable online selling world. The straightener is of competitive quality to larger name brands and particularly attractive because of the lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good on thick, coarse hair such as my own, or curly soft hair as is my daughter&#x27;s.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for shine and a long lasting style.  I only had to run the iron once through my hair and got wonderful results.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Works wonders with my curly hair! I have never had a straightener work so well and so fast! I have recommended this to all my family and friends already!</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. It does take a little longer to heat up than I had expected however, it works great! I have dark brown hair that is mostly gray now but no one knows ;). The hair coloring tends to dry my hair out and the gray can be unmanageable. By using a leave in oil prior to straightening, my hair is healthy looking and styles beautifully using this straightener. The best part is that I am able to add body because the edges are rounded allowing for some curl.</li>
    <li> I was not very happy with this product. It didn&#x27;t seem to straighten my daughters hair like most reviews claimed.Maybe I just got a bad one, I read many reviews with girls that had curly hair and they said it worked great, it just didn&#x27;t do so well with my daughters curly hair.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this product through my Amazon account. She states, \\&quot;I bought this product to replace my older flat iron which had stopped working. So far, the HSI Professional flat iron is working really well. It is durable, heats evenly, and leaves my hair really shiny! I am really impressed and am glad I purchased this as a recommended product based on reviews I read on Amazon!\\&quot; - Kim E.</li>
    <li> I have purschased and tried many curling irons and finally this one didn&#x27;t disappoint me.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best ever. One swipe though my hair and it&#x27;s done. Don&#x27;t have to go over and over&lt;br /&gt;the same section and it stays flat all day. Seller awesome and fast shipping. Also great price.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry if you purchase this product.</li>
    <li> The plates do not rest evenly against each other, they touch at the tip and there is about 1/16th of an inch space on the handle end.  I have to squeeze fairly hard to flatten them against my hair and get an even heating, but then I am squeezing so hard that it does not move smoothly along my hair.  This is doubly a problem for me because I have very fine hair, so if the iron is left on a split second too long in a spot, it not only damages my hair it also leaves a little crease line.  I managed to make it work for a straight style, but have no luck trying to use any curling technique, I just end up with a bunch of creases.  This is very disappointing considering the reason I bought a new one is because my old one is getting dirty with product and doesn&#x27;t move smoothly down my hair anymore.  I put two stars instead of one because I do like how hot it gets and the variable heat selector.</li>
    <li> it heats up quickly and makes my hair very smooth and does not need to go over and over the same areas</li>
    <li> I had a flat iron for years, not this one, previous one. That one pulled my hair and was clumsy and heavy. Then I found this and YESSSS, I am so happy with this flat iron, it is so easy to hold and fits into hand and do not pull a single hair, so smooth. It comes with a glove for touching hot and it comes with a nice red, silky storage pouch, very handy. Overall, I love this flat iron and all that comes with it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Straightens my very curly hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron you can buy under $50! Works just as good as a CHI and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like some others. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought a similar hair straightener at the mall a few years back. It stopped heating, I wrote the company and they refused to send me a new one. Needless to say I spent about 4x the price on the mall model. This straightener works great, if not better than my old one. It arrived quick. You can straighten or curl your hair with this bad boy! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great price for a mid range iron! Working great so far.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing. It straightens my hair in one swipe. And leaves it smooth shiny.</li>
    <li> The straightener is everything I hoped for. Now I can straighten my beautiful golden locks in such a short time!  It leaves me so much time while getting ready for the day.  The shipping and customer service was excellent.  I&#x27;d recommend this product and service to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily to deliver the straightest hair possible. I like that it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  I also use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Works well enough.  The only big downfall is that the dial to adjust the temperature is actually inside the middle of the wand,  not on the side/edge,  which makes it somewhat difficult to adjust.</li>
    <li> the tip snag my hair every time</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron leaves my hair feeling silky</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She loves it. The best straightener she&#x27;s ever had!</li>
    <li> Works great. Does what I need.</li>
    <li> this product is horrible. I don&#x27;t know how it has so many good reviews. From day one it pulled and snagged my hair. it would not straighten my hair and the FRIZZ was out of control. I should have returned it but felt that because I already used it that would not be right. I have fought this for 8 weeks. Finally, I dropped the iron on the floor and the plate cracked off. I had dropped my previous flat iron so many times without a problem. I was happy to put this junk in the garbage and order something different. I did and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Straightened my hair this morning and have my soft, straight, NOT frizzy hair back and in half the time. My hair is thick so maybe this works for people with thin, fine hair but if your hair is course, thick and frizzy do not waste your time with this.</li>
    <li> It does get hotter than my Chi and is a great product for the price.  However, I found the location for the controls cumbersome and I only got a very small sample packet of the hair product, not a travel size as indicated in the description.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.  Reasonably priced and it does a fantastic job on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Takes some practice but does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Its amazing, actually i bought it acc. to reviews! .. When i received it i couldn&#x27;t wait, after using it i can say its really amaaaaaazzzing!!! And i dont need to use the gloves the surface of the iron tolerable &amp; non harm heat, even when i put it on the highest heat.. Really amazing didnt regret at all and LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!!! I was a faithful CHI user and was in the market for a new one until I came across the HSI straightener. Great product and the price is incredible for a straightener of this quality!!!  I can say that I will most likely never go back to a CHI again. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> It was sent to our soldier granddaughter. It works fine. No complaints. Cost was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Good quality product for a good price.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because she was always \\&quot;borrowing\\&quot; my CHI.  This is actually much better than my CHI and now I am the one who keeps borrowing hers!  It heats up very quickly but the best part is the adjustable heat.  You can easily raise or lower the heat depending on your hair type.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I bought this early for my sisters birthday and when she plugged it in it buzzed from the cord. I wasn&#x27;t aware that I couldn&#x27;t return it and now I have a brand new broken item</li>
    <li> I love how this ionic flatiron leaves my hair looking and feeling. I really like the argon oil that was a bonus gift. It has been quite some time since I have been able to give myself that &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; look at home. Now I have it all the time. I am very pleased with the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flatiron. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Glides very easily over my hair and one glide is all it takes! It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, it&#x27;s effortless and wonderful results!  I like it so much,  I ordered one for my sister :)!</li>
    <li> love this product meets all my expectations. heats up fast nice.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Prior to this purchase, I was using my daughter&#x27;s Chi straightener.  When I needed to get my own I decided to save some money and get this HSI one.  I&#x27;ve found this one to be just as good and maybe better than the Chi!</li>
    <li> This product was great!!!!! I was looking for a straightener I could use in Paris and London and it worked perfectly!  I am using at home in the U.S. now too since my other one died!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Quality product.</li>
    <li> very happy.  good quality. would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have below  shoulder length almost straight-wavy hair which is the most easiest to straighten  and with HsI even my hair DOESNT get straight as expected . When I do 5-6 passes it gets almost straight but within a couple hours it springs back to being frizzy and wavy ! I use the ghi serum (I bought the bottle ,not the sample!) thinking that would help but NO . It even &amp;#34;fried &amp;#34;my hair completely ruining it&#x27;s texture and making it more frizzy :( I wish I could get a refund  !!!!</li>
    <li> For the money a good buy. But I have noticed that it is breaking my hair!</li>
    <li> I really like it, its quick and efficient, sometimes it makes my hair too dry when I put it on the highest temperature, so make sure always to use some protecting oil or mask when ironing the hair.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like some others review say it work , maybe in thin hair not thick</li>
    <li> My wife started using her new flat iron immediately and liked it as well as if not better than her more expensive flat iron that had recently broken. She says it works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great flat iron!  Plus my sister showed me how to do my hair wavy with it and I love it.</li>
    <li> It gets hot very quick but not too hot to burn your hair. I&#x27;ve had flat irons that you actually will smell my hair burning and it will stick and pull my hair.  This flat iron is the best one I&#x27;ve had.  I have curly,  frizzy hair and this makes it very smooth with the products I use. I definitely recommend this to anyone that has frizzy hair they can&#x27;t tame.</li>
    <li> Best Flat Iron I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Love the straightener. Only issue I had was when the package arrived, the hair oil that came with the kit was slightly opened so it spilled onto the heat cover. Lost some oil and had to wash the heat cover but not too big of a deal since those were special included items. Love the straightener! Still have to try curling my hair with it. The heated glove is great to have too.</li>
    <li> I did not like it. Does not heat up enough. I would advice you to skip it.</li>
    <li> Great tool- good size for my thick hair</li>
    <li> excellent - really lived up to expectations</li>
    <li> My wife is the one that purchased this Straightener, she HAD a CHI Straightener prior to this one, which died on her.  so this was her decision for a replacement.  She has NOT been disappointed.  Recommend highly!!</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this straightner, it&#x27;s lightweight, heats up in about 5 seconds and leaves my hair silky and frizz free. I would def recommend this to anyone with thick hair like me, who needs a straightner to work quickly and effectively.</li>
    <li> Worked great, but burnt inside of my legs straitning those hairs. Works great, I&#x27;d recommend buying this item</li>
    <li> I have very think  corse hair, with the iron i have to do two passes. I think for the money it&#x27;s great, it was in my price range. It came with the aragon oil 2 ml sample. I have s much hair it made my hair feel nice, but it wasnt enough. I bought the thermal spray, I didnt like it .  With the combination of both products my hair was still frizzy I live in a very humid area. . It probably works  best for thinner  textures.</li>
    <li> I extremely recommend this flat iron. I&#x27;ve been used a lot of other products from other brands, but this one was the best ever. Very cheap in comparison with others. It was the only one that could straight my new growth hair!</li>
    <li> works perfectly, love it!</li>
    <li> So disappointed with this Iron.  I have this coarse hair that, with a good iron, can be straight and shiny. This iron does not glide through hair at all.  It does straighten hair some but my old iron does much much better. Wish I had spent $100 and got an iron that really works!</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m pleased with the flat iron. I have very thick short hair that I want kind of spiky so I use the iron on a very hot setting. It&#x27;s a bit slow to heat up but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I like that it feels sturdy. It&#x27;s not as slender and graceful to use as my old cheaper flat iron so it&#x27;s a little tricky on short hair but for the price I think it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! Especially love that I can finally &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; my hair with a flat iron to achieve that sexy supermodel curl :-)  for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. My friends who all have Chi flat irons tell me mine is way better! So far, so great</li>
    <li> one of best product i ever had.. i really recomment  this iron specially for woman with curls is amazing!</li>
    <li> fantastic flat iron!! the positive reviews are true! It&#x27;s just as good (if not better!) than all the other expensive ones on the market!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever seen anywhere- at a salon or at someone&#x27;s house. if you want to control the heat damage and you forget to turn your iron off- dont worry cuz this one does all that and makes your breakfast!!!!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived was as described. Works great. The grip is more comfortable than the previous one we owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on Amazon reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It straightened my 4C natural hair like a champ! It&#x27;s easy to use and lightweight, and most of all I did not burn my fingers like I usually do with other brands.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It heats quickly and is easy to use!</li>
    <li> This was actually going to be a gift for my daughter, but when it arrived I decided to keep it.  This is the BEST flat iron I have used.  Since I have fine hair the lowest setting works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;The Argan oil is great - thanks for the sample - I plan on purchasing more&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> My sister loves it. Faster and better than the instyler. She couldn&#x27;t be happier. Gets hot very fast.</li>
    <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;Going to use it on a trip to South Africa.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I hunted for just the right thing, this is professional quality at a fraction the cost.</li>
    <li> Works great but it doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as I expected. I&#x27;ve had better flat irons before but they were a whole lot more expensive. This one is GREAT for the price.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up sufficiently thus it does not straighten your hair!  My sister has a similar flat iron by Intertek (NUME HB048).  They look very similar in style, however, hers heats up and works great.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get a great flat iron for a cheap price while this was on sale. However, it pulls out my hair when I use it. Badly. This had so many great reviews that I got it even after reading some of the bad reviews. Sadly, I have to agree with what so many other people said. It&#x27;s cheaply made and I lost a LOT of hair when I used it. I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great price!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron! The quality is excellent and it is also an amazing value! If you are in the market for a flat iron, I highly recommend this one! It is great!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast shipment. Decent price</li>
    <li> This iron woks very well! I really love using it. It makes my hair shine and it&#x27;s cut my straightening time in half.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly African american hair maybe 4a-4b type and this flat iron straightens my hair like it&#x27;s permed it doesn&#x27;t snag and it leaves an awesome shine after great product that allows you to control the amount of heat you place on your hair...</li>
    <li> This iron took awhile to get the hang of; the paddles don&#x27;t close very tightly and since I have thin, fine hair I had to make several passes over my hair instead of just one or two. It&#x27;s also kind of difficult to see the control/temperature number setting. The paddles across the back (opposite side of the heat) are flat instead of rounded; this does not allow for an easy, soft curl at the end of your hair if you want to roll the flat iron a bit. Additionally, I was supposed to receive a small sample of the protectant oil for free with this iron, but that was not included in the package :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good enough product if you have thick hair. I don&#x27;t like to leave negative reviews, but I felt that this product was not as good as it could have been.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! It glides through my hair without pulling and it heats up very fast. I&#x27;ve gone through about ten flat irons and this one will stick with me from now on!</li>
    <li> Love it! My flat iron works like a charm and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Heats within seconds and it straightens every strand. Definitely needed this....great buy!!! Wish I got more of the oil though......</li>
    <li> when i first got it, i had some issue with the straightener but i contacted with them and they were super nice to let me try another one. the new arrived in a very good condition and it works perfectly. by the way, they ship the items pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Very great straightener for the price.  My hair is long,  very thick,  frizzy and curly and it did a fantastic job hiding that.  Definitely purchasing another when this one has had it.</li>
    <li> I had a very expensive flat iron that finally stopped working.  This one works just as well as that one, but a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have very thick and wavy hair.  As long as it is turned up it works great.  My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have a light or indicator when it is on and it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic off.  I have to be very attentive to remember to unplug it.</li>
    <li> This Iron works very well.  Excellent  purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase. Top seller.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I have very fine hair that is prone to damage. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or burned when I straighten it. The iron is fast to heat up,  which is a bonus for me. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> On-off button is nice (vs. just on when plugged in). Like travel pouch.</li>
    <li> Well packaged, nice weight, great cover, works very well. I wish it closed a little tighter. It is difficult to straighten a small amount of hair.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this straightener is perfect for me.  My daughter has long thick hair, and she does not like it.  It is not heavy-duty enough to straighten her hair.  She says it could work for her hair, but it would take much longer than the straightener she owns, which was much more expensive.  For the price, this one is great for me.</li>
    <li> My wife has a problem during humid weather with her bangs curling and separating. She frequently goes to the hairdresser to have them retrimmed to help. Occassionally she tries to do it herself but ends up cutting them crooked or too short. I suggested this product which she agreed to try. I picked it up for her birthday in June 2015. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!! She uses it frequently for PERFECT results. We could not be happier!</li>
    <li> Very nice easy to handle just what I wanted</li>
    <li> My wife and daughters did not like these at all. Tossed them and bought CHIs.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly &amp; works just as expected. Great product &amp; a great company.</li>
    <li> I read that this was one of the best flat irons.  My daughter and I love it when we want to straighten our natural hair, and the price was so right.</li>
    <li> Love the product. First flat iron had a broken plate. Customer service responded quickly and sent a new one.</li>
    <li> This tool makes all the difference between hair that looks so-so and hair that looks great.  I really do love it!  I got it on sale, so that made it even better!</li>
    <li> I simply love this flat iron!  My hair dresser used one during one of my appointments and I loved the way it made my hair look.  Ordered one and its simple enough to use that this old lady can use it!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great quality and was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I just got this, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with it.  It seems very well built.  I like the controls - both an on/off switch and temp control.  It moves over my hair smoothly and is neither too small nor too big and heavy. It was shipped promptly and was very well packed.</li>
    <li> My hair is smooth and straight each time I use this iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener a little over a year ago and I love it. I have very thick hair and so I need a high temperature, high quality straightener to get the job done and this one was perfect. I also fell deep in love with the argan oil just not with the prices haha so beware ;)</li>
    <li> I have only done a patch test with it. Its pretty good on my natural 4b/4c hair. I don&#x27;t think I will be experiencing any heat damage with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like that the heat gauge isn&#x27;t digital, I could swear that was how it looked in the picture. The heat gauge is a little nob so I will have to be guessing the correct temperature.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener!! When I came home and saw that my little frenchie had eaten the cord to my CHI flat iron I was not looking forward to buying another one for over $100. So i decided to look around at my options and came across this particular iron and thought I would give it a try. For the price I had nothing to lose but I was skeptical on how good it would work. Now after owning it and using it I will never buy a CHI again. This product blows it out of the water. It heats up much faster and straightens my hair (which is  very long, thick, and wavy)  in no time. I now save a good 10 mins in my morning routine with this flat iron because i only have to go over it once compared to 2-3 times at least with my CHI. I highly recommend this flat iron to anyone looking for a high end product and not paying a ton for it. I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Was better than expected.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing.  Twice as good as the one I had before (and loved) and half the price.  Worked for both long and short hair, heats up fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> The product works great. Got hot and straightened my hair. Also came with glove and mini argon oil</li>
    <li> I loved my old ceramic flat iron, but it was getting less stable after a couple of falls from the bathroom counter. Originally was drawn to this because I was looking for a dual voltage flat iron for an upcoming trip to Europe. Haven&#x27;t been able to try it out &amp;#34;on the road&amp;#34; yet, but it&#x27;s become my daily flat iron here at home and is great!  Heats quickly, very effective at straightening my hair, and leaves hair in good condition.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> Really really good. Especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Everything about it is great! Early arrival on the delivery was nice too.</li>
    <li> For some reason, the plates always catch my hair and pull.  I have never had this problem with any other straightener.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I have thick, coarse hair and it goes through it no problem. Also love the argan oil.</li>
    <li> I can not believe how well this iron works for such a low price! I&#x27;ve had three Chi straighteners and each has quit working within a year or two. With the price of this straightener, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it quit working in a day or two, but I&#x27;ve had it for several months and it&#x27;s still working great! It has a dial to adjust the temperature and a basic on/off switch. I have thicker yet fine hair that is super wavy and it definitely gets the job done. Super happy with this purchase. I would definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. She really liked it. It is a great product in the price.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome If a smaller plate could be included for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron, works just like a Chi, the oil is definitely a plus, just a bit adds extra shine.</li>
    <li> Good product and I was lucky to get it for a great price.</li>
    <li> It works as expected! Satisfied!</li>
    <li> Even great for fine hair!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Second time buying it because I&#x27;d never go back to a chi or more expensive hair straightener ! I tell my friends to buy this one also!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron at a great price.</li>
    <li> The HSI is definitely a straightener that you would want to buy. It glides down your hair smoothly without tugging or ripping out your hair. If your hair is thick, poofy, layered and kind of dead. After reading a few of the recent comments, I was unsure how well the HSI would perform. I was afraid that it would be terrible. When I got it in the mail, I opened it unsure. Inside was a brand-new straightener, the tourmaline metal all shiny (I like shiny), The 8-6 foot cord was wrapped neatly, the straightener was inside a silky red bag that contained the straightener wrapped in bubble wrap. The glove was at the bottom and the oil sample was neatly tucked under all of it. It is around the same weight as a Chi iron. It has adjustable head sensor and fits neatly in your hand. This makes your hair feel smooth like you just came back from the salon. If I were you, look no further. This is definitely the hair-straightener to buy! :D</li>
    <li> Works good, quick to straighten hair don&#x27;t have to go over one strand several times to see results.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome. I am 100% satistied. this is my 2nd one, I bought the 1st one 3 years ago, and loved it. It works great.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! I had a $150 Chi that the on/off button broke so in the trash it went. I had wanted another Chi but they are just too expensive!  This one gets just as hot and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught it like it did in the Chi. Try this and you&#x27;ll love it too :)</li>
    <li> Love the way in which it was packaged ( glove, flat iron, straightening oil sample, cover). This product does the job and can be controlled by turning the dial which was essiential. Great purchase for the price and my hair looks and feels fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have tried this hair straightener four times and it  just won&#x27;t get hot (barely warm).  Am I doing something wrong?</li>
    <li> I had to replace my expensive hair straightener and because I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much the second time, I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try. The reviews were right! This straightener is awesome!</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and was packaged very well. It comes with a storage pouch. Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;I think the demand for 18 words needs to be revised. Sometimes fewer is better.</li>
    <li> I returned this item because it did not heat up at all. I am giving it three stars because they were very good and professional about letting me return it. It seemed cheaply made but maybe if you get one that works it would be okay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a hair studio. After heavy daily use for 3 months it still works great. I am going to buy more.</li>
    <li> My daughter has this curly hair and hasn&#x27;t mastered straightening it yet (she&#x27;s 14). This straightener has been awesome for her to use! It&#x27;s heavy duty, has a long cord,  works beautifully, . and it&#x27;s only downfall is there is no \\&quot;on\\&quot; or LED power light? The switch is small and inside the handle, so you have to look hard to see if its off.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very good. The adjustments for it are amazing and I can use a lower setting for the first time and I have thick,curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair straightener that I love! It is easy to use and works very quickly, especially for those on the go/low maintenance ladies like myself. I recommended the product to a friend who has curly hair and she was able to straighten her hair in 10 minutes! Love it!</li>
    <li> I checked out several different products before ordering the HSI Professional straightener.  I have VERY thick hair that I have always had a problem with when it comes to flat irons.  I never could get the sleek look I wanted until I bought this flat iron.  It does an amazing job.  My hair has never looked so good!  I might have the heat setting half way up and my hair is straight in maybe 5 minutes (but like I said I have a lot of hair).  If you purchase this product you will be amazed at how well it performs. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.  I have bought several expensive, professional quality flat irons and this is my top pick!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron over 1.5 years ago. I got it after I had left my chi by accident at a hotel and was seriously bummed. I liked the price, the quality seemed good and the cord is extra long. Shortly after getting it, I had gone to a new hair stylist who way over-processed my hair. I began to notice that after blow drying and flat ironing my hair, I would see frizzy  burnt ends, that once completely flat ironed would go away. If I let my hair dry naturally, the ends were horrible, frazzled, burnt. I chalked it up to the overprocessing. But now that my bangs (19 months later) have completely grown out all the bad damage and color, my ends are still burning and frizzing. I started to realize it was because this HSI flat iron gets way, way too hot and the little temp dial doesn&#x27;t work. I have resorted to plugging it in to get it hot, then unplugging it to use it as it cools down. Crazy!! Going back to chi!</li>
    <li> Works great. It gets hot Fast and straighing it nice and easy.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Works very well!!&lt;br /&gt;Smoothing oil smells wonderful and full of shine!&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again as a present aye!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my very thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product was awesome! The temperture setting was higher than the cheapo&#x27;s you can buy at the store and a great deal for the price. Give it a try and you will be happy with it :)</li>
    <li> Great straightener! Wih the included argon oil, it really makes my frizzy ends smooth and shine.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for an a great low prices flat iron and I found it! Gets hot fast and stays hot!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this flat iron because it was duel voltage! We&#x27;ll be traveling abroad shortly and I didn&#x27;t want to buy both a converter and a new straightener (my old one is on the fritz). My hair is naturally curly but not in a good way, rather in an all over uneven mix of frizzy, super curly and totally flat. I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything special but surprisingly I find this flat iron to heat up faster than those I&#x27;ve previously used, straighten with only one sweep through my hair and yet doesn&#x27;t burn the more fragile top layers that have endured decades of hair color and bleach. I highly recommend, especially if you travel!</li>
    <li> Product works as stated.  It is easy to use, gets rid of the curl and leaves hair smooth and straight.  It was a replacement for a much more expensive item and it works just as well.</li>
    <li> Love this! Straightens my hair so fast!</li>
    <li> I have crazy thick fizzy curly wavy hair NOTHING wokded for me till I got the HSI. It changed my life I want from taking 45 mins to do my hair done to 30 and there is NO frizz</li>
    <li> It came scratched as if it was used and not brand new as stated. Before sending it back hoping that they would send me a non-used one, i did test it out to see if it was worth the hype. Temperature was great, it was hot enough and all the extras that came with it is a big plus, BUT the tip of the plate kept pulling my hair. I decided to return this and get a Chi.</li>
    <li> Excellent straightener!</li>
    <li> Gets my curly hair super smooth and silky without damaging my ends. It&#x27;s that simple. Can&#x27;t believe how great it works and it didn&#x27;t cost anywhere near $100+. It&#x27;s FAR better than my Chi and every other flat iron I&#x27;ve bought in my quest to find the perfect flat iron. I can finally stop looking and I can&#x27;t wait to get rid of the rest of the dozen flat irons I have sitting around waiting for my next garage sale.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this flat iron!  It does a great job of straightening my very wavy hair. I like it better than the Chi iron.</li>
    <li> I can feel my scalp!!..worth it and it comes with a silk case that I can rest my flat iron on and glove..I&#x27;ll never use it but its nice and some hair oild..worth the price</li>
    <li> This straightener is easy to use. It heats up quickly and does a great job straightening my hair and it doesn&#x27;t take as long as the ones I have used in the past. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener as a gift for my wife.  She mentioned she wanted a Chi, and I will usually buy her anything she wants without question. However, I am a Management Analyst, so I feel like I have to check everything out. I was looking at reviews for all types of flat irons, and thats when I came across this one.  The price was almost half of the one she wanted, so automatically I am skepitcal.  But, most of the reviews I read was how good this one is and some people actually compared to the Chi and said this one was better.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, and since there was a return policy, what, other than time, did I have to lose?  Anyway, when we got the flat iron in the mail, I think I was more excited than my wife was for her to try it out.  She, like me, was skeptical because of the price.  However, since she turned it on and started using it, she has had nothing bad to say, except I should have bought a bigger one.  She loves, loves, loves it!!!!  So, I guess more expensive don&#x27;t always mean better.  If you are in the market for a new flat iron, do yourself a favor and buy the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> works great, gets very hot.. i have very curly hair so it takes a lot of heat and pressure to force it straight! comes with a straightening serum, working pretty good too!</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener!  I had been using my old one for 12 years, I mostly used it for my bangs, but it was old and starting to pull out my hair. I did some research and stumbled across this. The price was great and it had good reviews.  I love the way it glides over my hair and leaves it smooth and shiny,  and I don&#x27;t need to go over the sames section of hair more than once.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of inexpensive straighteners and they have never worked as well as the HSI. After reading several reviews, I decided to purchase one and see the results for myself. It worked greatly on my hair and I am very satisfied with it as it does not burn or dry out my hair. My friends have bought straighteners over $100 and they still complain about its functions, so for those who are looking to buy a new one, why not try the HSI and see how wonderfully it works!</li>
    <li> When I origonally ordered this straightener, It came quickly and was packaged well. However, when I tried to use it, it didn&#x27;t heat up nearly as hot as it said it would. The seller said it was fine to return it, and didn&#x27;t give me a hard time about it, but the whole process took about a month. The replacement sent works just like it should though, so overall, i got what i had ordered.&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product review: It is a nice straightener. For the price you pay, it works very well. I can straighten my hair, curl it, all kinds of stuff. But even though it heats up well, it doesnt heat up as high as i would like; however i have fairly thin wavy hair, so it works out fine. Another plus - it doesnt pull or snag hairs when straightening. For the price you pay, you&#x27;re getting a pretty great straightner.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Fast shipping.. I&#x27;ve had for a few months now..no problems☺works great!!!</li>
    <li> The straightener works pretty well. PROS: It&#x27;s lightweight and convenient to wield. Even without being set to the highest temperature it usually only takes a single pass to straighten each section. Great price.  CONS: The temperature adjustment knob isn&#x27;t located in a convenient place and I risk burning myself if I need to raise or lower the temp. It has a really strong plastic smell. If you are sensitive to smells it may overwhelm you.  And unfortunately the bottle of argan oil was cracked and nothing was inside which was disappointing because I really wanted to try it.   Bottom line: Frills free economy straightener that works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron in October and my daughter and I share. She has thick curly hair and I have thin straight hair.  She said it did&#x27;t work well on her hair.  I thought it was fine for my type of hair.  I&#x27;m not giving a bad review cause of performance, I&#x27;m giving this product a bad review cause of it&#x27;s poor quality.  The flat iron fell on my foot (not on the floor) and just fell apart.  The ceramic plate broke from the inside and then all the other piece just fell out.  I can&#x27;t fix with screws or glue.  It&#x27;s in the garbage.</li>
    <li> The surface area of the plates allows me to do my hair much quicker. The plates get hot VERY quick. My hair is shinier and far less frizzy than with my previous straightener, which I still have but do not use. Heat indicator light is great too. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I stopped using irons because they damaged my hair and caused it to fall out very badly. This iron is very gentle with my hair and leaves it very smooth and shiny, of course the results may vary depending the level of heat you use, but overall I&#x27;m happy this iron and the argan oil, which also helps to protect my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it but the misses does n she loves it. She says it works better or just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Such a great flatiron. Heats up quickly, straightens beautifully. Great price.</li>
    <li> This iron works even better than my over priced Chi that lasted about 5 months. It will leave your hair silky smooth and looking great. They also have great customer service people to help with any concerns as well. Very good purchase!!</li>
    <li> I love the HSI straightener. I love that you can change the temperature of the straightener, unlike the Chi which is only on temp. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great price for an excellent product. I had been waiting awhile to buy one and this was perfect. It was exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  It works very well and leaves her hair looking straight and very shiny.  I would highly recommend this product.  Just remember to use a spray meant for heat on your hair first so you don&#x27;t dry out your hair too much!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener to replace my wet-to-straight appliance. I was skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve always bought the same kind, however, this one works so much better! My hair is thick and curly and normally takes at least 30-40 minutes to finish, but it took only 20 with this one! I absolutely love it and definitely recommend it! :)</li>
    <li> When I received this straightener and first felt the plates, I was afraid it was going to do damage to my hair because I bought it to curl my hair and the plates weren&#x27;t very smooth and had an edge instead of smooth sides.  When I first used it, I was right, it tugged unnecessarily on my hair instead of gliding evenly.  But I thought, what if I used a similar technique to curing a new cast iron pan to help smooth plates?  So I used argan oil to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; the plates and now it works amazing!!!  I love how quickly it heats up, that it has a on/ready indicator light, wide range of heart settings and that the controls are inside the handle so they can&#x27;t be bumped.  The red sateen bag it comes in is lovely, the heat resistant glove fits my giant hands and the argan oil is amazing!  I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I placed my ordered and then came to check out some of the reviews on here. Some of the reviews are written on the SAME DAY. For example, so many people have ONLY written positive reviews on ONE SINGLE DAY. How is that possible? Also another reviewer mentioned that some of the reviews on here are fake and can be found on various FAKE websites. I cancelled my order immediately. Do your research before you buy people. Groupon has this deal going on right now and as soon as I saw the groupon deal, I came on here to find so many reviews written on the same day. Needless to say they seem all fake. This sounds too good to be true. When something is too good to be true, it most always is.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this flat iron for my daughter after her Sedu died. My daughter has very long, thick, curly hair and liked her Sedu very much. We wanted a less expensive model this time, and decided to try this one after reading the reviews. After two uses, she finds that this flat iron does not glide down her hair as smoothly as the Sedu, it takes a bit longer even at a higher temperature to get straight, BUT, it does a better overall job. Her hair is flatter and straighter, and stays straighter longer. So far, I definitely recommend this product. We actually would have given this a 4 1/2 star rating, but that wasn&#x27;t an option.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife two years ago. It heats up fast and does exactly what she needs it to do. I was expecting to have to replace it after reading some of the other reviews, but luckily it is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any product, it only lasts as long as you take care of it.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was a little apprehensive about buying the HSI because the price was just to good to be true and I needed a styler to replace my old CHI. I thought \\&quot;what the heck I might as well give it a try\\&quot; and the HSI has yet to let me down. It is a great styler and what&#x27;s best is it comes a great price. The HSI ranks up there with the $100+ stylers and I recommend anyone looking for a real deal to get one. The item was shipped on time and came with extras. At this time I have no complaints, I am the happy owner of an HSI Styler.</li>
    <li> Love these flat irons, they get very hot and do a very great job, i tried to use my regular curls and they would not curl the weave i had, but HSI did the trick.  I will highly recommed these curlers. They came with a glove and very nice bag. thanks</li>
    <li> Love this straightener been using it for years gets really hot.  bought it as a replacement for the one I dropped and broke.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron from HSI.  It works great.  I know you would be happy too. It heats up fast and turns at the cord making it easier to use.  I got a small bottle of hair leave in oil with this purchase.  Flat out happy!</li>
    <li> I received my flat iron on the first expected delivery day. I immediately touched up my hair and it is actually softer than my hair stylist ever made it. I also retouched up my friends sew-in which needed some major saving. It looked great after I was done. I love this flat iron!!!!</li>
    <li> I used only a CHI for several years and loved it, until I broke it. So I began my search for a new CHI. While searching for a new CHI, I kept coming across the HSI flat iron. I began doing a little more research and after reading tons of reviews on several sites I decided to order the HSI flat iron. It is even better than my CHI was. I love the adjustable heat setting. I&#x27;m  able to do my hair at a high setting and then lower the setting for my girls. I have two small girls one with really fine hair and one with really curly hair and it worked wonderfully for all of us.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron for my sister for Xmas and I finally got around to asking her how the flat iron was... Her response-- I&#x27;ll let you try it out for yourself.. I told her to just tell me what she thought because I was convinced that after all the good reviews she&#x27;d for sure love it... but to my surprise- she said it wasn&#x27;t good. she said that after going over the same section of hair over and over again, it still didn&#x27;t make her hair straight like her old Chi.  Her hair is pretty frizzy, but nothing too extreme. I don&#x27;t know if it was just her flat iron or what... maybe we got a defective one? I told her to give it back to me so i can get her something different, but the return window was over in January.  Oh well, lesson learned.. i&#x27;ll just continue my hunt for another flat iron that will be comparable to Chi.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a flat iron that would ACTUALLY straighten my  hair , and I have FOUND it .  I am natural so I have thick curly hair .The HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron  does amazing at straightening my hair.  After straigthening my hair , It left my hair feeling  so soft and smooth.  I did not have to worry about the frizz because i had none. other flat irons i had used in the past , I always had to worried about fly aways and frizz .  Also this is amazing for people with thick hair because when you use the high setting you don&#x27;t have to worry about  frying your hair , because my hair wasn&#x27;t fried at all.  I didn&#x27;t feel any rough patches ( burning hair) in my hair , just smooth and silky .</li>
    <li> My straightener broken not even 6 weeks after I got it. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have this flat iron for 3 years and it&#x27;s amazing. I really recommend this product, my hair is so curly and with this flat iron I can do it by myself. Another thing is about the seller, he/she is great, I bought a new one for my sister and when it arrived was damage, so I contacted the seller and he sent me another one right away. Thank you for everything.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron to replace my Chi.  I ordered it last August and it worked great.  Unfortunately the last couple of months it hasn&#x27;t been working as well.  I finally figured out that one side of the iron heats up and the other doesn&#x27;t.  It is a lot of money to pay for something that didn&#x27;t even last a whole year even if it was cheaper than the Chi.  I will buy the Chi for a little more money and see if it does any better.</li>
    <li> Love it. Bought one for a friend for Christmas. (She loves it too.) when my old one died automatically purchased another for myself</li>
    <li> My wife claims that this iron snags her hair.&lt;br /&gt;As a mechanical engineer, I inspected the product and compared against her broken one.  Here is my prognosis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heater plates are not parallel.  Although they are spring loaded to compensate for this, the misalignment is too large and requires too much pressure to close properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lesser quality, $30 unit has better plate parallelism than this.  I hope this is an isolated case.  Based upon its popularity, this must be so but I am disappointed that I am the one that received the lemon.  Considering that this is really easy to check, I am perplexed as to why it wasn&#x27;t caught on the factory floor prior to shipping.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron. This is the most I&#x27;ve spent on one but am glad I did so now.</li>
    <li> I order and received the straightener very fast!! I have used it several times already and it works great!! I would recommend it. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Great and great price</li>
    <li> Not wotrth the $, doesn&#x27;t function correctly.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron when mine bit the dust. This flat iron takes a bit longer than my last to warm up but for the $, is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has some nice amenities included:  storage bag is the one I like most. There is also a temperature setting which I find useful. Good for the money.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It immediately softens your hair as you use it. I am very pleased with how it has worked so far. I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks so its hard to give a great feedback right now.</li>
    <li> I love this flatiron!</li>
    <li> This straightener doesn&#x27;t fry my hair immediately like other flat irons I have owned. It makes my hair shiny and beautiful. The perfect size for long hair too. My hair is almost to my behind, and it can be hard to handle, but every piece gets straightened with this baby.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for my two teen-aged daughters, who both have very long hair. They love this iron! It heats up quickly when turned on.  It straightens hair very nicely without having to do strands over and over.  Their friends always compliment them on this quality iron.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is great.  But overall, it is just okay.  I don&#x27;t like the old school look of it.  And I don&#x27;t like the way it feels as I pull it through my hair.  I also think the plug for the wall is obnoxious.  It is the size of a hair dryer plug.  Just okay... 3/5 stars.  But can&#x27;t beat the price, that is for sure.</li>
    <li> My first straightening iron.  Seems well made, light enough to hold comfortably.  Heats up quickly.  Love the variable heat settings as I have fine hair and don&#x27;t need it super hot.  Seems to work well.  I felt my hair stick once, but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;ve just started using one and am still learning the best technique.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron! For the cost and the quality I could not be happier. The outer light lets me know when it is ready and the heat adjustment is easy to use. The cord is a great length and does not tangle. Although I have only used the product for a week I can already tell it is going to be a good product. The product does come with a warranty which does put some worry to rest. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is a good flat iron and the argan oil is great!</li>
    <li> Its small but does the job well lol</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed by this product as i only bought it due to all of the fantastic reviews. I have had the straightners less than one month and one of the plates no longer heats up. I loved everything about it up until this, the delivery was prompt and the straightners worked perfectly for me. I would like to get a replacement, however I am now past the return date by only a few days so am very disappointed and annoyed they have had such a short life span.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my flat iron a few times since I&#x27;ve had it (for a couple weeks), and so far it works great. I use it mostly for curling, and it does just what I want it to do. My only minor complaints are that the temperature dial and on/off switch are on the inside of the iron, which makes them a little awkward (maybe this is the norm?) to reach and view; and occasionally my hair snags on something, but I&#x27;ve never used a curling or flat iron that didn&#x27;t do this a little. I would imagine some people might want temperature increments on the dial or a digital display for the temp, but for me it&#x27;s not a big deal. Once the dial is at a temp that works for my hair, I&#x27;m not going to touch it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the protective, and stylish, bag for the iron, especially since I tend to be careless when putting all my gadgets away. The wrap for the cord is very handy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside of the iron gets pretty hot, which is good for curling, but it hasn&#x27;t been so hot that I&#x27;ve worried about burning the counter or anything (I use a towel just to be safe anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, seems to be well worth the price, as long as it lasts me a good while (1-2 years at least, I hope). I tend to go for super cheap, so this is on the spendy side for me! So far, not disappointed!</li>
    <li> Packaged very nicely..awesome iron..very happy</li>
    <li> I love this! I have thick coarse hair and it straightenes it beautifully!</li>
    <li> Love the argan oil, pouch and glove. The straightener meet my expectations but it doesn&#x27;t do a miracle. I will update it later when I get to use it more.</li>
    <li> Works great and is dual voltage for my trip to Europe.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast.but seamed to pull on my hair .little tabs on the ends catch on hair and cause it to break.to weeks of using  my hair look terrible. Short  broken pieces everywhere going back to old flat iron</li>
    <li> Love this iron. Love this seller. My iron arrived sooner than expected and product performance is the same as other more expensive irons I&#x27;ve unfortunately purchased (chi).</li>
    <li> I wish it had a retracting cord.  Also wish it had an auto-shut-off.  Other than that it is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron just for the reviews and regret it. The iron is not good at all. I have to go over and over again and still looks frizz, and after 1 hour looks terrible. also it brakes the hair so bad. My recomendation is that put a little more money and buy a better iron like the babyliss.</li>
    <li> I bought the HSI flat iron because of the dual voltage.  I have previously destroyed a couple of hair appliances on trips to Europe and this time I wanted dual voltage to avoid any issues, but I did not want to spend a fortune.  I was a bit hesitant because I had not heard of the brand, but the price was right, as was the dual voltage.  I was more than pleased with the product.  It heated up quickly and worked as well as my current iron.  In fact, I have actually replaced my previous iron with this one now that I have returned home.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does not work how promised. I have thick wavy hair (not even super curly) and I had to go over my hair 3 or more times to get straight and it didnt look shiny or anything. After reading all the good reviews I thought this would be the perfect flat iron for me but it definitely doesnt work well. It is worse than my 6 year old crappy revlon. I would not recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Loved,the best one,finally after five flat irons i found it.I recommended to everybody,For sure I&#x27;m gonna buy this HSI again.</li>
    <li> Useless.  It&#x27;s not hot and it doesn&#x27;t have a tight hold.  I threw it away</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas, she loves it.  It works great, makes her hair look great without burning her hair.  Happy wife &#x3D; happy life</li>
    <li> I just got this hair straightener and it came with the little argon oil, the straightener a glove and of course the little bag. It&#x27;s works well and straightens good but I&#x27;m still considering if it&#x27;s really awesome since I&#x27;ve staightened once while my hair was in a not so well condition. I had a Revlon for 4 years that was really great so I hope this one will be just as good since the price dropped super low when I ordered it!</li>
    <li> Had to change my review because after using it for a week, it started to tear my hair.  I now have breakage and pretty damaged hair due to this flat iron.  Hopefully the return will go smoothly.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully - I was very impressed with the quality, as this replaced my Classic Chi of 6+ years. I haven&#x27;t used the heat glove or oil yet but it was a nice bonus!</li>
    <li> This flat iron doesn&#x27;t leave my hair neither dry nor oily. Many flat irons do one of the other. It also heats up nicely and just enough to straighten my very tight and coarse curly hair. It&#x27;s a great find, but one!</li>
    <li> Awesome flat Iron!!  Very Happy with it!!</li>
    <li> I got it on Saturday and curled my hair with it for a party, the curled looked amazing! I really got a lot of complements on it. Most important for me is that it did not burn my hair like my old one did, this one actually made it shiny.</li>
    <li> Like most other reviewers here, I used a Chi Turbo for three years until it died on me. When I discovered the cost of repairs would be more than I paid for the actual iron, I decided to just buy a new one. This iron is just as good, if not better, than my Chi. It gets just as hot, just as fast. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, now, and I am pretty satisfied. I have ethnic hair, and it&#x27;s really good for straightening my roots in between relaxers, but be forewarned that, if it&#x27;s humid outside, you&#x27;ll need to put something in your hair to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t puff up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two cons I can think of. (1) The barrel gets REALLY hot, and it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself with it. I was used to being able to hold the edge of my Chi iron&#x27;s barrel while curling my hangs, but you absolutely cannot do that with this iron, you will burn yourself. Also, be careful about burning your forehead as well. (2) There&#x27;s no auto-shutoff, and I would suggest spending the extra $10 for the LCD display iron with the auto-shutoff option. At least twice now I&#x27;ve left my iron on overnight or for a whole day (I had to make myself a big note and tape it to the bathroom mirror!). If you&#x27;re forgetful like me, it;&#x27;s worth it to get the LCD iron.</li>
    <li> Item came promptly and flat iron works very well on my hair.  Seems well built and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great product... works well..as expected.. small, heats up fast and easy to use. Company is great and responsive.  not sure yet about five stars because I have only used it a couple times. Will have to see how it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> I ordered the same product as before simply by clicking order again because my dog chewed the cord and yet the item I received was completely different..</li>
    <li> The price was excellent and delivery was as fast as promised.</li>
    <li> Awesome packaging, awesome product! Heats up fast and works like it should! Came in very nice box! Would order again from this company!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Well packaged. Great product at fantastic price.</li>
    <li> I got the hair straightener for my daughter and she loves it.  She is using it every other day and has found it very user friendly!</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery! I bought this straightener to replace my Chi that died and I didn&#x27;t want to pay another ~$100 for one. After looking up reviews and researching, I found this one. After I got it and tried it, I&#x27;ll never go back to a Chi! This straightener leaves your hair so soft and you even get a little bottle of Ragan oil with it that is great, it doesn&#x27;t leave your haie greasy or anything. If you&#x27;re trying to choose between a Chi and this straightener, I would definitely choose this one. I know you&#x27;ll be happy!</li>
    <li> Absolutely am thrilled with my new straight iron. Great price and does a wonderful and fast job!  Love it!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Seems to be made of good construction.</li>
    <li> By far the best iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;m growing my relaxer out so mantaining my hair during the transition requires weekly salon visits but not anymore. It doesn&#x27;t take long at all to straighten my hair to salon quality.</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up quickly and straightens beautifully! From the first use, I knew this was better than any other hair tool I had ever owned. It tames my wavy, thick hair in just minutes. Would recommend to anyone looking for a new straightener!</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great on my hair even when I let it dry naturally and it is frizzy.</li>
    <li> My last two flat irons were FHI brand.  The first lasted about 5 years, with almost daily use.  I replaced it with an FHI Platform, which I loved.  It met with an untimely death (thanks to my clumsiness and a tile floor).  Rather than immediately replacing it with the exact-same product, I decided to shop around and came across the HSI Professional.  It had a lot of good reviews, and a great price, so I decided to give it a whirl.  Um, hello disappointment.  It&#x27;s not that bad, but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I need it to be and is a bit clunky and heavy to use.  My hair is wavy, not curly, but I still struggle to get it as straight and shiny as I was used to.  I plan to make this one work for awhile, but ultimately I will head back to the FHI.</li>
    <li> This iron will not heat up to 450, which in my case is ok because my hair is really fine and will burn, but if you have thick or curly hair, forget it, it will never straighten your hair. This iron is ok, but I will not purchase it again. I noticed something funny though, I recently purchased another iron \\&quot;Le Angelique\\&quot; and BOTH have the same design, same controls, same body...everything is the same, even the \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; sticker. The only difference was the name tag on each of them and that one has black plates and the other one tan, this one say HSI and the other TA. Am affraid some manufacturers are using the SAME irons but adding their own name on them. Good luck</li>
    <li> I am a Chi fan so I was a bit hesitant to switch.  This iron gets much hotter than the Chi.  So far very happy</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reviewing it online and it just turned out to be perfect buy. I would highly recommend this .Don&#x27;t get cheated at mall for the same product for 200 bucks.Amazon has lowest price.</li>
    <li> This little flat iron comes beautifully boxed and wrapped up in a lovely red satin bag, which makes it look \\&quot;very impressive\\&quot;! When I plugged it in to use it, the iron started to heat immediately, and took about a minute for it to be ready for use. I love the fact that I can control the temperature, and put it on the right heat that is good for my hair. It also comes with a glove that can be used to protect your hand from burning if it should come in contact with the hot part of the iron.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it&#x27;s there in case I want to. A little bottle of Argon Oil is also included for use in treating the hair.....also which I haven&#x27;t used yet, but will. The iron has a good feel to it when handling and using it, and it is easy to control in the hair.  I think this flat iron and I will have a good, long relationship, and I&#x27;ll certainly be wanting another one like it whenever the time comes for a new one.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and works wonderfully. Myself and my 2 daughters have used it and we all love this hair straightener. We have always used Chi which is ok and Babyliss (which I LOVE), but this works as well as the Chi. My girls and I have thick, course, curly hair and it works fine on our hair. I do feel like I this was a steal for a straightener like this. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks so if there&#x27;s a problem in the future I&#x27;ll edit this review, but so far it&#x27;s a great straightener.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron as a replacement to one that has lasted me over four years. My old flat iron survived the test of time, COUNTLESS falls, wear and tear, and still performed perfectly. I never had any problems with it. THIS flat iron has the same heat control that my old one did, but it still felt like any other NON-professional flat iron one could buy at the super market. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and all it took was ONE accidental drop for one of its plates to UNHINGE. The fall wasn&#x27;t from any high place. It fell on a well-cushioned rug.Complete waste of money and time, as its warranty does NOT cover accidents. So, if you&#x27;re an occasional butterfingers like I am, be sure to check out the WARRANTY FIRST on their website.</li>
    <li> Works so much better then other flat irons and had adjustable heat setting...leaves my hair silky straight</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT LEAVES MY HAIR SILKY SMOOTH AND i HAVE REALLY FRIZZY CURLY HAIR ONLY TAKES ONE OR TWO TIMES THROUGH MY HAIR AND STAYS THAT WAY THE WHOLE DAY LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK straightener.  It tends to catch strands of my hair more than I like which pull my hairs out. Also I have to hold the handle pretty far back because the front part of the handle can get quite warm.  The handle also pinches my palm due to the way the handle closes.  Also the ceramic plates don&#x27;t feel very smooth when I move it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using various straighteners for years and this one is not the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Heats up pretty quick and the plate shape and flex really helps get some good twists and flips for some outrageous hair.  The grip feels pretty good in the hand, but starts to get a bit warm after a long period of use.  Been looking to try argan oil, and the sample they include is a full five mL bottle filled to the brim.</li>
    <li> All prior reviews are right, Great flat iron at a great price.  Buy this one.  Purchased for a gift for my sister and going to order one for myself.Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product since it had so many great reviews. It worked really well and my hair was nice and straight. Normally I don&#x27;t use my straightener that much- maybe on average once every two weeks, so I was extremely surprised to see my straighter glitch and not maintain its heat even at the highest level. The light indicator would flash from red to green, then instantly flash to red again. The iron will be hot one second, then warm the next, so it causes chaos to my hair and I&#x27;ll have to re-straighten strands. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have thick, coarse hair that can get very wild. I used to have to blow dry my hair then style with hot iron/curler. The HSI works so well that I no longer have to blow dry my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months and my hair is healthier and growing longer.</li>
    <li> Bajsbsjhdhb d bskekebdbdjekjebdbd</li>
    <li> Okay so it has been close to two years since I bout this flat iron. I am still using it weekly and it still does wonders on my hair! I would definitely recommend to any one who wants a professional flat iron at a wonderful price!! I have very thick hair that is curly and it makes my hair super straight! I always use a Moroccan Oil and a Heat sensitive spray when straightening my hair to make sure there is no breakage with the high temperature. I love this flat iron and when finally it decides to give out I&#x27;m purchasing another just like it! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have a lot of natural curl in my hair.  The flat irons I have tried in the past didn&#x27;t work well at all with my hair.  After reviewing all the feedback for this product I decided to give it a try.  It is amazing!  The adjustable heating allows me to turn it for smoothing my hair, and turn it down for my daughter&#x27;s.  It was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this flat iron, I never thought this would work so great on my hair. My hair have a lovely shine and  no frizzy.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this flat iron, I seriously couldn&#x27;t understand what the big deal was. It was no better than the one I had. But, I continued using it and am very glad I did. This really is a great flat iron! In less than a week, my hair has more softness and shine than when I started. And I don&#x27;t get that dreaded sound of my hair being tugged/pulled through the flat iron. It just glides right through it. Item arrived factory sealed and nicely packaged. Nice long cord with swivel. Heats up quickly with several temperature options.</li>
    <li> First of all , I have naturally curly frizzy poofy hair. And this flat iron works GREAT. The first time I used it , it was great! And it still is.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair VERY straight and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair! I got a little bottle of argon oil with it and I also love that product too!&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality ! Good for all hair types , and isn&#x27;t even expensive!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this iron  But my hair kept getting caught in it and the iron pulled out strands. My scalp was so sore. I looked all over the iron, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out why this was happening. Also, the blades aren&#x27;t aligned. When closed the blades don&#x27;t close all the way. When I used it, I had to squeeze real hard. I know that there are some reviews about how the manufacturer took returns and sent a new ones immediately, but if this happens so often, isn&#x27;t that I sign that there is a good chance that you&#x27;re going to get a dud too. I didn&#x27;t want to try again. I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle.</li>
    <li> I mostly love my new hair straightener.  I would give 5 stars however I am not very experienced with other brands of hair straighteners.  I also wish it was slightly more wide.  The absolute best feature about it would be that it doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch.  My friend&#x27;s straightener will literally burn her or whoever if it is touched.  I can put this on the highest setting and it is nowhere near that bad.  I love the sample HSI serum that was included with it.  Freebies are always nice.  I think the glove is alright but I do not usually use it.  The pouch is nice and soft to keep it in.  It makes my hair straight however I do have to run it over the strand a couple of times.  My hair stylist does not feel it should be set on the absolute highest setting 410 degrees so I keep it was 375 or so.  I wish it would straighten more without multiple swipes.  I have pretty straight hair already compared to others so that should be noted.  Overall its a good product but as I said I am not sure if there are better options.  I would recommend buying it if you are looking for affordability.  For the price I think the straightener is fabulous.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me and I had zero issues ordering. The flat iron is great!</li>
    <li> For this money it should not break this soon...  no warranty, no money or replacement.  Im going to get three cheap ones for the same price.</li>
    <li> After my old flat iron died, I dreaded trying to find a new one.  I decided to take a gamble on the HSI Professional flat iron, and boy, did it pay off!  This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s at least as good as, if not better, than the one my hairdresser uses.  I actually enjoy using it, which has never been the case before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying such a good product at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this iron for the following reasons one the heat settings  are on inside and hard to get to. the iron grip pulls on my hair  to rough . over all hair oil great iron sucked sorry not the best ive had better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Would purchase again and recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dual voltage flat iron for my trip to France last month. But the airline lost my luggage so I didn&#x27;t have a chance to use it there. However, I was able to use it back home in the states and it is great! I am African American and I wear my hair straight with no chemicals. I use the iron to straighten my edges and for styling. I go to my hair dresser for my regular straightening, but this iron works well for touch up straightening in between appointments. I love the temp controls and the oil as well. Great product. I hope to be able to use it on my next trip to Europe!</li>
    <li> Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
    <li> I recommend this flat iron if you are not ready to spend over a $100 on a high end one. I have had this one for over a year and have no complaints. It gets the job done every time. Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t overly dry my hair. I usually use a heat protectant spray or something like that before I straighten my hair and that seems to help as well. Very Happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter who has very long thick hair and it works great. Straightens it and makes it look very smooth and soft. She is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron. Got my natural 4a/b hair straight in one pass and it lasted for two weeks. Could have gone longer but I was missing my curls!</li>
    <li> Broke. Replaced it. Broke again. My hair looks like s***.</li>
    <li> We purchased this flat iron and used it four times and now it does not work.  We never dropped it or have any reason to why it quit working.  It will not even turn on.</li>
    <li> The light changes back and forth from red to green. NOT HAPPY with it, not worth the price for what I got. It shouldn&#x27;t be shorting-out for $79</li>
    <li> The packaging was impressive and the shipping was GREAT, very fast! However, the iron itself is not what I expected. I expected a higher quality and smoother glide.&lt;br /&gt;I have a different iron that is Salon quality but I expected the HSI to be much better. :(  It&#x27;s not... and my old iron works better.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing and I was able to purchase it under market value.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great with thick hair! Received it quickly. This is the second one we purchased. My daughter got hers for Christmas and it worked so well that we got another one for mom.</li>
    <li> I have owned Chi&#x27;s for the past 9 years. My first one lasted 6 years and I have gone through 3 in the past 2 years due to malfunctioning products. I finally had enough sand thought I&#x27;d try the HSI. I love it. It has a heat control for temperature, glides through hair with ease and straightens my hair in minutes. I have really curly hair. I love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day, or nearly every day, and it works great.  That said, I&#x27;ve tried a variety of straighteners all in this price range and I can&#x27;t say i&#x27;m loyal to one brand or another, they all work about the name without much differentiation, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this straightner so much I bought 2 more as gifts for my best friend and my sister who both are cosmetologists. They think it&#x27;s fantastic for such a great deal!! I definitely recommend if you&#x27;re in need of one.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality and packaging of the flat iron. The case it came with to protect it as well as the oil provided. I&#x27;m fairly new to using a flat iron and people kept telling me I was going to have to get a flat iron that was at least $ 100.00 in order to get a good one.  Definitely not the case, I find this one to be easy to use and it definitely does what I want.  I would highly recomment it to anyone.  Great value, Great price.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The temperature range is great for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Works well and easier to use than previous products.  Heat adjustments but does not shut off automatically. Does not crimp hair like other products I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair flat iron because my old one was too big, heavy and cumbersome. This one is the same length as my old one but is not as heavy and easier to use. The results are great. I would recommend to my friends. 😃</li>
    <li> This flat iron has single-handedly made my morning routine so much quicker than it used to be.  I no longer have to spend the amount of time I did in making sure I have the perfect blow dry.  This iron takes care of all the kinks and the oil included makes my hair look so healthy.  Best purchase in a long time.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with how well this flat iron worked until after about a month I felt a snag and noticed that the plate had cracked. Major disappointment. Time to find a new flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great product and at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 yr niece and she loves this straightener! She was even more excited when she saw that it came with the oil and the glove!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went with this! It&#x27;s about 90% the quality of my old (dead after 3 years) $100 straightener for 40% the price! Definitely a bargain!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is really good. Love the way my hair looks after each use.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener was the perfect upgrade for me. I used to use a cheap, ineffective straightener - and it showed. The good news is that I didn&#x27;t have to pay that much. At around $40, this HSI straightener is amazing. Having had my hair straightened at salons, I can honestly say this is right up there with the $150-$200 irons the professionals use. It heats up in seconds, and I love that I&#x27;m able to adjust the temperature. I highly recommend this for anybody looking for a professional-quality straightener at a very reasonable price - you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Was a great price. Would totally compare to the chi.</li>
    <li> I have my little cousins back in Pakistan and they asked for straightener and looking at reviews I have sent this one to them and so far I am hearing pretty good things from my little cousins. It can work with 120V as well as 220-240V so can be used internationally easily.</li>
    <li> I need a flat iron that would heat up quick and give me the spiral curls my hairdresser gives me.  The HSI Professional ceramic flat iron heats up extremely fast.  That&#x27;s good because I tend to schedule my morning with minimum time between sleeping and showing up for work. As for the spiral curls... well,  the product will definitely deliver but the operator of the equipment (namely me) needs to practice more.  There&#x27;s a reason we tip our hairdressers - they learned how to do those things perfectly.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the HSI flat iron and will, after practice,  become more satisfied with my own abilities to use the equipment to its full potential.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this flat iron. It heats up quickly and works fantastic. I never knew how quickly I could straighten my hair and I never thought I had the time but with this straightener it is quick and the results are amazing!!</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a good straightening iron.  I have short hair and it makes my curly hair shiny and straight.</li>
    <li> My wife had been looking for a top notch straightener.  I went to amazon to check reviews and this was reasonably priced with excellent reviews.  She has used it for a week now and has like it a lot.  My sister in law bought one for $100 and was not impressed with it.  This is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. She used to hate straightening her hair as it used to take too much time with her old one. Now it takes her less than 5 mins to straighten her hair and she&#x27;s on her merry way in no time. definitely a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> It took more than three weeks to get it.&lt;br /&gt;Bu so far it works</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and well packaged from this business. Product works well. Only thing that could be improved is that plates be extended to the end of the device as hair sometimes gets caught in the plastic at the tip.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time research hair straighten. I don&#x27;t  like to spend much money on myself. But also i want a product  i will not have to replace  in a few months/years. After seeing the savings on the product and the great reviews,  this purchase  was a no brainer!  I love how fast it heats up and it takes me no time to straighteny hair (my hair is thick&amp;to the middle of my back) mother of 5,doesn&#x27;t  leave much time for myself. Nor do i like to spend hours priming. I have been very happy with this product  and will be ordering one for my mom and sister! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> We bought this based on all the rave reviews. The plates are of poor quality and pull hair.  I have used a Chi for years and never had it pull like this does. This unit did heat up quick but I just can&#x27;t have my hair pulled on like that.  I guess you get what you pay for. Spend the money and get a better unit.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter and she loves it. It leaves her hair shiny and soft and she also loves the free oil that came with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever purchased. My hair is wavy and this makes a smooth straight finish to my hair. I was going to get my hair permanently straightened in a beauty salon for hundreds of dollars, but now that will not be necessary..</li>
    <li> the flat iron i purchase I&#x27;m very very satisfied and I will be telling all my friends and family how i enjoy my flat iron. Tks very much</li>
    <li> A little too thin. Surface is not big enough to do long hair past shoulders. Last one I brought was 125.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Hair Straightener and was so excited after hearing all the positive reviews. I was so thrilled to finally hear about an affordable straightener that was comparable to those that were top of the line. Unfortunately, my experience with the HSI straightener has been very disappointing. I have used hair straighteners for over 10 years, but have never had one that not only pulls my hair like this, but also makes it look split/dead. If you have thin hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this straightener. I think it&#x27;s important that potential buyers understand that part of the reason this product has received so many positive reviews, is that the company tries really hard to please it&#x27;s buyers, and also asks you to write to them about your unhappiness before letting the public know. While this product may work for some, it did not work for me. Wish I had read more potentially honest/negative reviews prior to my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great, the oil that comes with it really helps. Love this straightener.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t pass up the great price for this ceramic flat iron.  It heats up quickly and gets the job done without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> I chose this straightener for the choice in heat temperature and the price. There is an analog dial that lets you choose the temperature gradient, bit it is not marked to show the exact temperature. It heats up quickly and is a good size for my short hair. It doesn&#x27;t feel as sleek or sturdy as some more expensive brands of straighteners, but for the under $40 price tag, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good purchase. The storage bag is a nice feature for travel, as well.</li>
    <li> This one is one of the best iron, after use it your hair will shine very nice, and the stylish is very neat</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that it included a heat proof glove</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron it makes my hair looks relaxed. I have very thick hair and this is the only flat iron that have laid my hair. Thumbs up 👍 👍 👍</li>
    <li> Horrible customer service. I message the seller over 3 days ago because my device seems to be defective. When I turn it to high heat the red led doesnt change to green when its ready to use. I just wanted some answers or figure out what I could do but it seem like they like to blow people off. Definately not work the money if it only works right for a month.  Id give it a better review if the seller actually contacted me back.</li>
    <li> I bought the iron thinking it will be a great replacement for my old remington flat iron, since I have heard a lot of positive reviews about it, but l was wrong. I tried to use it, and it was terrible,  it was pulling my hair out so bad that I had to stop using it and finish straightening with my old iron. The plates are not aligned properly, it has a big gap on one end when you close plates together, unless you press it very hard. I liked the design and size otherwise. I am going to return it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, keeps my hair super straight and I have super curly hair. The flat iron heats up super quickly and works wonders.</li>
    <li> I got an amazing haircut and the stylist used a flat-iron on my hair, which elicited many compliments. I usually curled my hair, and it was getting too long to do that, so I asked for a new style. Once I realized that I was going to have to use a flat iron, I researched and found the HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic straightener. It had all the elements I read were necessary: ceramic plates, adjustable heat settings, a rotating cord, and what I especially loved, a heat glove. I had never heard of a heat glove before I started researching flat irons and I was happy that the iron came both with a heat glove and the Argan Oil that gives hair a brilliant shine. I love packaging and the carrying pouch. I can&#x27;t make the cord fit in the pouch, but that is fine, as long as the iron is protected. Using the flat iron is surprisingly simple, and I did not encounter any snagging. I really recommend this product and I love that way my hair came out - silky straight with lots of movement, just like in the salon. I received so many compliments on my hair after using it. I am sure the average user will find this product more than adequate for their needs.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this straightener it makes my hair shiny and smooth. It is better than other more expensive products out there I have tried. It feels sturdy and high quality, thank you HSI. I informed my hair dresser she said it was a good one she uses this one too.  I would recommend buying this HSI you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Awesome better than my chi</li>
    <li> I found this product on Pinterest, where it got rave reviews. I came to Amazon to check it out and was farther lured in by all the positive reviews and unfortunately didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the negative reviews. I love my current Flatiron but its almost 10 yrs old and showing its age. I don&#x27;t have the budget at the moment to replace that, so the price of this, along with the rave reviews, suckered me in.  It&#x27;s heavier then my other Flat iron (Which I paid about $90 dollars for so it wasn&#x27;t cheap!). The controls on the inside are awkward to get to and its a dial  that only lists the lowest setting and the highest settings. Trying to find the Medium temp is sort of a guessing game. I didn&#x27;t even know there was a indictor light because it didn&#x27;t come on until halfway through the first use and then it would just randomly come and off and on. Its supposed to turn green when the iron is at the correct temp. but it stayed red. I realize that, that could&#x27;ve just could have been due to a faulty iron. The plates when pushed together wouldn&#x27;t meet together so I had to sort of mash it together for it to smooth/iron the hair like its supposed to causing it to snag and catch several hairs. Also since the medium heat is a guessing game as to what will work with you hair, it wasn&#x27;t ironing my hair with one pass! I had to go over multiple times snagging even more hair in the process! I basically had to crank it up to the highest setting (which is not good for my hair) to get it to work with one pass. I have normal, med- thick, slightly wavy hair so it shouldn&#x27;t have needed to be cranked up that high! I sent it back not only because of a defective indictor light, but because it was just plain awful! I got what I paid for! Most certainly NOT a \\&quot;professional quality Flat iron!!</li>
    <li> i bought three of these, the first two works great my sisters use them, has your hair straight as expected good styling tool as well however, just when i was having good vibes on this straigtner and thought ok let me order one, i got a defected product. the straightener only worked once and when i went to use it the second time it never heated i got frustrated as i only just bought it and now it does not work anymore after one use. the standards of this product needs to be maintained, either you are selling great products or dont sell at all. the cost of sending this back is alot but not as much as what i paid for it, i hate my new straightener it does not work i am disappointed that i spent my money for something that is truly a waste of time, it would be appreciated having a new one that truly WORKS!!!!</li>
    <li> HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a high end salon quality product, very pleased the the purchase!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this flat iron!!!  It makes my hair so soft and smooth.  Definitely the best flat iron I have ever received.  Would highly recommend it to anyone with thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> For someone who has very thick and curly hair like me it sure does it&#x27;s job! It heats up fast (under 5 mins for me)  and is very nice for it&#x27;s price! I only give it four stars though because with how thick my hair is it takes a little bit because I have to go over some strands of hair a few times before it flattens out. I would recommend to anyone needing a good  hair straighter!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my fiance over Christmas and she loved it.  She says that the Ceramic in this model was much superior than many of the other brands that she has bought and it works great on her hair.</li>
    <li> I had to return this product b/c I set the head for 400 and I could still touch it after 5 min of heating up. it never got very hot. Maybe I had a bad one but I just went with a baby bliss (which is a lot of money but has a 4 year warrenty) and it works amazing!</li>
    <li> I have bought other flat irons before and given them away, but this one is so great!  Thank you so very much!</li>
    <li> Iron is great!! love it and would recommend anytime. thank you</li>
    <li> Caught and pulled my hair every time I used it. Had to send it back. Got a CHI. So much happier.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron! I have really thick hair and it heats up fast and leaves my hair silky. I like that it comes with a protective glove because my old iron would leave my hair too hot to touch for a moment. I haven&#x27;t had this issue yet, but my hair is just as straight.</li>
    <li> The straightener worked in Europe.  It actually worked better than my \\&quot;home\\&quot; iron, so I may use it full time now that I&#x27;m back in the states.  It is lightweight, it heated up really quickly, and the ceramic finish glided over my hair.  I&#x27;d recommend this for travelling abroad or for use at home.</li>
    <li> This Flat iron is fantastic.  It is priced right for a high quailty product.  I don&#x27;t see why anyone would pay $100+ to get the same professional results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few flat irons over the years and usually gave up using them because of the poor results thinking it was my technique and would go back to using a curling iron.  I saw this flat iron had great reviews and decided to try just one more.  I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  It wasn&#x27;t my technique at all because this iron leaves my hair smooth and silky.  Combine it with HSI Argan oil and you&#x27;ll have beautiful, swingy, silky hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it so far. Seems like a very good deal.  We are a satisfied customer!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift from my wife, she&#x27;s very happy with it compared to previous cheaper irons.  It works perfeclly.</li>
    <li> I am impressed in every way with my purchase!  The price was great! It shipped very quickly! The product is exactly as promise and I love it! I had a flat iron previously that cost. over $100. It exploded when i tried to use it in Europe.  I decided to buy this product when i saw the price and reviews of the product. I really needed one asap! I would highly recommend this product to anyone and I would definitely recommend Amazon for purchasing!</li>
    <li> It heats up very quickly and straightens my hair efficiently! Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok straightener. Based off of reviews I thought it would be much better, but it does as well as the $20 conair straightener I had before and doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
    <li> Considering its a high end straightener, I expected it to be a bit more powerful. It takes a while to heat up, and it&#x27;s not up to par for my hair once my hair is 90% dry out of the shower (that&#x27;s always been a Tell for a good straightener). I noticed my wavy hair (not quite curly unless it&#x27;s really humid) manages to start curling after a few hours. I brought a Remington and  that does the job a bit better for initial straightening. I&#x27;ve been using the HS1 to maintain my hair. Good for the price, but not my go to after months of owning one.</li>
    <li> Wow, this thing gets hot.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews but it was just horrible. My hair is already fairly straight and this straightener didn&#x27;t even take out the waves. I returned it and purchased another CHI.</li>
    <li> I was not looking for a flat iron when I went onto Amazon, but then I saw the HSI Professional as a suggestion.  With the price and the positive reviews, I just had to order one.  I am very pleased that I did.  Typically, my quick last minute choices do not always turn out to be a great idea, however I am done with my old flat iron.  The HSI professional comes in a sleek looking pouch and the cord is longer then my other hair tools.  I would like the cord to go into the bag too, but it does come with an attached zip tie sort of thing to keep the wires contained.  My hair is thick and and somewhat wavy.  To get it straight takes a lot of layering and repeated sections.  The HSI Professional really cutes the time in half.  The heat stays hot and the even and I dont have to go over strands over and over.  I love it!  I would suggest it to anyone and I want to look into other HSI hair products too!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product, fabulous price- delivered prior to promised date-</li>
    <li> The flat iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as advertised.</li>
    <li> I really like the iron it gets my hair super straight but I still have to go over it a few times. I do find that I need the heat all the way up and it works much better. The heat glove that is included I do have to wear it gets very hot. Over all for the money I&#x27;m happy with the iron. I only give 4 stars because I have to use 2 hands to hold iron down on my hair to get enough pressure to make it straight.</li>
    <li> thought it would be smaller and lighter for traveling</li>
    <li> Great product for the $$ and I love the oil!</li>
    <li> I was solo excited when I find these for the listed price. What a steal. They come packaged very nicely. I keep mine in the box AND bag for extra protection lol. They heat up fast and are good for people with thick/coarse hair and people with thinner hair. Don&#x27;t find myself using the included glove but the argan oil sample is awesome I lobe it.</li>
    <li> Good iron does what it should</li>
    <li> Great product timely delivery great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my flatiron for 3 weeks and love it.  Would buy this product again</li>
    <li> Works well.  Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic!! Speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift to surprise my wife. The item was delivered on time. My wife was on cloud nine after seeing this surprise gift. She loved it as soon as she started using it. The item is very handy and it is very easy to use even for the beginners. I would definitely recommend to buy this.</li>
    <li> I was able to straighten my natural hair with ease. Best flat iron I&#x27;ve had so far. My hair did snag in a small area of the plate, avoided this with rotation. I could replace it but don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  After a long search for the perfect one for my coarse, thick hair.  I found this one and LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Ordered this product and was disappointed that the ceramic flat paddles were scratched. I know it wouldn&#x27;t have affected my hair, but still the product was new and should&#x27;ve been scratch free. Did not use the product- sent it back.</li>
    <li> I love this..! Good one</li>
    <li> Chipped the first week... Also doesn&#x27;t work with thick hair and long hair didn&#x27;t like it continued to use the straightener I have had for 10 years now from hot tools...</li>
    <li> The product was delivered as stated.  The flat iron works great and heats up quickly, no waiting!  Highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener 5 months ago. I previously used a chi, but wanted to see if a less expensive item could be just as good. I am disappointed because I had high hopes because of all the positive reviews. Sadly, this straightener doesn&#x27;t keep heated anymore and snags my hair at the ends. I have natural curly hair and so I straighten it every other day or so. I feel like this product can&#x27;t handle the usage. I wish I could return it. I will purchase another chi because those last for years and are a lot better on my hair. This product is cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. Spend more for a better valued product that is more kind to your hair.</li>
    <li> gets really hot and heats  up extremely fast Excellent buy</li>
    <li> After my daughter took over my CHI I started looking for a replacement. Have to admit I only took a chance after reading some of the reviews. This flat iron works very well. I like the digital thermometer. Just a great purchase for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I love it yes i will recommend this flat iron</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic straightener!  The high quality plates leave your hair shiny and silky all day long.  Unfortunately mine stopped working after 4 months, just wouldn&#x27;t turn on one day.  I did make sure to press the reset button as hard as I could, so I&#x27;m not sure what was wrong with it.  That was outside the 90 day return/exchange window, but Blue Novelties exchanged mine anyway with no arguments!  Excellent customer service from Blue Novelties!</li>
    <li> Great product w/ rapid ship time!</li>
    <li> So far really liking this flat iron. Heats up quickly, glides well thru my hair and makes it very easy to flip out the ends</li>
    <li> Really a great product.</li>
    <li> Snagged my hair to the point of breakage.  Controls are in an awkward position and difficult to read.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money....The only thing this straightner does is create frizz...My $15 walmart straightner is worlds better; I&#x27;ll stick with that one while I through this one into the trash can</li>
    <li> Great product, and the oil is phenomenal.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for the price.  My CHI started falling apart after many years and I purchased it because this product received such excellent reviews.  The only difference is that it does not have the same smooth pull through the hair as the Chi.  It is workable, however.  There is quite a price difference so if price is your main concern, this is certainly good enough.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!</li>
    <li> Ok product for the price. It does snag your hair (most reviews said it didn&#x27;t) and the cord constantly gets twisted.</li>
    <li> The strainer is perfectly fine for what I need it for. I hardly ever use one so I&#x27;m happy with the product. My hair does get stuck in the crevices though and sometimes pulls it if I put too much hair through the flat iron!</li>
    <li> Its a Great straightener in the market.Its better than what i used before like conair.&lt;br /&gt;Its faster and heat is effective and we can adjust temperature.</li>
    <li> Great product and price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product was less expensive here than if I drove to the store and is of great quality</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron and hair care product i&#x27;ve ever used. The argon oil is perfect! i&#x27;m an african american withouy a perm, so my hair is always on it&#x27;s worst behavior, until i stumbled upon this flat iron! I was originally going to buy a CHI (my cousin loves the CHI) but when i saw the price and reviews for this flat iron i went with the better deal. I am really happy i did! My Hair comes out straight and full of body, it even looks better than the times i visited a salon and got a wash and set. I&#x27;d certainly recommend this to african americans with thick, unruly hair. It has saved me from $150 sew ins, $200 hair bundles, and $50 wash and sets bi weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How i use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash, Condition, Blow dry hair using a round ventilated brush.&lt;br /&gt;2. Section hair into 7 sections (I work more efficiently with smaller sections)&lt;br /&gt;3. One section at a time, i apply a dime sized amount of hsi argon oil on it from roots to ends, then I use a skinny comb and make 1/2 inch parts and straighten with hsi flat iron  (410 degrees, my hair is really thick) and i only need to pass over hair once unless i parted too much hair.&lt;br /&gt;5. Do all sections.&lt;br /&gt;6. Voila! Super straight hair that my husband loves and prefers over my brazilian weaves :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*To maintain and care for my hair, I wrap it each night with a net and big satin scarf. It unwraps the next day perfectly so i only need to flat iron my whole head once a week, and mid week I&#x27;ll go over the middle of my hair (due to sweating in the summer). I wash my hair once every weekend and go through this routine. I&#x27;m really happy i can finally care for and do my hair myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to spend a ridiculous amount of money on sew in weaves, now i&#x27;m considering taking the money i used to use on that to get a new car :-)!!</li>
    <li> Arrived proptly. Only used once so far.</li>
    <li> Not the best, doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair that well. My hair is thick but very manageable and is already pretty straight. Extremely difficult to curl with this straightener. Overall I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase but it isn&#x27;t the worst</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Buy this you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I am definitely returning this. Do not buy this flat iron. It pulls your hair as you use it (which I&#x27;m sure is damaging to your hair as well as is uncomfortable) and while the temperature IS adjustable, the only temperature that is marked on the little dial is the hottest temp. So if you&#x27;re doing anything cooler than that, you will have no clue what temp it&#x27;s set on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS STRAIGHTENER!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Only available in black.  Works as expected.  No auto-shutoff timer (known that before purchase).</li>
    <li> I love this iron! For YEARS I have tried to give my hair nice big bouncy curls. I have curlings wands of all sorts, and hot rollers and nothing seems to work. I saw how many great reviews this product had and it was a good price considering how much it&#x27;s really worth so I gave it a shot. My hair looks gorgeous! I have long black thick Hispanic hair..very curly. And I was done within 45 minutes tops. My curls look better than ever before and the Argan oil makes it super smooth. ITS A MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> The flat iron is awesome,  I have told family and friends about your product</li>
    <li> Really great product and such a great price...highly recommend! Thanks</li>
    <li> Works great on my course, thick, curly hair! Just as good as any high dollar ones I have bought in the past. Love it!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my coarse hair very soft and shiney.</li>
    <li> I have to get another one soon because it keeps disappearing from my bathroom. (my daughter takes it all the time!) :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as shown in the image(s). Its sturdy, doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap. It heats up really fast and does not lose heat.</li>
    <li> The curling iron arrived quickly and works perfectly.  I was surprised that it came with such a nice travel/storage bag, the Argan oil and glove.  Although I would have liked instructions on how to use the glove (never have used one before), I am very pleased with the purchase - great value for the money - as good as those costing 2-3x as much.</li>
    <li> My wife says it is great. This was a mother´s day gift.</li>
    <li> I like the ceramic irons.  Haven&#x27;t had much time to use them often but the one time I did, it was ok.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Recipient seems to like it. Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I love love love these flat irons. My hair never been as straight and silly with any other flat irons. I will recommend these to everybody!</li>
    <li> came on time and product as expected</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!! Didn expect it to be so good, i seriously mean it! Other straighteners i would have to go through my hair several times and with this one it is a lot more time saving! Totally recommend! Worth the money you spend!</li>
    <li> So far I really like the product!</li>
    <li> So far, my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair texture.  My old Chi is hotter than this iron and it is over 8 years old.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I recommend this for everyone!! It is easy to use and it straightens my hair quickly!</li>
    <li> I am black with natural hair. This iron gets hot enough to make a difference to my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fast to use to make my hair slept very well and makes my hair wavy and beautiful I&#x27;d recommend using it and also charged me because I&#x27;ll buy him one of my friends buy them, and certainly excellent and fast in Tmujh or Ansiabath and also the results are not long sabotages Excellent Excellent</li>
    <li> It gets really hot I love it and the heat protecting glove</li>
    <li> These are amazing. I have thinning hair due to over processing with relaxers &amp; coloring over the years. After transitioning to natural hair the past 7 months it&#x27;s hard to not miss straight flat hair when your on the go days in a row. Well, I tried these on my now thickened new growth(African American), it flattens it perfectly. I lost my mind I went on a &amp;#34;Hey kids who wants their hair flattened?&amp;#34;, spree. Comes with a 5ml bottle of Argan Oil leave in treatment &amp; one safety heat glove. Also a coupon for future products. My guy niece came to visit in state &amp; tried it. She&#x27;s a fresh out of college sisterhood showcase hair type girl and she raved about these. We got her a pair for a going away present. She loves them, thanks me all the time. My brother&#x27;s fiancé used them &amp; only had loads of positive comments &amp; people she&#x27;s a hair stylist. Please take the time to invest in these. I used them at the highest temp(which I do not recommend for all hair types) 410F and it did not burn my hair at all. Side note my letters are starting to rub off due to the amount of oils or moisturizers I use whenevet I break them out. But oh so I can&#x27;t say it enough, oh so worth it.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot and works really good!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best straighteners I have ever used. Definately in the top 3.  It is comparable to a CHI for less than half the price plus the free argan oil.  It leaves my hair more smooth than a CHI because the plates are a different material but leave my hair just as straight. You can make waves, curls, volume, or go totally straight with this tool.  I absolutely love it.  After reading the reviews here I bought it skeptically hoping for good results and the day after recieving it in th email I returned my CHI I had bought a week prior and started telling everyone about this straightener! I recomend it to anyone in search of a good quality good price tool.  I have thick, wavy, course hair and it gets my hair straight in about 15 minutes.  Must buy!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I bought it to take to Europe. It is big and not light. I travel light. Now I find that I need an adapter in Europe. Thinking about returning it and getting a smaller, lighter travel iron.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS FLAT IRON. My hair has never been more happy. I love the items it comes with as well. The sleeve for the flat iron is perfect and protects it from any cosmetic damages. Best product ever</li>
    <li> Love my straightener! Great reasonable price for it and it heats up quick.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works well, I have medium length wavy hair that gets frizzy easy.&lt;br /&gt;This iron keeps it straight all day&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife as a gift.  She had gone through several other brands and always found something she didn&#x27;t like with them and stopped using them.  She&#x27;s used this one regularly (not every day, but once a week or so perhaps ... she says its not good to use something like this too often) for over a year and hasn&#x27;t complained yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to do its job and is of good quality.</li>
    <li> I like the different temperature control. It does take a little longer to heat up than my last one, but not much, and considering it was 1/2 the price. It is well worth it. All the accessories that come with it are very nice quality. It was also shipped very fast. I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> This is the worst straightener I have ever owned. I purchased it because it had the highest ratings on Amazon... I can&#x27;t imagine why. At the highest temperature (400 degrees) I was able to put my finger on it, obviously showing that it does not get up to 400 degrees. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have debated whether or not to get a straightener for a long time, and I could not be more agreeably surprised at how nice my hair looks with this particular one.</li>
    <li> I love this one and the oil that comes with it smells great</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! I love the price even more.</li>
    <li> For the life of me I don&#x27;t understand all the five star reviews! I was ready to fall in love with this item, after reading that it&#x27;s better than the Chi irons. I used to only use Chi and then switched to a Remington $15 iron, then I saw this one on Amazon for a great price and thought I&#x27;d try it out. It is a piece of JUNK. Do not waste your money. This product is absolutely nothing like a Chi iron. It snagged my hair and tore it out of my head. Unbelievable! Thank you Amazon for your quick and easy return policy. I&#x27;m shipping mine back immediately and going back to my $15 Remington iron.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Wonderful service</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Great service</li>
    <li> Sleek styling and quick heat-up, nice sample of argan oil too!</li>
    <li> The product came in on time and is just what I expected.  I would definitely give it  a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter ( 20 something), who has curly hair, she loves it. She said this is the best one she has used, it works fast and her hair looks terrific.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Cousin and she totally loved it. I am definitely going to buy one for myself soon. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it..what used to take me over an hour to straighten my hair only takes me 20 minutes at most...I have super thick hair and love this straightener!</li>
    <li> Works great! I love love love this small but gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! It leaves my hair feeling soft after each use even if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair that day. It heats up quickly and cools down pretty quick. It literally takes me about 5 minutes to straighten all my hair. I will definitely stick with this.</li>
    <li> Great product. Heats up very quickly and does a good job - does not leave kinks in your hair like some straighteners! Also has a nice, light feel.</li>
    <li> Like my Sedu better but for the money, it does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Arrived in 3 days with free shipping. Paid about $40. So worth it. Works great.</li>
    <li> Received this product super quick and exactly as specified.  The argon oil is very light and does not make my hair feel oily in the least bit.  I&#x27;m very happy with this flat iron and I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested in purchasing one.</li>
    <li> Works even better than the previous one I had.</li>
    <li> Just as good as my friend&#x27;s Chi.</li>
    <li> I had issues with the first straighter and they were super helpful. They emailed me right away and exchanged my product. I love my straightener!</li>
    <li> I love it so far just used it once(Just got it)...but I&#x27;m Loving it!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and was a great purchase. I would recommend thus to anyone looking for quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Amazing customer service and product.  I happened to receive a defective product that kept changing temperatures and cooling down, making it almost impossible to straighten. So at first I was disappointed. But I received an email from the seller asking my satisfaction,  so I emailed them stating my disappointment. They were so friendly stating that the item must be defected and they will send me a new one. I received the new one in just a few days and it working amazing! Kept a steady temperature and straightened my thick course hair in minutes! I love this flat iron and already recommended this product to others! Amazing customer service!  Will buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a Chi that had started to malfunction. Tried using it once, the plates didnt float and i was pinching hair more than straightening it.  this definitely got returned.</li>
    <li> I order this product a while ago. And I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It straightens your hair quick and easily and leaves your hair feeling super soft. And I couldn&#x27;t beat the price. If it&#x27;s on sale don&#x27;t pass it up. 😃😃</li>
    <li> I have no now gone through two of the exact same straighteners in two months. Ceramic plate broke again! I do not recommend this product. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a bad hair straightener, but it is also not at all comparable to a CHI like a lot of folks have said. In the past 12 years I have used a variety of straighteners for my thick wavy hair and have never found a one that compares to a CHI.  I think this item would be wonderful for someone with thinner hair or someone who just needs it for touch-ups, but not for someone who is trying to turn a head of curly/wavy hair into straight hair.  I would say it took me about 2x the amount of time for me to straighten my hair with this as with my 5 year old CHI (which I was trying to retire for this straightener because it doesn&#x27;t run as hot as it used to).  If you have thick wavy/curly hair, put the 40$ you would have spent on this somewhere safe and add to it here and there to make the investment towards the CHI, it&#x27;s really your best option.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think is professional,I straight my hair many many times to get what I want ,knowing that I have straight hair !!!</li>
    <li> very good benefit/price ratio excellent deal good product. Design and quality are great, so far very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought mine and it does a wonderful job straightening , but I have natural curly hair &amp; it leaves it looking like straw! So I have wasted my money on yet another flat iron!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and gets hot. My teen girls and I have very thick hair so the high, even heat works well. And love the oil!</li>
    <li> I thought I liked my old flat iron but I LOVE this one. It heats up quickly, let&#x27;s you know when it&#x27;s ready to use, and straightens my hair quickly. I am beyond pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I happened upon this flat iron after Googling \\&quot;Top reviewed flat irons\\&quot; online.  After reading the reviews for it on several websites, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have thick, frizzy, naturally curly hair. It&#x27;s a REAL JOB getting it to NOT look frizzy after using ANY flat iron or hair care products.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t BELIEVE the SUPERB job this flat iron did on my hair!  It was INCREDIBLE!  And, at just a fraction of the cost for what I paid for my CHI, or Babyliss flat irons!  Also, as other reviewers have stated it DOES take only one stroke through my hair layers to get them straight!(Other curling irons would take me two or three strokes).&lt;br /&gt;I also LOVE the ridges on the handle.  It allows me to get a better grip on the handle, thus providing additional \\&quot;no burn\\&quot; safety while using it. I like the argon oil sample that came with it, however, because it&#x27;s so difficult to find products that work with my hair I stuck with my Nexxus Frizz Defy styling cream before using the flat iron, and Nexxus Frizz Defy hair spray after use.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is - Give this flat iron a try!  I&#x27;m SURE GLAD I did!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product. It was delivered in a timely and works excellent on my hair. I would definatly purchase items from this brand again.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I  was  excited</li>
    <li> i love this product. i&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months ago. and it works amazing expect if i turn it off it doesn&#x27;t turn off and it stays on and i have to unplug it every time i use it.</li>
    <li> Good for money, meet my wife&#x27;s expectations. She is using it every week and it works good, I recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been using an Ion hair straignener for probably about 6 years.  I was long overdue for a new one.  I did not realize how nice it would be time-wise to purchase a new one.  This edition comes with gloves that I have never used, I could see myself putting them on if my hair were damp when I used the straightener.  The argan oil that comes with it makes my hair a little greasy looking even though my hair is dry, it is not just the brand, I have tried the Josie Miran argan oil and it does the same.  It really does do a great job and is efficient.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and product is outstanding</li>
    <li> Works great! Does not get as hot as my older flat irons, but still works as well. Love the oil that comes with it. Makes my ends behave better.</li>
    <li> Easy to use for first time users.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons that I have had over the years. My hair is comes out beautifully after using it. I have long hair and because the iron&#x27;s plate is about an inch wide, it takes quite a long time to get through the process of straightening and/or curling it. So, I would like to see this iron made with a wider plate for longer hair, 2 inches would be nice. That would also help produce wider curls, too. Overall, it is a great tool and a great value!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener</li>
    <li> This flat iron feels cheaply made when in use. It does not do a good job of straightening think curly hair. I have to go over my hair 5 or 6 ones to get it straight. I&#x27;ve purchased many flat irons online before, but I&#x27;m highly disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> My teen has very thick, long hair and it does the job. It doesn&#x27;t create a lot of steam and it doesn&#x27;t maintain it&#x27;s heat setting very well. I know people that own it and love it. Maybe we just got a bad one. For the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I have gotten my daughter a expensive $200 flat iron that she droped and broke. So this time I try this one. She loves it more. It leaves layers in her hair. Before it was to straight.</li>
    <li> I loved it!! I had the chi and the HSI is way better specially the price!! Also i loved the oil they sent me free!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and bought thiis straightener because i can use it at a lower temperature than most others. I have only used it once so far but am very impressed, even the packaging is beautiful. It works great and I love the oil that came with it, it left my hair looking smooth and shiny.. Haven&#x27;t figured out what the glove is for though</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience with straighteners, but from the few that I&#x27;ve tried this is by far the best.  It is smooth and easy to use.  I can quickly curl and add body to my very fine, limp hair.  It feels very high end, but for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my new product, especially after the great reviews I read before ordering. The package was delivered as promised and the appearance of the packaging and the items in the box were nice. I used it a few times now and it pulls my hair every time! I have tried playing with different temperature levels, tried using product, not using product, etc. but I am very disappointed in how it breaks and pulls.  I cannot continue to use this as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener i have ever owned. I have really thick hair so its not easy to find a straightener that i can use and be done within 20 minutes, but with this HSI i can have it all done within like 5 to 10 minutes. It heats up really quick and it gets really hot. i absolutely love it and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good reliable straightener.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron but I was upset when I opened the package and the HGI Argon oil sample had leaked all over the inside. Luckily there was no damage to the iron.</li>
    <li> When I first received this straightener, I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed even though I had been very excited to get it since my last straightener finally broke. The first few times I used it, it straightened my hair pretty well, but it got frizzy again not long after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a new hair dryer, have gotten my split ends trimmed and have started really giving my hair the attention it needs. Since then, the straightener works far better and does a great job! I have very thick, wavy hair and I can straighten it so quickly now. My hair still gets a little frizzy after a while, but it&#x27;s a great straightener. And it comes with a heat glove, a cute heat protective bag to put the straightener in and a free sample of argan oil (which I love) so it&#x27;s a great bonus!</li>
    <li> This Was An Flat Irin I Heard On The Top 10 Flat iron List on google. I checked the prices and said they were pretty steep. I came on amazon and searched for it and found it at Blue Novelties. These flat irons have the temperature control dial that is well need for different textures of hair, also it came with a heat resistant pouch to store it in after use. Best yet it came with a hot glove for us beginners that hates hot hair. This is a amazing product I been a amazon user for atleast 2 years now. And must say its the best thing I ordered by far! Cudos to the company!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Love the handle and the swivel cord.  Ceramic plates work great.  This flat iron works well on my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased based on reviews and low price as a backup to my digital wet-dry CHI iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to replace my CHI! A little heavier in weight with less options, but left great results on my hair. Was a steal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the sample oil leaked during transit and got all over the storage pouch. Sent a MSG to the seller in hopes they will resolve issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron as a Christmas present for my daughter.  I read the reviews and it sounded like a great product.  Unfortunately, she did not use for 3 months and when she tried to use for the first time it did not work. I&#x27;m past the return period and now it looks like I have to pay another $19.95 for shipping and handling to replace.  I&#x27;ve contacted the manufacturer so we will see how they handle this.  Right now I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair. My old flat iron has an extra long plate (I realize this now after doing research). After using it for a few years I&#x27;ve gotten spoiled by getting my hair flattened pretty quickly with it. The HSI is a nice iron, and very high quality. But the plate is really small (1 inch) and I foundd it took me a whole lot longer to straighten my hair. I&#x27;m torn if I should keep it anyway or return it and keep looking for something that&#x27;ll afford me more time with my kids than standing in the bathroom flattening my hair!! Thus, I give it 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> hate this! doesn&#x27;t hold heat!! I wouldn&#x27;t ever pay more than $40 definitely not worth $200!! love the hair dryer; that&#x27;s why I bought this!!</li>
    <li> i got the wrong product , instead of 3rd generation one i got the non 3rd generation one even though i paid double for the 3rd generation one. I have put for return, i hope i get back my money soon and don&#x27;t have to end up paying return cost.</li>
    <li> After my faithful straightener of 5+ years gave out I started looking for a new one.  I had always heard good things about chi so I was going to go with that, but then I found the HSI.  After reading through reviews and how many found it comparable to chi I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  It heats up quickly, it straightens with the first stroke, and I can curl nicely with it too.  I would definitely recommend and would purchase another one.  Love my HSI straightener.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this flat iron, it heats up very quickly and works great even on the highest setting, without any hot smell or burning of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also like how the cord is so long and rotates! No tangled cord!&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product and does as well or better than more pricey flat irons.</li>
    <li> Works very well, even on a low heat setting. Love this and have already recommended to others.</li>
    <li> I buy this flat iron and for the price I was really scary doesn&#x27;t do what I need... But after reading all the comment I was convinced that this wat the iron for me. The onlye thing I didn&#x27;t like is that doesn&#x27;t go off automatic or sometimes heats a lot and other not to much althoug is on the higher temperature. Beside that problem, I&#x27;m totally in love with it, made my work so much easy leave my hair shine and manageable. Well I love if I can change my review stars, I buy this a months ago and recently start to get off... It&#x27;s sad because it&#x27;s a really well done flat iron. But now I have to get a new one...</li>
    <li> This straighter did not get hot at all!  The LED on mine keep flashing from green to red to off and green again and so on.  It would not straighten my hair had to go over a small piece over and over again.  It is some what heavy compared to most irons.  The nob to control heat is located in the inside of handles along with the power button.  Not a good location!  The only good thing about this is the trial size oil that comes with it.  Not good at all!  In this case you do get what you pay for! (nothing good)</li>
    <li> The straightener works great and I love the glove and argan oil it comes with. It heats up quickly and my hair feels so soft and silky that I can&#x27;t help but run my fingers through my hair every 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair and have tried several flat irons and this is the first one I am very satisfied with. I have also purchased the HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER which I use a few drops of to soften my hair before hand.  After using the flat iron It then leaves my hair looking nice and straight and feeling/looking silky and healthy.  I also like the fact that it is global 110V-220V so I am able to use it when I&#x27;m in Europe as-well.. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For $39.99 I feel like I got an absolute bargain. It&#x27;s sturdy, heats up fast, and I love the way my hair feels after I use it (combined with the Argon oil sample). I also appreciate the light that turns from red to green when its ready! :)</li>
    <li> I am so satisfied with my new straightener; it is all they advertised it to be and more. It contained a glove and also a sample of a silk hair product to use as well.  The straightener also came with a soft case.  Very pleased. Well worth your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and so far it&#x27;s great! I have thick wavy hair and it made my hair smooth and perfectly straight.</li>
    <li> After diligent research, this was the best straightener I could find under $100 and my girlfriend loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t describe using it from personal experience but I have heard no complaints and nothing but good things about it.</li>
    <li> not hot enough, but a decent 410 degree iron.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth keeping, but it&#x27;s not what I expected. I still have to purchase a flatiron.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month and it works just as well even just the same as better as my broken down Chi. After spending $ on a chi and it flourishing after the occasional usage of 6 years, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that much on a flat iron again if I rarely use it now with my curling wand. I read the reviews on this nifty thing and trusted the reviewers. I love it. It&#x27;s made well, heats instantly and does what it serves. i have immensely thick hair and I was able to straighten my hair quickly. Highly recommend to those chi users contemplating whether to convert to HSI.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this flat iron</li>
    <li> This product straightened my hair well but the knob to set temp. Has no marking or indicator on it and it turns very easily...i never know what temp it is at ...not even a high or low indicator so I wing it when i use it.it heats up quickly .i will most likely keep it to avoid hassle of return but i think something as importantnas the temp button on such an item should have been thought out and implemented.</li>
    <li> I really love this Straightener!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have really long hair and I am very affraid to brake them... But with this Straightener it&#x27;s easy and save.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t do it often... and when than I also do curls... and I am satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;But I only baught it because of the low price on black friday ;D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;d like to write the review, coz I really satisfy with the product. I bought the straightener for my daughter actually she asked me to buy another one but&lt;br /&gt;I just decided to try this one. After trying to use the first time, my daughter and me both love it, it&#x27;s very easy to use and heat up very fast, the temperature control button&lt;br /&gt;is also good for different types of hair. Strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this straightening iron was AMAZING the first couple weeks I used it.  now it gets super hot but it won&#x27;t straighten my hair AT ALL!!!!  i don&#x27;t get it.  nothing has changed besides the fact that the iron is now over a month used.  it just isn&#x27;t doing the amazing job it 1st did.  thinking about going back to my conair!!!  i absolutely LOVE the oil it came with, though!  i ordered another bottle almost immediately.  lol.</li>
    <li> For having a lot of great reviews, this straightener did not live up to my expectations. I will say besides the great price, it nicely packaged with the argan oil, heat protectant glove, and a nice carrying case. However, each time I plugged it in, I had to push the reset button. Not a big deal, but seems unnecessary when I have other similar plugs for hair products and this is never an issue. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the grip, it wasn&#x27;t very comfortable to hold for even a short time. Most importantly, when I used it, it tugged at individual hairs like no other flat iron I have used. Also, the frizz reduction did not happen. Unfortunately for me, this one was a bust.</li>
    <li> The shipping for this product was fantastic. It came very quickly in the original packaging as stated. It even had a sample of argan oil and a glove for handling. I have not had to use the glove though as the handle of the iron does not get too hot to handle. I like how you can use the dial to adjust the temp. It does pull the hair a little, but my CHI iron did too...maybe its the way I&#x27;m using it. Anyway, this replaced a 5-6 yr old CHI and I absolutely love it, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This product as other reviewers have mentioned is amazing. It&#x27;s size makes it very convenient to travel with. The price paid for the quality of the product is exceptional. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that! The package arrived as expected. I would highly recommend purchasing this amazing product if you were on the fence about it before. You definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed. It gets the job done w/ ease. Thank you blue novelties and amazon!</li>
    <li> For the most part we are happy with the HSI flat iron.  It does tend to pull my hair which s short and also my daughter&#x27;s who has very long, thick and wavy hair.  That is a bit disappointing.  But other than that it is great.  They were super fast in delivery.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and smooth results from one run through each section.  I bought this for a lower price than many cheaper brand flat irons and am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I can tell a huge difference in the way my hair feels after I use the flat iron and the Argon Oil as well! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted a CHI but when I found this on Amazon, I knew she would love it and I was right. Adjustable temp control and sturdy. Great product.</li>
    <li> I received my flat iron about five days after I ordered and I am in LOVE with it! This flat iron is so awesome. It heats up quickly and I&#x27;m done with my hair in half the time that it took with my old one. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I dont love it, I bought it based on Amazon reporting it as a top seller, although I initially planned on buying the bellezza which is sold at the mall. It only goes up to 400 degrees which poses a problem for my African American daughter with kinky hair. If your hair is a fine or medium texture it should be fine, but I wouldnt suggest it for a more coarse texture. Also you have to use the argan oil for it to really work. Not really what I was expecting</li>
    <li> The iron heats up really good but it pulls the hair badly, i don&#x27;t recommend this iron..</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing!  I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve purchased a few brands $250+ range, and this was the best one I&#x27;ve ever had!  I have curly ethnic hair that I usually use 2-3 straightening balms in a sitting, blow drier, expensive flat iron, hair spray, then edge balm.  And for special occasions I still had to go to a salon.  With this flat iron I only need dry hair!  My stubbornly curly hair can be made bone flat and even survive humidity somehow.  I have salon looking hair at home in less time and whenever I want it!  The only down side is it gets so straight my hair looks thinner, so I just run it through my hair faster to leave volume.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the price, the time it took to get to me and the product it self. it works awesome plus comes with a nice bag and a glove, plus you can register it so you have a lifetime warranty.</li>
    <li> I like my chi better its kinda hard on the hair an dose pole it.it dose get the job done but I would go with a chi if u want amazing.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought mine and have used it a handful of times. I absolutely love it. Not only does it straighten my hair but it will also make curls/wavy hair after I&#x27;ve straightened it something I was never able to do with my previous straightener (different brand)</li>
    <li> great quality product.  Great price for such a nice iron.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife as birthday present.&lt;br /&gt;she like a lot when she see it first. after using once she replied when I asked how do you like it. she said, its okay.........&lt;br /&gt;hmmmmm..</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife as a gift. She always wanted flat iron, but never wanted to pay big bucks. I decided to try it,and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It makes her hair look great and feel light as air.  She liked it so much that she got one for her sister.  Don&#x27;t waste tons of money, this product works great!</li>
    <li> Great for thin hair.  Not the best for thick, curly hair. (It pulls on curly hair)</li>
    <li> I opted for the knob instead of digital display. This flat iron is my new favorite hair tool. Very easy to use. Recommend letting it cool and store in bag provided to protect heating plates. Got it at a great price, too. I would shop with this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have had a Chi for the last 6 years and was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. Using the HSI for the past 3 weeks and am not impressed at all.&lt;br /&gt;It takes longer to heat up and I have to turn it up to the max to get any results.</li>
    <li> My new fav!! My hair is very thick &amp; it gets my hair bone straight in no time..Very nice packaging comes in a cute little satin bag and comes with a glove.. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if u buy this product:)</li>
    <li> I really like the HSI flat iron, it&#x27;s easy to use,really tames my frizzy hair. I am very pleased with it. The argan oil is great to, it smells wonderful and makes my hair feel silky. I went to the HSI website and watched the tutorial videos they were a great help</li>
    <li> So far so good. The end is not too hot to touch like my last straightener. I wish I could find one that shuts off automatically after an hour. I always think I am going to leave it on and burn down the house. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the temp control. Hard to figure out since it is a dial and not digital. Once you get it right it&#x27;s fine. Heats up really fast, probably a minute or so. Seems like a high quality product.</li>
    <li> I am super impressed with this flat iron. I have a Chi which is more expensive and doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as this HSI flat iron (it&#x27;s also a lot more expensive). You cannot go wrong with this one. Variable temperature settings will enable you to select the perfect temperature for your hair. The plates are super smooth and don&#x27;t snag your hair. It comes with a small bottle of argan oil to try out and I would highly recommend using that oil with your straightener for super shiny results. Overall, totally pleased with this product. Great speedy delivery. Lovely packaging and dual voltage!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron. Not only the cost but the performance is above and beyond! I&#x27;ll never buy another CHI again. This works great on natural hair</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is amazing!!  I needed a new one when the ceramic coating started flaking off my previous one, and my hair stylist recommended getting one with solid ceramic plates rather than a coating, that it would last longer, but to be prepared to spend $100 or so.  Well, not only does this product work GREAT, it only cost $40!!  It has cut my styling time in half because my hair is straight on the first pass, and I have thick wavy hair.  I cannot recommend this iron enough!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after reading reviews on it and since it was on sale it was a bonus! I am EXTREMELY HAPPY! It heats up quickly and works great! So glad I did not spend money on a Chi!</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before purchasing this flat iron by HSI and I am very pleased with this item and would recommend to others. The temperature control was very important for me as I use it on my protective hair units and can use this flat iron without worry that I am going to burn the synthetic hair. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> It is a little small for an iron, but it does everything that it promises and we are glad we bought it. My wife was hesitant at first but then grew to love it and loves the control flexibility that it has and how good it works on her hair.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before purchasing this.  It straitened my hair fast; I was impressed.  It also made my hair super soft!  The only thing I wish was that when I ordered this product, that they would&#x27;ve had the digital model available.  Also, I wish that the temperature adjustment was on the outside.  Other than that, I love this product!</li>
    <li> This straightening iron is the worst takes forever to heat up and is crooked breaks hair do not waste your money I am returning mine.</li>
    <li> Great straightening iron. Straightens my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a 16-ounce jar of the HSI Professional Hair Mask with Argon Oil, and I am so glad I did!  The quality ingredients in this hair formula are amazing.  Following the easy-to-apply directions, within minutes my hair was transformed into a beautiful resilient sheen that I haven&#x27;t experienced in years.  It&#x27;s now manageable and full of new life.  I even tried it on my beard, and it works great for that as well.  It is the perfect complement to the HSI Professional Leave-In Hair Treatment with Argan Oil, with great results.  I would highly recommend this product for men and women alike.  About the time I didn&#x27;t think there could be a better product, and then this new Hair Mask comes on the market and blows me right out of my saddle.  Praises to HSI Professional products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my own fault really. I&#x27;ve never looked to get a quality flat-iron before so I had no idea what could have been (other than noticing how much better my hair looks when my hair stylist takes care of it). My only defense is that I tend to be stingy when it comes to certain things until I&#x27;m reminded about how much cheaper it is in the long run to buy a quality product. I am incredibly pleased with this flat-iron. It is sturdy, heats up quickly, and the results are smooth silky hair. It comes with this satiny storage bag which I&#x27;m not entirely sure of the purpose other than wanting to make TSA think you&#x27;re fancy when traveling. It&#x27;s one of those finishing touches that I appreciate even if I&#x27;m not really seeing the practicality of it. ...but I digress. This flat-iron is wonderful. I highly recommend. My main advice is two-fold: Ensure you use some kind of product designed to protect your hair when applying heat. The remainder of that advice is to know your hair type so that you use the appropriate level of heat. Curly, coarse hair requires a higher setting. Fine hair, even if it is somewhat wavy, should be styled at a much lower level.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron recently and I&#x27;m having the same problem as a few other buyers who have reviewed the iron. When I turn my iron on, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot quickly or hardly hot at all. I was very excited to give this iron a go since there were such great reviews but recently I think a bad batch of irons went out because I&#x27;m very disappointed with mine. I&#x27;ve tried turning it all the way hot and I still can&#x27;t seem to get the look I desire because I just can&#x27;t seem to get the iron hot enough to function correctly.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this flat iron! After reading all the reviews I thought it would be a good choice but it wasn&#x27;t. My hair was curly I tried straightened it and it would not make it straight (even with the control all the way up). I gave it a try for almost a month and the results were very poor. I returned it and going to try the chi or amika.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The price was unbelievable. Works better than any other flat iron I have had.  The extras were nice too.</li>
    <li> I thought for 2 days before I ordered this product because it seemed to good to be true for the price, but I decided to order because I really wanted it. It only took 4 days for it to get to me in the mail and I was not disappointed. I love the flat iron and it works perfect for me. I have very fine hair and it does not burn it.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I am lazy so i rarely use it, but when I have the time, I use matrix sleek shampoo and conditioner, a teeny bit of argan oil (included with this straightener) and I blow dry with a round brush. next, I use the straightener. I have long hair, down past my bra strap in the back and it&#x27;s cut into long layers and this really sleeks it up nicely. I love the pouch it comes in and it&#x27;s very easy to use--my only complaint would be that the darn heat control is in a hard to reach spot-you really gotta jam your fingers in there to turn the little wheel. other than that, it&#x27;s just as good, maybe better than most irons out there. Good packaging and shipping as well. positive shopping experience all around.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this straightener.  She is able to get her hair straight in about half the time it used to take her.  Unfortunately, after about 6 months, it just stopped working.  I contacted Blue Novelties customer service and within a couple of emails, a brand new replacement was on the way.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve had such a good experience dealing with custom service.  Thank you guys so much for the wonderful product and for the terrific support!</li>
    <li> NO AUTO SHUT OFF. Are you kidding me. Decent straightener but not as good or even comparable to a $150 ghd. Save your $40 and put it towards a ghd.</li>
    <li> This product was a lifesaver at a perfect price. I had my favorite salon grade straightener die on me after about 6 or 7 years so I was on a desperate search for another salon grade one at a reasonable price. That was a tough search. I was pleased when I stumbled upon this one. I&#x27;m not sure it gets as hot as my old one but I don&#x27;t think it lacks much. For the price, it is better than I expected. The real test will be to see if it lasts as long as my old one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the right quality for the cost. It straightens well but pulls on your hair. It doesn&#x27;t curl very well either.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love love loved it!!! It&#x27;s awesome!! Exactly what I expected!!!</li>
    <li> meh - not great, i bought it to curl my hard but it wasnt hot enough to do much, my hair would get snagged onto it too.</li>
    <li> It does its job exactly as described in the description. I am glad that I made a good choice</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s only been a few months and already my light isn&#x27;t turning green.  It still heats up though so it&#x27;s just a default with the light.</li>
    <li> Does what it is intended to do--very well.  Careful, it gets really hot.</li>
    <li> Great for the price... Very happy!</li>
    <li> It has been several months since I received my new  flat iron. I was reluctant to buy this at first because I was sold on the Chi products, but because of all of the great reviews, I figured I really had nothing to lose, and might save a bundle of money. I was not disappointed at all. It works as good as a Chi, and actually is easier to handle. Who says you have to spend a bucket load of money to get a great product? You don&#x27;t in this case. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you give it a try.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my nice she loves it</li>
    <li> This is in amazing product and I will buy more from here soon</li>
    <li> Love it. No complains</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype over this straightener. It works, I guess. It doesn&#x27;t have an auto turn-off, which is a big pain. It has a spring/squeak sound when you use it -- very annoying. Other than that, it&#x27;s just a straightener. It&#x27;s gets hot, it works, and that&#x27;s it. Nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant on getting a small flat iron because I have always used wide plates. This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned, it works as fast and my large plated flat irons and makes my hair look so nice and shiny afterwards. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there is no timer and it does not automatically shut off; when you&#x27;re as irresponsible as me that is something you definitely need.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I had high expectations of this flat iron.  After minimal use over the past three months I determined it really did not work that well.  The iron did not seem to heat up hot enough despite the temperature control buttoms.  I contacted the seller due to the 12 month manufacturers warranty.  The seller provides a 30 day return policy.  As a courtesy the seller sent me out a new flat iron.  The flat iron I received was in an already opened box that was actually missing a piece of the box.  It appeared to be used and damaged.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Had it for over a year now. Still in EXCELLENT condition!</li>
    <li> Not as great as my old Chi, but for the price I definitely can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> Best value for the price!</li>
    <li> Love it. I have thick hair that most hair straighteners don&#x27;t work on. This works amazing. .. Just wish it was a tad bigger</li>
    <li> Great price.  Great product.  Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product over delivered-it is the best hair iron I have ever used or seen.  I am thinking of buying another for the future!  Excellent company-fast delivery !</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly for about a year, then just stopped heating up.....have no idea why.</li>
    <li> I like the flat iron and I am using it daily and it won&#x27;t hurt my hair, I can create any style that I want. Keeps my hair looks neat and charming.&lt;br /&gt;I like it especially for travel; it is a  good size that I can put in my suitcase and  it won&#x27;t take up so much room.  This is a great tool for the hair. I love it and I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I wish it got a little hotter, but I don&#x27;t think they sell flatirons that heat up over 450.</li>
    <li> Died suddenly after 10 months of use. Too late to return it. I bought this after my Chi died after 6 years. Not sure which to try next..Sedu or go back to Chi because the cheaper versions just don&#x27;t last!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase.  This is an amazing flat iron, it&#x27;s better than the ones I&#x27;ve had that were triple the price</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried to make my color treated hair look smooth and silky with no luck. Then one day my hairdresser used a flat iron on it. Wow, what a difference. Not only was it smooth and silky but it stayed that way for 3 days! No muss, no fuss. When I asked her what brand she suggested, she said to get a HSI. It was priced reasonably, was easy to use- first try, and I no longer thought the only answer was to cut more off. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality, without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning it. This flatiron made my hair feel stiff and really dry. I&#x27;ll stick with my Ion!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener I have ever used!  I bought this straightener as a back up last year when they went on sale due to compliments I had heard about this flat iron.  I finally used it recently and it does GREAT!  Highly recommend this flat iron to anyone!  Also has swivel cord!  VERY NICE!!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Heats up quickly and does a great job on hair. Great price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this 2 months ago but did not start using it until a couple weeks ago.  I had been using my sister&#x27;s &#x27;cheaper&#x27; but better straightener until she moved out so I started using this one.  This product does not straighten well.  I purchased it thinking it would be a superior product (because of the reviews and premium price) but this is not the case.  Maybe I got a defective one?  It just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough (and yes, I put it at the max heat) for my hair to straighten properly.  Unfortunately there is only a 30 days return policy so I can&#x27;t return this from Amazon :(</li>
    <li> I was so excited finding an affordable straightener for this price with the quality reviews it had. I do like the product itself, my hair sometimes get caught between the ceramic plate and the outer piece of the wand which can be painful and annoying. It also turns off after a certain amount of time which is frustrating because it cools fast and has nearly no effect on my hair so I have to turn it back on and wait for it to heat up again which thankfully is very quick. It is a little to thin for my taste when it comes to curling my hair but I use it every single day and it has definitely done its job effectively.</li>
    <li> I love this better than my old Chi and this was 1/3 of the price!</li>
    <li> The product met all my expectations</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it!!! heats up quickly, and does not damage her hair like other straighteners did.</li>
    <li> I love my HSI professional flat iron! I had bought a chia flat iron and tried it out for the first time. It worked great but was soooo expensive. After reading the reviews about the HSI professional I thought I&#x27;d give it a try as well. It was half the price as the chia. It works great as well and actually see no difference between the two. I returned the chia and keeping the HSI product. Not only that but recommended it to my family and friends. I&#x27;m sold! Thanks HSI!</li>
    <li> Great product and service. Arrived on day it was suppose too.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and superb product.  Love my hair straightener!</li>
    <li> Good  product that does a great job on my hair here in humid south Florida. The bonus of argon oil was nice too. Product came quicker than I thought  and price was unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Update 4/2017: my original flat iron failed to continue heating up after 2.5 years. So I purchased two new ones - a generation 1 for my travel bag and a generation 2 for home. Both came in the exact same box, look and function the same so not sure why I spent the money for a generation 2. One came in a bag, see photo, which lead me to believe maybe it was refurbished? Posting didn&#x27;t lead me to believe that is what I was getting so that is super upsetting. BUT even more upsetting is that same one that came in the bag DIDNT WORK! Would not heat up, indicator light never came on. I&#x27;m not even sure which one it is since they look the same to even try and return it. Will not be ordering again and debating returning both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review 2014: Third time I have ordered this and still love it - this time as a gift for my mom who keeps using mine and loves it! (Second time was because I dropped and broke the first one :( ) I highly recommend! Heats fast, straightens perfectly!</li>
    <li> Love it! And the price is great</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener! Heats up super fast and works really well. Very satisfied with the price too. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This straightener is just what I needed! I have relatively straight hair to begin with, so I just use it for touch-ups in the morning. It heats up very quickly and makes my hair look very smooth! I would definitely recommend for someone looking for a good straightener at a good price. I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for someone with wavy/ curly hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful iron! Just what I was after! Can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Worse iron ever! It does not stay hot after a few minutes. Not worth your money.</li>
    <li> This is the best, safest and most versatile flat iron/curling iron I have ever seen! The price is reasonable, the quality is excellent and the packaging and service were superior! I would definitely order from this company again--they do an excellent job of marketing and they deliver!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. I have used a CHi for many years for way more money/ I just got back from paris and London and it worked well in both places (can&#x27;t say the same thing for the hairdryer I bought from someone else that didn&#x27;t work in paris at all). Great product, great customer service and great company. I highly recommend it and them!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with it and can&#x27;t believe the price!</li>
    <li> it makes my hair feel better than it did before I straightened it</li>
    <li> This flat iron is comparable to the much more expensive versions currently on the market. The ceramic tourmaline plates glide through your hair, leaving it feeling very silky. The heat setting is easy to use, and so is the on/off switch. The flat iron does not take very long to reach the desired heat level. The flat iron comes in a nice black pouch, with a heat protection glove, and a sample size of Argan oil. I have not actually used the glove. The box is perfect to store the iron in, when not in use. This flat iron is great value for money, does an excellent good job at straightening my curly hair, and functions and looks a lot more expensive.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smooth hair and heats up quickly! Comes with a nice little carry bag for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love this, works just as well as a CHI, minus the high price!</li>
    <li> Great product, I really like how smooth it makes my hair. I have not missed my chi!</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron April 2012 and this is October 2014 and it is still doing a great job on my wavy hair.  I will definitely buy another one this brand when/if this one goes out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a flat iron, but I&#x27;m sure glad I bought this one as my first one.  It&#x27;s so easy to use.  I have wavy hair so it doesn&#x27;t take much to straighten it, but my mom&#x27;s hair is very curly and it worked very well for her, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned may flat irons. Each time a niece visits, one goes missing. And a niece was just visiting, so I had to buy a new one. I&#x27;m very bad at remembering previous brands I&#x27;ve used, but I always purchase flat irons that are not less than $100 for quality reasons. I have to say this product is my least favorite. It doesn&#x27;t get hot fast and feels heavier than my last ones.</li>
    <li> I dont write reviews but as a lady who has tried so many flat irons I need to let you all know this one is the best and leave my hair so shiny.</li>
    <li> Love it..even for a novice user it was easy to use..</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations, and the price is awesome</li>
    <li> delivered promptly as a gift for my daughter. Thank you</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it. Works great!</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for the price. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this one because it was half the price of a Chi and it had great reviews. And everyone is right. This is a GREAT flat iron! The heat is adjustable, it gets nice and hot and it heats up really fast. My hair is hard to straighten and this made it smooth and shiney in just a few minutes. It doesn&#x27;t catch my hair like my old cheap-o one did. I am very pleased - this flat iron is a bargain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for years and this is by far one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Works better than a CHI and 1/2 the cost</li>
    <li> I am surprisingly in love with these flat irons. They make my hair silky and shiny. Flat iron them to perfection. I don&#x27;t hv to have them to the highest temperature, and it doesn&#x27;t burn out my hair. I got rid of my old flat iron and replaced them with these.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Still learning how to use a flat iron well, but this one works so well!!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. It is great for straightening and curling. Best if both worlds.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, product works great to control the frizz on my extensions.</li>
    <li> Based on all the reviews I thought this product would be great. Unfortunately the flat iron does not get hot at all and does not work to straighten my hair. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. Gets nice and hot. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. Leaves my hair nice and smooth and shiny. Very happy with this purchase. Oh and the travel pouch is great for when you don&#x27;t have time to let the straightener cool before packing it away.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product last week and love what it does. I used a Chi for years and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted. That was long, sleek and shiny hair. I have long blond hair that frizzes up with any hint of moisture. This number one selling Amazon flat iron does exactly what I want. The package I purchased also had a glove to protect the fingers as well as the Argon oil. One hair care specialist I spoke to was trying to convince me to buy the VF1. Once I researched the flat iron market on Amazon, however, it became clear that the HSI was a much better deal economically AND delivered the results I wanted. Here&#x27;s to a great purchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great little straightener. Heats up quickly and curls nicely.</li>
    <li> I recently chopped my hair off and I am in love with this straightener! I love using it to create beach waves!!! Definitely money well spent!</li>
    <li> Love it! I made a great decision. It works perfectly. My hair is really curly and this works wonders.</li>
    <li> Great straightener for a great value.</li>
    <li> Everything looks good, my hair is strong and thick, so I use the high temp most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;only thing is the led indicator is on the other side, think it will be better to be on the same side of the temp. adjustment and on/off switch.</li>
    <li> Its not as great as i thought... :-(</li>
    <li> At first I thought the iron was too small for my immense amount of long hair. Then I gave it a try. The iron is wonderful! It is lightweight and easy to handle. The rounded edges make it free from snagging hairs and give it the ability to curl hair. The control can&#x27;t be changed by accident which is nice too. The plates are smooth and very effective, despite their small size. The temperature doesn&#x27;t go as high as my previous iron, but I find I don&#x27;t need it to. I am very pleased with the quality and performance of this ceramic flat iron!</li>
    <li> The first day I used it I got a compliment on my hair from a coworker. :)    I have fairly fine, blonde, wavy hair that&#x27;s frizzy underneath my neck. This iron left my hair shiny, smooth, and soft. I got pretty close to the super silky texture my hair has after a salon visit. Which as you know never happens! I&#x27;ve owned other irons that I paid 2-3 times as much for that weren&#x27;t as good as this one.     A few points:    The floating plates appear to make good contact with the hair all the way down the section.    The swivel cord is an excellent feature.    The storage bag is great for storing the hot iron quickly rather than having to leave it out to cool down.    Very nicely packaged for a wonderful gift any girl would love!!    The price and performance are so good I don&#x27;t miss a fancy paint job or a digital read out.       Very happy with this purchase! Thank You Amazon &amp; HSI Professional!!.</li>
    <li> Great iron. Heats up quickly. Have been using this for the last two years and no issues. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Takes a little longer to straighten but very silky and smooth when done</li>
    <li> Amazing value for the price. The straightener gets super hot and tames my extremely curly hair. Would absolutely recommend! If you&#x27;re looking to save some money, buy this straightener instead of a $15-$20 model. You&#x27;ll spend a bit more for this, but it&#x27;s salon quality results.</li>
    <li> Great tool! Especially for the price. I have been a Chi user for a long time and am very satisfied so far with my HSI!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s old ceramic flat iron fell and broke.&lt;br /&gt;This was her replacement model.&lt;br /&gt;She certainly loves this one.</li>
    <li> have used a Chi for years and it broke. I was nervous about buying this but it works every bit as good</li>
    <li> This is the worst straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever used. The positive reviews must be fake reviews. This iron pulled my hair, never got hot enough, and left it frizzy.  I am returning it.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife a year ago. She loves them! We took them to the UK and they broke when we plugged them in, so I&#x27;m not sure how world wide they are. We just bought a replacement set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on using these in other countries, becareful!!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, product looks really nice. This is a gift so I have not personalize used it, but looks like a great item.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.  It leaves my hair smooth and soft without feeling damaged. Also loved the argan oil sample it came with!</li>
    <li> Great product, I would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Used once so far and it&#x27;s great. I have very thick hair that easily &amp;#34;poofs&amp;#34; in the smallest but if humidity and creases within seconds of being in a ponytail. I used the serum that came with the straightener and even friends noticed a difference. Even when I did get a great I just ran it thru again and all straight again!! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener. Small and easy to pack.</li>
    <li> The product was perfect and as described.  The delivery was fast.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a trip to Belgium and Germany so I wouldn&#x27;t need a converter only the correct adapter plug and it worked great.  It converts it self from one voltage to another.  Really gets the job done and no static.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve purchased as a gift.  The first user LOVES the way it works.  Its versatile and easy to use.  I imagine the second gift recipient will love it as well.</li>
    <li> This works great, especially considering the price. It does snag hairs from time to time.</li>
    <li> I got this for a FANTASTIC special on amazon for $40 when I was looking to buy a new Chi (after I tragically shattered the outlet plug on the ground). It&#x27;s great quality but tends to pull on my hair a little. It is still wonderful and was a great steal!</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener!</li>
    <li> I have used Chi straighteners since they started making them, but they kept downgrading in durability through the years. I had finally had enough and decided to look around for alternative straighteners. This HSI was not the highest rated, but certainly up there. After purchasing and using this HSI daily I can tell you I am a firm believer. This is the best straightener on the market.</li>
    <li> My last flat iron was not nearly as good as this one. I am glad my other one broke. This flat iron leaves my hair more silky and shiny as well as doing less damage to the ends of my hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent straightening iron! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair straightener. 5 stars. Works well makes my hair soft and silky with the hair oil. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a non professional quality one this is an amazing price for this iron. In a beauty supply store it would have cost me 199.99 which is crazy. Also my product was shipped very quickly I had it in 2 days and didn&#x27;t pay for express shipping.</li>
    <li> I love my HSI Flat Iron.  The only thing is I would have put instructions in on the oil since it is such a small bottle it is hard to read.  Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect product! Does everything I&#x27;d hoped for! Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product...works like a charm!!! best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product</li>
    <li> Love the swivel cord. Arrived in timely manner. Thermal cloth bag is a plus. Definitely is easier on the hair than the cheap models. Recommend if you need a flat iron</li>
    <li> StraightneR works great.  Pulls my hair occasionally but otherwise no problems</li>
    <li> They have great customer service! I ordered and they sent me one that really did NOTHING to my hair. I have really curly hair and it made it frizz up and that was about it. I advised them of this and they sent me a new one (might I add THE VERY NEXT DAY) because that was defective. To my surprise the new one was in different packaging and looked completely different which was a little strange to me but it worked GREAT! Awesome product and amazing customer service.</li>
    <li> So far it is one of the best hair straighteners I&#x27;ve ever had, and the price is fantastic!</li>
    <li> for the money, you cant beat this flat iron. I love it more than my old ghd.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and just as described. Works well!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. It makes my hair feel so smooth and look so shiny.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Works amazing so far. I have very curly hair and it does not leave my hair frizzy. It heats up in seconds and is ready to use.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I was honestly skeptic to the price of this flat iron, and to see if it would tame my thick curly hair, BUT I fell in love! Very good buy. I switched over from a,150$ chi to this. Much better, and your not left with the burnt hair smell like you are with the chi -.- bravo! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I had bought an expensive Chi - used it for a day, returned it and ordered this. I&#x27;m so glad I did!  It is easy to use and adds shine to my hair.  Great product - excellent price too!  About 1/4 of the Chi cost!</li>
    <li> Does a great job at straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> It is ok. It gets hot enough however the metal plates do not tightly close when straightening  my hair.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s just ok. Not bad but not the best flat iron I have owned. I bought it because I thought it was compatible with the electric current in Italy. It was not. I will use it as a back up in the states.I would recommend a more upscale flat iron.</li>
    <li> Gift for an aunt. She loves it.</li>
    <li> As far as straighteners go this one is pretty good. I have curly/ wavy hair and it leaves my hair smooth and straight. It pulls my hair a little but even my chi did that at times before it was brutally murdered by my 1 year old. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews because hsi doesn&#x27;t curl their hair. You can&#x27;t fault a tool for not doing what it was not made to do. It&#x27;s a Straightener people! It does what it was made to do: straightens your hair.</li>
    <li> I very much love this product. It was just what I was looking for. It does exactly as it says. 5 star product</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. works great!</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s the Perfict size</li>
    <li> My hair is hard to straighten &amp; this flat iron works great.  Much better than more expensive models I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  I&#x27;m still new to using a flat iron, but I have no complaints about this one.  It heats up in seconds (about 10 to be exact).  It came with a small bottle of HSI Argan Oil, which I just tried and really liked.  All in all, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> OMG this flat iron is amazing. I am an African American female with natural hair and this flat iron is amazing. Great heat control and the ceramic plates prevent heat damage.</li>
    <li> Excellent Flat iron. Heats up very quickly. I&#x27;ve paid three times this price for a far inferior iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, slides down smoothly through the hair. Great value, shipped and was delivered very fast. Bought for $40. No complaints so far</li>
    <li> Present for my mom...she loves it!</li>
    <li> Returned from Europe late Oct 2014 and can confirm that the flat iron works with an adapter.</li>
    <li> It does NOT get as hot as I&#x27;d like it too. It works great if you have thin hair, but if you have thick hair like me you should probably find another straightener.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my grandaughter for Christmas and she is thrilled. Heeps telling me it&#x27;s the best present she had gotten for Christmas!  She  loves it!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t rate products but this one has to be known.  I have had several expensive flatrons but this one by far has been the best.  It heats up and seconds and does not burn your hair at all.  Your hair feels so silky and also has a lot of bounce.  My stylist was so impressed she bought 10 for her salon.</li>
    <li> my daughter says &amp;#34;it looked small I thought it would be lame but it is so great!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This flat iron doesn&#x27;t offer much of a smooth glide, but I guess it&#x27;s worth the price. Most people seem to love it, so I &#x27;m obviously in the minority. Returning and will search for something better.</li>
    <li> Opened this gift today and went to plug it in and the plug completely fell apart little springs and pieces came out so now what am I supposed to do with this costly flat iron and has major defect and fire hazard....really frustrated right now</li>
    <li> Have bought many flat irons in the past, but this one is by far the best yet. 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron after reading the reviews because I had left my five year old GHD Insta-Shine at my son&#x27;s house and needed an afforadable flat iron before I could get mine back. The HSI Professional flat iron does a good job on straightening my hair, but I&#x27;m disappointed that there is no light to signal that it is on and has reached the right temperature. You also have to reach under the two plate sections to adjust the dial, which is a bit concerning because you are reaching between the hot plates. I now have my old GHD back and honestly it works better than this one, so between that and my concern about possibly getting burned just trying to turn the dial, I think I will be returning it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> My daughter lost the $130 straightener and I was looking for a replacement at a reasonable price.  This fit the bill. I also wanted automatic shut off button because she is as forgetful as she is careless.&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron works as well as the expensive model we used to have.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after reading the reviews, the other 2 flat irons that I use cost over $120 and this flat iron is cheaper but just as good.  I&#x27;ve been using it since I bought it and I love it so much.  It is easy to use and great to curl with and straighten my natural tightly curled hair.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the new HSI flat iron. says it does a wonderful job for her.</li>
    <li> My daughter n law has thick curly hair and this straightener just cuts right through it leaving it shiny and straight and she even curls her hair with it giving her self  a salon blow out style in minutes, its well worth the money and the shipping was super fast.</li>
    <li> Works just like the more expensive ones but for a fraction of the cost. I Use it everyday Works great on my thick hair. Love this brand</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my niece and she is in love with it. She straightened her hair in 10 minutes and she has long hair</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this item, with large amounts of disappointment.  I purchased this item a week ago and after dropping it once on carpeted floor, the entire ceramic plate shattered.  I had my previous straightener for 7 years and it was dropped many times.  This never happened.  My mother has dropped her CHI on travertine floor without it breaking.  I think a drop with a straightener is something that happens often and it should be able to withstand one drop.  I have contacted the company for a return and I am waiting to see their reply.  I would buy with caution!!!!</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron. Have gotten several compliments on my hair since using it. The glove, oil and carrying case are a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Best investment yet. Works really well all of their products.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Gr8 quality &amp; arrived faster than I thought!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the prompt delivery of this product. It was a gift for my daughter and she is very pleased with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a hairdresser and have always bought CHI flat irons and when they weren&#x27;t lasting as long as my 1st one, I research different brands and came across HSI and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping it lasts a good while. I may be buying one for myself.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever used and my hair is hard to straighten. Lasted years so far. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It&#x27;s truly like a professional&#x27;s flat iron.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Been searching for new flat irons for a while.  My current ones (CHI) are 5 years old and don&#x27;t get as hot as I need them to.  I have a very nice grain of natural hair, however, I do need safe heat to really get to my roots like I prefer.  Anyway, my mom asked for some flat irons for Christmas and I decided to give these a try since the reviews were so good!  We got them and tried them out right away.  They are incredibly sturdy (actually a lot better than the expensive ones I have).  And they worked super great!  I have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed, so much so, that I ordered myself a pair and can&#x27;t wait to get them.  It comes with a cooling bag, and heat glove also.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter who has normally curly hair...she wanted a flat iron to straighten her stubborn curls, and was thrilled with this item.  The fact that it also came with extras, such as the oil, international plugs and travel bag made it all the better.  Thanks for a great product and excellent service.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair the last time I got it cut. I had never used a flat iron before, and I was impressed with how smooth and shiny my hair looked. I had to get one of my own. I LOVE this styling tool. I can straighten my hair quickly, go to bed and wake up with my hair still looking fresh and great. I cannot believe how easy it is to have manageable, smooth hair!</li>
    <li> Really great iron at a great price.Heats up automatically</li>
    <li> Love it, just what I wanted!  It&#x27;s perfect and works really well!</li>
    <li> Love this product, just what I wanted</li>
    <li> love it. works great with thick natural hair</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for grand-daughter this year. She loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been more than a year now and I am still using this hair straightener. I use it average 4 days per week. I&#x27;ve purchased three hair straightener before this one and this is by far the best hair straightener.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up fast and straightens in one pass.  Not a typical result with my thick, wavy hair. Slightly better than the Chi I was using.  I also love the protective pouch that comes with it,  and the heat glove comes in handy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love it</li>
    <li> Great price for a good &amp; reliable product. Heats up fast, cools down fast enough. Great for traveling around with.</li>
    <li> Baught this flat iron for international travel that I will be doing in a few months.  I didn&#x27;t want to take anything expensive.  I tried it at home first and seemed to work ok.  Not as great as a chi flat iron but does the job - better than the $20 types from a Walmart.  Once I get back from traveling - will post again on how it performs and the ease of the dual voltage.</li>
    <li> Came promptly and was the product purchased.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to hold and to manage. It is very solid and heats up well and evenly. I really like that the heat control is a turn knob to adjust to different level of temperature and there is a separate on/off button. The control buttons are located on the inside of the handle so you wont accidentally turn it on/off or change the heat settings.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My wife loves it and her hair is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Got the product sooner than expected, like it a lot, works real good..</li>
    <li> Very good straightening&lt;br /&gt;Hair stays flat over night too</li>
    <li> It is awesome! I was pleasantly surprised and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!! I have naturally curly hair and it not only straightens it but you only have to go over twice! I would suggest using it with the Aragon oil they provide,( you can get a big bottle separate) all in all an awesome product!</li>
    <li> Great results!  I bought this for my daughter who has had a professional Keratin treatment done but still requires blow dry and flat iron.  She has very thick curly hair and this straightener has helped so much.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Quick to heat up and makes straightening hair take a ridiculously short amount of time! It works amazing, and the manageable price makes it a lot better!</li>
    <li> This is first time I ordered any hair straightner.. and its pretty good.. i saw some youtube videos to see how to straighten hairs and used this .. and it working good.. i have smooth hairs not curly.. so i used this only at 140 temp.. and it works good for me..I bought this because its universal I can use in multiple countries... I still have use in india because voltage there is different than in US.. will write my review about that later.. so far its going good...</li>
    <li> Received this iron for christmas, it is the best flat iron I have ever used. Very smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull or break your hair. My hair is only warm to the touch instead of blazing hot like irons I&#x27;ve used in the past. I straighten my hair and it stays straight right into the next day, saving me time in the morning. There&#x27;s nothing negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it. She&#x27;s got some seriously think hair.</li>
    <li> I am a huge straightener snob. I only used Chi while I was in highschool then in my early 20&#x27;s I discovered the GHD and fell in love. I had the GHD for about five years when it decided to break my heart and finally stop working. The GHD is pretty pricey and since I&#x27;m saving for a wedding, I didn&#x27;t want to put out the $200 for a new one. I went on to Amazon and the first straightener that popped up was the HSI professional. It had 10,000+ reviews and four and a half stars. It was only $40, which, honestly scared me a bit. Remember, I was a huge beauty snob and it was engraved in my head that I&#x27;d have to pay at least $100 to get a decent straightener.  I decided to trust my fellow Amazon reviewers and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, I received the HSI. I absolutely love it. I have wavy, frizzy hair and this bad boy makes my locks straight and shiny. It feels very durable and finely made. It gets hot super fast and my hair doesn&#x27;t get struck in the crevices like in the cheap straighteners. Would totally recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After having for less than a year, the straightener already broke. It no longer heats up at all. Changed my review from 5 stars to 2 stars. I guess I&#x27;ll pay more for a different straightener and hope it lasts for more than a year. Very, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very smooth with no pulling.  Flattens really well for both myself and daughter. My hair is very thick and coarse where hers is less and works great!  Reasonable price when compared with others, would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product  and smallwhich is great for storage</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I brought this flat iron bc of all the reviews it had. I was so excited to receive it when I turned it on to use it it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. The flat iron itself looks amazing fast shipping ! Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work:(</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Awesome Flat Iron for the price! Love it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well on course hair! At first I thought it was pricey because I had gotten the cheaper flat irons in the past. This one is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Amazing tool for hair styling! I recommend it for all who have problem thick hair. Iron  makes my hair as silk for 10 minutes. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Thee product arrived sooner than I expected. At the beginning I didn&#x27;t see what thee fuss was all about but I liked it better the second time I used it andd I prefer it over my Old one now which wass also very good. This is an excellent hair straightener. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase .</li>
    <li> Worked great at first, but the iron eventually stopped staying hot. I now have to wait about 2-4 minutes between straightening sections of my hair to let it heat up again. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping and great price for a great product.  Really like the quality of the flat iron and it&#x27;s travel case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than expected. I love this ceramic flat iron on my natural 3c/4a texture hair. It leaves it soft, shiny and straight, as If I had a relaxer without having to go through the process or using chemicals. I must also admit that I am a product junkie and I own at least 3 other flat irons, including higher end ones that cost approx  $150, and this one beats it hands down.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have had.  My hair is straight and frizz-free.  (It dries wavy and frizzy!)  This straightener is every bit as good as the one they sell in the malls for $200, that I almost bought.  You will not be sorry you purchased this.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! This flat iron is easy to use, heats up quickly, and does a beautiful job straightening hair. The product comes with a glove and a sample of Argan oil.  I shopped at a local store where flat irons were priced 2-3 times the price of this one yet were of inferior quality.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I purchased.  Both for my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one because my daughter had used her sisters iron and&lt;br /&gt;also loved it, so I bought her one of her own.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> You have no idea how much I&#x27;m all about my hair straightener lol i straighten my hair everyday for 12 years now. I won&#x27;t leave the house worth it Not being straight and teased. Sooo i needed a new straightener again and did my research. This it&#x27;s the first that popped up and out had 10k reviews.. After research i bought this one. I&#x27;ve always liked and had hot tools because mine was set for more degrees than this one, but i thought for $20 more and all the reviews get this. I bough the 1\\&quot; but wish i got the bigger one only cuz my past straightners are the 1 3/4 ones. But its good just seems to take longer since i have long hair</li>
    <li> For the first couple of weeks it was very nice. Sometimes it didn&#x27;t heat up, but I pressed Reset and it started working. Now it starts working, then it gets cold, then I need a few min to make it work... piece of garbage. I would rate it 1 star, but the Argan oil coming with it is too good. :)</li>
    <li> This is an awesome straightener and sells for an affordable price (and comes will a few extras too)! I love how quickly it warms up, the adjustable heat dial, and the swivel power cord. I haven&#x27;t used the sample oil provided with the straightener yet, but even without that, the straightener does a solid job.</li>
    <li> Was a great gift for my wife. Good price too.</li>
    <li> thanks for this one. i love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews &amp; sales, but it pulled odd pieces of hair, so I never wanted to use it. After about four or five uses, it&#x27;s just sitting in the closet. ( p′︵‵。)</li>
    <li> Great iron, my fiance loves it!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that it is WAY BETTER than any store bought flat iron. Its not the greatest flat iron out there, but its pretty freaking good if your doing your own hair, in comparison to going to a salon. Does what its supposed to do, I have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flatiron for about six months, and I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 times per week. About to throw it out and start shopping for a better one because it heats up but then cools down after about 10 minutes to where it&#x27;s still hot enough to not want to touch, but it barely smooths out my hair. Super frustrating! I have pretty soft and manageable hair which this thing should easily be able to handle. It also feels like it&#x27;s snagging and pulling my hair between the plates. I&#x27;m going back to my four-year-old cheapo big-box-store flatiron until I can get a better one.</li>
    <li> After years of roller-setting my long hair, I recently got a new haircut which now requires me to air/blow-dry my now short hair and then use a flat-iron to smooth and style it.  I was really a little intimidated about using a flat iron. When I saw the reviews on Amazon, especially the one by other users who were \\&quot;new\\&quot; to \\&quot;flat-ironing\\&quot;, I decided to try this product. All I can say now is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;! The HSI 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron is just a dream. It was so easy to use and handle and, did a terrific job! My friends thought I had gone to the beauty salon to get my hair done done. LOL. I HIGHLY recommend this product and the price is so great for the quality. The silk pouch is beautiful and the oil added a nice shine to my hair without appearing oily. If you&#x27;re looking for a great flat iron, this is it!</li>
    <li> My third Chi broke after about a year&#x27;s use - all three shorted out - and a friend recommended this straightener.  I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brands and Chi was the ONLY one that would straighten my hair.  But since there were so many glowing reviews, I went for it.  For the price, why not?!  I LOOOOOOVE this straightener.  It works as well as the Chi if not better, and for a fraction of the price.  The only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s not quite as smooth as the Chi when you&#x27;re straightening your hair (a few hairs get caught and break off, but rarely).  And I love the oil that came with this!  Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever splurge and pay the high price for the oil once my sample runs out, but I have to say I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the straightener a few weeks so we&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> just got my flat iron within two days in the mail and I&#x27;m in love. works great! and my hair looks amazing when i use the oil that it came with, wish it came with more oil but i guess ill have to buy more then</li>
    <li> I have very dry, coarse, curly thick hair,&lt;br /&gt;and have tried other flat irons, and this one worked great!&lt;br /&gt;Straightens my hair better than the Paul Mitchell or Chi.&lt;br /&gt; Am buying another one, for a friend at work, who tried mine&lt;br /&gt;and loved it! Not only straightened my hair well, but made&lt;br /&gt;it feel a lot softer.</li>
    <li> i really liked how well the product heated up and that the casing didn&#x27;t get too hot to handle. i&#x27;m still on the fence about the argan oil, it did a good job of protecting my hair, but i&#x27;m not too hot on the smell.</li>
    <li> Better than my old hair straightener which just left me covered in split ends. A smooth touch and the argon oil smelled nice too leaving hair with a shiny touch! Light weight and heats up quick too. Totally recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product. I&#x27;m so happy I bought it!! Best flat iron I&#x27;ve had in my life and I&#x27;ve had many different brands like CHI, Instyler, etc. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it comes with the glove that makes everything easier. With this product i style my hair very fast and it last for so long I can&#x27;t even believe it. Everybody is also telling me how good my hair looks, so shinny and silky. I&#x27;m very happy I bought it for such a good price. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 3 weeks ago after much searching on Amazon and review reading. I received an Amazon gift card for my birthday and since my old Ken Paves flat iron was not heating up and making my hair frizzy and I took the plunge on this one. Love it!! Not only does it heat up fast but I can actually style my hair so quick and easy. I wanted a flat iron that would allow me to curl my hair as well as straighten and this makes turning a breeze! You can&#x27;t beat the sale price on this awesome flat iron!! Buy buy buy!!</li>
    <li> This item makes a great birthday present! My wife has owned many straighteners and she says this one is by far one of the best yet! Curls and straightens without catching and pulling hair! Highly recommended item</li>
    <li> great product! totally love it!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and gives me amazing looking hair. It made my hair very shiny and very soft. The argan oil included with the product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have purchased flat irons in the past and found that they just did not work that well.  I had to keep going over the hair to get it straight.  I ordered this HSI flat iron and found it to be excellent.  It works quickly and effectively, and I have found that my hair stays straight until my next shampoo.  I have medium length hair, however my daughter has long hair and she too has told me that it works well and that she does not have to flat iron her hair again, until the next time she shampoos it.  This is actually the second HSI I have purchased. Since the first one worked so well, I thought I would purchase another, so that I could have one to take on vacation, since my daughter and I were sharing the first one.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! Ladies if you have natural hair your hair will look like you just got a relaxer! I went to my beautician to get a sew in and she gasp and asked me if I got a relaxer. Nope I said just a new flat iron :). I may do a video review I could not find any for natural 4b hair. It really works!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because the reviews were so good.  However, it was not at all what I expected. I had to turn it to the highest heat setting to have it work at all on my my wavy hair.  It had a very rough feel, and it was almost as if my hair would get snagged on it with every use.  I prefer the Babyliss which feels nice and smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. It came with a cloth case, protective glove, and a small bottle of hair oil. Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, better than my much, much, more expensive one.  No hair tearing, great weight, perfect!</li>
    <li> This iron is great! I love the packaging, and I think that the swivel cord is awesome for when you need to curl hair. It heats up in less then a minute, it&#x27;s design is beautiful, and gives great results! I tried it on my cosmetology styling head, my niece, and my cousin. All with different textured hair, all ended with silky, smooth, and shiny hair. I might post photos up. Bottom line: This is an astonishing iron, especially for the price. You won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
    <li> Not only did it heat up fast, but it also straightened my thick curly hair in under 30 minutes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking for a while if I&#x27;ll get this or a more expensive flat iron like CHI, so I opted to this since I&#x27;m Asian and close-fisted with money. HAHA.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly fine, shipping was fast, I got the bonus argan oil in a tiny little bottle. Heats up quickly, very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is when I hold/grip it, the skin on the lower part of my thumb finger gets pinch sometimes..maybe I just need more practice in handling it, but so far so good. :)))</li>
    <li> Whooaaaa!!! all I can say is \\&quot;wow\\&quot; really...with super fast delivery,This iron works so well with my hair, lasts all day and makes my hair real shinny...cant say enough, but thanks HSI/Amazon you guys are super!!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair straightener.  One of the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used.  Even better than the Chi.  I would recommend this straightener to anyone.  Plus I received a pretty storage bag for it free.  On a scale of 1-10 its a 12.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! I have naturally curly/wavy hair and have the option of flat ironing. This flat iron works very well, gets as hot as you need it and glides through my hair. Just remember to work in small sections and you will get the result you are looking for. The argan oil is a nice bonus. It smells good and makes your hair nice and smooth. And, for the price, I think it is a great dea!</li>
    <li> A teenage girl getting ready for highschool is an ordeal!  One of the biggest worries is \\&quot;bad hair\\&quot; days.  My granddaughter is always looking for the perfect solution to her hair problems...long hair but without a lot of body.  She found this hair straightener on Amazaon and we decided we&#x27;d give it a try.  What a perfect choice!  She loves the feel of the product and was so glad to find the glove in the box.  She&#x27;s always burning her fingertips so it was a real plus.  It straightens her hair as no other product has but still leaves it so shiny and silky.  Usually after straightening her hair looks a bit frizzed and dry, but not with this one.  She loves her machine and babies it.  So, we&#x27;ve taken away some pre school jitters for a freshman.....the worries of \\&quot;bad hair\\&quot; days are gone!  Thanks Amazon.  A-Z we always find the good products.</li>
    <li> This straightener makes my hair much shinier than with my last straightener, a cheap drugstore one. People compliment my hair all the time, both on style and shine! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted a nicer straightener than the $30 one I purchased at Target...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the good reviews I went ahead and purchased this one, But at least in my experience, this product is not worth it! My target straightener works so much better.  This one leaves my hair CRAZY FRIZZY.  And it takes SO many passes over each section of hair to straighten.  And even then, it doesn&#x27;t straighten as nice as my other one.  It also doesn&#x27;t hold, after about an hour, my hair looks like I never even straightened it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by all the good reviews...</li>
    <li> I love the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron!!! I paid around $40 and feel like I got an awesome deal!  Since it has rounded edges, I use it to both straighten and curl my hair. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Very much in love with this flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> Best features:&lt;br /&gt;The heat controlling plates on the outside of the straightener. It still gets hot, but not hot enough to burn my hand if I accidentally grab too high on the straightener or touch my hand on the wrong side trying to pick it up. I’ve only been using it for about a month, but I feel like it’s safe to say that I see many less burns in my future, if any, that I experienced with my old straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers are right, it doesn’t pull my hair, or very little. I never noticed how much my old straightener did it, and now I’m horrified at how long I dealt with that thing. I don’t know how on earth this straightener pulls it off, but yes, it doesn’t pull on my hair hardly at all.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair MUCH less oily. I have EXTREMELY oily hair, and since I’ve been using this straightener I can go a whole extra day before needing to wash my hair, and the only thing I’ve changed is my straightener. That statement is a major, major change, I only have to actually straighten my hair twice a week now instead of thrice, which makes my whole week easier. My hair hasn’t really behaved or looked different, not shinier or straighter, but somehow it just doesn’t get oily as fast. It blows my mind.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this thing heats up lightning fast, like in 10 seconds or something. I also have it set to max heat though, but still, I don’t wait for the heat-up anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The missing feature:&lt;br /&gt;I only miss automatic shut off feature my old straightener had. It’s a convenient bonus that I got used to having, and once in a while I forget to unplug it, which is a fire hazard, forget wasting the straightener life and electricity. It just seems silly to me that all straighteners don’t automatically come equipped with it. (I wonder if there’s some sort of automatic shutoff timer plug/converter I can buy that will solve this dilemma for me, maybe?)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do love this straightener, it’s a huge upgrade from my old one, even without that one feature I miss. Honestly the only reason my review isn’t 5 stars is because I see the regular price is listed as $200, and I just don’t feel that this straightener is worth that. That being said, this is an AMAZING $40 straightener, which is what I paid for it. If the regular price was $40, or even $50, my review would be 10 out of 5 stars all the way, because it is DEFINITELY worth every penny of that $40-50.</li>
    <li> This product is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had! I love the different heat settings. It makes my hair so smooth and silky looking. I would recommend it to a friend for sure!!</li>
    <li> The HSI Styler is the first iron I have used so I am unable to compare it with others.  It did heat quickly and just as quickly straightened my thick, wavy hair.  This morning I awoke to perfectly styled, straight hair.  How nice that all I have to do is comb it.  The only negative I have with this product is that the tiny controls are somewhat difficult to access as they are on the interior of the product.  I sense that this is really the only area where they can be placed; if they were to be put on the outside, the settings could inadvertently be changed to a higher temperature than one might want.</li>
    <li> A very high quality item. Easy to use and perfectly designed. Not only works well but has a great shape that fits in your hand well.</li>
    <li> Very happy, used to use a Chi but when it broke I didn&#x27;t want to pay another $100 for a straightner. I read other reviews, and gave this one a shot and so far I am very happy. I have to use it at the hottest setting, but it works beautifully. DEFINATELY reccomend!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is excellent. It heats up quickly and straightens my hair in very little time. The product also came with a glove and a sample of hair serum to use with the straightener. My hair came out silky smooth.</li>
    <li> After reading many other people&#x27;s review about this straightner, I decided to purchase it. It shipped fairly quickly. I liked how the light turns red when it&#x27;s heating up then green when it&#x27;s ready but the overall quality for straightening my hair was okay... I have long long hair.. It did the job of straightening it but was still kind of frizzy. I&#x27;ll just stick to my chi straightener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of flat iron from CHi ranging anywhere from $80 to $150 a flat iron. I also like Bablybliss. I&#x27;ve been using flat irons for about 10 years, and I have tried most brands on the market. Most flat irons do not do well on my hair when it is a no wash day, but I tried it, and it really worked. I tried it on a wash day and my hair stayed straight and smooth. Usually by the end of the day with humidity my hair starts to frizz, and it stayed pretty good. Plus it is fast. Many flat irons take several times over the hair to straighten my hair, but my hair was completely straight and smooth in one try.  I hope this flat iron lasts. It was a good price and it received high ratings and so far I give it 5 stars. It came in one day, and worked on smoothed and straightened my hair.  I recommend the HSI flat iron.</li>
    <li> Not only did the iron arrive days before the earliest I excpeted, but after one use, I could tell the difference between it and other irons I&#x27;ve tried.  This is by far the best one, and it wasnt even the most expensive.  The soft case is great for travel and storage, the construction seems very durable and mostly rubberized, doesnt slip around on the counter.  The handle is cool enough to touch during operation, and even the tip stays cool enough so that you can touch the end of it without the glove (which is also included).  I use the glove to set it on, rather than buying a stand for it.  Heat-up time is pretty much consistent with other irons ive tried.  There are no plastic molding bits for your hair strands to get caught in while ironing.  The heat control and on/off switch are located inside, and out of the way, so you dont accidentally touch them while in operation.  There is also a ready-light built into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got very thick and coarse dark brown hair.  It is naturally very wavy to curly in parts.  The iron had no problem easily straightening my hair with only a few passes and with a spritz of hair spray after, it stayed perfectly smooth all day at work - in Florida! (During hurrican season, so there is pleanty of Humidity!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came with a GFI Plug and a 2ml sample of Argan oil which is also great.  (Ive already ordered the 4 oz bottle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I couldnt be happier with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron apprehensively because it was a company that I&#x27;ve never heard of but best beauty product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Very durable flat iron and left my hair silky and pin straight. It took me about twenty minutes to straighten really curly and frizzy hair that is a little past the midway of my back. If you purchase this you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I love the straighter! So far, no snags in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I am soooooo satisfied with my purchase of this flat iron.  We are ususally TEAM FHI. I have purchased two FHI&#x27;s from amazon and needed a 3rd one to send off to college with my daughter. I did not want to spend a 100 bucks for another flat iron so I searched for a comparable one until I came across these HSI Stylers. I read all the great reviews and decided to purchase them. I love them!!! My HSI works just as good or even better than the FHI but half the price. It leaves your hair straight and silky smooth!! I am now Team HSI!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the best straightener I&#x27;ve used. It was shipped fast. The straightener heats up fast, the manual tells you what temperature you should set it at for your hair type. It leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky. The 1 inch size makes it easy to store and travel with since it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price....definitely does not straighten like product description claims.  I would save your money and put it towards a higher priced higher quality product.</li>
    <li> The title says it all!  I am very happy with this flat iron.  It works great and heats up quickly and leaves my hair looking nice!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  love the way my hair looks.  Heats up quickly easy to handle an curls my ends beautifully.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is so amazing. I really recommend it for others to have such a high quality item in their homes</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron! I have had 2 CHI irons in the past and can honestly say this iron works better. My daughter and cousin have used it and love it! I would definitely recommend HSI to friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy/curly hair. This straightener got my hair straighter than the other 2 straighteners I have used. I even had people comment that they had never seen my hair so straight before.&lt;br /&gt;I love how quick it heats up too.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Heats quickly.  I like the curved edges allowing for curling if desired.  There is also a textured grip which is nice.  The plates do not snag my hair.  Leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> The HSI flat iron is great for frizzy, hard to manage hair.  It is as good, or better, than the CHI flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;It heats quickly and my hair is flatter than it has ever been before.  It also has a great sheen that it never&lt;br /&gt;has had before.  I highly recommend the HSI ceramic flat iron for anyone who has curly, coarse and thick hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this flatiron.  My hair is pretty thick and coarse and it manages to straighten in while leaving it shiny and soft.  The argan oil that comes with it is very nice also.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! I was planning on running down to the store and grabbing a Chi but a friend told me about this (she has it) and the great deal.  I got it and love it!  Its great quality, has the swivel cord so its not in the way.  A lot of people said it came with a small bottle of hair stuff...I didn&#x27;t get anything like that with mine, just a nifty heat glove I will never use...lol...I did get some spray from a local salon called Perfect 10, and that combined with this flat iron gives me the best hair I&#x27;ve had in years.  I live in FL and the hurricane that just came through with that insane humidty...My hair was GORGEOUS in spite of it!!  I have coarse, weird hair and I have had people ask me over and over since I started using it...did you get your hair done at a salon today? Nope :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  This straightener has surpassed her Expectations.  She is always getting compliments.  I would highly recommend purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Straightner is ok, for the price.  But, I prefer my old on to this one. I have thick/wavy hair and it takes more time to straighten with this product.  Price is good though.</li>
    <li> I knew I needed a good flat iron, but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the price of a Chi.  I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 6 months and so far, has been wonderful.  Heats up fast and stays hot with every pass through my hair.  It glides nicely, never snags my hair &amp; the cord is really long, which is great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron! I had been using a comparable CHI which I was perfectly happy with. The reason I even bought this HSI flat iron is because it was so inexpensive (on sale for $39.99) and it received such high reviews I figured it was worth a try. I am so glad I got it because the Reviews are completely true...this HSI flat iron works even better on my hair than my CHI. I have very frizzy, thick hair that is chemically relaxed. After washing my hair, I usually allow it to air dry over night, brush it out in the morning, apply 2 drops of Argan Oil and a heat protector spray then use my flat iron, working on small sections at a time. With my CHI, I would pass over each section 2 or 3 times and was happy with the result. With this new HSI flat iron, I pass over each section ONCE for the same result! Cuts my styling time significantly. I had already been using Argan Oil in my hair so I wasn&#x27;t surprised with how great it works to tame frizzy hair. I don&#x27;t find the HSI brand oil any better/worse than another brand I already own but it&#x27;s nice to get a free sample. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this iron. I&#x27;ve had a CHI (hated) and my previous iron was my beloved Sedu. After having it for 7 yrs it died. I was going to buy another one, but I came across this one and read the great reviews. I thought for $40 I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. I must say it is AWESOME! It really straightens without much effort. Just one sweep through the section of hair was all it needed. The only thing that some people may not like is that it&#x27;s slightly heavier than previous irons I&#x27;ve had. Not a big deal to me. It&#x27;s a great product with a great price.</li>
    <li> There are TONS of reviews about this flat iron and they are all over the board--people either love it or hate it. I am right in the middle. The flat iron worked fine: the ready light came on, it heated up quickly, the swivel cord is a nice touch. The pouch and glove that come with it are cute, but basically just fluff to look like you are getting more bang for your buck. Didn&#x27;t try the oil as I use a different one that I love. The diamond design on the handle didn&#x27;t bother me--if you have to grip a handle so tightly to make a product work that the design on the handle becomes an issue, it&#x27;s not for you. I have shoulder length, thick, semi curly hair which straightened fine with this iron, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed its curling or flipping capabilities. There was something about the way the plates sat in the iron that just seemed off...kind of like they floated and didn&#x27;t clamp my hair like they should have. All in all, I ended up returning this item. Even at $40, I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money on something I didn&#x27;t absolutely love. Can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would pay the suggested MSRP of $299 for it either (gag!). PS: Don&#x27;t buy this item just because Amazon &#x27;shipped it quickly&#x27;. Receiving it in 2 days instead of 4 won&#x27;t make you love or hate it any better.</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to heat up, no automatic shut off, and it really doesn&#x27;t get too hot&lt;br /&gt;Ok flat iron for the money</li>
    <li> Amazing hair straightener!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous flat iron! It works as well, if not better than the one I paid over twice as much for a year ago.  It came in a nice bag to use for travel and included a small bottle of argan oil. Amazing value. My daughter has had hers for a year and it&#x27;s still going strong. Love it!</li>
    <li> I cant say enough good things about this flat iron! My sister is a hair dresser and she actually says that this flat iron is much better than the very pricey one she bought for the salon! Love the temperature control on it. One pass and it straightens wonderfully. Dont be fooled by the price, you can feel the quality of this flat iron, if you are shopping around for a new one, just stop and order this one, you will be so glad that you did!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener for my daughter-in-law so I haven&#x27;t used it, but she chose it to put on her Wish List.  I&#x27;m sure she did so thinking it would be a good one.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron hair straightener  &#x3D;  Amazing hair !</li>
    <li> Great product! It was exactly as described in the product description. It heats up quickly and works well with my hard-to-style hair. It is definitely a high-quality product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This wasnt as hype for me as the other reviewers made it seem. It barely heated and about half an hour later my hair has waves in it again.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and works very well so far. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks and only used it a couple times so hopefully it holds up.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Makes my hair straight and shiny and I also love that it is easy to curl with as well. It can get very hot so it is great for all different hair types. The shipping was super fast. I am very impressed. I have recommended this product to all my friends who need new hair straighteners.</li>
    <li> i have really thick hair and this straight iron is the best thing i have ever had i really would recommend this to anyone who has long thick hair</li>
    <li> Bought this as a xmas gift for my 16 year old niece.  The sheer number of reviews on this product was a good indication that it had been put through the ringer by many users, which ultimately led to my purchasing it.  My niece was so excited that after opening it, she almost immediately locked herself in one of our bathrooms and used it to curl all of her hair.  She was very impressed with the design, amount of heat, and how easy it was to use.  I have a different brand of flat iron which doesn&#x27;t get used often, but when it comes time to replace it, I may get one of these for myself.  Very pleased with seller communication and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> The straightener didn&#x27;t get my hair all the way straight. My hair was a little wavy.  This product was just ok.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what iron all these other reviewers received but my iron is cheap and worthless. I am returning it immediately. It snags my hair and it does not get anywhere near as hot as it needs to be. My hair was getting wavy 5 min after being \\&quot;ironed\\&quot;. The worst buy ever. I really thought this was going to be a good buy according to all these \\&quot;great\\&quot; reviews. I must honestly say that I have bought a better hair iron at walgreens, and that is saying a lot. This thing is cheap junk. Don&#x27;t even bother to consider this product. I have never ever written a review in my entire life and this product was SO disappointing I actually created a pen name just to write this review. I do not want anyone else to be as deceived as I was. I have thin, wavy, easy-to-manage hair and this was total and complete crap.</li>
    <li> After contemplating the purchase of the HSI flat iron, I finally placed the ordered. I am very pleased with the results after styling my hair. It really does straighten while also smoothing and eliminating frizz. What is amazing is that it stays even in humid conditions! I can already tell a huge difference between the HSI and my old curling iron which was \\&quot;frying\\&quot; my hair. The argon oil is a great product as well.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! It heats up fast and does wonders for my hair! It becomes so smooth and silky. If I straighen it the night before, it stays that way the following day. Love it :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener b/c my T3 had stopped working after four years! I originally purchased this to just get me through till I could decide which expensive straightener I was going to get next...however, I&#x27;m sticking with this one! It straightens and curls my hair beautifully and doesn&#x27;t fry it!! So happy I ordered this!! Plus, the company was great to answer my questions!</li>
    <li> Great product! Niece loves it.</li>
    <li> My last flat iron which I paid about $90 for just got replaced with this one. I was going to get a sedu cuz I&#x27;ve read a lot of good things about it but when I was looking for it on amazon I came across this one and saw the great reviews and figured wth, it&#x27;s only $35 Ill be throwing away if it doesn&#x27;t work instead of $100 or more. When I got it I was very impressed. It was so smooth on my hair and seemed to straighten it very well. I didn&#x27;t have to keep going back over it like my last flat iron. I loved the oil they sent with it but I&#x27;m already out! I&#x27;m definitely getting more! The oil seemed to make my hair straighter and smoother. I just hope this flat iron doesn&#x27;t crap out shortly but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this brand as I have never used it before but I do love it.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and it doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair like some of the others I have used.  This is a superb product especially for the price. I would recommend trying this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. The storage bag and glove are added bonus.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a really nice flat iron at a reasonable price. After looking at several, settled on this one since the reviews were fairly great and priced very well. Arrived quickly and put it to use right away. Love the option of dialing up the temp when needed, LOVE the extra long cord (I believe it is about 8 feet) as the one I used before was rather short and inconvenient, enjoy having the glove to use and not burning my fingers anymore and the travel bag was a nice add-on that came with the box.  If the iron keeps working as it has been, I will be very happy with my purchase...So far, so good!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Delivery was on time and I got more than I thought when I opened the box. I have a glove to eliminate burning my hand, a small bottle of oil, and a case. I was very happy to receive all this and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it!! It warms up quickly and glides very smoothly through her hair. She highly recommends this to anyone using a straightener!</li>
    <li> I just got this item yesterday and have used it twice. I&#x27;M IN LOVE! What an amazing flat iron I used a chi before this and read the reviews on here. So for the price I figured why not?? Well my hair looks and feels so silky and looks amazing! I love this item and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this iron. I read the reviews and decided it was time to finally replace my $25 drugstore straightener with a more professional one. When it arrived, I used it right away. Well, I tried to. It took 15 minutes to fully heat up to 410. I always use the hottest setting on flat iron because my hair is very thick and wavy. When it finally heated up, I used it on one strand of hair, and the light turned red so it could heat back up. It took 3 minutes to heat up again. I tried resetting, turning off, turning on, giving it a day to calm down, etc. Nothing work. I contacted the seller and they said it sounded like a defective product. I received a free replacement within a few days. Unfortunately, it had the same exact defect. I was frustrated and sent both back for a full refund. I would give this 0 stars but the customer service was great and based on all the great reviews, it&#x27;s obvious I got two bad irons out of hundreds and thousands of good ones. I just didn&#x27;t have the time or energy to keep getting it replaced anymore, so I&#x27;ll stick with my cheap but reliable Remington.</li>
    <li> My previous flat iron was a CHI, which worked well for a while but never really handled the thick, wavy hair that I have.  Since I had not heard of the HSI, I felt I was taking a chance, but liked the reviews I read on it.  I am so glad I did!  I am very pleased with the performance of this flat iron.  It is less bulky than the CHI, more heat settings, a swivel cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled,and easier to use. With my CHI I had to get the hair in the iron, then hold it with both hands to put enough pressure to straighten it.  No so with this HSI - one hand does it! The glove is a great addition, as is the HSI Argan Oil.  Thank you for offering a wonderful product at a wonderful price!</li>
    <li> The reviews online were very helpful. I recieved my flat iron very quickly. It was shipped and packaged well and the box was in perfect condition. I opened it and used it right away and I was very impressed. It holds my hair strand much tighter than my previous flat iraon and my hais was so shiny! I plan on ordering another one for my daughter for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I really love my new hsi . It gets my hair really straight. I would recommend the hsi to any one.</li>
    <li> After researching numerous reviews and also asking friend recommendations I chose the HSI Professional. I am extremely happy with this product. It straightens my wavy hair better than any flat iron I have owned. Salon quality!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is beautiful!  Not relevant, but it is ;-).  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, east to use, and gets hot super quickly.  I cannot use it on the hottest setting even though I have very coarse Afican American hair because it just gets that hot.  This I&#x27;d a really efficient hit iron.  As soon as my nineteen year old niece got a look at it she said that she wanted the exact same one to replace her old flat iron.  I am do pleased with this purchase.  I compared the sample argon oil to my nieces argon oil of a different manufacturer and HSI&#x27;s oil is much lighter, smother, and shinier.  I gave my niece the sample because I purchase the 4oz argon oil from HSI.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I purchased this flat iron. For starters, it arrived two days before I expected it! My hair is thin, yet since I&#x27;ve been coloring it for years, it quickly frizzes in humidity. I live in Florida, which is highly humid almost every day. It only takes me about 5 minutes to pass the iron through my hair. It glides very smoothly and leaves my hair perfect! Since it&#x27;s rounded, I also like that I can flip the bottom under, giving it more body. When I get home in the evening, my hair is still perfect, no matter how much time I&#x27;ve spent outside!&lt;br /&gt;The price is unbeatable, and it includes the Argan Oil, a glove, and a beautiful thick travel pouch. What more can anyone ask for!!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product before but a friend recommended it and I have been very pleased! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Its a pretty good flat iron considering the price. Great deal! Works well w my hair and doesnt damage it at all</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this flat iron due to all the great reviews. Although the shipping was amazing and quick, I was not impressed with the flat iron. My hair is wavy and requires some maintenance. Nothing a regular flat iron can&#x27;t take care of. I used the iron and it really wasn&#x27;t that great. I&#x27;ve had my share of irons and I felt this one wasn&#x27;t living up to all the hype. Had to run the flat iron through sections of my hair waaaaaaay too many times. Overall: not impressed. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever owned. It heats up quickly and works amazingly well. My teenage daughters keep stealing it from me!</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this flat iron after the first use I am hooked. I love the way it makes my hair look and feel. I would often go to the salon and pay $85 or more for the same results that I got with this $40 flat iron!!! The Flat iron heats up quickly and there is an indicator light to let you know it is on. They included a small bottle of Argan oil, a glove and a nice reuseable pouch to keep the flat iron in after use. It also comes with instructions just in case...A great buy and money saver!!!</li>
    <li> It is not a good tool..... it lacks the power and heat.  If I can pass it through my hair WITH my hand, it is not a good straightener.  I was very disappointed, to the point that I took time to do this.</li>
    <li> I just got this straightener in the mail today, very high quality, works great! Curls perfectly as well. Feels like I&#x27;m practically stealing this $300 straightener for $40!</li>
    <li> Recently my CHI hair straightener decided to sort of \\&quot;break\\&quot; on me. The last time I tried to use it I noticed that it was barely heating up when I set it on its highest setting. I&#x27;ve had it for a few years so it wasn&#x27;t too surprising that it was about time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent maybe $80-$90 on my last CHI, so I expected to spend that much on another one. I looked for a CHI but the ones I found were too expensive for my tastes... upwards of $100. I was about to fold when I found this HSI straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was totally right and the reviews seemed spot on. I was really hesitant because you get what you pay for right? But I figured since it was so cheap I&#x27;d give it a go, better than spending $100 or more I didn&#x27;t really want to spend on a hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HSI came super fast (thank you 1-day shipping Amazon!) and I opened it up. Came with a nice silky case, a glove... thing, some solution for hair, instructions etc etc.  I could care less about the glove and hair solution, and I would for the case too but I think I&#x27;ll actually use it to keep dust and whatever else from getting on the straightener when I&#x27;m not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day I tested it out. Used it just like my CHI, put the heat all the way up. It worked like a dream!! Also, I used my CHI to make some nice curls and flips and things, but I found it hard sometimes because if I didn&#x27;t do it just right I&#x27;d get those very noticeable and awkward \\&quot;grooves\\&quot; in the hair. I found it much easier to do this \\&quot;curling\\&quot; with the HSI. Also, I found it much easier to handle than my CHI, which was very bulky and slightly awkward to handle, and somewhat heavy. The HSI is much easier to move between my hands to get at each side of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I styled my hair, great. Didn&#x27;t take too long, replicated the effects I got from my CHI. Awesome! I experimented a bit with my hair, and I expected the curls to go away overnight because even after getting beautiful curls on thehighest heat with my CHI, the nice wavy hair I&#x27;d get would never last more than a day (it&#x27;d revert to very flat mostly straight hair). To my surprise when I woke up and looked in the mirror my beautiful curls and waves STAYED!! This was NEVER the case with my CHI, I&#x27;d always have to do the process over again to get my hair just the way I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy with the HSI hair straightener. WAY better value than my CHI, at the time of this review its about $40, which beats that $80 I had to pay for my CHI. Its much better to wield, heats up VERY QUICKLY and gives me curls and wavy hair that STAY OVERNIGHT (I&#x27;m pretty ecstatic about this because I didn&#x27;t think it possible for my curls to stay previously when using my CHI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HSI is so cheap right now I may even buy another just as a back up and also if the price goes up. I&#x27;m sure this is the best hair straightener that I&#x27;ve EVER owned, miles ahead of CHI!! Take it from me you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> My first flat iron was big and bulky.  I wanted something more streamline that still worked as well.  HSI does a nice job of straightening my hair and since the heat is adjustable, it&#x27;s not too hot.  It&#x27;s also easy to handle.  I love the argan oil that came with it.  The oil is very light and does not weigh down your hair.  It gives it a nice sheen and smells really good.  I really like both products.</li>
    <li> I have very curly thick hair, I&#x27;ve had a chi and I feel this flat iron is the best. I&#x27;m so pleased with it also I recieved it in great timing. I love my new flat iron!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought my straightners cheap and thought the mediocre results were just the by product if my thick long hair.  Then I had tried my friends chi straightener and realized I didn&#x27;t have to settle!  After looking up before mentioned straightener on amazon I realized that this straightener had better reviews and was more in my budget so I gave it a try. I&#x27;m so happy I made this purchase. It takes me 10-20 minutes to do my think waist length hair where it was taking me near an hour to do it with drug store straighteners (revlon anyone?). LOVE THIS. Plus it comes with a glove and a satin bag.  What more could you want! And at this price it&#x27;s a steal!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  The heating &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; are nice and long so I can make less strokes thru my hair. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener after my beloved Sedu was essentially split in two by my 6 year old. I had spent over $100 on the previous purchase and was not very happy about spending that amount again. After looking at this product and reading the reviews I figured that, for the price, I would risk it (at the time it was about $40). WOW! Am I ever happy that I did. This flat iron is fantastic. It heats up quickly and keeps a steady temp.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, which was an issue for me with the previous product I owned. I also like that I received the heat resistant glove with this product, as I can now try some other styles, not just using my straightener but also with curling irons.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this. It was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> Im changing my original review because after owning this straightener for 8 months and taking very good care of it, one of the plates cracked in half as I used it and it took a chunk of hair off.  Not please with that at all!</li>
    <li> Great service, fast delivery and product is wonderful. I,ll be ordering another for a Xmas gift which i,ve already tryed on this person. She loved the results.[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]]</li>
    <li> A great product at a great price. You should try this before buying one of those expensive overpriced Chi irons. This flat iron works just as well, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> What an amazing tool.  I can&#x27;t compare it to another iron, because I&#x27;ve never used one before this.  It has transformed my unruly, frizzy hair.  I never thought I&#x27;d be able to handle ironing all this hair, but, like magic, I did it, without any problems.  I look like a completely different person, with hair I always wished I had.  I&#x27;m buying a back-up at this price.  Incredible product.  Heat glove is a must.</li>
    <li> I have only purchased cheap straighteners at the store that never really worked. I didn&#x27;t want to pay hundreds of dollars for a hair styling product.  This straightener is priced well and it works.  Now my hair is as straight and shiny as if my hairdresser just styled it.  I would highly recommend this.  FYI my hair is slightly curly naturally and thin.</li>
    <li> I bought the flat iron as a gift. I am a prime member and was able to receive the iron in two days. That is very important for me. Great Job!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace my CHI which I liked very much.  The HSI straightens my kinky hair very well!! I love that there is a temperature control on it as my CHI did not have one.  Using the HSI flat iron makes easy work of doing my hair!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it had so many great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed when I used it. I did notice that the orange light did turn green for a while then when I start using the iron it gets orange again. My hair is somewhat wavy and I have quite a bit of hair and even if I straighten it layer per layer... it leaves my hair wavy still and it doesn&#x27;t even look like it was flat ironed. I feel I could have bought a CHI and could have saved myself the headache of being without an iron practically. I can&#x27;t use it since it does nothing for my hair.... so now I&#x27;m having to look into getting another one, which is not what I expected. It even broke the ends of my hair causing me lots of split ends and had to go get a haircut to cut all the damaged ends. It seems for wanting to pay a low price... I have paid a high price since I am having to purchase another one. I am just so deeply disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my second Chi just quit working.  I was a little skeptical as I have bought a lot of different flat irons and none of them have worked as well as the Chi.  This one does!  I have very thick, course hair and couldn&#x27;t believe how well this straightened.  It works the same as my Chi for half the price!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the high quality of this ceramic flat iron!!  Heats quickly and has various temperature settings.  The price was FANTASTIC also!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The item arrived in a lovely package, but it took forever for the iron to heat up and it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair the way I expected. It also took the sellers a long time to send me the return address and then to return my money.</li>
    <li> When using the HSI The Styler Ceramic tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch, my hair is just as smooth and silky as when I leave the salon. I was very skeptical because I have always spent a lot of money on my flat irons but decided to give this one a try, I&#x27;m so glad that I did. It does not damage my hair like my expensive flat iron does. I am very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian with really puffy hair, had been trying some different straighters, however, it never gave the look i want. the \\&quot;HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron\\&quot; actually gives me the style i want, my hair is smooth but not like flat. so far, with the price i paid for, I&#x27;m really happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I received mine two days ago. I LOVE the oil and the flat iron! It heats up quickly and works in an incredible way! I have my own way of straightening my hair. I use a J&amp;D Heat Straight Brush and the flat iron at the same time. I would clamp my hair and have the flat iron above it... then I go downward. The brush will keep your hair straight and separated for the flat iron to heat it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location of the temp. knob and on/off switch is not something people like but I think it&#x27;s good. Because our hand is constantly slipping on the outside, we might switch it off or turn up/down the heat on accident. I wished it came with two gloves because I couldn&#x27;t decide which hand I should use it for. The straightener is hot and so is the hair. I used it on my straighter hand since the iron will ALWAYS be hot while your hair will cool down quick. The iron heats very quick. Mine reached max temp. in under a minute. The cord is workable. The argan oil is great. The pouch it comes with is awesome and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to get Japanese hair perm once a year. I didn&#x27;t do it this year and I really wanted my straight and non-frizzy hair. I also like tying my hair and untying it without a hair band print too so I decided I needed to get a flat iron to make up. I have dry, semi-wavy and puffy hair. Too much volume. It gets frizzy and nasty to work with so I always tie my hair. I got fed up and since it&#x27;s almost Winter, I would love to have my straight hair back/have my hair down. I can also use this to curl my hair, which is neat! Sometimes having curls isn&#x27;t bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get this or not because it seemed odd to me that it is originally $300 but it&#x27;s $40 on Amazon. I compared it to top flat irons and other plates (this is a Tourmaline... so it&#x27;s different in how it works and heats). This had many reviews but you can never go with that. I watched videos. After extensive research, I convinced myself to get it. It&#x27;s $40. If it can work likethe CHI that I&#x27;m use to, then it is worth it. I cannot talk about the longevity but for anything.. as long as you take care of it, not throw it around, or do anything bad to it, it should last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL:DR - It&#x27;s worth the $40. If you cannot afford the expensive $150-400 ones, get this. An inexpensive and expensive one will break anyway, you might as well go with this one. You&#x27;ll save tons of money for the same result. Every flat iron will damage your hair one way or another. You just need to use specific oil before working with our hair to protect it \\&quot;some\\&quot;.  If this isn&#x27;t straightening your hair enough, you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong. From my knowledge, the science behind it, the making of the tourmaline, at 410 degrees it should straighten any hair. Let&#x27;s hope it doesn&#x27;t fry it though. Different hair requires different temperature. 410 is too high for my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after bleaching and dying my hair, resulting in an unmanageable poof after blow drying. I have thick, wavy to curly hairy that prior to bleaching wasn&#x27;t particularly hard to straighten. It takes out the frizz and keeps it smooth until I wash it. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair pin-straight, but having never really used a flat iron prior to this, I&#x27;m not sure my hair type is even capable of that. All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> My daughter insisted on having this particular straightener for Christmas.  She is extremely picky about hair products so I&#x27;m sure this will be ideal!  The package arrived on time.  Although I have not opened the box (because it&#x27;s a present)it is not crushed or damaged in any way.</li>
    <li> I purchased the flat iron August 1 of this year.  It then started having issues (not heating up) in October, and too late to return it back to Amazon.  I contacted the manufacturer two different times, the later part of October and the first part of November.  A message came up saying they would respond back within 48 hours.  Never was able to fall back on the manufacturers warranty after 2 1/2 months of use.  DO NOT BUY FROM HSI AS THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.  I have had other brands of flat irons and have never had one die as soon as this one did.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the HSI flat iron and absolutely love it. I have curly thick hair and this flat iron works perfectly. It heats up quick and I don&#x27;t have to constantly keep going through my hair to get it straight! Love love love!!! I recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have tried several flat irons and none. Of them compare to this product . It leaves my hair soft and silky for days ! Also I usually had to straighten my hair daily cuz it would frizz up not with this one as I said keeps your hair straight till you wash again . I get so many compliments on my hair now :)</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this flat iron. I loved the results accomplished with this flat iron, My hair was nice,straight and flows beautifully. I have received nothing but compliments after using this flat iron. This product receives my Highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> I purchased the HSI flat iron for my daughter as a birthday present.  The price was fantastic, it arrived earlier than estimated, and the quality of the straightener was much better than any that I have previously purchased.  I loved that it also came with a 1 year warranty which other manufacturers do not always offer.  My daughter was so happy with it that I bought another for my other daughter for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I have fine baby hair- it straightens well but pulls a bit on my hair, I wish it was a bit smoother. Good for price, and if you have thick, curly hair is would probably straighten well, just be gentle!</li>
    <li> I saw this product listed on in a magazine as a &#x27;best products of 2012. The product works great and straightens my hair in half the time than with my old one. It also heats up really fast. I am really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I started using HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch a few weeks ago and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I have soft African American hair that is permed, However, because my hair is so thick it has been abit difficult to find myself a straightener to tame my thick hair! It got my hair bone straight and even comes with a sample of argan oil which smells really nice and makes my even softer. I do wish I had a bigger sample. It also gets really hot at the top of the straightener so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if the straightener itself wasn&#x27;t great enough, it also curls my hair the way I want too. Its almost as if I&#x27;ve left a salon! The only thing I&#x27;d complain about is the fact that it gives off a burnt smell if put on the max heat but other then that, I would recommend this straightener to anyone, especially those women who have hair like mine ! This straightener was worth the hassle! and the customer service was even better!</li>
    <li> The product is great because my daughter was looking at some other product the price range was crazy expensive.  I thought it was over priced.  So, I was looking around and I found this from Amazon.  The price is reasionable and it came with its cover, and glove.  It heats up very quickly and works great!!  I recommand to anyone who is looking for a flat iron.  My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I loved the product. It flattens your hair really quick. what i liked the most is how healthy my hair looks!</li>
    <li> This hair iron initially snagged my hair so I contacted the vendor, Blue Novelties, and they were more than happy to send me another unit- no hassles.  They have amazing customer service.  They assured me that the iron was snagging my hair because it was not maintaining constant heat and sent out a replacement promptly.  I like the iron because all the controls are on the interior of the iron.  Other irons have the heat settings and on/off button on the outside so as I grab the iron I may shut off the iron without meaning to.  That is my favorite part of this iron.  Also, it has a nice grip on the hair so it straightens more efficiently.  The smaller plates make it nice to be able to get the roots of the hair straight.  I love the sleeve that it comes with for traveling and storing.</li>
    <li> FRIED my hair ...will never purcahse this brand ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Delightfully surprised!  I burned out my far more expensive Chi by plugging it in, with a voltage adapter, to an outlet in Paris two weeks ago, and bought this HSI as an inexpensive temporary replacement while I shopped for a good price on a new Chi.  Wow, this is a great flat iron - better than the Chi, which I will NOT be replacing.  Plus I can use the HSI in Europe.  Very impressed!</li>
    <li> This is a not so bad flat hair iron but i think it is definitely overrated by the ratings here.  I purchased this based on the reviews but after using it for a week...i burned my forehead twice already...i use a flat iron everyday so i am an expert on this.  The last one i had was really good, lasted for many years and i pholly burned myself a few times carelessly.  But since this is a new iron i have been extra careful...still got burned.  Another thing i dislike about this...it is pretty heavy, imagine ironing your hair for 15-20 mins with your arms up with the weight.</li>
    <li> Love this straightening iron.  I have fine hair and I can dial down the temperature which works better on my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!!  Great value!!!</li>
    <li> Very good appliance, heavy and slim at the same time, you won&#x27;t need to push hard on ur strands👍</li>
    <li> I received the flat iron very quickly and was impressed with how well it was packaged, though it didn&#x27;t include the oil sample it was supposed to. As I was looking it over I was disappointed to find that it appears to be in used condition. There were scuff marks on the exterior and the plates look discolored. I thought I might as well give it a try and on the very first section of hair it snaggged and pulled like crazy! It&#x27;s completely worthless, hopefully I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> I was in doubt at first... But all the positive reviews were true! This works like those in salons that are sold for over 200 bucks</li>
    <li> I completely agree with the other reviewer that this HSI flat iron is better than the almost 3x more expensive Chi. I had one of the Chi, which worked well until it broke only after a few uses. Apparently that model had a lot of problems based on many of the reviews I&#x27;ve read (after the fact of buying it, bad on me). I&#x27;ve had the HSI iron for about a month now and it works great. The plates seem to work better (feels smoother going through hair) and it heats up fast. It took me a little practice and some experimenting to get my hair to flip and curl the way I wanted. A whole lot faster than my curling iron (which is now tucked away in a drawer somewhere). Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on longevity but at least I know it outlasted the Chi and saved me a whole lotta money!</li>
    <li> i did my research, on how to buy a flat iron and this product met all the qualifications, my girlfriend uses it and her comes out really nice, it doesnt burn or anything. i would say this product is worth every penny and the quality is great.</li>
    <li> I personally have not used this flat iron, but my daughter is the one who bought this item and she has told me that she Love&#x27;s it!!!!</li>
    <li> This straighter has the quality beyond the under 40 dollars that it cost to purchase.  The seller was amazing, the product arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  I have recommended this product to all of my girlfriends and adore the straighter.  This replaced a 130 dollar straighter I had and the quality surpasses it.  Buy this and you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener on Amazon for my wife. Her old one shorted out or something similar to that. I look at all the reviews online and read on some websites that HSI makes an excellent flat iron.  So, I decided to give it a go and see how my wife liked it. It came in a great package that looked fairly professional. My wife opened everything up and look at all the contents. It came with a glove, a little bottle of Argan oil, and the flat iron itself. She&#x27;s told me that it is one of the better straighteners that she has used. It seems to heat up well, maintain heat across the surface evenly, and straighten the hair with a professional look. So, I guess this is wife approved.</li>
    <li> I really was expecting this flat iron to be amazing after all of the reviews. Sadly it was not. It took me twice as long to use compared to my other flat iron which by no means is a fancy expensive brand, and it only made my hair semi straight. Had to go over it with my old flat iron. Not sure what the heat protective gloves are for, as this iron barely gets hot. No way does it go to 410 degrees. My old flat iron does a way better job at only 360 degrees. I am giving two stars because the Aragon oil that is included it really awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll post a more detailed update later but my wife and daughter absolutely LOVE this hair straightener.  Their comments were that it is the best they&#x27;ve ever used and was well worth the money.  My daughter uses it very frequently and still occasionally mentions how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Great value for an amazing product. It heats up very quick and straightens my hair beautifully. I love the little kit it comes with.</li>
    <li> i have thick coarse hair - had tried chi and GHD - this one is not nearly as good...returned mine</li>
    <li> Received this product within 2 days after ordering!  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a flat iron on my hair since my hair is poker straight as it is.  After being told it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have poker straight hair, a flat iron can do multiple things &amp; makes your poker straight hair stylish.....I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!  I tried it the first night of receiving the item....without using the oil that comes with it, I LOVED IT!!!!  You can pull your ends under (the look you get after blow drying your hair out), you can spiral curl your hair or even a light curl (any curl for that matter), or just straight up straighten all strands!  I&#x27;m not one that likes to spend time on my hair....I&#x27;m a throw up &amp; go type of girl, but after seeing the results this flat iron can do....I don&#x27;t mind spending that extra time on my hair!  Since this is my first time using a flat iron, I can&#x27;t comment on the flaws a general flat iron does have (like the changes in temperature when it&#x27;s on, etc.).  I could give or take the auto off timer option on them since all I do is put it on my ceramic sink after I&#x27;m done with it (unplugged, of course) to let it cool off, but I close my bathroom door so my cats don&#x27;t get burnt....my daughter doesn&#x27;t bother with that bathroom so no concern there!  But all in all.....in my opinion, this is worth the money!</li>
    <li> This straightener is great! It left my hair very soft and sleek. It heats up very quickly and there is an indicator light showing when it is hot (light turns green). I just noticed the light this morning and it&#x27;s helpful so you know when the straightener is ready.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for less than 1 month and it stopped heating up, so I am in the process of returning it. While it was working, it worked great!</li>
    <li> This is  a good, easy to use flat iron. I love using it, makes my hair silky and does a great job on straightening or even curling my hair. Nice carry bag comes with it, and a small bottle of Argon oil. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> She loves it - her hair looks great and she is spending less time making it look better than ever with this iron.  Extremely please with the purchase and fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Returned to amazon because it barely gets hot.  i have fine to medium caucasian hair and i still had to make several passes to straighten and could hardly create a curl.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, packaging, floating plates and build all seem decent</li>
    <li> Way better than what I was thinking as it wasn&#x27;t really expensive as the CHI! I have VERY curly hair and this iron worked great at straightening...So many compliments the first day! Can get a bit hot-- but just dial down the temp to what you need it at.  Digital version of this would be nicer but all and all great product!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these as a gift for my mom. She has thick, semi-course, half curly hair (not straightened, it looks like she has a bad perm job!) and the only flat iron that&#x27;s worked for her thus far is a $300 iron that she borrowed from me (which met it&#x27;s untimely end when she inadvertently knocked it off the bathroom counter). I was hesitant because of the price but it looked sturdy enough and I&#x27;m glad I took the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron delivers as promised.  She has been happily using it daily for over three months and has dropped it several times without repercussion - it also straitens as well as the $300 iron even on my fine, thick, half-curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of flat irons but I really love this one.  I am black, with type 4 hair and have been natural for almost 2 years.  This flat iron does straighten my hair very well.</li>
    <li> I and my daughters all have very long, curly hair...kinky/frizzy that is very hard to straighten, most products do not work. I was looking for an affordable ceramic straightener that would not \\&quot;fry\\&quot; my hair. This worked so great my daughter took mine to college with her and so I came back and bought another one! It heats up quickly, gives a smooth and sleek look that really last for days so it keeps hair very manageable between shampoos! I have tried many straighteners and this compares to some of the higher end proffessional products that have been used on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It heats up in less than 30 seconds and it also makes your hair shine! I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I received my HSI Ionic Flat Iron one day earlier than was told. You will not be disappointed. I love it. It makes you hair smooth and it glides as you use it. I would highly recommend this item. The price was awesome and the product is even better. I would like to buy a second one just to have on hand. You will love it. I never could afford the CHI&#x27;s everyone talks about. Or could not see spending that much on an iron. Buy this!! You will not regret it. It comes with a nice satin bag for traveling and a glove and sample of Argon oil that will make your hair shine. Love it and the company I purchased it from. Great delivery and service. As Nike says... Just Do It.</li>
    <li> The iron works great and heats up super quick. I&#x27;ve got thick wavy hair; the iron makes my hair smooth and shiny and stays straight all day. I was surprised when it came with a tiny bottle of argan oil and a heat glove. My only complaint is that I have trouble straightening my bangs because the iron is a little too thick to get close to the scalp which why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product at a good price. It is also good for a gift as it is packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I was in need for a new straightener and couldnt pass up the price. This has been one of the best ones I have used. Love that it comes with the bag as well. I will be ordering another when my daughter needs a new one.</li>
    <li> My hair is super curly so its usually hard to straighten but this flat iron has adjustable temperature settings that allow you to use the perfect amount of heat. It heats up quickly and works much better than my previous flat iron. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the glove and case the flat iron came in the plates are great they don&#x27;t snag your hair and its a great deal, and a very professional flat iron I would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Product is excellent given the price!  Lightweight &amp; warms-up quickly. I would have given 5 stars if the controls were on the side rather than on the inside.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and then ordered it.  I LOVE it.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and had expressed shipped to use for my company&#x27;s Holiday Party. The flat iron worked very well and heats up fast! The heat control is easy to change and I like that it has an indicator light to know when it is hot. I love all the extras that came with it and I would recommend it to anyone. I have very thick hair and it straightened my hair very well!</li>
    <li> Extrememly happy with the performance of this flat iron.  It&#x27;s high quality construction, heats evenly and great results every time.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this flat iron.  It heats up quickly, has a temperature control too.  It&#x27;s a bit heavier than my old CHI, but not so much that it made a difference.  Great product.  I&#x27;m happy I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I was a little uncertain ordering a hair straightener online, but I decided to go for it.  This straightener is a great price and it works really well.  I have wavy/frizzy hair and this smooths it out really well and doesn&#x27;t make it look fried.  So far I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a replacement to a 1\\&quot; Chi I bought five years ago.  This flat iron does the job well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a newcomer to the temperature control, but it is nice to have that option for different strengths. The iron heats up quickly and has a nice indicator button to let you know when it is or is not ready for action. I love the criss-cross pattern that is etched on the outside because it makes for a great grip that my last flat iron definitely did not have! The cord is very long; too long for my needs, but a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular item also came with argon oil, which I have not yet tried as well as a fabric pouch the iron goes in and a fabric glove, which all makes this a great gift option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron has turned out to be a wonderful replacement for my Chi flat iron. I would buy another product from this company in the future.</li>
    <li> I choose a two because the product does not get as warm as other straighteners I&#x27;ve had.  Also my hair doesn&#x27;t straighten well because of it not getting hot enough.  I was going to buy a different straightener that my hair stylist told me about. When I researched it on here, this product came up with the one I was looking for.  I told myself $40 bucks yeah right.  When I read the reviews I figure that I would give it a try.  I am very unsatisfied with the purchase to say the least.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of good and bad comments on this products and just wanted to give it a try so i ordered it.  i was very excited to try it out at first but was soon very disappointed...the Iron just wont heat up! there is an adjustable swift to however hot you like and there is a little light signalling whether it hot enough to use (green&#x3D;ready / red &#x3D; not ready)...i waited for 5 mins, the light turned green and immediately turned back to red as not ready to use...then after 10 min....15 min...it is still red...i gave up and am returning this useless iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener over 3 years ago and it still works like new! I don&#x27;t ever write reviews on products but I absolutely love it! I even bought a CHI hair straightener and it doesn&#x27;t work as good as this one. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking!</li>
    <li> I was optimistic about this product after seeing how many 5 star reviews it had, and since the price was such a bargain, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as they claim, and it also doesn&#x27;t STAY hot while trying to fix all your hair.  I have very fine hair, and it normally doesn&#x27;t take much heat to get my hair straight, but with this I have to keep going over pieces because it just isn&#x27;t hot enough.  I would recommend not wasting your money.  A cheap flat iron from Walmart would do a better job than this one.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is extremely picky about hair straighteners so I was pretty nervous picking one out for her after her paul mitchell one was lost somehow going through airport security. She absolutely loves this straightener and won&#x27;t stop telling me how great it is. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Like all the rest of the reviews sa  This iron is 100% better than any other iron I have owned. It&#x27;s a must!  If you want a great iron for a fantastic price this is it.❤️</li>
    <li> The professional packaging let you have the sleek iron in an elegant silk pouch that comes very handy for storage. There is an indispensable heat protectant glove that I always coveted my stylist for having. It makes a decent job in keeping my fingers safe from burning. The HTI professional flat iron is truly a life saver. The ceramic blades turns my dry hair into softer locks that are frizz free. It has simple buttons that can’t get you confused and the grip is perfect to prevent slipping. The light is very handy turning between red when it’s warming up to green when it’s ready. It heats up to medium temperature in less than a minute. Your last surprise is the argan oil sample they threw in with the flat iron. This is a true miracle. If you have textured hair or a dry one, this si a must. It softens, detangles and defrizz hair in seconds. The good part is the effect will last for 1-2 days, unlike other products which effect wears off in an hour or two. The oil looks viscous but once you rub a dime size drop in your hand, it runs so light and never weigh your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, GREAT packaging!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Does a great job.  Coes with the hot glove, too.  Can&#x27;t believe I got this at such an amazing price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great price!!!  I have super thick hair And this went through my hair smoothly and just one time was enough!! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic straightner for a fantastic price!  i would definately buy this straightner again!!  it works just as well as one that i bought for $150.00 at a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love it. I doesn&#x27;t burn your hair like the one we had and the hair feels nice and silky. It takes a little bit to warm up but just plug it ahead of time. We are happy with it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! I had an infrashine before and I was skeptical of switching but this was a great choice. it takes a little longer to heat up but it is worth that wait.</li>
    <li> I have a straightener that I love but wanted one with rounded edges to use for curling my hair. It works great for that and I can curl my hair in  half the time it takes using my curling iron. I actually haven&#x27;t used it to straighten my hair. My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut-off like my other straightener so I have to make sure I turn it off, no big deal.</li>
    <li> This iron works so quickly. It literally takes 1/4 the time the Conair model we had. I use it on my daughter and she loves the smoothness her hair has after, and it takes a fraction of the time. And for a 7 year old, that is a big deal! I would recommend this product to everyone. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great product,great price,great delivery,everything perfect, Im very happy with it and Im very high recommend this product. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for daughter...she loved it!  She told me it is the best product on the market.  Recommend buying this item.</li>
    <li> This iron is the best iron i have ever had! It makes your hair so smooth and silky and prevents my hair from burning!! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have Amazon Prime and based on the reviews I decided to give it a try. I ordered this product before I ordered anything else on Amazon. I have received the other products already and this product has not yet arrived as of this review nor have I received an e-mail letting me know it has shipped. This review is for timing of shipping and not for the product itself. I will update later on the product review. The reason I ordered this was for a gift to my spouse. I was hoping that a full business week would be enough for shipping and handling with 2 day Amazon Prime membership. This is the only product that I have ordered that has not arrived within 2 business days. I reiterate, this review is NOT for the product but the company&#x27;s inability to ship it out as advertised. I will update with product review. I guess I should have planned more time for a last minute gift to my spouse for she will not have it by the time our special date comes.</li>
    <li> I have used CHI straighteners for years and when my last one unexpectedly stopped working I decided to order this one. I love it! Works great on my thick, wavy, and frizzy hair. Would recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great! It leaves my hair soft and shiny and it stays styled all day. Also, it heats up so quickly. Just an all around awesome product.</li>
    <li> Heats really fast! Love how the light turns green when it has reached the desired temp. It was shipped fast also.</li>
    <li> Received this Flat Iron, and immediately fell in love with how fast it heat up and how straight it made my sometimes unruly hair.  The straightness lasts for days, and my hair felt soft, shiny and looked extremely healthy.  I also liked the Argan oil I recieved, it helps my hair stay healthy before and after straightening.  I would buy from this seller again, maybe get a curling iron.  I&#x27;ll definetly purchase the full bottle of Argan Oil.  I must mention I also recieved the glove which helped with the heat on my hands.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and hard to straighten. The only flat iron that would ever work on it was a Chi, but after reading so many negative reviews and seeing that the HSI was the most purchased product, I decided to go with this one and i&#x27;m glad I did! It worked so well! I didn&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair first either! In the past i&#x27;ve never even owned a flat iron because I had been so disappointed by cheap drug store brands. I would only borrow my friends expensive flat irons or go to a salon. Now i&#x27;m glad I have a professional quality one that works, so I can straighten my hair whenever I want!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing price for such a great product. This iron works great, has a heat control setting, and you can use it to style your hair straight or curly/beachy waves.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my wife she loved, was what she expected, she is very picky and now she can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair straightener. Would definitely buy again. Works like a professional straightener even on thick, coarse hair. I purchased another straightener many years ago, salon quality and double the price and this one far exceeds that one!</li>
    <li> Straightens hair and gets to temp quickly but doesn&#x27;t stay incredibly hot the entire time. For bangs it works excellent. I love the oil included. Cons: No automatic shut off and the placement for on/off/temp is hard to see unless you have bright lighting. It also does not clamp shut. Not sure why.. For the price it is a decent buy and gets the job done but I would not compare it to the Chi. There are a few other brands that are better with the features I like (such as automatic shut off) in the same price range.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a gift and she loves it</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! She said that it works well and makes her hair look so smooth and shiny. It heats up quickly but doesn&#x27;t damage her hair like some irons will do. She is very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many hair straighteners since the beginning of my straightening days. For the past year, I was using one made by Conair. I was pretty happy with it but over time, I noticed it was drying and frying my hair. I started on a quest to find a new one that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair but was still affordable.    Now, I&#x27;d like to introduce the amazing HSI Professional Straightener! It&#x27;s a heavy, professional flat iron that can be adjusted from 240 degrees to 420 degrees. My hair isn&#x27;t so thick or curly so I usually adjust the temperature to about 340 degrees or in between the lowest and the hottest setting. My hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in it and pulled out, which is one of the most important things for me. It has a rotating cord that turns with your hand so you don&#x27;t get wrapped up in the cord.  The plates are 100% ceramic so it shines your hair while your straightening. It heats up so quickly and is ready to use in no time! Mine came with a Heat Protective Glove but I haven&#x27;t had to use it because another great thing about the straightener is that it doesn&#x27;t get ridiculously hot on the outside where you can&#x27;t even hold it. It also came with a sample of Argan Oil which I am addicted to and will be purchasing the full size soon! It smells great and leaves my hair extra shiny! I was afraid to use it at first because I figured, putting oil in my hair would make it very greasy and well, oily. But this stuff does not do that at all! It soaks into your hair and leaves it soft and shiny. Another great thing about this straightener is that the on/off button and temperature controls are on the inside of the straightener. I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve used other straighteners and half way through wondered why my hair was being straightened. Well lo and behold, I had hit the off button and the thing would be off the whole time! Another thing I love that came with my straightener is the pretty red Travel Pouch. I used it when I vacationed in Cancun a few weeks ago to keep my straightener from getting damaged in my suitcase.    I did have one concern with the light indicator. It turned green and was ready to go but sometimes when I use it, it blinks red. I asked the company on their Facebook page and they reassured me that this is only because the straightener is constantly adjusting it&#x27;s temperature.    I&#x27;ve seen people say that they can curl and flip their hair with this straightener as well, but I&#x27;m not that experienced when it comes to curling my hair and haven&#x27;t tried this yet. Maybe I will practice and update this post if I have any success with that.    I&#x27;m really happy with this straightener, it leaves my hair straight all day and doesn&#x27;t get curly. It&#x27;s recommended for all ethnicities and all hair types from thin to course and curly. I&#x27;m recommending it to you if you were in the market for a new straightener or just want to upgrade your current straightener.  [...]</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I have owned this for 6 months and have used it less than once a week during that time- and already, it doesn&#x27;t work! It says it gets up to 410 degrees, but I have a hard time believing it heats up past 100 degrees. Either I got a dud or it&#x27;s just not a good product- either way, it&#x27;s not worth a dime. Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron a week ago so when it arrived recently I was super eager and excited to use it. I mean, I scored a GREAT deal on it...$39 down from $299 and there were so many great comments/reviews. Well when you think that something is too good to be true, just listen to your gut and avoid the hassle and frustration. First let me say that I have naturally straight hair, I just like to run a flat iron over it to give it that sheen and super straight, sleek look. So down to the nitty gritty...This flat iron is JUNK, plain and simple. The one I received looked used and when I held it and clamped it down, it wasn&#x27;t closing right. I&#x27;m wondering if it is a counterfeit or something? It&#x27;s clunky, heavy, the controls are in a weird/inconvenient place, it does not have an auto shut off, it doesnt get that hot, each section has to be done over and over, it caused tons of breakage and worst of all it pulls my hair OUT with every section I ironed. Even when I didnt clamp down hard at all, the plates would snag my hair and pull out several at a time...ouch! The indicator light kept going from red to green randomly during use and when I pumped it to max heat, it still didnt do the job. I was previously using a $45 iron that I bought at Sally Beauty supply and it is 10 times better than this one. I cannot for the life of me figure out why this product gets such rave reviews!?!?! Amazon was great as usual, very easy ordering and prompt delivery, but I will have to return this item. This is a lesson learned for me... you get what you pay for and if it seems too good to be true, then it you&#x27;re probably gonna get burned . I can&#x27;t imagine anyone in their right mind paying $299 for this product, heck I wouldn&#x27;t pay $2 for it... someone would have to PAY ME to use this piece of crap! My advice- don&#x27;t buy it, even if you&#x27;re lured in by an incredible price! I&#x27;m not one to review products I purchase, but I felt so jilted by this product that I had to give my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I have ever owned or used. I bought it for my daughter, who has thick, wavy, and sometimes curly hair, around chin length. I did her hair for her the other day, and this worked nicely. It took about 15 or 20 minutes, and did exactly what I expected: straightened her hair! I was inspired to try it out on my hair, which is well past my shoulders, thick, coarse, and very curly. I brushed my hair out and then spent about an hour to straighten my hair. This is the first time I have ever attempted it on my own, so that doesn&#x27;t seem that crazy to me, frankly. It got my hair pretty straight, but there was plenty of frizz. The oil definitely helped. Overall, I think it did a good job, but I feel like my hair length and texture definitely gave it a run for its money. I had to run through some areas several times, and the next day I did some touch up. My curls were definitely fighting to be seen. Blow-drying your hair straight as step 1 would probably make this an easier task. I probably won&#x27;t bother with my hair again, but will definitely be nice for my daughter. I appreciated the included glove. The iron seemed to get hot quickly and stay hot. My biggest gripe would be the location of the power and heat dial. They are on the inside part of the iron, which makes it somewhat awkward, particularly if you need to adjust the heat setting. For the price, though, I am happy.</li>
    <li> I really like this! It works so much better than my old straightener! Granted, my old straightener was quite old, but I am able to straighten my hair in half the time with better results with this one! The 1&amp;#34; width is on the narrow side, but that works well for my hair (I hair that is thinnish-medium width, shoulder length). My hair seems less frizzy and to last well when straightened with this item. I also really like the placement of the controls on it, they are placed where you cannot accidentally hit them while you use it. It heated up pretty quickly and overall worked well!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron on the market!  Great value for the money. You really do get what you pay for. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener as a Christmas gift for my sister from amazon.com. She loves it and says that it works beautifully! Great straightener for the price!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. The quality is much higher than the one owned by my wife.  Deduct one start for lacking an auto-off feature.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of straighteners and for some reason they ALL pull my hair. My cousin had a Chi that didn&#x27;t but they are so expensive. This one was pretty cheap and it works awesome, I just hate that it still pulls my hair.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as well at first because I&#x27;ve never heard of  this brand but it is amazing and leaves my hair soft and shiny and perfectly straight:)</li>
    <li> I had been using what was supposed to be a good hair straightener, then I tried this one . WOW!! What a difference!! I absolutely love this item!!!! Much better than any I have tried in the past!!</li>
    <li> for the price this hot iron is great!!! I read that reviews that this iron was better than the CHI so I decided to buy it. It&#x27;s good, but I can&#x27;t decide if it better than the CHI since my CHI iron was very old and really needed to be replaced. definitely worth the price though.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using it my hair looks wonderful and people think I look younger and better than ever!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Especially how quickly it heats up!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughters and they love it. great quality, great price, they said it is one of the best Flat Iron styler that they have used.</li>
    <li> This iron Works great ! Style lasts all day ! Doesn&#x27;t damage hair like other irons! Heats up instantly and heat is adjustable!</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener.  Love the bag that comes with it.</li>
    <li> i was bummin&#x27; REAL hard after i accidentally plugged my ancient (but loved) 1&amp;#34; CHI into a dimmer switch. on my birthday, no less! i debated whether i should go the chi route again but just couldn&#x27;t justify it on my college kid budget. i also thought of the way the edges would catch my hair and then definitely decided it was time to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in comes the HSI. yes yes yes yes YES! i have a mane of hair. no, really guys, i have a MANE. we&#x27;re talking two stylists when i get a blow dry kind of mane. it&#x27;s intense. it&#x27;s wavy-curly depending on the day and humidity level (i often call it my own personal barometer- i know when it&#x27;s going to rain when i have an afro kickin&#x27;). despite the volume of it, the strands themselves are really fine and prone to damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it used to take me about 20-30 minutes to straighten my hair AFTER blow drying it straight. with the hsi, i can leave my hair to dry as it pleases overnight, then straighten it in 10-15. that&#x27;s HALF the time it used to take, y&#x27;all! after that short amount of time, my hair is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-shiny&lt;br /&gt;-straight&lt;br /&gt;-humidity proof (mostly)&lt;br /&gt;-healthy&lt;br /&gt;-happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t tried to curl with it yet, but it is possible and i will get around to it eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have doubts, don&#x27;t hesitate. this thing is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert in flat irons by any stretch of the imagination. However, I researched a few different brands and largely made my decision to buy this product based on price and other customer reviews. I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for a few weeks now, and it has not disappointed me yet! I have incredibly thick hair, and most flat irons I&#x27;ve used before always lose their heat long before I finish my hair. The adjustable thermostat on this one is awesome, and it does not lose its heat while I&#x27;m styling my hair. My only criticism of the product is that it should have a safety shut off of some kind so that if its left on for an extended amount of time, it would turn itself off. I have already forgotten to turn it off once. I&#x27;m much more careful now! I love the product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great quality, amazing results! You really get a lot for your money and I am glad I purchased this product. The argan hair oil sample is divine and my thin/fine hair which is normally frizzy and dull is shiny and healthy looking every day I use it. I don&#x27;t think I could go for another brand of flat iron ever again. As someone who has actually never owned or used a flat iron before, it was very easy to use. Hands down some of the best customer service on Amazon, and sometimes that can be hard to come by from marketplace sellers.</li>
    <li> I got the HSI Styler Flat Iron when it was on sale for about $30-40. I usually only spend about $20 on my flat irons. But I do love this iron. It gets really hot so I don&#x27;t have to turn it all the way up like on my other irons, it heats up fast, &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I have NO complaints about this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I gave in to the amazing reviews of this straightener. You do get a lot for the price but it isn&#x27;t a HG product. I had a corioliss before this that lasted me 8 years before I forgot it in a hotel while traveling. I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it so I found this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The straightener is quite heavy and the plates do not line up perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: tourmaline plates and the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 months now and it is still holding up.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool. I received it before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Works great! Much better than what I had before. I thought it was a good product especially at this price!</li>
    <li> Heats very quickly, straightens my hair impeccably with a nice lasting curl on ends.  So for those of you who have thick, curly hair, I recommend this HSI flatiron!!!</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron. HOWEVER, it does not shut off automatically! I had been afraid I would forget to turn it off. I forgot yesterday and now my bathroom counter has two burn marks on it!</li>
    <li> Works well and leaves hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Worked great until it broke.  I had it less than four months.  Very disappointing, because the return date has passed.</li>
    <li> My cheap straightener stopped working on me and I had to replace it. I bought this straightener based on the great price and reviews and I am very happy with it. I can straighten my fine hair on the lowest setting and it looks wonderful.  With my old straightener I had to use the highest setting and my hair still looked bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this in October of 2012, and in January 2013 for the first time, it accidentally slipped off my bathroom counter and fell onto my tile floor. The corner chipped off and now there&#x27;s a crack, lengthwise, down one of the ceramic plates. I can&#x27;t even use it anymore since it rips my hair to pieces. One of the biggest reasons I bought it was because of the raving reviews about their customer service (In case someone else needs to find them, contact them here: [...]). After contacting their customer service, which did respond quickly (kinda, but that&#x27;s another story!), they told me that drops are not covered under the warranty. I understand that, but I would hope a product, that is going to be used in bathrooms (and that are usually tiled), would be able to at least withstand one drop. I really liked this flat iron when I had it, but unfortunately now I need to find a replacement. In all fairness, the CS agent gave me a $20 off code to use on another flat iron from their website. But, since they&#x27;re marked up in price on their site, Amazon is still a better deal. Plus, why would I want to buy another one, because of course at some point it is going to slip off my counter. Just a heads up to future buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I contacted Amazon about returning this flat iron, and even though I&#x27;m well past the return by date, they will still accept my return, with a 20% restocking fee. Better than nothing!</li>
    <li> Its not as hot as it should be i don&#x27;t know if it really heats at 400• degrees maybe I was expecting more.</li>
    <li> Excellent professional device. Really like my wife.&lt;br /&gt;thanks seller&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this seller for cooperation&lt;br /&gt;It is very convenient that the device voltage. power can work all over the world.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for two days now and I have no complaints about it, except for the lack of \\&quot;sample\\&quot; argan oil. It probably will only last one or two days, then you&#x27;ll run out and be forced to pay 15 bucks for a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time yesterday and my hair is straighter than ever! Fantastic product! I&#x27;ve already started recommending it to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the expensive versions once it heats up. tough to get to the dial inside the iron to turn the heat up or down, but I leave it on one setting. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Came fast, but wouldn&#x27;t get warm after being plugged in for 20+ minutes.  We tried several outlets in the house, too; just to make sure that it wasn&#x27;t our problem.  Returned product, then it was removed off of Prime.  Now to reorder, we have to wait almost two weeks for shipping unless we want to spend big $ for the newest model... ugh.</li>
    <li> Amazon ran a special on this flat iron, and as I was in the market for one, I decided to go ahead and order it based on all the positive reviews I had read. Shipping was fast, so that was good, but I didn&#x27;t use it for the first couple of days that I had it. When I finally went to use it, I noticed a small chunk of the ceramic plate was missing in the top corner, but I don&#x27;t know if it happened during shipping or if maybe my daughter dropped it (she says she didn&#x27;t). It doesn&#x27;t affect the usability, so I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and I&#x27;m just not that impressed with it. It heats up fast and has a light that tells you when it is ready which is nice and it has a nice travel cover to go over it, but I had hoped it would slide effortlessly over my hair like my hairstylists&#x27; does, but it seems to catch a little here and there, like the plates are a bit rough. For what I paid, I suppose it does alright, but if I had paid over $100 for this, I would be very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a greats straightener.  The cord is extra long which I prefer.  And it heats up really fast.  A year later and I am still using this guy everyday.  I have thick, unmanageable curls and this straightener has no problem getting them straight as a stick.</li>
    <li> What a great hair straightener!&lt;br /&gt;I got much more than I expected and was very happy with its presentation on arrival as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my wife for Christmas, and initially it was very nice. Worked perfect and she was able to do the curls and flips and straighten her hair just the way she wanted, then after about a month she started having issues with the power cord. Sometimes it just turns off and she has to reposition the power cord to get it to come back on. We&#x27;ve tried using a different outlet, and using a power strip, but still have the issue.  Once it&#x27;s back on it works great again but there are just those moments when the cord doesn&#x27;t connect properly.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend it. I accidentally left my chi at a hotel. After reading the reviews I decided to cheap out and buy this to replace the chi. Bad idea. This doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. My hair isn&#x27;t as smooth and is definitely frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;I want to give it away, but who wants something that doesn&#x27;t really work?</li>
    <li> I love it. It works really well! Everyone always assumes that I&#x27;ve paid $100+ for it. In other words, it&#x27;s very excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a new flat iron for her birthday so I did some research and it led me to HSI. We ordered the Flat Iron and it came as promised but with a small amount of damage. One of the ceramic pads had a chip out of it the risk of shipping anything these days. So we contacted Amazon and they sent us a link to HSI returns. I went on line with them and within a couple of hours there was a another brand new on it&#x27;s way to us that arrived within a couple of days. Bottom line is both company&#x27;s were a pure pleasure to deal with. Thank You HSI and Amazon. My wife loves her hair Iron and we will deal with them again.</li>
    <li> Tis an excellent product works great and affordlessly makes hair look great works way better then the cheap store brands well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had a CHI, which my inconsiderate roommate broke and lied about breaking, and cheaped out and got HSI as a replacement. I appreciated being able to control the heat settings (something the Chi lacks), but this is not as good of a hair straightener. It has a smaller heating area, which means you have less surface area and can do less hair at once. The effects also don&#x27;t last well through the next day like my Chi did. I&#x27;m going to stop being a cheap ass and replace the one I like.</li>
    <li> Although I bought this hoping it would be faster to get ready and turns out it takes a bit of time to straighten every strand, I do love it! It works great, and the ability to change the heat setting is easy and convenient! Thank you, and I highly recommend buying this product! Price is very reasonable and shipping is speedy. --V</li>
    <li> the flat Iron does not burn or damage the hair.  I bought it to add waves and curls to my wife&#x27;s very fine hair.  I have no experience in hair styling and was able to do a commendable job even the first time out. ( My wife survived a massive stroke a few years ago.  She was also a professional hair stylist)</li>
    <li> High quality straightener , but I still prefer my chi. with my chi it probably took 5 minutes less time to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener is by far the best bang for your buck out there. Works great, can use it to straighten or curl. Doesn&#x27;t make hair frizzy or dried out like some other cheaper straighteners I&#x27;ve tried out. My only issue is the quality control on it, since mine died out after just 2 months of using it (and not everyday at that). It seems most others haven&#x27;t had an issue with this so I guess I&#x27;m the exception. If it hadn&#x27;t died I would have given 5 stars, hands-down.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It heats up quickly and is easy to use.  I have very fine hair so I was worried about my hair getting damaged by a flat iron but the adjustable heat setting has helped my find the right temperature for my hair.  The only thing that is a negative is the temperature setting dial is hard to see and hard to get to.  It took some time finding the right setting because I could not see the dial.</li>
    <li> While searching for a flat iron, I always came back to this one so I decided to order it.  I&#x27;m so glad I did, it&#x27;s an awesome product!!  Heats up great, runs through the hair smoothly and leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy.  And....a value!!  I&#x27;m a thrifty shopper so believe me when I say..u won&#x27;t find a better deal for a quality product.</li>
    <li> This iron works much better than my daughter&#x27;s Chi. One pass and the cuticle is sealed - giving your hair a silky look with no split ends. Amazing price from this seller!</li>
    <li> This item arrived promptly and the quality of the product was excellent&lt;br /&gt;Would definately recommend this store to anyone.  I will&lt;br /&gt;use this service again.</li>
    <li> antes que todo un cordial saludo quiero deseasrle exitos por las ventas echas y nunca tengan ningun tipo d eproblemas</li>
    <li> This straightener is just as good or better than the $100 one i purchased two years ago! Works great, and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this iron!  It heats up pretty fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait too long, especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  I usually use come heat protectant products plus the HSI argan oil (which smells good :]) and when I glide down iron down my hair, it comes out shiny, soft, and overall more healthy looking from my damaged hair.  What was the best thing about this iron is that the price was so reasonable compared to the other irons out there that charge you $100 or more.  I love HSI!!!</li>
    <li> This really works like it is described. The argan oil that comes with it is also excellent .I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay straightener, it pulls your hair though, i will be using it as my backup but went out and bought myself another chi</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used! Love the price too!  Easy to use for an amateur like me...</li>
    <li> My last straightener was heavy and you could not flip the ends of you hair with it. I have longer hair (mid back) and had to use it 5-6 times each section to get my hair straight. I can use this one 2-3 times and its much lighter. My arms do not get as tired and my time is shorter with this. I have not tried to curl my hair (thick and heavy so does not hold well anyway), but im sure it would do a fine job.</li>
    <li> junk it broke a month later</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Works well on curly/course hair. Reliable seller, received my product on time and was content to know it brought other small gifts, such as the glove, and a small hair oil bottle. Over all, perfect experience with this straightener. (:</li>
    <li> Works great! Just like a chi if not better! Nice case and gets very hot! comes with glove too. Im a hairdresser and this is wonderful! I have think hair and makes it nice and soft and stay straight. I wouldnt use the aragon oil use morrocan oil</li>
    <li> Recommend this product to any female who needs a great straightener.Its the best straightener that I have purchased and very reasonable in price.Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this. This is best thing I have gotten. I have thick and course natural hair. I use this product in very small sections of my hair. It is just as good as what my regular hairdresser uses. Now I am able to do my own hiar and saving money</li>
    <li> Great for my natural hair</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking I was getting a flat iron and did not receive the iron only received the heat resistance glove for the price of $39.99</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a great price love the tool !</li>
    <li> Love the price and the flat iron. Gets hot and stays hot and does a great job on long hair.</li>
    <li> Terrible straightener. It pulls your hair and makes it extremely staticy.</li>
    <li> something was wrong with it. It didn&#x27;t heat up&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t send it back because I didn&#x27;t keep the box</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
    <li> my children an i love this product and we have shared it with friends. they work really well and get reall hot without burning your hair.</li>
    <li> Returned this because it did not heat up.  It would heat and then once I started using it, it would act like it turned off and cool down.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! I did A LOT of research before I picked this flat iron... infact I was looking around the $150.00 price range. I read the reviews of pretty much every flat iron on the market and this one met all the criteria I needed. I have naturally curly hair but fairly thin hair so I&#x27;m not sure how this flat iron would work for someone with really course hair but it works really well for me. It closes snugly &amp; allows for easy sliding through hair without pulling. This price is ridiculously low - seriously best buy out there!! Buy this product you will not have any regrets!&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast. The cord rotates easily. I use it to straighten and to do the &#x27;flip up&#x27; style at the ends. Easy to manoeuvre. I specifically wanted / like the 1 inch plates.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed. It heats fast and is incredibly smooth. Cons: it&#x27;s a little heavy but I have fine hair that straightens quickly and right on the box it says there is an argan oil sample but I didn&#x27;t get one.</li>
    <li> Where to begin. The product does not hold its temperature. It regularly drops from \\&quot;green\\&quot; (ready) to \\&quot;red\\&quot; (heating up), and not just when in active use. And the plates are not smooth, so it doesn&#x27;t glide over the hair. Instead, there is a bit of sticking, and I can hear my hair snapping off when I&#x27;m using it. Unfortunately, I got this right before a trip, and I wound up having to use it. I did so as little as possible. As soon as I returned, I boxed it up and it is going back tomorrow. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best straighteners ever. So quick and easy to use, and it came with a sleeve that makes packing it a breeze. Love.</li>
    <li> Perfect packaging. Quick delivery. Product works great! I didn&#x27;t think I could get a flatiron that would work that well. So glad I found this one!</li>
    <li> This straighter is OK.  It is smaller than what I expected, but it gets the job done. It would work much better if the ceramic plates were longer.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is of very high quality. The ceramic plates are a huge bonus to the flat iron.</li>
    <li> High quality iron!  I have thick hair and it works wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this iron for the past 5 months (with Argan oil) and love it!! Worth every penny and heats up in 1min.  Nothing to complain about, would highly recommend and I have very thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> The straightner arrived on time, but once I had opened the box I found that the aragon oil had exploded and ruined the travel bag, but the straightner survived. I have used sylica straighters for about 10 years and I was drawn to this one because of the price, but you get what you pay for. My hair is not as smooth and the straightner does not seem to get hot enough, even if I krank it to 410 degrees. I will use it a couple more times just to make sure, but then I am going back to my old brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this after the plastic in my ten year old Chi straightener broke and plates fell out.&lt;br /&gt;First of all this HSI straightener is better than most typical straighteners, but it is not better than the CHI. The CHI leaves your hair locked in straight and will not turn frizzy until days later, the HSI works and then an hour later your hair is frizzy at the ends again. Also, the HSI takes longer to straighten. I can go over one inch sections of hair quickly with the CHI, but with the HSI you need to stay on the hair longer or go over slower for it to straighten. However, the price is good for what you get, but Id rather spend twice as much next time for perfection with the CHI. The Argan oil and the gloves were a nice treat though! Loved the oil!</li>
    <li> I must say that the reviews are quite &amp;#34;over-hyped;&amp;#34; its a good flat iron that is up to par with a CHI &amp; GHD. However, it doesn&#x27;t wow me as much as I was hoping for. I&#x27;m not disappointed and I&#x27;m still happy with the price for what I got.</li>
    <li> still have this and have had no problems at all.  I love this hair straightener.  Heats up fast and works great</li>
    <li> After seeing all the reviews, I was excited to receive the iron. I am very disappointed. I use it on the hottest temp and its still not hot enough. I have to run it through my hair 4-5 times before seeing any results. I also was hoping to use it to curl my hair but it does not glide through my hair easily, leaving crease marks. Not happy with this purchase :(</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with this.  It works fine, but not as wonderful as a lot of the reviews.  I have another one that was much cheaper and this one is about the same.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to heat up. Not a bad product at all, but definitely could not compare to higher end straightners like the CHI. Great for its price though.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron based on the user reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did! It&#x27;s the best iron I&#x27;ve used to date. It heats up pretty quickly but my one peev about it is that it won&#x27;t straighten my hair to my standard on the lower heat setting. I have semi thick hair, mostly full. It does do the job on the higher setting but I have to make sure I use a heat ptotector before I use it. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and everyone! Well worth the money! It is one of the cheaper ones that I&#x27;ve looked at compared to the Infrashine flat iron. So if you are on a budget and looking for something that does the job, this is it!</li>
    <li> I have thick frizzy hair and this is the first flat iron that straightened my hair. Smooth silky and shiny it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I was originally going to purchase a Chi hair straightener, but this one was $10 less, so I decided to get it instead. I&#x27;ve only used it once but really liked it. I have fine hair so I didn&#x27;t turn the heat setting up all of the way, but it was definitely hot enough, and the ceramic plates prevented my hair from sticking. My only complaints are about the controls. Instead of being a digital display on the outside of the hair straightener, the temperature control is a dial that you spin on the inside of the straightener, so I don&#x27;t get that satisfaction of knowing exactly what the temperature is. It is also easy to bump the dial and turn down the temperature, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it. Overall happy, but the controls are definitely a let down.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product due to customer reviews.  I have used a CHI for many years but this one does a better job.  I cannot believe how quick and easily my hair straightens.  Not to mention how healthy my hair looks.  This is a keeper</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was a great buy, however, its not. It takes forever to heat up and I don&#x27;t really think that it is working correctly. I&#x27;m thinking about returning it.</li>
    <li> Great product that arrived quicker than I expected.  Straightens and curls the end of my hair better than any straighter I have ever used before.  Even came with a silk bag to store straightener in and also a small jar of argan oil!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mom. She says it works very well.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this flat iron but when I used it I was not impressed. The iron does not get hot enough to do a flawless job with one swipe.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Much better than the previous hair straighteners I have owned! Definitely recommend. The price is also good, as well.</li>
    <li> I really needed the Worldwide version (with voltage options) for an upcoming trip abroad. After much research, I finally decided on this one and figure I&#x27;d just buy a voltage converter separately. Imagine my surprise when it arrived and was actually the Worldwide version!!  There is nothing in the description to indicate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heated up very fast and operated as I expected. Appears to be of high quality. Love that it comes with a travel bag too!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It heats up quickly and makes hair smooth.  I also like that it has a heat adjustment knob.  I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> everything about the straightner is good. But I noticed burnt type of fragrance after straightening my hair</li>
    <li> This product was given as a Christmas present.  It was only March when it stopped heating up.  Past the return date.  This product worked great when it worked.  But I am very dissapointed we are unable to return it because it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
    <li> This iron is easy to handle and made my hair feel silky.  Didn&#x27;t pull my hair and was easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, leave your hair smooth, soft and straight last day long. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My flatiron randomly stopped working for no reason and I have tried in every way possible to contact the seller but no luck. I spent a lot about this nd was hoping it would last longer than  year</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was skeptical about trying this out because it had some negative reviews and she never used HSI before but ever since I just bought it and put it in her bathroom she fell in love and she is very picky when it comes to anything beauty related.</li>
    <li> This never got hot, only warm.</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on all of the other exuberant reviews. For what I need this works great.&lt;br /&gt;Love that the cord swivels and that there&#x27;s an indicator light that tells you when it&#x27;s up to temperature. It also heats pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Not so crazy that the on off switch &amp; temperature knob are on the inside. Also doesn&#x27;t stand up too well vertically.&lt;br /&gt;Wish this had a higher temperature/ stayed at temperature better &amp; that it had an auto shut off or that the heat light was more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual straightening goes, does a good job. I have thick greek &amp; italian curly/wavy hair and use the highest temperature. (I always blow dry my hair prior to straightening it, but it is extremely thick so it never gets bone dry from this) Although I have to do a few passes, it does seem to get my hair pretty straight. I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t stay up to temperature constantly. That little indicator light after one or two passes goes back to red and I have to set it down for it to heat back up and turn green (which I don&#x27;t have time to do so I just keep using it). Didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as quickly as I expected based on everyone&#x27;s reviews (but i have crazy thick hair). All that said, for the price I am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also curl with this straightener supposedly, but I have no idea how and any experiments of mine have not worked out too well.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it feels in my hand and the swivel cord is great.  I did find the temp control was in a difficult area to adjust and without better markings it was hard to determine what temp the iron was set.  Also the on and off switch was on the inside too.  It would be easier and safer to use if they were on the outside. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because my hair dresser burned my hair really bad.  I was in a panic.  Someone told me about the HSI products, I ordered the HSI styler ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron along with the HSI Argan oil. What a difference!  I will need to get my hair cut to correct all of it, but I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I used to have a chi, and while it did the job i think this one for 1/3 the cost does much better, and i can straighten my hair really fast. It comes nicely packaged with a cover, the only thing i wish it had was auto shut off because i tend to forget i have it on but that doesnt deter from the quality.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! Said it works like dream, and she has thick curly African American hair!</li>
    <li> Works very well and heats up quickly.  Has a dial for temp on the inside of the handle where you wont be constantly hitting it and changing the setting. Came with a heat glove that I haven&#x27;t needed to use and a carry bag and a small bottle of Argan oil.  I use this a couple of times a week and haven&#x27;t had any issue with it. It has a light on the under side that turns green when it&#x27;s ready. Having it on the bottom seems odd, but it heats quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
    <li> This item just went out today (3-14-2015). It work perfectly before it went out.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased by Mary my wife who is writing this review.  So far I have been very impressed with this item.  It came beautifully packaged with added features including a storage bag, glove and hair product.  I have only used it a few times, so still perfecting my technique, but have received many compliments on how nice my hair looks.  I have wavy hair, not curly and once I am finished blow drying, I use the iron to make my style look sleek, shiny, and sassy. The iron heats up quickly and I love the variable heating dial on the unit. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted a 1\\&quot; or 1 1/4\\&quot; model, but am very happy I selected this 1\\&quot; model.  Thanks for a wonderful iron.  It is a very professional unit at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly and been using it for months no problems at all.definitely worth what I paid for it</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this straighter works great. Love how I can give my hair some curl as well. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just as wonderful as the more expensive &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34; but a much better price.  I bought 1 for myself  and then bought one for my daughter too</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons!!  I am an African-American woman. I have natural hair and typically wear braids. I wanted irons that would allow me to straighten and  style my own hair with the same results as the professional stylists. These irons are the best. They leave my hair so silky. An I must add that I am a novice. I have never had great success styling my own hair. But after the encouragement and tutelage of my new hair stylist armed with a conditioner from the heavens by Joico, I gave it a try and I must say, these flat irons are....an  Amazing product. The handles don&#x27;t heat up and burn my hands. They do exactly what my friend said they would. I was sooo excited that I washed, straightened and styled my daughter&#x27;s hair too. She also has natural hair. She is an athlete and I typically leave her hair curly because she works out alot and I prefer not to apply heat to her hair regularly. But I just had to see. They worked very well. She was beaming with joy. Her hair was silky and straight, with one pass through.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener on a one day sale for an incredible low price. I have two other name brand straighteners in my household (3 teenage daughters, unwilling to share) and this works better than both. I would absolutely recommend this. I bought it from Amazon and it arrived to my doorstep in a couple of days. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought a Chi for twice as much &amp; it broke after 6 months.  This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  My hair is thick &amp; has a tendency to be frizzy and lackluster.  After I use the HSI, it is amazing how shiny and straight my hair can be.  Can a flat iron really work miracles?  I guess so!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this hot iron.  It does not get hot enough to really straighten hair.  I have wavy hair.  I blow dry it straight and then use the hot iron.  My old Vidal Sassoon, that broke, would get my hair stick straight with one pass.  No matter how thin of a section, or how many passes I do with this hot iron, my hair always has a slight wave.  Typically with a hot iron, there will be steam as you run it through your hair, but not with this one.  I really wonder who wrote all of these positive reviews and regret buying into them.  Be weary.  I am looking for a new one now.  That was $50 down the drain.</li>
    <li> I like the straightener. It compares to my HAI that I had for 15 years. It heats up fast and works well.</li>
    <li> So let me start by saying im cheap. I tend to go for the best deal and tend to always get what i pay for so to speak. Not this time, i did a TON of research and looked over hundreds of reviews. I was more than willing, for the first time, to invest in some serious cash and didnt have to! I also bought the argon oil in advance, as well as a hsi hair dryer. My hair was dry, straightened and silky smooth in 20 min!!! I have thick red hair so my hair takes alot of work to get it where i want it, but not anymore! Also, im not much into reviews but i felt i HAD to let everyone know how AMAZING this product is!!! Hopefully my review can help convince someone to purchase this wonderful product!!! Also purchased through amazon, and my whole package got here a day early! Cant beat that!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first flat iron I bought. I heard a lot about the CHI ones and not the HSI. The reviews on your site really helped me pick this one. Not only was the price great, the product is fantastic. Not sure what I did before this. Shipping as always was super quick. Thanks again for another great order.</li>
    <li> Really love this product , it is what it says it is.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve always tried to curl my hair with a flat iron and it never worked very well.  The first day I got this, I curled my hair in 10 mins and it was so easy!  It&#x27;s very nice to have one tool that&#x27;s so versatile that allows me to curl or straighten my hair effortlessly.  Would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener and while I thought it was good, I decided to return it as it was basically as good as another straightener I already had. I had a great experience with Blue Novelties customer service. They approved my return very quickly, even though there was nothing wrong (defective) with the product itself. They did not immediately refund my money upon receiving my shipment, however, once I emailed them asking about the status of the refund they refunded my money immediately. I was very pleased with the customer service and you can purchase this product with the assurance that you can return it with minimum hassle if it does not meet your needs.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Its the second time I purchased it, the first one I gave it to my daughter, still working like new!!!</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this product - great value and product!</li>
    <li> This flat iron lasted me a year and it broke cause I stepped on it. I used to buy the cheap ones and they lasted a month. Just ordered a 2nd</li>
    <li> Still have some frizzy in the same trouble spots, but better than the irons I had.</li>
    <li> Mine broke within less than a year. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Best I have ever used!!&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful with the heat. If your hair is not very thick or course you are better off starting with a low heat setting to be on the safe side.</li>
    <li> did not heat. I can&#x27;t give any good feedback since I got a defective iron. Just waiting for return now!</li>
    <li> great price for the quality, had a pyt but dropped it so many times it over heats and i needed something new and this what i anybody needs . i have thick curly hair and it goes straight and full of body</li>
    <li> I received the flat iron in a very timely manner- roughly 3 business days. The packaging was good, and it works as advertised, without pulling my hair like so many flat irons I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is where the temp settings knob is located(in the \\&quot;V\\&quot; where it comes together), but once you get it set where you need it, you don&#x27;t really need to mess with it. It does get very hot, so depending on your hair type, start low and work your way up to find the setting needed.</li>
    <li> great product! easy to use, good results</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I looked at several other more expensive products before purchasing this one and I am glad I did.  It works so well.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! Absolutely awesome for curling hair! (If you know how to do it unlike me..lol) Definitely a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this! Great value for the price</li>
    <li> My hair routine just got 10 minutes faster.  Excellent iron!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron ever. I have frizzy hair and it always bothers me. The flat iron is hot enough on the ceramic plate to make my frizzy hair totally straight and SHINY, and will not burn you on the outside when touched your skin. I&#x27;ll recommend this to whom has frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Horrible flat iron, I would not recommend to buy this one - it never sets, the red light is always blinking and plus, it doesn&#x27;t even get hot.</li>
    <li> Good quality flat iron.  Makes my hair nice and smooth.  Would recommend product taking into consideration the relative low cost point and quality feel of the product.</li>
    <li> The straightener works fast and leaves the hair silky and smooth. For a small fee you get a very quality product! I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!! I have a Chi and the HSI is better and I got a deal on it. Happy with price and does great on my hair ,I have thick curly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> After seeing all of the great reviews of the product I decided to get the HSI styler over other products. However, I wish now that I would have spent the extra $40 on another product because this one was not what I expected. The reviews stated that this product was better than a CHI and other high ranking flat irons, and because I wasn&#x27;t happy with my CHI I thought that would be wonderful! But, the times that I have used it, the HSI doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near the temperature of the CHI, it&#x27;s heavier, and hurts my hand when I&#x27;m using it. It barely gets hot enough for me to get my hair straight. So, I&#x27;m not very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she LOVES it! It is a very high end straightener for a reasonable price! She also loves the Argon Oil. Highly Recommend it!! :)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a back up in case my GHD flat iron should break.  I tried it out to make sure it works and i&#x27;m shocked and happy to say that it works just as well as my $200 flat iron. Heats up nicely and pretty quick.  Feels very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I bought one for myself and cousin and soon I&#x27;m ngoing to buy one for my sister.</li>
    <li> After having the same hair straightener for many years, I decided to try a new (&amp;less expensive) flat iron after my old one broke. I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the  product and like that I can change the temperature unlike my previous one. I think this is an excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good deal - heats up quickly, I like that it has a temperature control. It does snag on my hair a little (unlike a more expensive one my mom has), but definitely worth the price. I&#x27;d buy it again :)</li>
    <li> Even though I really feel like giving this only 1 star, I&#x27;m putting 3 because I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one? It has to be on the highest setting in order to get my hair straight and even so my hair will go frizzy 5 minutes after. The four times that I had used it, it had randomly shut down while it was still in use. I was so excited I even purchased the full size version of the argan oil it came with so the straightener would leave my hair even better...But I can&#x27;t help but feel dumb now for doing that, since the straightener won&#x27;t even work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! Works great on my new a-line haircut. The adjustable heat settings make it the perfect iron for my thick but fine hair. It makes my hair nice and smooth without leaving frizzies like other flat irons do.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this flat iron and would recommend it to anyone, even though I don&#x27;t flat iron a lot!</li>
    <li> I like the Argan oil that it came with but the glove is a bit of overkill. It&#x27;s a good flat iron...my only regret is that I did not spend the extra $ for the model with the digital temp read out.</li>
    <li> The flat iron I irdered is great it&#x27;s sime to use. It came with a holder for it which is so convenient overall a good product</li>
    <li> I have a horrible time straightening my hair.  I was about to give up until I tried this straightener.  It actually gets hot enough to straighten my hair (and nothing else I&#x27;ve used has worked).  The argan oil that comes with leaves it silky smooth as well.  And the glove is awesome to prevent burns on the hand when working with something this hot.  I couldn&#x27;t get these results out of a $100.00 straightener.  Would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair, so that might be the reason I didn&#x27;t love this straightener. It didn&#x27;t glide smoothly through my hair, but just seemed to pull at it. I wasn&#x27;t impressed- I returned it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I got a great deal on amazon. It&#x27;s everyday you come across a $200 straightener for $39. So I thought I would give it a try, and I am so glad I did! It&#x27;s worth it. It heats up fast. I have super thick hair that is so hard to manage. I had been using a cheap conair straighter that I finally just tossed out because it did not get hot enough to straighten my thick hair. The HSI flat iron seems to be very durable, and has an adjustable heat setting. I keep my setting almost all the way up because my hair is so thick. But it&#x27;s great for all hair types. I love this straightener!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, I LOVE this iron. I&#x27;ve had other kinds before and always thought &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the big deal?&amp;#34;  Then my daughter borrowed mine and told me it was garbage. I ordered this one and when I first used it...it actually worked. I love it!!!  What a difference.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, unfortunately my daughter said that it would pull her hair and she preferred her previous brand of straightener. So we returned the product and was promptly refunded our cash. Great way to do business. Would buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> This is a vast improvement over the last one I had. It heats up fast, and is very smooth. The value for what you get is perfect.</li>
    <li> Price was too good to pass up, so thought I would give this a try.  Have always used a CHI in the past, so was a little worried about something new.  Love this product.  Works wonderful.  Comes with a glove and beautiful pouch to travel.  Easy to handle and easy on my hair.  Will definitely recommend to friends and family.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I could not pass up the great price on this. I&#x27;ve had a Paul Brown straightener for 12 years and could not get myself to spend $175 on a straightener. This one works fantastic making my hair feel soft and am I run it through my hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was perfect for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.  A friend suggested it and it was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this flat iron! I love the look, the price, the carrying case, the sample argan oil, and the fact that none of my friends know about this brand yet so I get to tell them. I would definitely buy again and recommend to friends!!!</li>
    <li> My old flat iron  was crap.  Took me several times of going over my hair to get it to look right.  This one takes one swoop and my hair looks like I just came from a stylist.  It is shy and perfectly straight.</li>
    <li> I have curly/frizzy hair...this curling iron makes my hair smooth or I can curl with it.  The oil that comes with it (sample) is great too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase of this hair tool.  I normally don&#x27;t spend much money on styling tools, but I wanted to treat myself.  I&#x27;m not one to use styling tools very often as I have natural curly hair and to straighten it I just blow dry it out.  But sometimes you need to go over sections and this does the job nicely.  My daughter loves it cause she can make those long pretty curls.  ( she has curly hair too but sometimes likes a change).  I love the travel bag that will come in handy on business trips.  I recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent straightening iron.  I&#x27;ve owned a few very expensive ones and while the original price of this one was very high, I got a very good price on mine and ordered a second one as a gift, as I am VERY happy with it!  In addition, it was delivered on time, well packaged and in great condition!  Extremely happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Do worth the price, and easy to use</li>
    <li> This HSI Ceramic Tourmaline flat iron replaces a Chi original, which quit heating after a year.  In comparison, the HSI actually achieves a better, smoother, shinier result.  I would guess it&#x27;s because of the adjustable heat feature of the HSI.  Now if it will just last longer than a year, I will be very happy!</li>
    <li> Smooths hair to a shine! Heats fast and smooths quickly on my thick, wavy hair. Love it! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a flat iron, so I have nothing to compare this product with, but it works well.  It&#x27;s smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I have ever purchased, and only the second one I have used on myself. A friend recommended the HSI to me, and she has used many different ones! When she told me she bought hers with a Groupon for $45, I didn&#x27;t think I was going to find it for under $100, and not knowing if I was going to use it regularly, I really didn&#x27;t want to spend anywere near $100! Found it on Amazon for $39.99, list price $199 and knew I had to buy it!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my type of hair. I was using a cheap flat iron so I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my hair smooth and with a relaxed hair texture. Have to mention my hair is really kinky.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  This is the first quality Flat Iron I have purchased in a while and have high hopes that it will provide me with great hair days. I normally will not purchase any product that has bad reviews, needless to say this product has received great reviews!!</li>
    <li> I, too, have had CHI&#x27;s previously. I had 2, and both stopped working within a year.Both cost well over $200. I had never heard of HSI, and was not sure, initially. The price really convinced me to give it a try. I was happily surprised! I have thick, curly hair and the HSI works very well. I burned myself on numerous occasons with my CHI. This is not an issue with the HSI, as the outer cover stays cool. It heats up quickly and goes through my hair smoothly. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use it a few times since I received it less than a week ago. It heats up fast and plates line up nicely. I like that it is dual voltage. I use it to curl my hair, not straighten. The delivery time was very good. I only gave it 4 stars because it hasn&#x27;t passed the test of time yet.  I have had this iron for 3 years and it has developed a short in the swivel part of the cord and won&#x27;t stay on when using. I think a flat iron should last longer than 3 years. I will not buy this brand again. I liked it while it worked.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well.  It closes evenly and glides smoothly down hair without getting any hair caught in the iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these flat irons, one for my teenage daughter and one for myself. This seller shipped the product very quickly, it was just as described and both of us couldn&#x27;t be happier with not only the performance of the flat iron but also the reasonable price. Highly recommend this retailer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a great deal for the price however, the straightener itself is just okay for me. I&#x27;ve used the CHI hair straightener since 2007 and I thought it was time for a new one. I have slightly wavy Asian hair and it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to straighten my hair but its quite a battle with this straightener.  It heats up quickly but the hottest setting is just not that hot (maybe because my hair is thick). It also feels like it tugs my hair often during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used the Japanese Tsubaki Oil and thought I should try out the recent Argan oil fad. The Argan oil is good, the smell isn&#x27;t too strong. It does feel a little greasy compared to the Tsubaki Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for a little less than a month but I&#x27;ve used it 5-6 times now. I think this is a good product for people on a budget but I don&#x27;t particularly love it. I think it would be better to spend a little bit more for a hair straightener that has a higher heating settings and won&#x27;t tug your hair as much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for curling but my hair doesn&#x27;t turn out as straight as I want it to be. Overall great and would recommend.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a flat iron that could do curles too, becouse i already have folica 1.5&#x27; and did not do good of a curle so i gat this one its not as good as i expected it is worth the money though for what it does but its hard to slide and i have very thick hair it takes longer does not hold the temp constatly and pulls hair out, i think if there is a better product out ther it did not deserve a 5 star rating, i think it performs acording to its price and no more then 3 star. overall its not the worse!  i deceded to keep it just becouse it was cheep and hasle is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The flat iron was very heavy and felt like it was tugging at my hair. It left my hair looking frizzy and didnt keep it&#x27;s style for long. Unfortunately, I had to return the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had such great reviews. It has definitely lived up to them! I do need to turn it nearly the highest heat, but it makes my hair shiny and bone-straight! Doesn&#x27;t fry it out either, my hair is silky straight now! :)</li>
    <li> I got it thinking it was a great deal seeing as how it was originally over $150 and I got it for $40 but it sucks. I have curly hair and it snags my hair and doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as my $40 one from target that I bought 2 years ago. Definitely a fail</li>
    <li> Works great, gets really hot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron after my Sebu one broke unexpectedly.  So far it&#x27;s worked comparably well, but it takes a little longer to do my hair since the barrel is thinner.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It was time to find another flat iron, as I needed a thinner profile and one that would pack easier than the wider, rather clunky Revlon one I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this one.  It has an off/on switch located on the inside, so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while using.  The plates are very smooth and glide off my hair, with no catching or pulling - very important!  The thinner profile allows me to be more precise in styling. It heats up very quickly.  The added bonuses of a padded case and a small bottle of finishing oil were a very nice touch!  This company has my business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> this is great product. It gets hot very fast but it&#x27;s hard to get burn unless you touch the hot spot. This is my first time usinng straitner and I don&#x27;t have any problem with handling it. The free pouch is nice and I love hair oil which gives me silky hair. The reason I gave 4stars is because of shipment. I got it very fast about 2-3days later from when I ordered. But the carrier guy just left package out side of my apt garage door where anyone(even someone whose walking the street) can have it. Fortunatly my neighbor picked up and gave to me. Other than that I definatly recomment this hair straightner! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this straightener gets such great reviews.  It&#x27;s fine.  It gets hot like it&#x27;s supposed to, but it also catches your hair and pulls it, unlike my old Conair straightener.  Straightening my hair is now painful with lots of strands getting ripped out.</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional 1 flat iron straightener is an exceptional buy! It is performing like it cost triple the price I paid on Amazon. The free glove and pouch are an added bonus. The travel size of Argan leave-in oil treatment has proven to be excellent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed one thing when using the straightener, however. The green ready button shifts to red periodically while in use. Not sure why but this has not affected its ability to perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I believe this is a good product for an exceptional price.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Love the temperature control, and that it allows the flat iron to heat evenly. I have relaxed hair, and got a new hair cut that requires some flat ironing. It was very important for me to get one at a great price, that will heat evenly, and not burn my hair. After reading some reviews, I decided to give this one a try, and it is simply amazing. My daughter has natural hair (no relaxers), and loves it also. I have to keep going to her room each time I need it, because she uses it all the time. I am having a little bit of an issue not turning the gauge while doing my hair, but I know that it I will get pass that soon. I am planning to surprise my daughter with one for her birthday in a few months. Great buy at a wonderful price!!</li>
    <li> This straightener works very well, especially for the price I purchased it for on Amazon. I have thin hair and do not need to use the highest temperature for it to straighten my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this straightener. I am an African American woman with thick, curly hair, and before purchasing this product, I had difficulties getting my hair completely straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing this straightener about a year ago, I have stopped going to salons because I&#x27;ve been getting professional results. I am constantly getting compliments on how healthy and smooth my hair looks. Additionally, I have tried this product on relatives with similar thick, coarse hair. This product gets hair bone straight and I&#x27;ve found that it works for creating all types of hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this straightener to everyone because it seriously works. Also, contrary to what some of these reviews state, i&#x27;ve found that this straightener gets VERY hot if you take time to learn how to properly turn up the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not write such long, in depth reviews, but I am very satisfied with this product and the silky-smooth effect it has on my hair-in addition to the affordable price. This product earns 5 stars, for sure. Buy it, I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly! It gets just hot enough to leave my hair straight but not burnt. This is a very good hair straightener and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Does a good job.  Bought it mostly for the dual voltage so I can use it overseas as well.  :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend who wanted a Chi, she&#x27;s definitely glad I went with the HSI. She said it&#x27;s the best flat iron she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> I would like to start off saying i have coarse, frizzy hair and have used many different brands of flat irons over the last 15 years. I received this flat iron for Christmas last year. At first I was impressed with how quickly it heated, but found that I still needed to make multiple passes to ensure my hair was straight and frizz free. Over all, this flat iron is good for the price, but I would recommend spending the extra to purchase a Paul Brown Hawaii flat iron instead.</li>
    <li> got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She uses it daily. Her hair always looks amazing, I assume she is happy with it and would recommend</li>
    <li> The HSI professional flat iron is wonderful for the first month. I&#x27;ve purposefully waited to review the product to give it a fair shot.  The flat iron will sometimes work and sometime cut off without warning.  Pressing the reset button on the power adapter and then waiting a couple minutes does not fix the issue.  I bought this product to replace my chi and at first try this flat iron was just as good as the chi, now with the few issues I&#x27;ve had I don&#x27;t think it measures up.</li>
    <li> TOOK ON A TRIP, WORKED GREAT ON THE FRIZZ EVEN THOUGH IT IS SMALLER THAN WHAT I NORMALLY USE.  GLAD I PURCHASED IT</li>
    <li> Great! Can&#x27;t beat the price. I have owned two more expensive ones that died and this one seems to work just as good. Plus I won&#x27;t be as upset when I need to replace if at this price.</li>
    <li> Very hot, works great! I&#x27;ve always used a chi in the past bc I have super crazy hair and the ones in the store never worked for me. This performs just as good or better than a chi for a fraction on the cost!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, and long hair. I was very happy that the HSI Pro get hot enough to flat iron my hair. I was able to get my hair smooth and shiny. I love the size of the iron. The pouch and heat glove are nice accessories. I will be recommending this flat iron.</li>
    <li> for the price this is a great buy. It gets really hot and works very well.</li>
    <li> Note bad for the price, it&#x27;s a good iron, but doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair with two passes I am use to 30mins and done with my hair! this one take 45-hour to get my hair somewhat perfect. I cover is nice and the free LITTLE bottle of oil  works great in my hair.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and does a great job.  My daughter is a hair dresser and uses it everyday. It fits comfortable in your hands without burning yourself.  The only thing they could do to improve is that the numbers on the heat control are hard to see but otherwise than that, its a great product.  It shipped fast and packaged securely.</li>
    <li> A little information about my hair: it&#x27;s frizzy, it&#x27;s wavy, it&#x27;s curly, it&#x27;s resistant, it&#x27;s coarse, and it&#x27;s damaged...to sum it up, it&#x27;s just a big hard to manage tumble weed of a mess. I invest quite a lot of time and money for my hair to get results some girls can simply wake up with. If a relationship were this high maintenance and not going anywhere, I&#x27;d be tempted to kick it to the curb. Anyway, I have several flat irons that I use. I think this one overall is great for its price and results. It glides through my hair smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cause breakage. The results look nice and smooth. Despite it being a 1 inch, it straightens nicely and heats up very fast. I like that it can keep my hair straight longer and looks more natural. It also comes with a glove and a tiny sample bottle of the argan oil. I&#x27;ve been using that little bottle of argan oil and it&#x27;s pretty nice. Not sure if I would actually buy the bottle as it smells so synthetic to me but the reviews on Amazon is pretty good for it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have long thick wavy hair and it straightens it with little effort! Get very hot and  very easy to use! Im very happy! The best ive ever used</li>
    <li> I love this tool. It arrived during the expected delivery date and had no damage.</li>
