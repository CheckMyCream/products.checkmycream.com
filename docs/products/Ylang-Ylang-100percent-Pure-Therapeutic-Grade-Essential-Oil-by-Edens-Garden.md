<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great luck with the oils from this company.</li>
    <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden! Great for the price :)</li>
    <li> came in very fast. the bottle was as big as expected, about 1 1/2&amp;#34; tall. smelled fresh</li>
    <li> I so love this product especially the price!</li>
    <li> As I have said before I really can&#x27;t say enough about Edens Garden Oils. The more you use the more you like them.</li>
    <li> First, Ylang Ylang is my go to perfume, one drop on the back of my neck is perfect for a light airy perfume. Also I only use Eden&#x27;s garden oils, and I use them everyday.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils. I was attracted to the very reasonable prices of course, and after reading a few reviews, it seemed safe enough to order from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ylang Ylang essential oil is a scent that I have only had limited experience with, but EG&#x27;s version seems alright. I plan to use it in my own homemade beauty products and in a diffuser from time to time. Compared to Aura Cacia&#x27;s Ylang Ylang oil, this one does seem to lack intensity of aroma a bit, but overall I am satisfied with the purchase -- especially when the low price has been factored in. For my purposes, it will do.</li>
    <li> price is right but I sell a different product line</li>
    <li> I really like Edens Gardens. I buy from them again and again.</li>
    <li> I love Ylang Ylang! for someone who has PMS, some light acne, and wants to be in a better mood its perfect. This brand has worked great!</li>
    <li> The oil and the delivery were fine. There is nothing wrong with the product or the seller! I just didn&#x27;t like the smell as much as I thought i might. Live and learn. I would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I use this fragrance a lot, and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> love it , smells good in my bath water.</li>
    <li> I received this item today 01/20/22015 item description as described thanks for your prompt shipping I received all 3 items.</li>
    <li> Smells good! And now to make bath bombs!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell but I gifted it to my sister and she liked it :)</li>
    <li> If you love the smell of cough syrup-this is your oil.&lt;br /&gt;Dishonest company, only shares the &amp;#34;five-star&amp;#34; reviews for their oils. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this product when cleaning my floors with the mixture of vinegar and baking powder and added a few drops of ylang, ylang...the smell was refreshing.</li>
    <li> Intoxicating oil that blends well with many oils in my body butters.</li>
    <li> Yes, this ylang ylang is very beautiful smelling. I love it.</li>
    <li> smells so good that canada has come to me</li>
    <li> Good quality, definitely strong.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing oil, it smells sooo good. It&#x27;s a tiny bottle but the stuff is really strong, it&#x27;s great diluted in my diffuser. Its very floral and sweet. Love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the products! Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed! Great prices and fast shipping. Customer service is nice and replies very timely. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very subtle, clean, warm, deep. Applies well.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product by Edens Garden I was not sure how it would smell, but YLANG YLANG smells very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I make my own hair products and this was one product that I will purchase in the future. My product came in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I use it in homemade skin care products, no complaints!</li>
    <li> This essential oil is a strong, sweet, powerful experience in a (5 ml) bottle!  It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the floral effect one is likely looking for.  Smelling Ylang Ylang directly out of the bottle can be intense, while using a drop or two and letting it disperse and settle (as in a spray) allows its best qualities to come forth. Edens Garden delivers quality essential oils, I count on them when looking to try out new ones, Ylang Ylang was exactly what I expected, would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find oils that smell this true to the scent. This is fantastic!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is tainted by a chemical odor that repulsed me. Yeager ylang is one of my favorites, but this is awful.</li>
    <li> Great blend &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed any difference from DoTerra oils</li>
    <li> I thought this would smell better....</li>
    <li> I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!! highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Great essential oil. A plus in the box they also put a booklet on what oil does what. Justt getting into the oils.</li>
    <li> prompt shipping and product as described</li>
    <li> thanks, great product</li>
    <li> Love the oil, not a fan of this smell.</li>
    <li> Love these oils.  Will purchase more!</li>
    <li> i have been having issues with high blood pressure and could not get it regulated with meds .  i started using three drops of ylang ylang and lavender and rubbing it in over my heart and carotid arteries.  my bp is a steady 111/72 with no meds!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this oil to mix with other carrier oils as fragrance. I also put a few drops in my bath water and sometimes let it steam in my shower. very invigorating fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love ylang ylang.  I would definitely repurchase it.  This is my favorite scent.  Very sensual and earthy.  I wish it was bigger.</li>
    <li> this is by far one of my most favorite oils.  the smell is so relaxing and yummy.  I mix this is almost every concoction I come up w/. very good quality.</li>
    <li> great and came with great info on oils!</li>
    <li> Love this product even though it wasn&#x27;t what I originally ordered I wanted rosehip seed oil but realized it wasn&#x27;t it. tried it and loved it love the aroma, imediately calming and refreshing to the spirit. Although the bottle is so tiny all you need is a couple of drops and it last all day long great for carrier oil with almond oil for hair and body.  If you don&#x27;t like strong smells though do not buy it is very strong for me but I love it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first about buying from a different company but you have won me over. Works great for me. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell, just not big enough!! Please make them bigger!!😂</li>
    <li> small bottle goes a long way</li>
    <li> Perfect well packaged I like all of the scents I have purchased priced right I would recommend this seller and product and I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> I have used Ylang Ylang before but this one reeks of an odd smell.</li>
    <li> it smells awful, almost like urine. not worth it, no matter how cheap it is.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite compared to others.  I&#x27;ve used products with Ylang Ylang and the secret it probably to mix it into something else (lotion, shower gel) to get that faint hint...by itself, not so much.  I recommend mixing with products that contain vanilla scenting to counter balance.</li>
    <li> my extent of essential oils has been tea tree oil on my feet and using oils in place of perfumes.  Trying to rid my life of some chemicals and get some \\&quot;clarity\\&quot; ive started building up a nice supply of therapeutic oils. I started my collection with a bottle of ylang ylang oil. okay i know this stuff is suppose to be an aphrodisiac and maybe it is. ive been using it 2 days and havent been around people so i dont know but i do know one thing. this stuff is a stress reliever. i read up on it and i read that it does relieve stress and regulate the heartbeat. ive always been a little nervy. As soon as i had a few drops rubbed into my skin i felt a sense of calm and relaxation go over my body. I honestly could have either gone out and socialized or curled up on the couch and gone to sleep. it just gave me a total peace of mind to do whatever. id suggest it for people that deal with anxiety issues. i know it will be a regular part of my life for now on. edens garden is a good distributor and ive already told friends about them. good product and price.</li>
    <li> All  the essential oils I&#x27;ve ordered from Edens Garden have been great.</li>
    <li> I use the Ylang Ylang Essential oil to add to my Hair and Mud wash shampoo.  It smells amazing.  As I indicated, I bought it to use in my clay mud wash and have recommended it to my youtube and facebook followers.</li>
    <li> I love their products Since I have tried them I havent used anybody else I would recommend to anyone if you make bath and body products theirs is the best. their ylang ylang is great and it works wonderful in my products. It blends well in my bath oils its great for fighting acne and works well for balancing combination skin. Their bottles are perfect and easy to use no dripping problems at all. I use this product in  my favorite bath oils,my best combination is  ylang ylang and bergamot to help fight back acne my friend and family love to get this bath oil from me.</li>
    <li> Just as shown in the picture. It is very a small bottle. I love the smell and I mixed it with aloe vera juice and water and spray in my hair. Makes my hair feel and look great!! Hair does not feel dry anymore. .</li>
    <li> This is a very good smelling oil.  I use it along with other oils that I&#x27;ve purchased from Eden Gardens.  I love all of their oils...very high quality oils.</li>
    <li> Not a very good smelling oil so actually threw away but that was my fault because I ordered something I didn&#x27;t know what it was.</li>
    <li> I enjoy trying the different oils.  I haven&#x27;t quite convinced my family that they smell good or are that beneficial, but that&#x27;s ok.  I find this smell to be pretty interesting.  I like the floral fragrance.  If you are more into flowers instead of something earthy or woody, this would be for you.</li>
    <li> Great quality great price</li>
    <li> Used in Diffuser last night and it seemed to help, having alot of congestion and can&#x27;t sleep so used with a few others.</li>
    <li> Smells the best I&#x27;ve ever gotten of this scent</li>
    <li> The Ylang Ylang oil has a nice subtle aroma and great for summer. It&#x27;s not overpowering as some therapeutic grades are and has a calming affect.</li>
    <li> Had to get used to the smell, but when mixed with the other ingredients to make a face mask, it works wonders!!!</li>
    <li> Used in homemade lotion.  Super duper essential oil.</li>
    <li> I love this essential oil! this is the only brand of essential oils I buy! The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a five was because the shipping was a little slow this time, but great product!</li>
    <li> I have no clue if this is 100% real essential oil but whatever it is, it did its job. I bought Ylang Ylang (along with a ton of other essential oils) to add to my hair concoctions and thats exactly what it did. It lasted me an entire year even though it is much smaller than the other ones. I love this oil. I still have a tiny, tiny bit left which I will continue to use in my future hair concoctions.</li>
    <li> This stuff smelled so awful to me.  I couldn&#x27;t give it away.  I will not buy this again or recommend.</li>
    <li> I have bought several essential oils from this company and an very happy with all of them.  I have bought from many others but will continue to buy from here.  The shipping was super quick, the scents have all been great.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will be around for a while and continue getting their great products out there.</li>
    <li> Great products so far. Need more time to rate the overall results of using them. Great so far though! Waiting</li>
    <li> this was a great add to my collection of essential oils...makes a great addition to soaps and lotions..thanks, i&#x27;m very pleased</li>
    <li> I have been substituting other oil combinations to make the perfect flowery smell. This brand nailed it. I love the soft floral smell. Happy camper.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden is phenomenal! Their mission to sell at the lower cost is the best ever!!! Thanks to Edens Garden I can afford oils for my special needs daughter.</li>
    <li> Making my own cosmetics and lotions and this is essential to any homemade soap recipe to get you feeling fresh and frisky.  Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Do you like licorice? I don&#x27;t, and for that reason, I don&#x27;t like this oil. It&#x27;s strong and it lingers long after it has burned - which is a great thing so long as you enjoy the smell of licorice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as aphrodisiac properties, I dunno. It&#x27;s not going to help anyone in that department if you don&#x27;t like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this oil is the real deal. It&#x27;s very high quality and the brand/seller, Eden&#x27;s Garden, is phenomenal. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with their oils  and if you happen to need their customer service, I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s outstanding, too.</li>
    <li> The price was amazing. It met my expectations. I would recommend this product to any one who is into essential oils, Thank you.</li>
    <li> I took a short class on essential oils for stress relief. Ylang Ylang was identified as a good oil combination to be used. I love it. It has a nice floral scent and I really feel like I get some great benefits when I use it. I have bought a lot of Edens Garden therapeutic oils and find them to be high quality and a great price.</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say about this product ,it is real pure essential oil. Also i liked the paper with some recipes for home and personal using.</li>
    <li> excellent would buy again</li>
    <li> This product smells great, I will continue to use it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great essential oil</li>
    <li> Nice quality essential oil..</li>
    <li> wife got to help her sleep at night</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with beeswax to make small perfumes and it reminds me of pine-sol. Not using it at all.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of Edens Garden Oils was the lavender. I was looking for a 100% pure oil. I was a little spectacle being that its a reasonable low price and that well come on-purchasing online is not the same as in person. You have to go by gutt feeling and the positive reviews which plays a big role on online purchasing. Well OH am I pleased I followed my gutt. This is why I am writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I recieved my lavender, which came two days of ordering. Once you open that top OH you can distinctly smell that it is a pure lavender oil. It comes with a neat book as described that gives you a background of each particular oil and its uses. It has a built in droplet top so you can easily use and not spill.  I was also surprised that a day later I recieved a phone call from the actual retailer asking how I felt about the product and if I was pleased. She also asked for an email for discounts on future purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have purchased Ylang Ylang which blends lovely with my Lavender. Tumeric, Patchouli and Clove have been added to my collection. I highly believe the retailer when they label 100% pure. My son suffers from eczema and these oil mixes have been a great use. I also have had recent surgery and my scar is getting lighter with the mix of clove with tumeric and I dilute with 100% coconut oil that I purchased elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I love my oils and I thank god I followed my gutt and found Edens Garden Essential Oils. My next purchase will be the 14 bottle of 10ml synergy blends. I cant wait for that.&lt;br /&gt;All in all 5stars on delivery, customer service and product. For those who complain about scent its all on self opinion. Scents vary from person to person. Every oil has their distinct aroma. Whatever oil you purchase that is what it will smell like. Like my clove yea it smells just like clove as does tumeric smells of tumeric. Your getting what yourpurchasing.</li>
    <li> Yang Yang is supposed to have a sweet floral smell but this is far from it. I can&#x27;t quit place what the smell reminds me of, but it has a spicy fragrance to it somewhat like clove. Either way it&#x27;s nowhere near what it should be and I can&#x27;t use it in my lotions so it was a total waste of money. Maybe my bottle was compromised, but this was the first and last time I buy essential oils from this company.</li>
    <li> Too small - I like the scent but I wish the bottle was larger. The price was just right thanks</li>
    <li> I do not enjoy the smell of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils. They could really smell a lot better and I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but they are not relaxing or enjoyable.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! THESE OILS ARE AMAZING AND WHAT A GREAT VALUE. THANK YOU EDENS GARDEN</li>
    <li> Ordered the oils to make rice bags at Christmas time and they worked perfect!  Loved the quality and price!</li>
    <li> SUPER FAST SHIPMENT!  EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!  SUPER PRICE!  THANK YOU!!!!</li>
    <li> Ylang Ylang is a great essential oil. Edens Garden are less expensive and their website contains great info for the multiple uses of their essential oils and product arrived well packaged.</li>
    <li> I ordered this when I was first getting into essential oils (it was so cheap!) but I was very dissapointed.  The smell is very heavy and floral but very unpleasant to me, almost nauseating.  I gave the bottle away to a friend and I know she hasn&#x27;t been able to use it either because of the overpowering smell.  I&#x27;ve learned more since then and have bought a higher quality ylang ylang extra (first distill of the flowers) and I LOVE the smell.  This company doesn&#x27;t specify but I believe this is probably what is called a complete distill.  Basically, they distill the batch of flowers over and over until they can&#x27;t get any more oil and combine them for a cheaper but lower quality oil.  Spend a little more money and buy a first or even 2nd or 3rd distill ylang ylang for a much more enjoyable scent and higher therapeutic value.</li>
    <li> Very strong scent too hard for my nose</li>
    <li> ylang tlang is such a relaxing smell. I put a little in a bath or the laundry. So sweet, I use it for everything .I ts is a very tranquil smell.</li>
    <li> smells terrible, and i usually like yland ylang</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  It was nasty.</li>
    <li> Have not tried it yet,but I will.</li>
    <li> Use as a moisturizer after I bath not shower. Overnight I awoke to him loving the scent and feel of my skin. lol... I wish this came in huge canisters.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil and seller!</li>
    <li> Extremely strong and floral, use with caution as it lingers for long and can give you a good headache.</li>
    <li> the quality of ylang ylang is the same quality of young livings product only much cheaper. helps calm my nerves.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Great aroma for my vaporizer.</li>
    <li> Ylang Ylang and Sweet Orange are my two favorite types of Essential Oils. I&#x27;ve tried several other fragrances from Eden Garden, but didn&#x27;t like any of them. Don&#x27;t be confused; their quality was the same as my preferences, but they just weren&#x27;t pleasant enough for my sense of smell. Each time that I finish one of my favorite two, I quickly re-order them. In fact, I don&#x27;t even wait until I&#x27;ve completely emptied a bottle before I re-order it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this fragrance. I mix it in my African shea butter...and use it on my hair &amp; on my skin. Looking forward to purchasing more oils from Eden Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle Khumalo</li>
    <li> Good for hair growth and strength as well as very aromatic scent to homemade products or just therapeutic properties also</li>
    <li> I got this scent because of the reviews- I also heard that this scent is good for mood elevation. It came in just a few days, and the wrapping was wonderful- It had a fluffy package with a thick layer of bubble wrap. I opened the little bottle and took a light whiff. Now I know that straight on oils are not always true to scent. So, I put 4 drops of this into my vapor diffuser. After a few seconds, a sickly sweet scent filled the air. Yuck. It is the kind of scent that just seems to drip into your throat. I immediately stopped the diffuser and cleaned it out. I hate this scent... However, just because my personal preferences are different than people who like sweet scents, I don&#x27;t want to take off stars. Well, maybe one. But! The oil is VERY high quality, and is 100% natural/pure. I can&#x27;t really argue with quality, can I? I suppose one drop of this mixed in with other scents can be nice- so I will try that, instead of simply this scent.</li>
    <li> I love EDENS GARDEN! I have a plethora of oils now that I use for my face...moderate acne and acne scars. I am so glad that I found out about the use of oils and I hope they continue to be such a great experience. I&#x27;m an African American female with oily skin (my entire face,not just my t-zone lol)... Give EO&#x27;s a try if you have been battling acne for a long time.</li>
    <li> Long time DoTerra user, so I&#x27;m very happy to have found something that works just as good, at 1/3 of the cost!! And the shipping costs are much lower also.</li>
    <li> I had read in Wikipedia nice things about this oil. It was strange that that I could&#x27;t buy it in the Philippines. But after my purchase I discovered why. Despite it is given a relaxing feeling the smell is very unpleasant. It was my first and last time to buy pure Ilang Ilang oil</li>
    <li> I was referred to this oil from a YouTube video about making a mud wash for natural hair. While this product was not what I expected, it is still therapeutic as described and I am satisfied with it. It definitely lingers when you leave a room!</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this a higher star rating is because this stuff smells really strong. It has a kind of sickly sweet odor that makes the nose crinkle a bit. But the oil is useful.</li>
    <li> Smells better than I imagined</li>
    <li> Good picker upper during the day, has a nice fresh scent.  I use it when I am feeling a little sluggish and it is just as good as peppermint.</li>
    <li> Does not smell good . I love ylang ylang , but this oil smells strange</li>
    <li> Good quality oils, fast delivery, very pleased with this company, will order again from Edens Garden :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(you also get a free complimentary leaflet with some combinations of oils and how to make your own blends)</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO USE IN MY HAIR HAS A HAIR MIST. I USED JUST 2 DROPS &amp; WATER, ITS BEEN OVER A WK &amp; THE AROMA IS STILL SMELT IN MY BOTTLE. IT EVEN LASTS IN MY HAIR FOR DAYS. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Love this ylang ylang. I used it in most of my natural hair products. I love the way this stuff smells, and the price is very good. I will be buying more from this company.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this but have found some better oils from other suppliers that smell a little better then this.</li>
    <li> It is a good quality oil and, while not my favorite scent, is a good scent.</li>
    <li> I do Young Living Essential Oils, although they are 100% pure with no other chemicals or additives, Edens Garden has wonderful oils as well. I would definitely order from them all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t care for this herb&#x27;s sent. Some people like it. As for quality- I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t have  a way to test its purity.</li>
    <li> Very good line of essential oil. I especially like that the dropper is small, so the oil lasts longer. Some brands have a dropper top that is about four times the amount and the oil is twice-four times the price. You do the math. Great value.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why they call it YLANG YLANG, but it&#x27;s STANK STANK. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this essential oil because it is an ingredient in many DIY lotions, balms, and body sprays, and i am gradually adding to my arsenal of oils to play with. I am a bit embarrassed to admit that I honestly had no idea how it was supposed to smell. When it arrived I put one drop on my wrist and waited for the magic. I must say it is very strong and long-lasting. It seemed to me to be in the same scent-family as patchouli (which I love) but quite a bit sweeter, so I can see why it would be so widely used in combination with other oils to make complex aroma blends. All in all, Edens Garden as always quickly shipped and nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> Gua i like this product t hanks.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 of the Edens Garden essential oils,.  All 5 smelled the same, like they were old and stale.  I would not but them again!</li>
    <li> No.. EXACTLY like a public restroom.  Guys will know the smell instantly - it&#x27;s like going number 1 on the urinal cake.  The exact same smell.  Now why would I want my room smelling like THAT?  I hear rave reviews about this oil from all over the place, as if it&#x27;s the King of oils (and sometimes it actually is).  Funny, I guess I&#x27;m the first guy to ever give this stuff a good whiff.</li>
    <li> Smells nice.  I use it in combination with lavendar, patchouli, and bergamot.</li>
    <li> This smells really nice and the bottle will last a long time. It took longer than expected to ship - that&#x27;s the only downside that  comes to mind.</li>
    <li> I received my two bottles of ylang ylang essential oil a few days ago. I&#x27;m a little confused as to how so many people gave this five stars. There was one guy who posted a review and he stated that ylang ylang EO smells like a public restroom. Yeah, you sure got that right. It smells like a nasty public restroom. I put a couple of drops on a cotton ball and placed it on a small dish to take in the aroma because I ran out of tea light candles for my oil diffuser. This stuff made my living room smell like a dirty restroom. When my husband walked into the room his first words were &amp;#34; Ugh. why does it smell like a urinal cake in here&amp;#34;? I&#x27;ve even tried it with four drops of lavendar oil mixed with 1-2 drops of ylang ylang oil and 3 drops of water on a cotton ball. It STILL smells bad. What am I missing here? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I LOVE Edens Garden essential oils and will buy more soon, but not this one. I purchased two bottles one for me and one for my Mom who has stress issues and high blood pressure because I found out that this oil helps with these issues. I sure hope she likes this EO because I can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful.  (Caution, if your guidebook doesn&#x27;t tell you, use it sparingly because too much can cause nausea.)  I&#x27;ve been trying various brands of essential oils and find Edens Garden&#x27;s oils to be among the best quality and better priced than the others.  Also, the labels are attractive and easy to read.  I love the color coded labels.  It allows me to quickly find the one I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly!  This oils are amazing!!!  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Thank you,I am enjoying my products</li>
    <li> Ylang Ylang has a very strong smell, however it is beneficial for many things. But it is hard to be close to this essential oil. The bottle is dark which is good to keep the essential oil from ruining.</li>
    <li> I love these oils and make my own cleaning products with them. The smell is absolutely lovely!!!</li>
    <li> smells amazing!  Very strong and came with a really nice booklet on oils.  every oil I got from Eden&#x27;s Garden was fantastic!!!  Definitely will be repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Eden&#x27;s Garden for its fair prices on quite decent oils, though this one leaves me slightly disappointed, it not striking me quite as high quality as other ylang ylang oils.  This may be a moment where you are getting the bargain deal here, though this still remains a fine oil and not the worst it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is quite fragrant and flowery, and by inhalation I feel the effects almost immediately.  I find it a wonderful mood enhancer and great for baths and showers.</li>
    <li> love your oils.  always safely wrapped, on time.  thanks</li>
    <li> I recently started Accutane and I&#x27;ve been using Essential Oils to also help with the excessive dryness, acne, fine lines, wrinkles, &amp; hyper pigmentation. I&#x27;ve added this to my daily routine and have nothing negative to say about it! Its been working great and my skin looks amazing! Something I haven&#x27;t seen in many years due to acne scars! I&#x27;m using a blend of Geranium, Lavender, Lemon, Bergamont, Ylang Ylang, Tea Tree, Rosehip Seed Oil &amp; Frankincense every morning &amp; night with either a Jojoba or Aloe Vera as a carrier.  It also smells amazing! I&#x27;ve heard it is also an aphrodisiac and I can tell why just by the smell! lol</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> I just didn&#x27;t care for it.  However, this was my first essential oil purchase.</li>
    <li> I spent $2000 on Young Living Essential Oils and Products... was lured into their pyramid scheme by a friend who walks around in a daze like pigpen from peanuts cartoons but instead of flies and dirt surrounding her has untold combinations of oils and tinctures swirling about her in an 8 foot perimeter. wheee!&lt;br /&gt;Prefer Edens Garden price points and product!</li>
    <li> Great oil can mix and blend with other oils. Great with olive oil as the main oil and can use it on your skin once you do mix and blend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from high blood pressure since I was 25. Wearing this on the back of my neck and increasing my intake of celery has helped lower my blood pressure some. Can&#x27;t deal without it.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden has very good quality essential oils</li>
    <li> love this sent- use it as a perfume.</li>
    <li> I love this company other fragrances this particular does not smell like it should, not a chemical smell just not ylang ylang. At least not scent in the past.</li>
    <li> Hi. I use it in my aroma lamp. Good product.</li>
    <li> I love ylang ylang, and it can be difficult to find, so I was very excited to try Edens Garden. Such a disappointment!! This smells NOTHING like ylang ylang; instead it&#x27;s like an overpowering fake rose scent. After sniffing the bottle I didn&#x27;t even want to try it in my burner, but hoped that dilution with water would help. It did not, and I threw this out; a waste of money.</li>
    <li> love the melo scent and last a good while. used it in my homemade foot scrub will be buying more sents</li>
    <li> I wished I&#x27;d of bought the lavender!!</li>
    <li> had to give to a friend since my husband said it smelled like sausage to him.  I loved the scent, made me relaxed and fell into a restful sleep.</li>
    <li> Luv this oil-  I use 2 drops on my pillowcase every couple nights--it works great to help me sleep.  I also infuse it and the smell is intoxicating! I think it smells like hyacinths.  Great product-great price!</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with smell and price.</li>
    <li> Love essential oils, check out the benefits on an Aromatherapy Chart.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this essential oil.  The quality is there and of course the scent of Ylang Ylang is wonderful and used in so many of the blends I&#x27;m creating.  Will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> First, seller was fantastic and shipping was super fast. If you&#x27;ve never tried ylang-ylang, this is a fantastic oil to start with, especially as it comes in a smaller bottle. YY is potent so you don&#x27;t need much. I would liken the smell to a mix of jasmine and lily - it&#x27;s an in your face floral, not a soft a sweet one. Mixes very well with vanilla and patchouli</li>
    <li> A little strong but smells nice</li>
    <li> smells heavenly in my diffuser!</li>
    <li> I brought this oil on the reviews alone, but the reviews said that this oil smells good, when  it really  stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had surgery and I needed something that smelled good and strong, but this made things worst, it blends in with the smell of band-aids.&lt;br /&gt;I like all my other oils that I purchased from this company.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this scent. I have never smelled ylang ylang before so I can not comment on the quality.</li>
    <li> You only need a couple of drops this stuff is STRONG so the little bottle will go a long way!  I get lots of compliments on this scent!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance - worked well in soap, bath bombs and Lotions.</li>
    <li> All of edens gardens essential oils are great. I think I own them all</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Should have read the 1 star rating. It has about 1% smell of what other authentic product smell like.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to use in detox baths &amp; warming candles. Great product and it comes in a great package.</li>
    <li> It smelled awful.  not at all like the description.  I put it in the oil burner.  once I was able to smell it I took it out. I threw the entire bottle out.</li>
    <li> this ylang essential oil arrived promptly a couple of weeks ago. Just opened today. The smell is strong but hopefully effective.  I&#x27;ve ordered an entire package of Eden oils since then.  Can;t wait.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!!  I apply this oil in my deep conditioner and hair moisturizer for my natural hair. . This oil stimulates growth and thats what Im looking for. I see the price has jump up everywhere on this oil. All I can say is shop around .</li>
    <li> The scent is heavenly.  I highly suggest using ylang ylang for any of your aromatic needs.  Love this little bottle.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product. Top quality. Would buy again if I were in the States. This is great for all purposes as the oil is pure: burning, in the bath of aromatherapy. A good ylang ylang oil is very stimulating and also a good aphrodisiac.</li>
    <li> Good quality ylang ylang oil. I really enjoy all of Eden&#x27;s garden. They are a good quality for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair and skin! Has a flowery, sweet and soft aroma. Have started using in a roll-on blend...very intoxicating!</li>
    <li> This essential oil is exactly as expected.  It was well packaged to arrive safely. The oil appears to be of high quality and is a fair price.</li>
    <li> I use this in my bath salts.  I like this scent but the dropper does deliver a little to much at a time.</li>
    <li> This may be a matter of taste but I personally haven&#x27;t found this scent to be one I can stand for too long. I use it for its skin benefits only. So many people swear by this scent but it just isn&#x27;t for me. I suggest you go to your local health food store and smell this in person before you decide to buy it here. I&#x27;m still working with it, though, trying find a blend that will bring out the best in this scent. A combo with orange makes it much better for me.</li>
    <li> I make a lot of my own home fragrances using the essential oils.  I can personalize based on a room or a personality.  I enjoy the way this oil combines with other oils to build my perfect scent.  The Ylang Ylang in particular adds an exotic fragrance, flowery but not too much so.  I really like this brand of essential oils.  The quality is high on all their products, and their packaging gets everything to my door in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started getting into aroma therapy, this being one of the first products I bought for this endeavor.  I&#x27;ve been putting a few drops in my humidifier, along with using one drop on my wrists and neck as perfume.  It creates a much more relaxed atmosphere than my apartment had previously and my significant other loves my new scent.  I am definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> This one smells amazing and is a great addition to the oils I use for diffusing.  I&#x27;m going to start calling myself a self professed Eden&#x27;s Garden addict. My goal is to buy all their oils eventually for various purposes beyond diffusing. Love this company!</li>
    <li> but tiny product, didn&#x27;t realize how small vial was :)</li>
    <li> One drop is enough. So very strong and potent. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this oil is great for those who like this scent - I thought I&#x27;d try something new and do not like it. But that is just my opinion - smells too florally and sweet.</li>
    <li> This overpowers any scent you try to pair it with and it is so strong even one drop can be too much!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this oil, planning on getting more of these amazing oils :). Edens garden is def a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it blends well in my homemade beauty products that I am making.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I use this as part of a &#x27;home cleaning recipe&#x27;. Eden&#x27;s Garden are by far one of the cheapest places that sell this product and it&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty strong to my nose, so I like to just put a drop or two to add a nice &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; to my scents.  Use a little for a subtle but sharp floral scent.  Good quality stuff.</li>
    <li> thank you.  haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, amazing product!! I was already excited when this arrived within 3 days to me in southern Cali, and the product included an awesome product guide on their oils, and a guide with 101 ways to use essential oils. After just loosening the cap, I could already smell the wonderful therapeutic strengths of this oil, truly grade A! Much stronger than my other oils from other places.</li>
    <li> good smell, seems to be fine quality. It may be diluted with a carrier oil but I don&#x27;t care because I would dilute it anyway</li>
    <li> Smells very chemical .&lt;br /&gt;I would not order it again, and would suggest the lemon oil, which smells great!&lt;br /&gt;But the price is good.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden will GOUGE you on the shipping:  $10 per item (regardless of size/weight) is very excessive!</li>
    <li> I realize this isn&#x27;t a high grade oil (looking at the price should give you an idea), but this oil does not smell good or even floral.  I let my husband smell it and he asked why I had a vial of urinal cake scent.  Hopefully we just got a bad batch, but I was not very impressed.</li>
    <li> not my favorite brand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to oils, but it seems to be good quality. Edens Garden does supply a booklet with their oils that I found to be extremely useful and informative. Like this company</li>
    <li> I bought this as an oil scent for my hair after reading the description. It&#x27;s pungent. It&#x27;s so pungent that when I added it to my hair oil and put my cap on to go to sleep, whenever I moved and the cap shifted, my nostrils were assaulted by the stench emitting from my scalp. At 2:00 in the morning I finally didn&#x27;t care whether or not my hair was being conditioned and ended up shampooing the smell out. At one point, during the night absolute hair loss would have been preferable. I not only would not buy this again, I now have a bottle of it I cannot give away. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried forcing it off on other people, but once they take the cap off they make funny faces and shove it back to me. I now have it wrapped in a sock in the back of my drawer hoping the cap never comes off. I&#x27;ll be forced to move out of my home if this ever happens. It is a smell that when it hits your facial area, you hope your nose falls of just so you can get away from the aroma.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Exactly what it explained is what I got...</li>
    <li> Ylang ylang is widely known and used.  Sometimes I add it to other essential oils and blends, but never by itself as it is by far the strongest smelling out of all the essentials that I use (to me).</li>
    <li> As described. Fast ship. Would use again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve smelled many different ylang ylang oils, and this is honestly the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelt. I would return it but there is no point, the shipping costs almost as much as the refund!</li>
    <li> I was glad to see and smell that this was the real essential oil. At times I have purchased essential oils and they did not meet my expectation. They were either diluted or mixed with a lot of other products. All you need is a couple of drops because it is strong</li>
    <li> Great oils for a good price</li>
    <li> very nice, edens garden sells good quality essential oils at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I seriously love the smell! I plan on using it in a lot of my bath and body products. The quality is so good for the price!</li>
    <li> Nice smelling oil that I use occasionally.  I would prefer it mixed with rose or another scent as it is rather strong.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected from a top quality oil. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The smell can use a bit of refining.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little weird , but that&#x27;s just ylang ylang in general , I like the smell tho , and I use it in my dogs shampoo an it adds a nice mix to it .</li>
    <li> It may be a good oil for therapeutic use? But it smells like carbon ink... not good for aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;It is long lasting, could be a good one for making some kind of  perfume though.</li>
    <li> I love this product a lot...Love...Love...Love....</li>
    <li> I love this company customer service this smells different but I use b it for my hair</li>
    <li> I like it, but the smell of this oil isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Secure package&lt;br /&gt;But it smells so strong i wish it has a lighter scent</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the recommendation of a friend, not knowing what the actual scent would be.  I am only just beginning to purchase essential oils, and I have not been disappointed by any of Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s products.  I am enjoying the flowery scent of Ylang Ylang in my diffuser and will order more from this Supplier.</li>
    <li> Ylang Ylang:  Is made from the flowers of the tree.  Is used to uplift the mood and promote overall health.  It is used to treat high blood pressure, nervous conditions, anxiety and impotence.  It is a powerful aphrodisiac.  It has antidepressant, anti-infectious, antiseptic, euphoric and stimulant properties. It contains stress reducing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ylang Ylang is more pleasant. I place a few drops of each on separate cotton balls, and place at the head of my bed. They help me relax and sleep well throughout the night. Often times my legs are very restless. When I take in a few deep breaths of each oil, my legs calm down. When I&#x27;m stressed out, it&#x27;s nice to just sit for a few minutes and smell these two oils. I feel much better afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like that Edens Garden offers 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils at a great price.  Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I was a little weary of buying these oils as they were quite a bit cheaper than some of the other more popular brands. But I took a shot, ordered Edens Garden and I&#x27;m so happy I did. I tested the oils I received right away and all were as stated, pure therapeutic grade. I will definitely be ordering from Edens Garden again soon!</li>
    <li> Good Product! Fast Shipping!!</li>
