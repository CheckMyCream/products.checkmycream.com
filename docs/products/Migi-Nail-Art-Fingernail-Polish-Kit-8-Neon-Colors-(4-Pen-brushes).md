<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter loves these. They work very well.</li>
    <li> I got these as a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law&#x27;s fiancee. She loves doing and re-doing her nails. As soon as presents were opened and Christmas brunch was finished, she disappeared to try out the kit. Apparently it worked out well, because she came back with a deferent design on every fingernail and gushed about how much she loved it for days. Success!</li>
    <li> I love these pens and I can recommend them to all who love nail art.</li>
    <li> Disappointed the blue was cracked and dried unusable.</li>
    <li> i thought this would be great for my girls age 12 and 13 allowing them to get creative. they are lucky they can form a dot without the product clogging or gushing out. i tried it to see if they were using it wrong. They weren&#x27;t its just a bad product for good money.</li>
    <li> Paint was too thick to paint on smoothly.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This Migi nail art set (white neon kit) was exactly what I wanted!  They make very fine lines and are great for making tiny designs.  The colors are bright and vibrant and the best part is that you can register your product and receive free refills on two colors at a time for life! (shipping not included)  Great product for the nail art enthusiast!  I would definitely by another in the future!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described.  Had an issue that required me contacting customer service.  The representative was incredibly courteous and immediately resolved the problem.  Would not hesitate to buy from them again!!</li>
    <li> Order came in before the expected date and was exactly what I had ordered.  It is always a pleasure to do business with Amazon.</li>
    <li> my grand daughter just loved it</li>
    <li> rec&#x27;d item in a timely manner.item is as advertised.our grandaughter ( 11 yrs old ) is delighted with the product..took a little practise but has mastered the use of it.of course grammy had to help at the outset....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my thirteen year old teen aged granddaughter. She has been eyeing this item for weeks and I am sure she will be pleased with it. From the looks inside the packaging, I&#x27;m sure she willl love it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a neighbor for Christmas because she is so creative and loves to do make-up and nails.. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Clogs easily, but fun to use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for a child.  Bought for my niece for her own mani-pedi kit.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great!  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister as a Christmas gift. She&#x27;s very artistic so she loved this product. It comes with a few simple colors to choose from, but its enough for a young artistic girl to enjoy.</li>
    <li> Very cute. Was given as a gift to my granddaughter. She loved it.</li>
    <li> 12 year old Madelyn says AWSOME! Great colors. Goes on easily. Brush on one side &amp; pen on the other for fine detail work. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my eleven year old daughter for Christmas after we had seen a similar product on a trip to New York. She was thrilled and has spent the entire week painting designs on her nails.</li>
    <li> Nice product.. Takes some getting used to with having to squeeze the bottles to get nail polish out.. Works good though..</li>
    <li> Smaller then I expected but still good for a 12 year old. [[ASIN:B002C7DK7Y Migi Nail Art Fingernail Polish Pen-Brush - Set of 8 - Neon Colors]]</li>
    <li> This looked like such a great way to design nails. However, most of our pens don&#x27;t work. My daughter is really bummed and we will be exchanging it. Hopefully the new set will work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters and they love it. Good quality and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The migi nail art is a lot of fun for my children and I am going to buy some sets for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> These paints are colorful and really easy to use. They come with the option to paint like normal finger nail polishes OR you can flip them over and use the paint pen. The pen option works well for doing designs and nail art. I would buy some clear polish to help protect the designs though! The product is cute and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Much more affordable than going to a nail salon.</li>
    <li> This nail art was a great gift item I gave to my 6 years old. She loves it. The colors are beautiful. We also purchased the Nail art book from Klutz with it for her for the inspiration. This is a great gift for girls of all ages. It could be a great part of a girls birthday party.</li>
    <li> This item does not like it and my mistakes for ordered. I would like finger nail paints for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Works OK, but cleanup is difficult and if not used correctly can be a big mess. Not what I expected for the price. Needs better cleanup options.</li>
    <li> I love this set of nail pens! It arrived on time and it works great!! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion and looks jsut like the products I saw for twicethe price at the craft show, won&#x27;t know until the child gets it on Christmas day but I don&#x27;t foresee any issues with this product.</li>
    <li> When used for nail polish, it doesn&#x27;t provide good coverage even with 2nd coat. However, it&#x27;s excellent for decorating &amp; art work.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 13-year old daughter. I asked her for her opinion and she gave it 5-stars. She told me she really likes it, it&#x27;s easy to use, and really fun. She painted her dad&#x27;s toes (no joke! he&#x27;s a good dad) so I asked him his opinion and he said it seems to be staying on pretty well. It&#x27;s only been two days so he can&#x27;t really comment on how long it lasts, but at least at this point it&#x27;s holding up well. I think the price is a little high, but I&#x27;m a tightwad so you might want to take that with a grain of salt. She&#x27;s enjoying it and my husband is being a good sport, so in my opinion I&#x27;d say it was a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> These are ok. But don&#x27;t really look that great. Fine for a little kid.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old niece was absolutely thrilled to receive this set for Christmas! The colors are bright and the pens actually got her to stop talking for a bit and focus on creating her art! Peace and happiness for everyone ;)</li>
    <li> Bought for my 10 year old niece for Christmas. She told me this was her favorite present, which meant a lot since she got A LOT of cool stuff. She couldn&#x27;t wait to use with her friends.</li>
    <li> I sent these nail pens to my 9 year old niece for a gift.  Love that you can get free refills.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Not worth it. Cheap paint. Peels in a say.  Pens don&#x27;t work well. Waste of money</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, I thought it was just nail polish pens. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered they also had brushes. I know the description said pen-brushes but it didn&#x27;t click with me until I got them and started using them. I&#x27;m slowly getting better with them and I look forward to getting even better! The colors are great an the pens are easy to use once get a feel for how much pressure to apply to the tube to yield the desired result. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try nail designs with higher difficulty, or a great way to do lettering an numbering.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 11 yr old daughter for Christmas and we BOTH love them!Easy to use and great quality! We are buying more colors to add to our collection.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a set for a 16 yr old girl and she loves them too! A must have if you like to do fun nails!</li>
    <li> Gift for my niece who is 9.  She had fun with it but wasn&#x27;t very precise when she was trying to draw on her nails.  May be better for a teenaged girl.</li>
    <li> Nice. Got for my daughter and she hasn&#x27;t used it yet so I can&#x27;t say more.</li>
    <li> When I received this item I could hardly wait to use it! The neon colors were great! I did my nails and they came out great! Had a hard time trying it out on my 4 year old daughters nails but not because of the product (it was her...she didnt want to be a guinea pig lol) I have even done some of my friends nails with this product and since seeing the product I recommended them to but from this seller. Excellent shipping time!</li>
    <li> It brings out the artist in us all, &amp; the price &amp; quality are top notch. So many colors... so little time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as expected!!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my granddaughter, she liked it!</li>
    <li> Migi Nail Art is one of the best purchases I have made. Was at a county fair and had a demonstration, which I just loved and I had to own one but bought mine online and saved some money. The kit comes with pictures and directions for drawing things on your nails. Very fun and artistic! you dont even have to be an artist to do this!</li>
    <li> The nail Polish is super gooey &amp; hard to use. But I love the colors to much to throw it away! I can just deal with it</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for granddaughters. The girls will love these colors .  Would recommend this product to my friends.  Arrived fast and in new condition</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but you&#x27;ll need a steady hand.</li>
    <li> I got this for my niece&#x27;s birthday and she loves it! I love having nails done and then would do nails on someone else. Lol Such a sweet girl!</li>
    <li> These pens didn&#x27;t really work like what I had imagined. Yes they were working fine, the first couple of  times using them but after a week, they get caught in the pen part. The little metal stick, that came with it, to clean the pen part would not go all the way back where the paint harden and clogged the pen. It was so troublesome to clean the pens right after using them, I gave up on them and gave them to the nail salon, I go to. They gave me free color designs, so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll like it more than me.</li>
    <li> Hard to use. Wasn&#x27;t the way I remember them. You can squeeze a lot before getting anything to come out.</li>
    <li> Teenage granddaughters love it.</li>
    <li> The product worked great I have no issues with Quality or performance and I would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> was wondering how I receive refills, I have some colors that are almost out, red yellow, green, black,gold, blue. I really hope someone out there can help me.</li>
    <li> The tips bend and no longer work. This happened during the initial usage. You really need to be careful when using them, but they don&#x27;t really work well for an 8 year old.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter had a lot of fun with it</li>
    <li> Its fun way for girls to learn how to paint nails. Its also hard to paint details perfectly on small nails. Make sure to twist the brush cap on all the way or when you go to use the tip it will get a big mess. One of the tips already broke.</li>
    <li> I like the initial idea behind this kit. I can draw designs on my fingernails. The instructions that came with it focus on nail designs but not too much as how to use the product. It would&#x27;ve been helpful to have solutions (that may up rise with the pens or brush) included with the kit. Also I think its important to point out that refills are not free. You have to pay $8 for shipping. I guess they are saying you don&#x27;t have to pay for the actual polish being re filled, to me its too much money. Not to mention, its noted when you do send for refills you can only send two colors to be re fill. Which is a rip off.</li>
    <li> Love the polish kit.. we purchased the neon colors and my grand daughters have had a blast doing each others nail. Easy to use and the girls love it</li>
    <li> She loved the item and was painting every fingernail and toe she saw during Christmas with all kinds of neat designs and stuff. She is so creative and this allowed her the tools to do it!</li>
    <li> I chose 4stars because one of the pens didn&#x27;t work (blue)..but other then that I Iove it I do little designs on my nails when going to school</li>
    <li> These are really cool, the line you get from the pen side is super fine. I tried it briefly and the polish peeled off really easily, but I don&#x27;t know the right way to paint nails so that they last. It was a gift for someone else.</li>
    <li> I REALLY adored this product until I discovered that half of the colors wouldn&#x27;t even come out of the pen. Nothing came out regardless of how hard I squeezed. I used the pin included in the kit to unplug and to no avail. Then some of the previously working other colors dried up as well. What a great concept this was and how fun it would be if only they found a way to make it work properly. Seems like such a waste. Poorly made item, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a nice package for giving as a gift. I love all the color choices it gives you along with how to clean it guide and info.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old granddaughter and her Aunt had a great time using this product.  Easy to use and my daughter-in-law made my granddaughters nails look like she had just had them done at the nail salon.</li>
    <li> I love these it is great to be able to draw your own lines with the pen part. They work great. Just read the instructions and follow them and they work great.</li>
    <li> I ordered a brand new set of these however, some of the colors I had received were either used or not filled up properly. But I love the bright colors!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 19 year old sister for christmas and she loved the gift so much! she had alittle trouble making a design on the first try, but she is getting better with practice.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 11 yr. old granddaughter, and she has been having lots of fun with her girl friends trying different&lt;br /&gt;styles on each other. She also talked me into having my nails &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;. Great fun !</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these all the time. She shares them with her friends. She will probably be buying the primary color set of pens next.</li>
    <li> Great precision and detail work can be done on nails. Can&#x27;t wait to try on my friends and family! Love Migi</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and she LOVES it. Probably a good purchase for girls 7-16yrs old and isn&#x27;t messy/takes up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 8 year Granddaughter who can&#x27;t seem to pain her finger nails enough :) Opened it right up and started using it.</li>
    <li> Yeah, this set is colorful and fun.</li>
    <li> Awesome my daughter and her friends r enjoying a lot...</li>
