<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this yesterday afternoon and it&#x27;s a good thing I did because that morning I threw out my lower back. I gave it a try last night in a hot bath and liked the way it smelled and helped to relax my back muscles. I&#x27;ll be using it again.</li>
    <li> This works wonders after a long day at the gym. Soaked at night before bed and the next day my pain was gone! Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Great product! Exactly as described! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed. Do not work as I was thinking at first place.</li>
    <li> Over a month ago I was suffering from a painful callous. It had recently healed but left behind dead skin that I&#x27;ve been scrubbing away at whenever I took a bath. The salts had softened the water and softened my skin so much that I was able to get the skin off. I was worried it hurt but it didnt. There really was no pain. The smell of the wintergreen salts were so relaxing. I swear the scent of the salt, and the bath steam helped clear my sinuses. It was aromatherapy to the max. These salts were so good-so very worth it.</li>
    <li> What a Great way to soak away the pain!</li>
    <li> Wonderful pain relieving bath product!</li>
    <li> I have ankle and foot pain and after a long day tlI sprinkle this into a hot bath and all my pain eases away. This is what I use now instead of taking a pain pill. The smell is very strong when you put it in but only leaves a clean smell on your skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> great stuff just to soak in!! pain does really go away....have ordered another since family members are wanting to use now too....still having the BEST Foot Pain relief 6/2017 and have experimented by adding Dr Singha&#x27;s mustard soak ............OMG!!! the relief (For ME/family members) beats rx pain meds HANDS DOWN!!! and BEST OF ALL ..NO SIDE EFFECTS unlike w/rx pain meds...So this definite keeper</li>
    <li> Bought this to use for my daughter who has arthritis. She soaks a couple times a week. Maybe it&#x27;s the soaking or maybe it&#x27;s this stuff but she seems to sleep better after using it and doesn&#x27;t wake up in as much pain.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severe cramps and abdominal pain every month when it&#x27;s &amp;#34;that time&amp;#34; of the month. I was able to soak in these and my cramps went away, and my abdominal pain level was dropped from a 10 down to a 3-4, still bare able. The only thing I dislike is that &amp;#34;menthol&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s pretty strong lol but my husband uses this for his back pain as well. We&#x27;re almost out of the bottle already. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am not super impressed. All I feel is more of a burning sensation on the back of my legs. I was so hoping I was going to love this :(</li>
    <li> The container er is big and it&#x27;s sealed. You can smell the product through the seal. When you open the seal, WOW it hits you even more. The smell isn&#x27;t as strong once it&#x27;s in the water. It relaxes and soothes. Works on sore muscles. This stuff is great. Worked for me in more than one way. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> These bath salts are just heaven in a jar!  I love all of the essential oils in this - they smell so good and relaxing even before you get in the tub.  Then when you do, you don&#x27;t want to leave!  My legs were hurting from something I did earlier in the day and these salts helped tremendously.  I will be using these salts for many years to come!</li>
    <li> These Vi-Tae dead sea salts are very generously saturated with several essential oils that are well-known for their relaxing, medicinal qualities.  For example, the rosemary leaf oil is often used in aromatherapy to sooth those aching muscles. I’m seeing some very potent and potentially soothing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t have arthritic bones, but like most people I sometimes have muscle aches from occasionally overdoing it.  It’s not hard to do, but instead of fast relief (if any), I much prefer to luxuriate in something like dead sea salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that immediate pain, I’ve used all kinds of different products, including Blue Goo, which has menthol as its active ingredient.  The Vi-Tae is loaded with menthol-like ingredients and the smell is incredibly inviting with the swirl of aroma.  I’m not quite sure which scent comes to the surface, but when the jar is opened it amazingly strong (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recipe for using the Vi-Tae Dead Aromatherapy Sea Bath Salts is quite simple.  You can either put a handful in warm water or measure out a quarter cupful.  Vi-Tae recommends that you use them two or three times a week, but if you are using them for sore muscles, they can obviously be used as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result?  It was a very relaxing experience and I’d highly recommend the Vi-Tae Aromatherapy Dead Sea Bath Salts.  The only drawback, of course, is that they are rather pricey.  However, if you consider all the essential oils added to the salts, the price is much more understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead sea salts, methyl salicylate (sweet birch oil), mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen) leaf oil, thymus vul.(thyme) leaf oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana (cedarwood) oil, menthat viridis (spearmint) leaf oil, &amp; zingibr cassurmunar (plai) root oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VI-TAE DEAD SEA SALTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00DTEYUEQ Cellulite Dissolving, Fluid Reducing Aromatherapy Dead Sea Bath Salts - “Skinny Bath”]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00DTEZIXI Stress Reduction, Relaxation &amp; Soothing Aromatherapy Dead Sea Bath Salts - “Take It Easy”]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00H4M38NS “Pain Pain Go Away” - Arthritis, Joint Pain &amp; Sore Muscle Relief Aromatherapy]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00IMHXI1Q Detox, Cleanse, Healing Aromatherapy Dead Sea Bath Salts - “ReBoot+ReStart”]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VI-TAE (Sprays):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00DSXU52O Deodorant Spray, All Natural]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00DHOUZ92 Lavender Facial Cleanser &amp; Makeup Remover, Gentle, All Natural - “Take It Off”]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00DTEX2NQ Cellulite Treatment, Body Slimming &amp; Toning Cream - “Skinny Bod” - With Natural, Organic, Botanical Ingredients]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HKLFZI4 Cellulite Cream, Firming &amp; Smoothing Treatment - “Firm Baby!

    <li> I just tried this for the first time and was surprised at how much better my sore legs started to feel as soon as the salts hit the water.  I was really rather amazed!</li>
    <li> Very strong pleasant scent! Relaxing and helps with muscle pain. My husband suffers from back spasms and he felt better after just one bath.</li>
    <li> Working double shift makes my body sore. I tried different kinds of  oils for massage and bath salts to help relax my muscle and this one really works. My husband even use this after work since he also walks most of his time at work.</li>
    <li> Pain, Pain, Go Away is dead sea salt infused with a blend of essential oils which provide natural relief from muscle aches &amp; pain. Add 1/4 cup (about a lid full) to a tub of warm water &amp; soak for at least 20 minutes. The salt grains are larger than what I normally use, but they dissolved quickly. After the salt dissolved, I was left with some particles that were floating in the bath water. I&#x27;m not sure what these were &amp; am wondering if it was a reaction between some of the ingredients &amp; our community well water. (I will email Vi-Tae® and update my review with their response.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When opened, Pain, Pain, Go Away has a strong, yet pleasant, aroma. A menthol aroma lingered for the entire 30 minute soak. I loved that. My 30 minute soak was very relaxing &amp; provided temporary relief from the arthritic pain I was experiencing that evening.&lt;br /&gt;(The second ingredient in these bath salts, methyl salicylate, is from the same class of chemicals as aspirin &amp; is often used externally to help relieve the aches and pains of arthritis.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo7MIM5CXLATIV]]\\&quot;Pain, Pain Go Away\\&quot; bath salts are made of bigger granules than other bath salts that we tried before, but it doesn&#x27;t mean you would wait a long time for it to dissolve. In fact, the smaller ones dissolve in an instant and the bigger rocks disappears in just a mere minute. We love the aroma, just opening the lid quickly envelopes your head with powerful soothing scent. A hot water bath reinforces the effect. The only thing funny is that you may feel cold when you lift part of your body off the water. It has a sensation of menthol and eucalyptus that seems to penetrate all the way to your bones. Lastly, if you do it at night, expects a good night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feel best after a hard workout in the gym or after a very trying day at the office. A hot bath with a quarter of the bottle is enough to give you a rejuvenating experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> This product is a perfect panacea that eases all kinds of body pains, including muscle pains in the back and neck, as well as rheumatic aches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health insurance companies in Germany recognize the curative powers of Israel&#x27;s Dead Sea and pays for German citizens to go to the Dead Sea to dip into the warm salt and other mineral-filled Dead Sea. So many Germans fill the hotels at the dead Sea that one can hear German spoken wherever one turns. This product uses the Dead Sea minerals and as a result many aches and pains are relieved in a natural way. Users find that a warm bath with this product relaxes them, they sleep better, and their pains are gone without having to fly over a dozen hours to Israel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a quarter cup of the bath salts, which does not make the water salty, and relaxing in the water for twenty minutes produces the desired result.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer:  I received this product for free in trade for a fair and honest review.  Receiving the product for free in no way effects my ability to write an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I decided to try this because I have a lot of muscle aches.  Mine are mostly from allergic reactions, but menstrual pain can be pretty bad as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My husband actually ended up using this product before me when he was having a lot of back and shoulder pain.  He was taking a bath and I put it in, much to his chagrin since he hates hates hates menthol.  It is even more amazing with this in mind that he loved this product.  He said it took away all of his pain other than a bit in his shoulders, but that was b/c it was hard to submerge his shoulders since its a small tub and he is 6&#x27;4.  I thought that was pretty impressive since he has horrible back pain, and it didn&#x27;t come back either, I did not hear him complain about the pain again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When I tried it I was having terrible menstrual cramps and was in excruciating pain, as well as some very bad lower back pain that would not go away at the time.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but it got rid of all of my cramps, and muscle aches.  It did not get rid of my lower back pain, but the only thing that got rid of that was a crap ton of stretches over a several week period, so I don&#x27;t fault the product for that.  It definitely worked better than pain meds for getting rid of my cramps, outside of taking narcotics, and that is saying a lot, I have been told my cramps are as bad as contractions.  :(  I love this product for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The smell is a bit of a turn off, you will wreak of menthol, but I assure you the smell is worth it for what it does.  :)  If my husband could like it even if he despises menthol, I think you will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  God Bless ~Amy</li>
    <li> The aroma of VVi-Tae is pleasant (minty). There is a gentle&lt;br /&gt;reactivity which soothes the bones and muscles upon&lt;br /&gt;application. The reviewer verified this with personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend adding 1/4 cup to a tub of&lt;br /&gt;warm water. Users are to relax for under a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the effects will vary between people, the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients of this product are consistent with&lt;br /&gt;relieving pain. For instance, the preparation includes&lt;br /&gt;dead sea salts, sweet birch oil, peppermint oil,&lt;br /&gt;wintergreen, thyme,eucalyptus, cedarwood,&lt;br /&gt;spearmint leaf oil  and plai root oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have arthritis, you should review the contents&lt;br /&gt;of this product with your rheumatologist. You might&lt;br /&gt;consult with a practitioner of alternative medicine because&lt;br /&gt;conventional physicians are unfamiliar with herbal preparations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An allergist may be helpful if you are allergic to any of the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients in this product. There are specific blood tests&lt;br /&gt;to take in the Allergen Panel to determine what types of&lt;br /&gt;allergies may be present. This product is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also remember that sufferers of arthritis may benefit by&lt;br /&gt;removing certain foods from the diet like gluten, excess&lt;br /&gt;caffeine and large amounts of white sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is to be noted that the reviewer requested a product sample&lt;br /&gt;in order to become familiar with the mechanics of the product.</li>
    <li> I like it, not to show on the Pain Go Away!</li>
    <li> thought this was a cream or ointment, they are bath salts, my mistake</li>
    <li> Pain Pain Go Away is a wonderful relaxing bath salt. The main aromas are strong spearmint, peppermint, and wintergreen - three powerful smells. The salts contain birch oil, a precursor ingredient to aspirin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a strange bath salt. Most pure salts dissolve completely and quickly. The main crystals do dissolve quickly and give off that lovely aroma. There are these odd little white flakes that aren&#x27;t soluble in my water (my water is on the hard side of soft - Lake Michigan water). There aren&#x27;t many of them. They crush easily, so they don&#x27;t leave white speaks on your skin. And they drain easily out of my tub. Frankly, they look like the white snow in a snow globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bath salt to use every night. I use this after I&#x27;ve had a rough day and am a little sore from doing too much.  It is good for soaking a long time. A quarter cup per bath is just about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snow globe flakes aside, I really like these bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I work out quite often, and since I am (sadly) no longer in my 30&#x27;s, I sometimes become very sore after increasing weight. My usual solution is a soak (with salts of course) and Tiger Balm - LOTS of Tiger Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used and reviewed plenty of these things, and have to say that this vi-tae product is the best pain relief salt I have ever used. The pleasant wintergreen, rosemary, and cedarwood smells overpower pretty much everything else in this mix, resulting in an aroma that is somewhat similar to Tiger Balm. The mix also contains hints of thyme, eucalyptus, and some other pleasant pine-like scent that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more surprising is how effective it is at easing my soreness after a work out. A 35 minute soak left me completely relaxed, and while some discomfort remained, it wasn&#x27;t too bad. I even decided to skip the Tiger Balm, and that is the biggest praise I can give this product. In fact, it was so effective that I decided to try it again, thinking the first result a fluke. So I increased my squat weight by another 10 pounds and did an additional set - which of course resulted in soreness the very next day. Sure enough, another soak took care of it once again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I do have an issue with this mix as well. The 16 ounce container has (at most) enough salt for just five soaks, and sells for $31.50. That is a bit excessive, and puts them on the same level as spa salts (even more expensive than some spa salts actually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If vi-tae lowers the price, and sets up a subscribe and save option with Amazon, I would gladly recommend this product to everyone, as it is I can only recommend it to those that actually need proper pain relief, or don&#x27;t mind the high price for a quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before, but I play a lot of sports and use a hot bath to relax my muscles. This stuff makes for a pleasant post-work out bath. Not sure putting salt in your bath does anything for soreness or not, but it has a medicinal smell that gives you the sense that your bath is more than just hot water.</li>
    <li> The bathtubs in our house are tiny, so taking a nice soak isn&#x27;t easy. That being said, I would curl up in a ball and tuck myself into a basin of water if it included &amp;#34;Pain Pain Go Away!&amp;#34; This was one of the most incredible bath salts I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the jar, the scent of these salts hit me like a ton of bricks--a ton of heavenly-scented, enjoyable bricks--because the scent is very strong. It&#x27;s similar to Tiger Balm--very menthol-y. Personally, I really like that scent, so I was more than OK with it.&lt;br /&gt;I used a generous handful--probably a tad more than the recommended quarter cup--and found it dissolved immediately into the warm water. I slid into the bath and decided to soak a towel in the scented water to drape across my shoulders (which are always forced out of the tub due to it&#x27;s dinky size). This method let me enjoy more of the scent and I just relaxed and let the bath carry me away.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I should tell you about the pain I was experiencing that made me decide to get this jar of bath salts...I originally got it for my husband because he was suffering from leg pain due to running. However, I ended up using it first because I got into some poison ivy and bug bites and was willing to try anything to help relieve the itch. I was amazed when I climbed out of the tub itch-free! Now, the itching didn&#x27;t go away permanently, but this bath certainly gave me a great reprieve that allowed me to get some sleep.&lt;br /&gt;My husband did get a chance to try this as well, and he said it was absolutely wonderful to give his muscles some relief (both after running and working out in the yard).&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling soft and itch-free, and your muscles feeling like warm Jello!</li>
    <li> I love taking baths. They are so relaxing, and help with some of my chronic back pain. I was in a severe car accident in 2007 that left me with several broken bones and a 5 inch screw in my pelvis. The area where the screw is will act up as the weather changes, if I over-exert myself, and especially was bad during pregnancy. While just a plain old boring bath is helpful to relax the muscles in my body, this bath salt takes it to the next level. First of all, it smells amazing. Breathing in the scent while soaking in the water helps you relax even more. The salt dissolved quickly and easily, without leaving pieces to float around the bottom of the tub. Beyond feeling relaxed by the composition of the salt along with the hot water, when I got out I could feel a noticeable difference in my pain level. Now it&#x27;s not some magic thing that was able to take away my pain 100%, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it too. It did reduce it thought, which is not something a lot of bath salts can claim. I would definitely recommend this to others, especially those who suffer from chronic pain like myself.&lt;br /&gt;Note- I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my opinion. All thoughts expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This is some amazing stuff! I have a job where I&#x27;m on my feet most of the day running around and walking a lot. When I get home my feet and legs are usually in pain. An epsom salt bath usually does the trick at relieving some of the pain but this soak felt like heaven! I felt so relaxed that I was able to fall asleep right away. The minty smell was relaxing and it even tingled a little bit while I was soaking. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this often and have already recommended this product to co-workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it relaxes me!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I bought it for my sons who are both high school athletes. My oldest son tried it the day after a particularly intense game. His sore muscles were immediately relieved after a 20 minute soak. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product that, albeit temporarily,  allows you to soak your mild to moderate pains away. Easy on the skin. Amazing aromatherapy benefits as well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent bath salts. I have muscular dystrophy so being sore all over is an unfortunate everyday reality for me, and I&#x27;m always looking for something to soothe my achy body. The peppermint and spearmint aromas really do open up your sinuses, make the bathroom smell amazing and put you in a relaxed state. I would definitely recommend this to someone with a bad cold as a way to relax and clear the passageways before bed. I also loved the exfoliating properties of these bath salts. I got out of my bath feeling completely at ease, which of course, was the intended purpose ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and really don&#x27;t suffer from arthritis pain but do suffer from the occasional lower back and neck pain.  I&#x27;m one of the skeptics when it comes to stuff like this.  I didn&#x27;t use immediately when it arrived because at the time I had no pain. Well after helping to move some large boxes at work I found I could honestly give this product a try and write my review.  I ran a medium to hot bath and added the recommended amount. It has a pleasant smell and honestly made me fully relax in the the tub. The menthol like qualities were rejuvenating and the lavender was relaxing. I felt tremendously better after getting out. I slept like a baby that night where as without it I would have tossed and turned. The key to this product is that it does relax your body and muscles so you&#x27;re not tense up, causing your body to ache.  I will definitely be using this again.  I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that it would erase arthritic pain as that is a different kind of pain all together.</li>
    <li> Not only did this totally soothe my sore muscles and joints but it opened up my sinuses as well. This really works and it works well. I am so glad I found it and will be purchasing more when it runs out. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...from the scent to the results.  It relaxes and draws the pain away. My only trouble is sitting in a hot bath for 20 mins!  I have severe arthritis in my knees from being an athlete all my life.  After soaking in it I am able to relax and fall asleep without all the pain. Definitely will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Best thing for sore muscles!</li>
    <li> Great smell and created a relaxing bath.  Muscles were relaxed.</li>
    <li> I sit for hours writing at my desk, and my muscles ache endlessly from this, especially my neck and back. I&#x27;d tried a product from Vi-Tae before and loved it, so I thought why not try some with pain relief! It really lives up to the name. I soaked in this reading a book for about 30 minutes and afterwards I could feel a difference! The smell is amazing, and it calms you right down while taking away that pain! Also, my skin felt so soft after the bath. I&#x27;m going to add this to my routine every week.</li>
    <li> Arrived well on time,thanks fora great product</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of topical pain relievers for my arthritis pain in my neck, knees, hands and feet.  I&#x27;ve also tried massage, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory creams, you name it...most don&#x27;t do anything and a few may have helped temporarily.  When I initially read about Pain Pain Go Away, I really didn&#x27;t believe it could do what it says... but i bought it - and I am so glad I did!  Every time I soak in a tub with these salts, I feel like I have a new body with a lot less pain, and the relief is surprisingly long lasting - through the night and the next day. My only concern is that I may be getting addicted -  better this than awful pain meds though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 10 stars if I could.  I do give my heartfelt gratitude to vi-tae for making this product available.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I recently started a brutal &amp;#34;boot-camp&amp;#34; workout class and my muscles are extremely achy and sore afterwards for days - I can barely move at times. A friend in my class told me about using &amp;#34;Pain Pain Go Away&amp;#34; bath salts that she found on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon. She said that she rarely experiences muscle aches and pains after using it. I immediately bought these salts that evening! I have one huge issue now. I wish I could buy a barrel of this stuff. I&#x27;m in LOVE! It arrived a couple of days ago and I have now soaked in a tub with these salts for two nights in a row after my workout - it’s been wonderful! I do not want to get out of the tub! What I thought was impossible - happened! My soreness virtually disappeared! The smell alone is utterly scrumptious and the salt crystals dissolved quickly. I really felt like I had a $250 spa treatment at a resort. My skin feels so soft and I smell sooo good. I can&#x27;t wait to do my workouts now because I can look forward to soaking the pain and soreness away. The Dead Sea salts and the aromatherapy works wonders. They need to make a gallon size so I don&#x27;t have to buy 3-4 jars at a time.</li>
    <li> I just soaked my feet with this after working all day. Wowee wow wow. It smells amazing! My feet began to tingle after a bit. It felt like all the bad was being pulled out. After, my feet are super soft. I&#x27;ve forgotten how nice it was to soak. So glad I purchased this. I would buy it again or give it as a gift. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> Perfect  exactly what I needed after a long workout.</li>
    <li> These are the first bath salts I&#x27;ve used that are specific for pain, sore muscles and joints. It was very nice and relaxing and really helped soothe my sore muscles after a long day at work! There is a strong minty smell that actually helped clear up my sinuses too! Very great product!</li>
    <li> These bath salts are very refreshing. They smell very strongly of eucalyptus and will definitely clear up your sinuses. I couldn&#x27;t say if they added in pain relief or if the combination of them and a nice hot bath aided in relief. Will definitely continue to use these bath salts! They were packaged nicely and easy to use. I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I used it for my broken foot and I had my son who is sick with a cold take a bath with these salts and it cleared up his congestion. I will order again for sure</li>
    <li> I love the smell!  After having major back surgery, I needed this.  Works great for easing aches and pains.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who suffers from all the above listed items and probably a bit of diabetic neuropithy as well,  He called me (he is out of state) from the tub to tell me he loved it and could I please order 2 more immediately.  He passed one on to a co-worker who also raved about it.  They are both medical technologists and aren&#x27;t young, putting in some grueling hours which would take it&#x27;s toll on much younger men.  Standing, walking, running, bending, lifting, very precise work at a quick pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent him several other products that got great reviews by other reviewers, but I think that whole &amp;#34;dorm&amp;#34; for traveling med-tech&#x27;s is now partaking of this product the second they walk in their doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says it works better than narcotics or ibuprofen which really amazed me!</li>
    <li> My favorite bath salts by far. Eases aches and pains, also perfect for a relaxing bath. Leaves your skin smooth and soft</li>
    <li> Best bath salt I have ever used!! just like it and use it when I am so tired. After a warm bath, I always feel so nice! As a essential oil lover, I highly recommend this bath salt. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I normally turn down review samples of these types of products, but was intrigued with this one and agreed to review it. The good news is this is so effective that I am hooked. The bad news is it&#x27;s an expensive addiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for what role each ingredient plays I&#x27;ll sidestep that because aside from the salts and wintergreen I am ignorant of them. It&#x27;s the results I care about and after only three uses I have enough repeated experiences to believe that this stuff works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At sixty five I have aches and pains in places that surprise even me, and this stuff in my jacuzzi tub is a powerful combination. One of the main ingredients is wintergreen, and it dominates the aroma, but the rest of the ingredients all contribute to pain relief in some way I am sure. And if not, they enhance the aroma part of the therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this does more than alleviate my aches and pains - it actually invigorates me after twenty minutes in the tub. It also leaves me feeling fresh and clean, which is a side benefit that I doubt the manufacturer intended. I have a feeling that I will be purchasing this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this product over and over. I am a suffer of chronic pain from fibro. osto.arthtitis&lt;br /&gt;and many other symptoms and this is a wonderful product that does what it claims. 20 minutes in the tub and you will come out feeling like a new person</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using these bath salts.  There is a pleasant minty aroma to this bath salt and soaking in it really soothed my body.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, a 1/4 cup will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Epsom Salt, but the sea salt and the herbs really made it so much more enjoyable.  While soaking in it, I did not want to get out of the tub, unfortunately, the water started getting cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed these salts and will purchase some in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> I was asked to try this product and write a review if I liked it.  I didn&#x27;t just like it ... I loved it.  I have some osteoarthritis and some days are more painful than others.  I slide into the tub with some of this product and I am amazed at how my body succumbs to the properties.  I relax, I notice the pain going away, and after a nice warm bath I can get back to my busy day again, or I can go to bed (if used at night) and sleep so much better without all the pain I normally experience.  My only downfall is that it is almost gone, so I am going to have to order this quickly so I don&#x27;t run out of it.  This is truly a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product😃can feel the difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> If you are like me, after a long day you are really sore and need to soak. Thankfully, Vi Tae, maker of several bath salts have made a way for relief with their \\&quot;Pain, Pain, Go Away!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶ Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;* Dead sea salts&lt;br /&gt;* Methyl Salicylate (Sweet birch oil)&lt;br /&gt;* Mentha Piperita (peppermint oil)&lt;br /&gt;* Gualtheria procumbens (wintergreen) leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;* Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;* Eucalyptus globules leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;* Rosmarinus Officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;* Juniperus Mexicana (Cedar wood) oil&lt;br /&gt;* Mentha Viridis (spearmint) leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;* Zingiber cassumunar (plai) root oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶ Build&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you notice when you open the package is the white crystals and the overwhelming smell of peppermint - something I find very relaxing. For about $32 you get a 16 oz tub of \\&quot;Pain, Pain, Go Away,\\&quot; which is about $2/ounce or $8/bath. Take this as you will. You may want to save money than the advised usage amount. That being said, the price for pain relief may be worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶ How to use&lt;br /&gt;Add ¼ cup to tub of warm water. Relax and soak 20 minutes. Use 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶ Testing&lt;br /&gt; I typically am up for 12-15 hour days, sore, and all I want to do is sleep. I, however, tested this product out. Usually bath salts are always soothing to dip in, but being in a wintergreen and peppermint bath from Vi Tae seemed to soothe my body, not only physically but mentally as well. It is reminiscent of using a Tic Tac, only it is for your whole body. It allowed the pain to go away for the entirety of 4 uses, which makes me a believer in the product. It felt like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶ Final Thoughts&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product, but I feel $30+ for it is a bit much. That being said, the pain did go away as advertized. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone and give it a 5 star rating. I felt like a brand new man and slept like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Does everything as advertised. Was able to have pain go away after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive. Only four uses for $32 ($8/bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.h).    I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.</li>
    <li> Do you like to soak in a tub of water?  Do you have arthritis or muscle pain?  Then a ¼ cup of Pain, Pain, Go Away! will help relieve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is not something I was able to come up with.  Definitely not lavender or roses but not a bad smell either.  It was more of an earthly note, maybe because it is created from Dead Sea salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dissolves in the water easily which is great as sometimes I have used bath salts that didn’t.  It contains other essential oils – several types – and just adds relieving products into the water – no bubbles or foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package has 16 ounces of salts in it so if my math is right, you will get 8 uses from it.  If you are looking for a gift for an achy friend or find that you have overdone your exercise routine, this will help you/them lose the ache.</li>
