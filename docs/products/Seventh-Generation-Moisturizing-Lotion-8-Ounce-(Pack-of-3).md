      <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>I like using Seventh Generation products and like this one much better than the peppermint.</li>
      <li>Smells more eucalyptus than lavender.</li>
      <li>i wouldnt buy much more.</li>
      <li>The lavender scent is okay - not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just need a better moisturizing lotion than some.</li>
      <li>This is great lotion for the 7yo with very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>so I was pleased to find it here for such a great price.</li>
      <li>I ordered it and as soon as I opened the bottle, I felt its strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of Seventh Generation(tm) from Smiley360 and wanted to spread the word about this lotion.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of Seventh Generation from Smiley360.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend it and will continue to happily use it</li>
      <li>It has a mild lavender scent, goes on smoothly and leaves no residue on skin.  </li>
      <li>She is just over the moon at the prospect of having a good stash of a body lotion that really works for her ready to go.  </li>
      <li>Wow I love this lotion!</li>
      <li>Great bottle design - stands upside down to easily dispense.  </li>
      <li>When I put this lotion on at night, the lavender helps me fall right to sleep!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe its not the right thing, just for me!</li>
      <li>This is great lotion for all our very dry skin.</li>
      <li>Nice smelling pure lavender lotion...goes on smooth and light yet highly moisturizing and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I knew this was a real winner when she called me up a couple weeks ago to find out where she could buy some more.  </li>
      <li>I however would not pay full price for it.  </li>
      <li>The two things I liked about the lotion: it&#x27;s natural ingredient list and its lavender scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great moisturizer (I have super dry skin) and a wonderful natural lavender scent!</li>
      <li>it moisturizes the skin quickly without leaving a greasy film on the surface.</li>
      <li>I am surprised the reviews are so good, it doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Just be aware!</li>
      <li>The scent is very light, and smells of a natural lavender versus a fake/strong lavender scent which is my preference.</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of seventh generation since my first child was born and very excited for this new line of product!</li>
      <li>Works well for eczema and is easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
      <li>I found this lotion after a lot of searching have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  </li>
      <li>Really smells like lavender, fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t absorb well right after a shower, which is when I like to apply lotion.  </li>
      <li>So often \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products are great for the environment, but not necessarily better for people.  </li>
      <li>I give it as gifts and always get a call back from the recipient to see where I got it  because they want to buy more.  </li>
      <li>first use, I gave it away to friends, as my eyes started watering and itching.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks for a quality product!</li>
      <li>This product is as good as other products out there but the fact that they are green and not harmful to the environment makes them better in my book!</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and keeps my legs soft throughout the day without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>BUT, it does have a strong lavender scent (since they use real essential oil)!</li>
      <li>This is my preferred body lotion because it has NO significant toxins as identified by the &amp;#34;Skin Deep&amp;#34; database of the Environmental Working Group, supplemented by my own research on the Seventh Generation website.  </li>
      <li>It also has no dyes or parabens/pthalates which is also appreciated.</li>
      <li>It does NOT smell like lavender really.  </li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with 2.5 bottles of lotion that I don&#x27;t really care for.  </li>
      <li>It soaks in very well with no greasy residue.</li>
      <li>The smell is very subtel and used by the whole family</li>
      <li>It kind of balls up if you rub it in even just a few times, then you have sticky lotion balls all over</li>
      <li>I was bummed when I ran to Walgreen&#x27;s the other day to get more.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the scent but previous reviews are right there seems to be some eucalyptus scent that overshadows the lavender.</li>
      <li>I still use Cutemol for extreme dry skin cases, but this is good for now and then uses.</li>
      <li>like the clever bottle design.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also like how much of this product is plant based and natural.</li>
      <li>I only received one.&lt;br /&gt;Has a fresh fragrance, but too strong&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>The lavender fragrance is truly genuine and as a real lavender lover, anything less is unacceptable.  </li>
      <li>I have really dry skin, so this doesn&#x27;t work as a full body lotion for me.</li>
      <li>Oh well, live and learn.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the lavender smell is SO strong!!</li>
      <li>- she used some while visiting mom this weekend and apparently is also now very fond of it.</li>

    <li> I love this product! This lotion made my skin smooth and fragrant throughout the day! I have been a fan of seventh generation since my first child was born and very excited for this new line of product! I received a free sample of Seventh Generation from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> This particular lotions smells good and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and soft with no greasiness left behind.  I also like how much of this product is plant based and natural.</li>

The scent is very light, and smells of a natural lavender versus a fake/strong lavender scent which is my preference. It also has no dyes or parabens/pthalates which is also appreciated. The hand wash is now also one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I only received one.&lt;br /&gt;Has a fresh fragrance, but too strong&lt;br /&gt;for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;I like the clever bottle design.</li>
    <li> So often \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products are great for the environment, but not necessarily better for people.  I found this lotion after a lot of searching have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  I would definitely recommend it and will continue to happily use it daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great moisturizer (I have super dry skin) and a wonderful natural lavender scent!</li>
    <li> This is great lotion for the 7yo with very sensitive skin. My only complaint is that the lavender smell is SO strong!! We bought this to put on all over when she gets out of the tub but if we use that much the entire house smells like lavender. Using just a small amount on her knees and elbows the smell is fine, but who wants to police their lotion use?</li>
    <li> Really smells like lavender, fresh and clean.  Great bottle design - stands upside down to easily dispense.  Good consistency, easy to apply, feels good on skin, absorbs quickly.  Got the 3 pack so I have one for the bedroom, bathroom and office.  Use it all the time.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice lotion.. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals in it..</li>
    <li> The lotion is wonderful for dry winter skin and smells so great! The best thing is no greasy residue after you rub it in!</li>
    <li> Wow I love this lotion! I&#x27;ve been using St Ives forever and have been trying to find a high quality low chemical lotion. And I have finally  found it! The lotion is thick and creamy with a rich lavender smell. Plus it gets a great EWG rating! I&#x27;m in heaven. It soaks in very well with no greasy residue. I love Seventh Generation! I use their hand wash, their laundry detergent, their feminine products, etc, etc, and they never disappoint! Living a low chemical life would be so much more frustrating without their economical high quality products!</li>
    <li> The product is as per claim, except is slightly  liquid. Trusted seventh generation product, will recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> I am surprised the reviews are so good, it doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing. It smells really good, and it is great that it&#x27;s natural. My skin felt dry after applying and it left a powdery, chalky residue. Maybe I just need a better moisturizing lotion than some.</li>
    <li> The lavender scent is okay - not overpowering. I like using Seventh Generation products and like this one much better than the peppermint.</li>
    <li> If you like lavenda scent, you gonna like it.&lt;br /&gt; And it also keeps your body moistured.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it is made by 7th generation!</li>
    <li> This lotion stings my skin when I use it after shaving. And any excess lotion on my skin neither soaks in or evaporates. Instead, I&#x27;m covered in a white film that I have to wipe off with a towel. This product also has a thin consistency and doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I hoped it would. The two things I liked about the lotion: it&#x27;s natural ingredient list and its lavender scent. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but that wasn&#x27;t an issue to me. Overall, though, this product fails big time and I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I find it doesn&#x27;t absorb well right after a shower, which is when I like to apply lotion.  It kind of balls up if you rub it in even just a few times, then you have sticky lotion balls all over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the smell a little weird.  It does NOT smell like lavender really.  It has subtle lavender undertones, but there are other scents in there that are a little weird.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender essential oil, for example.  For reference I like the Pangea Organics lavender hand lotion.  That stuff really smells like lavender and absorbs really well with slightly damp skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a risk and bought this when it was one sale -- 3 big bottles for less than what one bottle of Pangea costs.  I kind of wish I hadn&#x27;t.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with 2.5 bottles of lotion that I don&#x27;t really care for.  Oh well, live and learn.  I&#x27;ve never seen this in a store so wanted to try it.  But I&#x27;d recommend *actually smelling* it in a store before you buy it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. Works well for eczema and is easily absorbed by the skin. It&#x27;s a bit pricey though, so I will only buy on sale.</li>
    <li> Good lavender scent ...does not leave a greasy feeling after applying/</li>
    <li> great lotion. no mineral or petroleum oils. lavender scent is nice, but not too strong. great deal here on amazon.</li>
    <li> Subtle smell and works so well. Love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals, etc. other lotions have. I&#x27;ve bought this 3x now and will continue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so difficult for me to find a lightly scented lotion that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I LOVE this lavender lotion. I use it at night before bed on my arms and legs so I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;white residue&amp;#34; issue that some people have mentioned. I was bummed when I ran to Walgreen&#x27;s the other day to get more. They told me they no longer carry it so I was pleased to find it here for such a great price.</li>
    <li> This is my preferred body lotion because it has NO significant toxins as identified by the &amp;#34;Skin Deep&amp;#34; database of the Environmental Working Group, supplemented by my own research on the Seventh Generation website.  It is a relatively thick lotion, not oily, with only a subtle, unidentifiable odor once raised to my nose.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my facial lotion, I prefer &amp;#34;Snow Spun&amp;#34;, an oily moisturizer made from all organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great scent, not greasy, absorbs nicely and even the kids like it. The bottles are a good size, too. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this very nice price. I have not use these product yet, but they are seventh generation!. So I think the quality would be nice too.</li>
    <li> I first purchased a single bottle of this lotion for my mother last year at Christmas (it was her stocking gift).  She is 75, has very dry skin in the winter, and complains every year that she can&#x27;t find anything that keeps her from flaking away that isn&#x27;t either too greasy or too heavily perfumed.  It was a larger bottle &amp; got her through the winter.  I knew this was a real winner when she called me up a couple weeks ago to find out where she could buy some more.  Fortunately, I actually missed her call &amp; it came to me as a voice mail.  Her birthday is next month, so I ordered up this three pack and sent it to her as an early birthday gift.  The day it arrived, she called me up and thanked me about 1/2 dozen times.  Part of her glee is that the weather is already changing &amp; as soon as she turns on her furnace the flaky dry skin returns.  She is just over the moon at the prospect of having a good stash of a body lotion that really works for her ready to go.  I am probably going to have to re-order this for my sister come Christmas - she used some while visiting mom this weekend and apparently is also now very fond of it.</li>
    <li> This brand is great! I do a lot of research into what ingridients go into beayty/self care products, and this brand is always consistently good. Use it for me, and my 2-year old son.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion to use at night. I had some trouble slowing down and falling asleep. When I put this lotion on at night, the lavender helps me fall right to sleep! I have really dry skin, so this doesn&#x27;t work as a full body lotion for me. It certainly doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some other people said. BUT, it does have a strong lavender scent (since they use real essential oil)!</li>
    <li> Not only is this product smooth with a delightful scent it hits all the buttons for &amp;#34;correctness&amp;#34;  which means a great deal to me.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Smells great!  There are no hazardous chemicals  and makes my skin soft. Does not cause breakouts either!</li>
    <li> Looks and feels nice.  I however would not pay full price for it.  i snagged it with a coupon and s&amp;s on amazon and i think they came to $2.50 per item.  Over that....i wouldnt buy much more.</li>
    <li> Love it and am thrilled I can get it through Amazon.This has been a difficult product to find and plan to reorder again</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the lotion in terms of texture and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, but I don&#x27;t think it smells all that great. I&#x27;d bypass this one.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It has a mild lavender scent, goes on smoothly and leaves no residue on skin.  It was also a great value.  I don&#x27;t use lotions that have parabens, any ingredient connected to the oil industry, or fragrance.</li>
    <li> I ordered it and as soon as I opened the bottle, I felt its strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;After first use, I gave it away to friends, as my eyes started watering and itching.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe its not the right thing, just for me!</li>
    <li> Got in on a 3 pack for six bucks, can&#x27;t complain on the price and the quality of the product is nice as well. I still use Cutemol for extreme dry skin cases, but this is good for now and then uses.</li>
    <li> It smells good and is soothing to one&#x27;s skin.  Smells more eucalyptus than lavender.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion for all our very dry skin. The smell is very subtel and used by the whole family</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it all the time.  I give it as gifts and always get a call back from the recipient to see where I got it  because they want to buy more.  The lavender fragrance is truly genuine and as a real lavender lover, anything less is unacceptable.  I hope 7th Generation will continue to retain this level of quality.  I recommend both for the fragrance and for the moisturizing quality</li>
    <li> This Canadian-made moisturizing lotion does what it claims:  it moisturizes the skin quickly without leaving a greasy film on the surface. That&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain petrolatum which does nothing more than coat the skin.  This lotion provides hours of moisturizing.  I put this on in the morning after my shower and my legs still feel soft when I come home ten hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender scent smells more like eucalyptus and pine rather than lavender.  And that&#x27;s because this lotion contains oils from eucalyptus and pine.  I don&#x27;t mind this, but people who prefer a sweet, floral lavender scent may be disappointed.  I find the eucalyptus adds some zing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oval-shaped bottle makes this convenient for gym or travel bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this is pricey.  I bought the lavender lotion when it was featured as a lightning deal.  I&#x27;m so glad I grabbed this when it was on sale!  For those who do not tolerate the aroma of eucalyptus and/or pine, this may disappoint.</li>
