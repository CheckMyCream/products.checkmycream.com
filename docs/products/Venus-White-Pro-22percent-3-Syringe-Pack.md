    <li> Just exactly like what I have been getting thru my dentist office but much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have bought Venus White Pro and can&#x27;t say enough about it&#x27;s effectiveness.  AND it&#x27;s 75% cheaper on Amazon than what you pay at the dentist&#x27;s office.  I kept one of the syringes from the dentist supply to make sure I bought the exact same product.  Why spend money when you don&#x27;t have to.  This product really, really works.</li>
    <li> It works exceptionally well, and is also what my dentist gave me after I had her do my first office whitening.</li>
    <li> This product works. We got it from our dentist, but I paid too much thru them. I should have asked more questions. But my wife has been using it for two weeks and we are already seeing improvement. One warning: you cannot drink coffee or dine on any red-staining foods during the process.</li>
    <li> Good for upkeep after having the procedure done in the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I have tried many varieties of teeth whitening systems for trays, and I have done a laser treatment too. Venus was the most effective. It is the only brand that does not make my teeth feel sensitive. I was able to do the full treatment, no problem. I have tetracycline stained teeth and this still does a really good job overall, and doesn&#x27;t draw attention to the stains. And you can&#x27;t beat the price here on Amazon. Dentists want to charge 2-3 times more.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect.  Product met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I spent more thsn $150 for same product at dentist, however received plaster mold specific for my teeth.  I no longer smoke and it worked excellently pre smoke and post smoke. My wife used universal tray, which was adequate.</li>
    <li> love this product. vendor was great to deal with. great price</li>
    <li> It does not come in a box as pictured. It comes out of the box with a rubber band holding the three tubes together.  Makes you wonder about the safety.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like past products that I have bought.  Didn&#x27;t whiten at all.  Very disappointed in the product and the window has closed for me to return it.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Even my dentist didn&#x27;t know you had it available.So I will definately be ordering more soon. Thanks for making it available!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Venus White Pro with the packaging shown as in the box.  When my product arrived it came as just three syringes with no box (not in the original packaging shown) and with no explanation.  I was not going to try a product off the internet that came this way so I am waiting for a response on a return.</li>
    <li> The Venus White Pro 22% 3 pack provided a very good product at a good price. Shipping was free and arrived the next day. I would recommend the product and the provider.</li>
    <li> Got the pack in a timely manner and they were exactly as advertised. My teeth are whiter so the product seems to work well!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Very effective.  Same product I received from my Dentist for $75.00</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it works. Tastes good too.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than the dentist&#x27;s office. Same great product, fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I purchased previously at my dentist&#x27;s office but at a cheaper price.  Very happy with this purchase.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Considering this item is a health and beauty item which should remain sterile, I am greatly disappointed that this did not arrive in OEM packaging.  I purchased from GreenDot and it was fulfilled by Amazon.  The syringes that arrived had been poorly packaged in heat-mostly-sealed cellophane.  There is NO mention in the item description that the packaging may differ from OEM as this may have changed my buying decision.  We have used Venus White Pro 22% before and are very happy with the product overall.  The sterile, OEM packaged product would rate 4-5 stars in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Works excellent if you follow instructions! Cut out coffee, tea, soda and any staining foods and use daily for huge improvements in just 5 days or so!</li>
    <li> I have Venus white for a long time and have good results with it. Very little discomfort!</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL. EASY TO USE AND WORKS FAST.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GREAT FOR AFTER GETTING BRACES OFF FOR THE PERFECT SMILKE</li>
    <li> The 22% or 26% if a little strong on the gums but it does work. I have done it twice because I smoke</li>
    <li> Received what I ordered in time promised. I can ask for nothing more. I will be back as soon as I need next refill.</li>
    <li> Everything is good, and I&#x27;m glad that I choose it. Shipping and description of the product was the same as the seller wrote. I like it.</li>
    <li> Although these were a little smaller than what I had gotten at the dentist&#x27;s office, they were about 1/3 of the price so that works for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Venus White 22% system for a couple weeks and I&#x27;m seeing a big difference. I got fitted for trays at my dentist and the kit came with 6 syringes ($175). I wanted to get a refill, so while getting my teeth cleaned, I got a 3 pack like you see here ($75). Now I see that I could have just bought them for $20 here on Amazon. The trays should work for awhile, so I guess I&#x27;ll be buying my refills on Amazon from here on out.</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading. You only get three syringes taped together. There are no trays or tray materials in the box they packaged it in.</li>
    <li> Quality product at a fraction of the price the dentist charges.  Does a good job but takes about a week to see results.  Highly reccomend</li>
