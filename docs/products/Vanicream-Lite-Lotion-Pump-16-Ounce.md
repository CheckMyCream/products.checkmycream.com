    <li> I love the cream, however, the pumps on both bottles were inoperable. That was very disappointing</li>
    <li> Great product!  Arrived on time and I use it everyday. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love vanicream and have no problem with the lotion.  My issue was that neither of the pump dispensers worked.</li>
    <li> We are very upset with the delivery of this product. A lot of the lotion spilled out and it was a huge mess. Will be retiring this product.</li>
    <li> Great product (like the regular Vanicream moisturizer) but easier to spread and not as heavy. The regular moisturizer was actually too heavy to use on my face and could cause me to break out so I switched to using Vanicream Lite. It provides enough moisturizer without any negatives but I still use the regular version for everything else.</li>
    <li> Just as described. The pump makes it really easy to get the lotion fast on my child. Zoom!</li>
    <li> great stuff for your dry skin !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is great lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Lotion great, pump is no good. But I replaced the pump with one from an empty lotion bottle (different product). With the reoplacement pump, I like the Vanicream lotion just fine. It moisturizes well and is excellent for sensitive skin even on the face.</li>
    <li> My already sensitive skin and become even more sensitive recently.  My dermatologist highly recommended this line of products.  Love them and since switching to this line I don&#x27;t have the skin irritation that I did with other mainstream products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Long time user.  Moisture without the grease and non-staining.  Better or as good as major brands from department stores at a fraction of the price.  A gal at the department store cosmetic counter suggested this, been buying ever since.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! My dermatologist recommended this lotion for my skin type and I absolutely love it plus it was cheaper thru Amazon ðŸ˜€</li>
    <li> I received my two bottles of the Vanicream Lite Lotion as described. One of the pumps does not work and it leaked lotion in the bottom of the box. The other bottle is perfect. For that reason I won&#x27;t give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I use this cream daily to prevent dry skin.  It rubs in well and is cosmetically elegant. Excellent price.I</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion - I love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion; light with no scent but can be mixed with body oils or a scented lotion if you choose.</li>
    <li> I already love this product - been using it for over a year, and just now bought it online. I like the pump design, but cannot get the pump to unlock.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and this lotion works well for me.  It causes no reactions at all.</li>
