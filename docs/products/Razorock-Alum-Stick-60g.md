<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Compact, but just the right size.  Packaging is great, twist on clear cap with a plastic flat base that has a moisture drain hole.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a quick once around the face after shaving, not so much for nicks and razor burn but just to tighten the skin up prior to a moisturizer application.  Of course any nicks and such will be found while using this and seal them up quick, fast, and in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size, will last for more than a year I am sure, mind the warning about keeping it off granite or marble counter tops, it will leach into the stone otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, I use after each shave, it fits the hand well, glides over moist skin, or just run it under some water.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I use mine frequently and it&#x27;s lasted a very long time. I enjoy the cooling effect and the skin conditioning it gives. It pairs well with most guys colognes and doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky or lotion grease feel. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Does not control bleeding.</li>
    <li> This is a product every wet shaver should own. I placed an order for this product and received it ahead of time. Used it for the first time and it did as described in other reviews. Left my face fealing refreshed, tightened the tone of my skin, and only felt a mild burn on my neck when using. I highly recommend this product, will order again.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I bought it originally for nicks and cuts as a result of shaving with a DES razor. I was tired of spending half an hour or more trying to stop the stupid bleeding, and I certainly was sick of getting blood on my shirt collars.  This stick stops the bleeding instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read that it was a good skin toner, but I was pretty skeptical.  I have pretty oil skin and adult acne.  I&#x27;ve used just about every over-the-counter acne/oil control product and many prescription products too.  None have truly worked.  I decided to give this stick a try for that.  It does a great job at keeping my skin from getting oily and gross.  I&#x27;ve used it now for a few weeks as a toner.  My skin is actually getting clearer.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any blocked pores for me.</li>
    <li> I got this a while ago. Great product. Burns a little bit but only if you shaved very roughly. I haven&#x27;t had a single bump since I started using this product!</li>
    <li> I like that this is a bit easier to hold and use than the block Alums. It&#x27;s simple and useful as a deodorant.</li>
    <li> Far superior at dealing with nicks than other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from razor burn when you shave with a Razor Blade this is well worth the cost. I have seen this product as high as $24.00 @ AOS  stores. and as high as $18.00 on e-bay. Great product. I use it I would recommend it highly to anyone that wants it.</li>
    <li> I got this to help with small nicks from my DE razor.  I got it because it was small, a good price, and had the self-contained plastic dome that came along with it.  The alum works great, and the design with the plastic dome allows me to use it, put the &#x27;cap&#x27; on it, and stow it without worrying about damaging the alum, or getting the alum on other stuff in my kit.  The plastic base also allows me to use the stick without getting the alum on my hands.  If you&#x27;re looking for a bigger block, they&#x27;re out there, but this little one is doing the trick for me.</li>
    <li> This is a bit neater to use and easier to store than a traditional alum block. Dries clear, stops weepers and bleeding, prevents breakouts. Nice modern delivery of an old-time solution.</li>
    <li> Works great so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I am a recent convert to double edge shaving (far superior to plastic multi blades). I decided to try the RazoRock Alum Block stick. I apply it after shaving, then leave it on while I clean my brush and rinse off before After Shave. I think it helps and it seems to make my face feel better. I think it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This rock will last for a very long time.  Can be used under an aftershave.  It leaves no white residue on the skin.  I was hoping it would replace a styptic pencil but it doesn&#x27;t.  This seals the minor scrapes and soothes.  For actual cuts, I still need the traditional product.</li>
    <li> azorock is simply the compound alum on a easy to grip base. Just rub it along your wet face after rinsing any remaining shave lather. It will tell you the degree of razor burn by the tingling you recieve. It will also close your pores and tighten the skin. You may leave it on or rinse it off if you prefer. Also makes a fantastic deodorant! It&#x27;s the same ingredient in your scented anti-perspirant. Try this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to help after every shave. It gives me a red face, too. I think it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> The RazoRock Alum Block is a great addition to my daily shaving routine. I had to switch to an electric razor when I first started shaving 4 years ago due to my sensitive skin. My roommate let me try his when I got razor burn on my neck. Within minutes the razor burn was gone. I ordered a block and have been using it daily. I even switched over to a manual razor just to try the RazoRock with it. It definitely stung more, but left me without profuse bleeding from nicks and zero trace of razor burn. Bought some for a friend for Christmas, and he loved it.</li>
    <li> Much better than the old syptic pencil</li>
    <li> Work well, i use this with my single blade shaving system and leaves skin feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> It is only 2 inch long looked really big on Pic</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. It burns. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as real aftershave, but it would  be great to travel with or use in addition to other lotions.</li>
    <li> after i shave, i rinse my face with hot water then cold water then i take the alum block, wet it with cold water and rub it on my face, for 60 seconds rewetting the alum block very often, it stops the bleeding from nicks and cuts..leave it on for 60 seconds then rinse it off with cold water water...i feel great, smooth face..no blood</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great product and works in tightening the skin and closing the pores post shave.  I&#x27;ve also read that alum can be good for those with acne but haven&#x27;t seen this first hand as I don&#x27;t suffer from acne.  Overall I would recommend this product to those looking to add alum to their post shave routine.</li>
    <li> Nice big styptic block that works well and stings like a champ :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say that it helps razor nicks at all or maybe I don&#x27;t know what I am doing.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest invention since Al Gore invented the Internet.  Oh, wait, alum blocks have been around for centuries.  The Romans used them to purify drinking water. Alum is used as a deodorant (called a &amp;#34;deodorant crystal&amp;#34; in some places) around the world.  Some cunning chap, probably a British chemist, figured out that it coagulates blood from shaving nicks and cuts, and the styptic pencil was born.  Then styptic pencils and alum blocks used for shaving purposes sort of died out when electric razors became the norm and straight and safety razors fell out of favor. I use it after shaving (with a straight or safety razor) whether I cut myself or not, because it also tightens the skin and is a nice pre-after-shave-lotion treatment, but it&#x27;s nice to know that if I forget to bring deodorant on a trip to where I am going to shave and the water may be suspect, I&#x27;ve got all that covered with one product. This particular product has a great container and shape, and is small enough to take in a travel kit (for all of the aforementioned reasons).  Worth the extra buck or two for the container alone.</li>
    <li> It is a very good Alum stick. It goes on well and is easy to use. The lid helps with keeping it clean and dry. I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and I agree with the 5-star reviewers comments, however you can buy it pretty much everywhere else for $5.99. Why it would cost 50% more on Amazon, I have no idea.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived with out this. Simple and very effective at stopping shallow cuts. Face feels nice after use.</li>
    <li> I couldnt get this product to work for me at first to seal nics while shaving.  After experimentation if you wet it then rub it on to the nic for a few seconds until it dries out.  This worked to seal the nics everytime now.  Stings slightly when applies to face, but doesnt leave any residue which is nice.</li>
    <li> Great little product. This is one of the few ways to find out if your shaving technique needs a little work. Everywhere this stings is a place to take more time on next shave. I love the tightening feeling of my skin after the alum. Alum lasts until you drop it and with the small plastic base I don&#x27;t have to worry too much about losing my grip. Must have for any wet shaver.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Brilliant Idea by manufacturer to have a hole on bottom of holder to allow for access water drainage after use. Will be buying the bar next!</li>
    <li> This was the first Alum Block that I&#x27;ve used for shaving. started shaving using a DE shaver about 2 months ago and went the first month without using an Alum Block. the difference between them is a complete 180 degree. the alum block stings a bit where you mistreated your face, but that&#x27;s the beauty of it since it tells you where you need to be careful next time, and at the same time it heals any nips and cuts that occur by your mistake. the delivery with the plastic handle seems to be ideal for the modern shaver, unlike the block that could slip and crack. also the thing that i find convenient is that the plastic holder has a small hole at the bottom that allows any trapped water to be release and not form any unwanted gunk. 5 out of 5.</li>
    <li> Love this product, will last 10 to 12 month&#x27;s, shaving every other day.</li>
    <li> great product  stops small nicks from bleeding and the block stays solid</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;wet-shaver&amp;#34; for about two years and read so much about alum.  I finally got the RazoRock Alum Stick.  It is a great product.  It works great after any shave but especially if you have any irritation or a nick.  I really appreciate the container and rounded shape.  Easy to apply and convenient to use and store.  I just got a larger alum block so the alum stick may go in my travel kit.</li>
    <li> better than the fragile blocks. hole in the bottom of handle allows H2O to drain out with out worry of mold or junk breading in it while cap is on. very convenient than others</li>
    <li> Shaving is much more pleasant, now that I am using this. My skin is much less irritated. I wish I would have tried it long ago.</li>
    <li> Did you cut your face and use a white pencil that leaves residue and burn all day?&lt;br /&gt;Ok, me too.  Now I use this and it is amazing.  Buy it now</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me. I went back to a Clubman styptic pencil that works better for me. Different guys like different stuff.</li>
    <li> This replaced Pinaud Dab-On styptic pencils in my medicine chest about six months ago and I haven&#x27;t regretted it once.  while the dab-on is a pretty good product, this does the job better and faster.  I picked it up when I started a brief dalliance with double edge razors a few months back and it proved its worth.  While d.e. shaving has its upside in a very close shave and the manly ritual of the brush applied lather the downside, at least for me, was slicing my face open on a regular basis no matter what blade I tried.  The cuts were never terribly deep, nicks for the most part really but they bled and that was very inconvenient when dressing for the office with little time to spare.  So, it was with great relief that I applied this product and found it did a great job of puckering up the edges of those little cuts and shutting down the bleeding almost immediately.  Applying it to the whole face tightens the skin and improves your appearance as well.  Just  run it under the faucet for a second then rub it all across your cheeks and neck.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a severe issue with ingrown hairs and irritation pretty much every time I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using RazoRock after every shave, and I&#x27;ve noticed a great improvement in my ingrown hairs.  Also, my skin feels very smooth.  I think the alum also works as a toner.</li>
    <li> I love this alum block setup.  It has a nice screw on cover and the alum is mounted to a plastic handle that you hold.  The rounded head allows easy application to tight areas of the face and is easy to travel with and manage.  Gives you definite feedback as to your shave.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> not too impressed. I was hoping this would do a better job with minor nicks and cuts/weepers but it really does little to stop the bleeding of even the most minor of cuts etc.&lt;br /&gt;sadly I can not get rid of the styptic pencil which I was hoping to do.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this RazoRock Alum block for me along with some Proraso Eucalyptus/Menthol shaving soap (http://www.amazon.com/Proraso-Shaving-Eucalyptus-Menthol-Formulation/dp/B00837YY18/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1434051812&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;proraso+shaving+soap+150ml )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a nice surprise, makes the morning shave ritual so much nicer.  Much better than alcohol based aftershaves that don&#x27;t really seem to do anything but burn your flesh.  RazoRock stops bleeding nicks without the burn and white residue of a styptic stick.  Cool and refreshing on the skin, instantly feels taught and refreshed.  Nice smooth applicator with a sturdy screw on cap that protects the alum block, not some flimsy cardboard or squared off plastic.  Smooth alum cylinder of Potassium Alum, made in Thailand, imported to Ontario. Ironically, RazoRock looks very similar to my wife&#x27;s crystal deodorant (ammonium alum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RazoRock will be in my shaving kit until I decide to grow a ZZ Top beard.</li>
    <li> Started DE shaving after years of electric, and many of the forums I read suggested Alum. It, along with a lotion or after shave balm, is keeping my skin quite happy.   I don&#x27;t think the Alum in RazoRock is anything special. But the packaging is VERY good. Both easy to apply as well as store and/or transport. Given how long this stuff lasts it&#x27;s well worth the few extra bucks to have something so easy to use.</li>
    <li> RazoRock makes quality shaving products (shaving soaps, razors, aftershaves etc). You will not go wrong with any of their products including this one. It very convenient and perfect for travel. And more importantly, it does the job. It is great for irritations and weepers.  You will also feel it working on irritation you may not even know you have otherwise. Great product!</li>
    <li> Horrible product! It crumbles up in the 1st 2weeks of use. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> The Alum raw materials in this product are fine, but the handle does not last long when it is used regularly.  After a month or so, it fell out of the handle and i use it with my bare hands.  Nothing wrong with using it with my bare hands, but you can get a block for much cheaper without the handle.  I would not buy this product again, but the raw materials worked fine.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s the point?  It burns but doesn&#x27;t stop bleeding.</li>
    <li> great product for using on small shaving cuts.  Stops bleeding pretty quickly.  Has a tendency to dry out my skin if I don&#x27;t rinse it off after a few minutes of application.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Packaging is great for traveling therefor worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit more costly than a standard alum block and you get less product, but in return you get a comfortably shaped stick with a base/handle and a sturdy screw on cap. It&#x27;s perfectly sized for the medicine cabinet or travel and it doesn&#x27;t leave the white film/residue that most alum/styptic pencils leave behind. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, as I feel it could of been just a little bigger, but it&#x27;s still a great little stick!</li>
    <li> Pretty standard alum, but worth buying just for the nifty storage container it comes in.</li>
    <li> RazoRock is my favorite new find. I&#x27;ve tried 3 of their shave creams (classic, aristocrat, and fresco) and now the alum block. For the price, this stuff is boss. Recommend over everything else I&#x27;ve tried. Seriously..</li>
    <li> Alum block&#x27;s should be part of any mans shaving routine.  It stops bleeding if you knick yourself and it also helps prevent red bumps on the neck.</li>
    <li> I just started wet shaving a few months ago, and when I am remiss in changing out the blades I tend to get a couple nicks.  This little baby stops the bleeding and doesn&#x27;t sting as much as a septic pencil.  Plus with how large it is, I can&#x27;t imagine that I will ever run out.  The packaging is also nice for those of us who travel a lot.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t ever tried RazoRock products? Shame on you. This is as good as any of the goodies Joseph and Michael cook up. Wet the stick after you get done shaving and apply it to your face. A little burn is normal, especially on areas of your skin that are irritated or nicked. This stick does not dry up your face as badly as a lot of alums I have used. The stick form is very convenient and well made. I use it after every shave and then apply my favorite scented aftershave or splash after I wash it off.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try. Surprisingly enough, excellent for aftershave maintanance. Quickly takes care of those little shaving nicks and or areas where razor burn caused irritation.</li>
    <li> Basically all quality shaving alum is the same, a natural aftershave that really works well. I use it after every shave and it works great for sealing up any razor burn or nicks.  It also tightens the skin and is very refreshing.  This particular alum block is awesome though.  First off, it is a little larger than typical blocks and should last a VERY long time.  Secondly, the container is terrific and is the best selling point of the product.  Alum shatters relatively easily and this container protects against that, it keeps it dry so the alum won&#x27;t dissolve or leave residue in your cabinet, and the rubbery base is easy to hold with wet hands.  If you are looking for an Alum block, this is the one to get.  Almost half the cost of the smaller Art of Shaving block and it is the exact same stuff.</li>
    <li> I like using this. It is attached to a plastic handle which gives me the grip I need when my hands are wet.</li>
    <li> There are certainly cheaper options when it comes to buying alum, so with this product you&#x27;re really paying for the holder.  It works great in keeping the alum protected and relatively dry.  The plastic base makes it easy to hold and relatively hard to drop.  I loved it until I dropped it and shattered the alum, but I can&#x27;t blame the product for my own clumsiness (many a good alum have met their end on my bathroom floor).</li>
    <li> This is pretty much what you would expect. It&#x27;s a cylinder of alum with a rounded top. There&#x27;s a hard polycarbonate shell that screws on to the base to protect the block during travel. It&#x27;s alum. Good presentation. Good price. It works. Five stars.</li>
    <li> Very good little product it comes in it&#x27;s own container.&lt;br /&gt;Never tried alum blocks before and I have to say this is great, it fights irritation, great after shave, great protection for your face.</li>
    <li> Great bracing after shave.</li>
    <li> A little over priced for what you get, but the cover and convenience make up for the cost. No complaints, people need to make money on their products</li>
    <li> Good product, not really sure that it prevents bleeding completely though... Really nice that it has a built-in holder/lid/cap.</li>
    <li> Perfectly packaged for travel.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations.Works like it should.</li>
    <li> This product is far better as a after shave treatment than the witch hazel I was using. Tightens the skin and leaves your face feeling great. This is not your typical alum &amp;#34;block&amp;#34;, and is less apt to break than the block form. Simply unscrew the cap and rub your wet face with the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;....leave on for about a minute and rinse it off. Apply your favorite aftershave, if desired.</li>
    <li> Great addition to your post shave routine. The handle at the bottom allows this to be a mess free application. I have been using this product for about a month and really like it. This one block will probably last a year or 2.... Easily.</li>
    <li> At first it was a miracle on stopping bleeds. After using it for a bit it lost its affect a bit on my skin. Might be how I am using it, but it still serves its purpose as an aftershave antiseptic</li>
    <li> Ok... so I read all the reviews about this product and figured it was a no brainer... nothing but 4s and 5s... and for the first month I had this thing I would have agreed 100%... but lets be honest... the whole allure of this is the fact that it is in a nice little holder and easy to use... all alum blocks are the same after all... Well sorry to say that roughly a month to 6 weeks after starting to use this it has now fallen out of the nice little holder and is just regular old alum block... it still works just fine and the thought behind it is great but after the alum wears down even a little bit (and yes I dry it off after each use) it starts to get loose in the holder and then it is just a matter of time...</li>
    <li> I started wetshaving several years ago and have tried several cheap alum blocks.  They all work but are hard to hold on too and awkward to travel with.  I usually drop them after awhile and they shatter.  RazoRock fixes this issue by packaging it in a great applicator which makes it easy to hold and apply as well as store.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Made in Thailand (which I don&#x27;t love), with no air hole for the Alum to breath after wetting.  It&#x27;s alright, a good deal for sure, and I liked the handle.</li>
    <li> Best one on the market. I have been using the regular blocks and they slip out of your hand then you have a jagged piece of alum chunks and slivers. This won&#x27;t slip out of your hand!! Pay the extra buck and a half... Way worth it</li>
    <li> I just started wet shaving with a double edge razor and bought this for any nicks I may receive. I have used it a few times and it seems to work well. Stops any bleeding without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> this alum block is ok and it serves its purpose. nothing too special. it does stop bleeding from minor nicks and cuts but it has a difficult time stopping cuts that are a bit deeper than nicks. i use this after i shave but i do prefer the clubman stick.</li>
    <li> The best part about this alum is the base it comes in. It really makes it easy to grip it when your hands are slippery.</li>
    <li> 1.  Found the same thing as Thai Antipersirant  for 1/3 the price in my local store.  I&#x27;ll know better next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  As a styptic, it works OK, not great.  At least it doesn&#x27;t get all bumpy like a traditional styptic pencil does.</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected and of good quality.  However the same quality and packaging is available at stores for $3.00 to $4.00 with different branding.  This brand is therefore overpriced.</li>
    <li> Does its job, no mess.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Does a very good job cleaning up those little nicks.</li>
    <li> It is good. Lasting a very very long time. Feels wonderful on the skin. Stops minor cuts from hurting and bleeding. Leaves my face feeling soft, dry and not irritated. I don&#x27;t use an aftershave with this.</li>
    <li> I originally started using this Alum block after shaving to close any nicks.  It is great after using a safety razor to finish a good shave.  I find if also gives me quick feedback about the quality of the shave and if I was careless and nicked myself anywhere (mild stinging sensation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also learned that it is a great deodorant, it is the most effective thing I have used to prevent strong post exercise sweat odor.  .  I keep a second block in my gym bag which I rub under my arm and over my chest before working out.  I no longer feel like I need to avoid people as I head back to the locker after a sweaty workout.</li>
    <li> Stops bleeding in the case of nicks when shaving</li>
    <li> I like this! Never tried one before. Works and feels good on my face, but it does rattle around in the holder so much it makes me think it is going to fall out, although it hasn&#x27;t yet.</li>
    <li> great deodorant, I got it on time.&lt;br /&gt;it is the perfect solution if you don&#x27;t want to use chemicals like deodorant</li>
    <li> Best alum block I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It isn&#x27;t crumbly like some cheaper ones I&#x27;ve had... and the shape is really quite convenient.</li>
    <li> The rock can come loose from the plastic handle if you&#x27;re not careful. I suppose you could just glue it back on though. Mine&#x27;s just a little loose after a year or so.</li>
    <li> Good and works like a charm.  Doesn&#x27;t sting and handles small nicks perfect. I had been using a styptic pencil.  This works just as good without the white spots.</li>
    <li> I use this after every shave.  It helps sooth any nicks and tights up the pores nicely.  There is no scent so you can use any aftershave lotion you want.</li>
    <li> I love this alum block. I wonder how I got along without it.</li>
    <li> Works well, cool colorful packaging. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Like the &amp;#34;deodorant style&amp;#34; convenience of the container. Not as messy as using a plain alum block.  What else can I say? It&#x27;s alum.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I wish I had started using it sooner. Everything it a was advertised to be. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> simple and effective to use to heal small irritations and nicks that may not be that visible, has improved my skin tone !.</li>
    <li> Solid product, it will last you a long long time, provided you dont drop it like I did a few weeks in.  But it&#x27;s worth the price of admission for sure.</li>
    <li> Good product as advertised.  A smaller stick would suffice.  .</li>
    <li> Tried using a block and kept dropping it. Purchased this and it has lasted twice as long since it has a place to hold and built-in storage. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought it on a whim. I must say I really like it. It does taste funny if you get it in your mouth though.</li>
    <li> Funny thing is, I am new to safety razor shaving, and the only cuts I usually get are on my ear lobes. I will look away for just a second, or be concentrating on my face, and not pay attention to my razor, and I get a cut on my lobe. Granted, I do have big ears and unattached lobes. This has only happened twice. You think I would have learned the first time. The rare nicks I do get, I apply the alum stick to, and no more blood. Very pleased with this purchase. It may last forever. I don&#x27;t know. But if I do use it up, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Self-contained, convenient and it works. Just run under cold water, apply after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Tightens the skin and reduces or, in my case, eliminates razor burn when applying after shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;A perfect companion to my other shaving paraphernalia. ~ The Boss</li>
    <li> Boughtt this for my travel kit.  Great for after shaving skin treatment and can be used as deoderant as well.  Nice small size and sturdy contianer makes it a great fit in my ditty bag.</li>
    <li> This stuff... Seriously. I rub it on my balls, and they don&#x27;t stink anymore. I rub it on my ass, and my hemorrhoids go away. This stuff is amazing. Buy it, use it, be happy. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  It closes my pores and seals cuts/nicks.  Any razor burn is soothed immediately.  Its easy to use and very effective.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7 months and it seems to last a long time.  I recommend this item because its half the cost of the Art of Shaving Alum block.</li>
    <li> Works quickly without any white residue on skin.  Soothes nicks from shaving better than steptic pencils.  I plan to reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> Shipping was really fast. Exactly what the description said it was. However, it doesn&#x27;t really work. Leaves a film on your face and doesn&#x27;t stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used alum &amp;#34;blocks&amp;#34; in the past and they tended to usually fall and break (crack/shatter/etc).  I&#x27;m a big fan of this &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; concept because it just helps keep everything tidy.  You can get more &amp;#34;alum&amp;#34; for your dollar using some other form factor like a block, but this stuff lasts for ever.  It is a salt so I do recommend licking it once just for fun.  Otherwise the general plan is shave, splash with cold water and rub the stick over face.  Really great product.</li>
    <li> And I love it. After a trim of my cheeks and neck (I&#x27;m rocking a short beard these days) I wet this block and rubbed it along my freshly-shaved areas. It stung for a second, but then felt so smooth and clean. The price is good... I know that you can get bigger bars for a little cheaper... but the fact that this one comes in a small plastic container makes it good for travel or storage. It&#x27;s hard to tell from the pic, but the stick is about two inches long.</li>
    <li> No problem with the product, just not happy about Potassium Alum</li>
    <li> I chose this one because it came with a grip at the end. I use this religiously after every shave. After my hot towel, I splash my face with a little cool water and let the alum go to work. After a few minutes I use a cold wet towel to rinse off and apply a facial lotion.</li>
    <li> Should last a really long time. I like the base and the cap. Should help it last longer by keeping it dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this alum stick because I dropped my last alum block on my tile bathroom floor and it shattered into a million pieces!  When alum gets wet, it gets a little slick, believe it or not.  All it takes is one good drop and it&#x27;s gone.  This one has a nice handle that makes it much easier to hold securely.  It also has a nice plastic cover for just throwing in your bag.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Like taking a trip to Woolworth&#x27;s in the 60&#x27;s.  Works well and is a versatile product unlike a pencil.  Shipped fast and was not marked up, looks great next to my old fashion razor.</li>
    <li> purchased this because I thought the handle would make it ideal and convenient for closing up the nicks, but the stick doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all for me.  Before this I had a styptic pencil which stopped bleeding almost instantly.  Unfortunately when I run this on my skin, wet or dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything (or very little, at least).</li>
    <li> I use it for a shaved head, this product works decently. It has many flaws including no steptic properties so any knicks or cuts do not stop bleeding. It is a really big salt crystal and you must keep it moist when using it. If you don&#x27;t then you end up tearing up fresh skin. There is a small drainage hole on the bottom, so if you leave it out there is a good chance it will drain out on to what ever is under it. Plus no scent at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I use alum to prevent ingrown hairs on my legs.  I also found out that alum works really well on my cystic acne spots as well.  So basically what I&#x27;m saying is that I use a ton of alum.  I used to buy the really cheap alum blocks on Amazon, but found that the blocks didn&#x27;t last me very long.  I went through a block a month and actually scratched myself pretty badly once with a block that cracked and fell apart while I was using it.  Those blocks would also frequently show up with weird yellow spots, which I was informed were impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RazoRock alum lasts me quite a bit longer than the cheap alum.  I&#x27;m going on more than two months of daily shaving now and haven&#x27;t even come close to using half of it.  The handle and cap makes it really convenient to use in the shower.  I&#x27;ve dropped blocks of alum before, but I&#x27;ve never worried about that happening with this stuff.  I do shake it out after every use and store it in a place outside of the shower though.  I find that water sometimes builds up in the handle somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as stopping bleeding from nicks and cuts, it works just as well as all the other alum out there.</li>
    <li> Use this product for year now. It works very well and I am very pleased with it. Highly recommended to all concerned.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!!!! I like many wet shavers that use alum rocks have accidentally dropped my block because it to slip through my fingers. The way this is made makes it impossible to slip out of your hands. and it has a nice protective twist cap. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good old alum. Quite a bit more expensive than many of the other alum blocks to be found on Amazon, however, since purchasing this one, I doubt I&#x27;ll go back. I feel like the RazoRock Alum doesn&#x27;t wear down and crack as quickly as my previous alum blocks. Great for closing up nicks from shaving. Doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as a styptic pencil, which I save for bigger nicks, but the alum block works great for reducing irritation and closing up the smaller cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A little pricey for alum, but in my experience, this alum has lasted longer than previous cheaper alum bars I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It really works!!! Far less razor burn and bumps or irritation!</li>
    <li> When I switched to double edged razors I cut myself. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me by a friend and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  I used to buy those cheap white chalk pencils to put on cuts and they burned and looked ridiculous. You can wipe the white junk off, but when you do your face can start bleeding again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This block works great on cuts and small nicks. A bit of fresh water on the end and a little pressure does it for me. It feels great on my face while I&#x27;m using it for a short time afterwards. No smell but I still think it&#x27;s a great aftershave feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this is great, there are a few other brands on amazon that are much more expensive and you get less product. I&#x27;ve had the same one for a little over two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone regardless of the type of razors they are using.</li>
    <li> While I wish this product was slightly cheeper, the price is pretty standard for this type of alum. The design is the best out of any alum block I&#x27;ve ever used. The plastic grip makes this much easier to hold, and the way it&#x27;s shaped makes it much easier to use. I don&#x27;t want to go back to traditional rectangle designs ever again. Standard rectangle designs are slippery, and dropping an alum bar will often break apart this fragile and expensive rock.</li>
    <li> Works well, comes in a handy package. Has really helped with weepers and any irritation I&#x27;ve had after shaving. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not sure what else is out there but this alum block is compact, has a cap and performs as advertised.  The cap allows for easy storage and travel. I&#x27;ve gone back to a double edged razor and use the RazoRock Alum Block for occasional nicks.  Some folks use it as a deodorant.  Regardless of how you use the RazoRock, it&#x27;s a good little product.</li>
    <li> Nice alum block.  It worked well for a few months then it started to crack, leaving sharp edges.  However while it was whole it worked great.  I like how it isn&#x27;t too large so its easy to apply where it&#x27;s needed.</li>
    <li> Cool shape, great price, does the job.</li>
    <li> It appears to be exactly what it was made to be; an Alum Block.  If it works as all Alum Blocks do, there should not be a problem with its ability to stop razor cuts.  Which is the purpose it was clearly designed for.</li>
    <li> I have just returned to DE shaving after a long hiatus and I remember the blood flowing from each razor scratch or cut that I inflicted upon myself. If you are around my age you&#x27;ll also remember that the only way to stop the bleeding was using tissues; and hoping that your blood would clot before you bled to death or had to go off to work with those tissues stuck all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor Rock Alum Block is a sure fire way to stop the bleeding when you mishandle your DE razor and cut yourself. It is a good size to keep in your doop bag or on a shelf in the bathroom cabinet. It has a hole in the bottom of the Alum shaped cylindrical block, (cylindrical block, boy I hope that this description isn&#x27;t as confusing as I think it is?), which is a neat little drain hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I&#x27;d order again; but, I hope that my shaving skills improve and I won&#x27;t have to reorder- but you never know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, sting on the micro burns and close the pours.  You know when you did a good job when there are no stings.  Also good as a pre-electric shave treatment.</li>
    <li> As a new wet shaver this saved my life.  Rubbing this on right after a shave stings a little bit, but since I started using it I haven&#x27;t had any bad razor burn.  Combined with a good lotion this will leave your skin toned and smooth.  I actually started using it on my entire face to take the place of my alcohol-infused facial toner and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Good size for a good grip.  Works as it is supposed to and clean up is easy.  This should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> The stick is much better than a block of alum. Easier to control when you are finishing your shave. Nice cover too. Well made product.</li>
    <li> Alum blocks are the best after-shave of all.  They&#x27;re unscented, astringent, antiseptic and can also be used like a styptic for very small nicks.  I really like this one above all others because of the built in holder and case.  I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for these features alone.  And the expense is minimal anyway considering one will last me seven or eight months with daily use.  I&#x27;ve used these for several years and (barring some new invention) will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Stops needing very fast</li>
    <li> Alum in a convenient format. I don&#x27;t always use it, but it&#x27;s nice to have for after shaving take its toll on my face. I&#x27;m on my second one. I used the first one pretty often and it lasted at least several months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good smooth alum block, but I didn&#x27;t like the shape. It dried much faster than the standard block making it a pain to use.</li>
    <li> Product that works as it should!  Extra bonus of being compact and traveling well if needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it works great. If I cut myself a bit (as I often do because I just started using a safe razor for the first time), I put this on and it stings for a half a second and then its gone. I never get redness anymore with my shaving like I did when I used a Calvin Klein aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a smell so keep that in mind. I love how easy it is to use, store, and carry around on trips and such. No gross ziplock bag or whatnot, the plastic \\&quot;case\\&quot; it comes in is superb!</li>
    <li> Good quality alum block - I guess it&#x27;s a little more expensive than some others because of the container and holder.  I really need one I can throw in my bag and travel with and this one fits the bill.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s on a handy base that locks into the container for storage.  It certainly beats using a styptic pencil for the occassional nick or cut and doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery residue when it dries. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> i would get it again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband. He has used it for a month now and his skin looks so much better.</li>
    <li> This is very handy to use. I use after the shave whether I have cuts or not. Tells me where I overdid and where not. Sensitive areas shows irritations.  Cuts burn lot more. I like the cylindrical shape.</li>
    <li> The handle holds the block well, provides a good grip, and does not slip when wet. The cap provides adequate protection and is secure. Surprisingly small and lasts a long time, as all good alum blocks should.</li>
    <li> Forget ripping up toilet paper and sticking it on those cuts--an alum block is what you need to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this alum block along with my first DE razor (Merkur #34C) about 4 months ago. I shave three times a week followed by a pass with the RazoRock Alum Block whenever I&#x27;m not too careful and I still have about 85% of it left. Any small nicks, cuts or razor burn will sting momentarily but does help stop bleeding better than using tissues, Vaseline, or nothing at all. Just run it under cold water, rub it on your face and your face will instantly be sanitized as alum blocks are natural sanitizers (so you won&#x27;t see any gunk growing on it over time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you let it dry completely after putting it on your face it will form an invisible layer that will make any moisturizers or acne treatment slide off and not absorb well. Apply them right after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convenient plastic base is still attached securely and I even dropped it in the sink once. The cap doesn&#x27;t screw on very securely so do expect it to come off if you&#x27;re sticking it in a travel bag. Overall it&#x27;s a good and affordable alum block that will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Good antiseptic for after your shave. The amount of stinging will tell you how good (or bad) your shave was. Less sting &#x3D; good (meaning not too abrasive) shave. Closes the pores and tightens the skin nicely. I follow up with a balm and then a splash. Your skin feels great afterwards. Excellent design and great for travel. Also makes an excellent underarm deodorant and neutralizes many odors (like stinky feet, fish or garlic smell on hands but I would use different sticks for those purposes.....)The big blocka may be cheaper, but this is brilliantly designed for easy use and travel. Easy 5 stars.</li>
    <li> So you finally want a &#x27;proper&#x27; shave that doesn&#x27;t keep hurting all day? Then this is a good step forward. Usually after you shave your face, all you do is wash it with cold water and maybe some aftershave right? Well, that&#x27;s not the right way to do things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you shave, apply cold water (preferably with the help of a small towel) and then apply this to your still wet skin (where you shaved). Even if you are bleeding, it WILL sting a bit there, but it will stop 99% of any (small) cuts, close up your pores and give you face a rather refreshed feeling. Is that what it really does? Well I&#x27;m not sure, but I can tell you this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using this Alum block, my face always hurt, was super sensitive and bled in a few places for a while. Which really made going to business meeting difficult, as having small dry blood spots everywhere was rather unsightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while my face is still sensitive and easily gets cut: after I put this on pretty much anything that was bleeding ISN&#x27;T anymore and my face feels ... well, normal and clean! It&#x27;s not overly sensitive anymore after shaving and my skin feels super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically: if you want your face to not hurt nor bleed as much, get this and use it. It&#x27;ll also help clear up acne, bumps and other things a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I see is that plastic stand that the alum block is in. It feels like the block will fall out of it&#x27;s holder, which sucks. It&#x27;s wibbly wobbly. Hasn&#x27;t fallen out yet, but who knows. Other than that, love this thing for use after shaving!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly to stop any blood from shaving nicks. Burns a little, but that&#x27;s the price to pay for not having blood dripping down your neck all morning! Should last many years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and I really like it, I haven&#x27;t had it come loose like another reviewer said. I also use it as a deodorant after my shower it works great most deodorants usually give me a rash on my armpits that really itches, this hasn&#x27;t caused a rash at all and it blocks the smell of my sweat. only thing I do not like is that it seems smaller than most alum blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses:&lt;br /&gt;- As a natural deodorant use after shaving the underarm. Run Alum Block under cold water and rub it lightly on the underarm.&lt;br /&gt;- As a pimple fixer, wet the Alum Block and rub over pimple until it leaves a deposit of salt on pimple. It is best to use overnight while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;- Keep Alum block handy in the kitchen, tool or tackle box, even for the kids; use it anywhere you might get cut.</li>
    <li> I read about the razorock on a couple different shaving websites and ordered it to see if it lived up to the reviews I had read. It&#x27;s easy enough to use. Just wet the end of the stick and rub all over your face after shaving. It&#x27;s seals up the pores of your skin and has a tingling sensation. It comes with a plastic holder and a screw on cover which is nice. If you have minor nicks or cuts I did notice that the razorock doesn&#x27;t stop the bleeding. So invest in a septic stick for those minor cuts and nicks. I give it a buy to add to your daily shaving regiment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this block for just over 2 years now and still have about 1/4 left.  I use it 3-4 days per week after every shave.  It really tightens my skin back up after shaving with hot water.  Very handy container for storage, travel and application.  I don&#x27;t know how it could be done any better.</li>
    <li> This is not a &amp;#34;reconstituted&amp;#34; alum block. It is a solid block inside a great container. The container&#x27;s top has a snug fit. (as it should)</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It&#x27;s definitely alum (i can feel it on my face when i nick myself). The reason i went with this one is because of it&#x27;s handle. You read about people dropping their alum on the floor and it shattering, and the truth is it happens to the best of us. However, this handle and case has saved me from it shattering twice already. So although there is a little less product than its competitors, it has already paid for itself by not breaking!</li>
    <li> This was my first RazoRock product purchase. Since then, I have purchased several of their soaps, plus a razor. All of the RazoRock products are excellent. I bought this alum stick for an extended cross-country vacation. I had been using an alum block at home as a post-shave treatment; it closes the pores after you shave and stops any minor nicks. But, I was concerned that it would be messy to travel with. This alum block comes with its own cover, and the whole deal is very compact. Basically, you use it like a deodorant stick, but on your face. So, I bought it. It was perfect for my trip, which was across the US and Canada - nine weeks of traveling! Not only did this product work perfectly for travel, I found it so easy to use that it has been in daily use since my return. And, it still looks like new - no signs of wear! At this rate, one stick will last me years.</li>
    <li> Since using this alum block for a month, my post-shave hours have become much more enjoyable. The base of the block makes this product very convenient and helps keep the bathroom clean. I have noticed the block starting to loosen from the block, so this feature may lose its utility pretty soon (my only real complaint).</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  better than the stick that I last used.</li>
    <li> This works great for me. No more razor bumps when I use this (in addition to shaving regularly with my safety razor). I love this.</li>
    <li> Product arrived a day or two sooner than expected, and all intact. It works just like an alum block should, and the base provides a nice grip, so it is much less likely that it will slip from my hand and shatter in the sink.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on some articles on shaving.  I&#x27;m not sure I see the benefit, but the product is as described and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use a DE razor and ocasionally get  razor burn after shaving. I have tried many different after shaves, lotions, etc but have not been happy with the price, smell what have you. After a bit of research I decided to purchase the RazoRock Alum Block and give it a shot. I am so happy I purchased this. No smell, easy to use (just wet and apply) no sticky residue. Quality product for the price!!</li>
    <li> Yeah after trying this with a few shaves, I honestly see myself continuing to buy this. This&#x27;ll fix up your skin in no time flat after a rough shave and considering how much is left after the amount I&#x27;ve used it, is honestly some darn good bang for your buck. Plus the little base and cap it comes in is really cool for keeping it nice and dry and getting a good grip on it to rub over your face. I honestly don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note to first timers: yeah this&#x27;ll burn a bit when you put it on, but don&#x27;t worry about it! It won&#x27;t last for more than a minute, and it&#x27;ll let you know where to be more careful.</li>
    <li> Feel that sting? It&#x27;s a good sting, and trust me... it&#x27;s better than the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel, and as effective as any other alum block out there.</li>
    <li> Never shave with out it thanks razorock.</li>
    <li> I started to use a DE razor to shave with. That has caused me to get more razor burn when i am not holding the razor correctly. This is a great way to get the relief from the burning and the stinging. When it applies it has a great cooling effect.</li>
    <li> This is one of those purchases that, when I pulled the trigger I thought, \\&quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll probably never use.\\&quot; I was really wrong. I use the alum block every day after I shave. I use a Muhle R41 with a Feather blade. I use really good shave soap (Mitchell&#x27;s, RazoRock, or Taylor of Old Bond just to mix it up) but I still get minor irritation no matter how lightly I try to shave. The alum seals those nicks and most of the time I never have to reach for the styptic (unless I get in too much of a hurry with shaving - not good). It stings like crazy but I know that every where it stings I got a little heavy handed and I try to do better next time. By the time it dries I&#x27;m ready for an after shave balm. The plastic holder keeps it from slipping out of your hand and even with repeated use (3 months so far) there&#x27;s barely any \\&quot;wear\\&quot; on the block. It is loose in the holder now but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it will come out. The way I am going - even with daily use - this thing will probably go a year and then some. Pretty good cost/use ratio.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I use an Edwin Jagger de89lbl and sometimes get knicks or scrape my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product all over shaving area and I feel it burning everywhere,  especially my neck.  I like the sting because it tells me it&#x27;s helping to heal and seal the thousands of cuts we just made that you can&#x27;t see (called shaving) and it stops any bleeding from deeper cuts. Extra bleeding cuts require more rubbing from the product, and occasionally a cut will start bleeding again a minute later and you gotta do it again. But it works good and I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave your face wet and rub this all over thoroughly right after shave.  Then I apply an after shave. (U-turn)&lt;br /&gt;I believe oils work as a much better pre-shave than soaps and gels.  I started with Taconic pre shave oil, but simple coconut or olive oil works great and cheaper.  Most products we put on our skin are full of toxic chemicals and seep in easily.  We are toxic enough without them.  These skin products/chemicals are the cause of skin cancer, including your sun screen, not the sun.  Aluminum in deodorants one of the main causes of breast cancer. (Proven, do some research. Face the fact, we cause cancer and disease, not your genes.  Eat right and stop poisoning your body, and voil&amp;agrave;) (also please stop putting your cell phone next to your breasts and other parts! Radiation, which your phone constantly emits, damages your cells and makes them cancerous. Be proactive to prevent cancer instead of thinking you have no control over it. It&#x27;s entirely under your control.  -sorry for my rant, but if I can help even 1 person to not suffer with cancer then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Its a Alum block, in a small form. What else can you say? It tightens your skin and stops small nics from bleeding. Works well and i like the small size. Good for travel or if you are short on space.</li>
    <li> This product comes in a small case and the base of the case is the handle that you hold to apply to your face.  Genius packaging! Make sure that your face and product are very wet and roll away! Great product!</li>
    <li> I used this product after shaving several times. It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality alum. I love the handle/base - it prevents slipping when wet.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and has a nice grip and way to store for travel.</li>
    <li> Good for travel, but I prefer the block version because it&#x27;s quicker to use with more surface area.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this Alum is that it is its own case. This makes it easier to store and for me easier to use. Is does have a distinct sting as all Alum does and really leaves your face clean and tight after use.</li>
    <li> The stick with plastic base makes it easier to handle than a plain block, particularly when wet.  Good price, delivered on time by vendor.</li>
    <li> it works but not as good as the cheaper walgreens septi pen.</li>
    <li> Seems to help disinfect but works best to teach a newbie like me when I am using bad technique. Shave bad and this stuff will punish you for it. Use too much pressure or over-irritate a spot and prepare yourself for the fires of Razorock fury to teach you a painful lesson. Gives you that pleasant/painful aftershave-like burn.</li>
    <li> When you need it you need it. Hopefully that will be never. I like this model because of the container it comes with.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, no scent, but great astringent properties. Do NOT leave it on any stone counters though, will etch</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You and Happy New Year!!</li>
    <li> does a good job. I wish I learned about alum a decade ago.</li>
    <li> It really works for cuts...amazing aftershave!</li>
    <li> Works great after a shave. I like the fact that it has a top that you can screw on and take it when traveling without worrying about damaging the alum stick. Also the base is plastic so you don&#x27;t have to actually touch the alum stick with your hands. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I like that this has a handle as opposed to the bars out there. It takes care of any small nicks I may have made in my shave. I just rub it on after a cold water rinse and it fixes all my mistakes.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  I use it as I&#x27;m rinsing my face.  With my face wet and the alum wet, I rub it all over the areas shaved.  It stings those areas that got chaffed and razor burned, especially when I should have changed to a new blade and didn&#x27;t.  I found that even after the block is dry that it doesn&#x27;t smell if I leave the cover off.</li>
    <li> I like this block, however I still have to make a couple of passes with this to close any nicks from shaving.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to use. Screw on cap allows it to be stored away easier. Bottom plastic allows it to be held and used with ease. One problem after some use it will wear away (as expected) but it will break away from the holder. Using it at this point becomes odd as it jiggles around in the plastic holder when your trying to apply it. So you have to try and hold the alum its self while still stuck in the holder if you want to get around this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall still a very nice price for the amount you get when compared to other company alum blocks.</li>
    <li> Good. Handy. Compact. Works as advertised. Helps with the nicks and cuts. Does leave your skin dry and slightly pulled but you can address that using a nice face cream. The design is quite handy.</li>
    <li> Burns like it should, the only thing that needs attention is the cheap cap it cracked on me like the second time I used it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on bigger nicks. Still need to keep the styptic pen around for that. It&#x27;s nice to tighten the skin up on the irritated areas.</li>
    <li> This is a great concept. It makes the alum easy to apply. It works just like any other alum I have used</li>
    <li> Great Product, Fast S&amp;H.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good alum block. I like the way it is attached to the handle. It makes it easier to apply. The product arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> It worked well. It let me know where i need to work on. Its a good product.</li>
    <li> Everyone should use an Alum Block after shaving; I&#x27;ve been using one for over 30 years. Here it is in the perfect package!</li>
    <li> What i particularly like about this alum block is the case design. The base gives you something to hold on to while applying to your face. The shape of the block lends itself to easier application (as opposed to the square or rectangular blocks). The base gets a little messy over time as the block begins to dissolve, but it cleans up easily.Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> As the title to my review suggests, I think that this Alum Block offers far more than the &amp;#34;Gentleman Jon&amp;#34; brand that comes in a small plastic case. First off,  it is important to realize that the starting shape of a piece of Alum for shaving serves as an excellent indicator of how the Alum will &amp;#34;degrade&amp;#34; over time. All alum breaks down as you use it and as it become wet. So the smoother and rounder the alum is up front when it is new, the better off you will be later. Essentially what it comes down to is that if there are sharper angles (such as with the &amp;#34;Gentleman Jon&amp;#34; brand) then the chances of pieces of the alum breaking off and thus becoming sharper and even more uncomfortable is much greater. This Alum block from RazoRock is excellent and truly a joy to use. The alum stick starts off very round and knobby which is GREAT for an alum stick. Also, the stick is certainly NOT too skinny like the alum stick offered by &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; stores either. Instead, this alum stick offers an incredibly strong and round product that will whither away over time in a respectable fashion...as opposed to breaking off in sharp chunks that can be annoying and painful to deal with...</li>
    <li> If you shave with a straight razor or safety razor (as opposed to a modern, multi-edged razor) you always run the risk of at least mild abraision, no matter how careful you are.  I rub this rock against my face after every shave to prevent redness and oozing.  Unlike typical styptic, it leaves no residue,  does not burn, and makes one&#x27;s face feel good.  I recommend it to all using traditional shaving methods.</li>
    <li> This works well and is a great size for travel. Get it slightly damp and it will help a shaving nick to set very quickly and well. Wait a few minutes and then clean around it to remove any slight residue (only occasionally an issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars is this: the product is essentially exactly the same as some less expensive options. In particular, I use [[ASIN:B000L978FU Crystal - Crystal Stick Body Deodorant, 4.25 oz sticks]] which is much larger in size and seems to be identical. It works just as well for shaving nicks. The smaller product here is great for travel bags (and BTW, it also works as a travel deodorant just like the Crystal ones). Either way, it&#x27;s a great natural alternative to more chemically type products. Cheers!</li>
    <li> Although this product is smaller than the bar sized product, the container and applicator handle makes using and storing this product very convenient.</li>
    <li> Stings like crazy, probably because I&#x27;m new to shaving with a double edged safety razor. Works to close up small cuts and pores after shaving. I use this, rinse then apply an aftershave balm and am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Significantly reduces the redness on my neck after shaving.</li>
    <li> I use this as an antimicrobial agent on parts of my body that I dont want to smell when I sweat. It does the job, and is a great keeper in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> works good.  I dropped it though and it shattered.</li>
    <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve switched to traditional wetshaving, I&#x27;ve most certainly had my fair share of nicks and cuts. Usually they clot up on their own, but they leave my neck looking like it got sandpapered. The day I got this, I got a decent cut on my chin from mishandling my razor. After I finished up my shave, I put this on, and the cut went clear, no bleeding. Sure it stings when you put it on, but that&#x27;s how you know it works. I know it works as a great aftershave, but I still like to put on my aftershave balm afterwards, to soothe the savage beast that is my face.&lt;br /&gt;Get one. Your face will thank you later.</li>
    <li> Works like advertised !</li>
    <li> The inexpensive RazoRock does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose; housed in an attactive and functional enclosure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used an alum block before, but now I can&#x27;t see doing without.  Having recently converted to wet shaving, I welcome the challenge of perfecting my razor angle and technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While sealing off nicks and cuts, the RazoRock also tells you were you&#x27;ve irritated your face, thus helping you perfect your shaving style.</li>
    <li> This was my first Alum purchase.  I think I might be hooked.  I like the tightness it provides to my face, it is by far more effective than using aftershave alone.  I didn&#x27;t experience much of a sting like the others, but I highly recommend Alum.</li>
    <li> Did arrive in time, exactly as expected , reasonable price,use it every time after trimming my beard or shaving my head , work great for stopping any cut or bleeding.</li>
    <li> Great product helps us beginners who are learning to shave again. Dose not leave chalky residue like stiptick pencils can.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product a few months ago when my wife got me a Merkur Vision 2000 razor and if you shave you need this product! The alum salt will find any knick and cut you knew about and will also help you discover ones you didn&#x27;t even see! If you shaved right it wont sting, if you shaved a little rough you will find out when you use this product! It is a must have for anyone who uses a straight razor or a safety razor as it will stop bleeding from little cuts very quickly! Can you find it cheaper, yes, however this form factor is really easy to use, to store and to travel with and it is work the extra money!</li>
    <li> Very convenient to use, and lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve used my previous one daily on my face, and it&#x27;s only now almost gone after two years.</li>
    <li> I am currently using the Tom&#x27;s of Maine version of this same product as an underarm deodorant; it is excellent but hard to find in our local stores or on-line. I bought this RazoRock as my \\&quot;next\\&quot; unit. The packaging of RazoRock is very similar but not identical to Tom&#x27;s. The product inside looks the same in every dimension and appearance, but I have not yet tested it (hence the middle-star rating and the warning in the subject line above). However the Tom&#x27;s version of this same product (solid alum) is mild to the skin, does not stain t-shirts like stick and gel deodorants do, and over this past winter has been quite adequate for both odor and moisture control for me. I am a person whose body adapts to deodorants that later fail for me; summer heat is a problem approaching soon and the proof of this kind of deodorant for me will come soon. Once I have warm-weather results to report, I certainly will update this. The added bonus of this style of deodorant is how long a package lasts. After several months of use, it is hard to tell that the crystal is any smaller than it started out! I&#x27;m guessing it will last a full year for me. Because I do not shave, I find there is no reason to moisten the top of the crystal as indicated in the instructions, I just apply it after the shower with the residual moisture in the hair.    Update: 1/2015 The Tom&#x27;s version has lasted a full year now, and will make it into next month. This did work for me as a deodorant through the hot summer months. I just added a spritz of my favorite cologne/after shave after applying to provide a bit of fragrance (and the alcohol in that seemed to be synergistic too on the hottest days). I&#x27;ll open the RazorRock block next month and repost another update after a couple of months of use. I&#x27;m still leaving the preliminary rating since I have yet needed to open the RazorRock version.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as advertised.  Using a good quality DE razor for the first time, I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or cuts so I haven&#x27;t been able to use this what it&#x27;s really for but I definitely noticed a smooth dry effect on the skin.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try a lower quality razor so I can test it properly!&lt;br /&gt; The smell is a little off-putting but I&#x27;ve never used one of these so I&#x27;m betting this smell is normal.  Since it&#x27;s on your face there&#x27;s really no escaping it.</li>
</ol>
