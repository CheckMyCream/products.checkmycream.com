<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this - She loves it!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion has been the best bar far I have ever used.  My legs are always the hardest to tan and this tanning lotion helped my white legs to get some color finally.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so moisturing and makes the skin feel great! It goes on evenly. I love it! The only reason it&#x27;s not my favorite is because I like a coconut, beachy smell. This one smells like a light perfume. (Which it mentioned in the details, but I thought I might like it. I guess I like smelling like the beach :)</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use the JWoww 50X Bronzer tanning lotion, and we both love that it keeps our skin moisturized and helps us to develop a quicker tan. The lotion smells very good, but not flowery or perfumey, so my husband can use the lotion without worrying about smelling like a girl! We both highly recommend this tanning lotion...especially at the great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I had been using Smoke lotions, and get tan with a slight red color (natural for me).  I tried JWOWW 50X, and love it even more than Smoke.  I am usually hard to tan, and fade quickly, but with this lotion, I have gotten the best tan I have ever had.  As a matter of fact, I have had to back off on how often I tan because I am getting too dark.  Never thought I would say that... lol.</li>
    <li> I expected more from this lotion , I taught it would have a better scent.&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t. You have to rub it in pretty good , which I abs hate , my hands starting hurting from rubbing it in into my skin.</li>
    <li> I was in a huge debate for weeks as to which \\&quot;Jersey Shore\\&quot; tanning lotion I should buy: JWOWW&#x27;s, Snooki&#x27;s or Pauly D&#x27;s.  I went to my tanning salon for the first time in a few month&#x27;s and they had this one there.  I asked them about it, and they said it was the best, and very popular at that salon.  I bought it...and I LOVE IT! I was noticeably darker after one session, and the bronzers work really well.  I had a nice glow, and the lotion smells awesome.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut, like all the rest, it has its own scent and it&#x27;s great.  Left my skin feeling really soft and smooth, too.  I HIGHLY recommend this lotion, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used in a LONG time.</li>
    <li> I tried this out at my tanning salon and knew I had to buy the bottle. It smells great unlike most tanning lotions, even after you use it you smell delicious! I like that it has instant and delayed bronzers so you look tan right away and it builds up into an even deeper one over time. I use this one all the time, it&#x27;s the best! So much cheaper to buy on Amazon than in the store :)</li>
    <li> I had so many times started to order this lotion and finally after not being able to tan for a week and a half do to medical reasons I wanted a lotion that would help me get back the color I lost quick...  I had seen some other reviews that stated this lotion to be amazing so I thought I would give it a try.  Within two uses I&#x27;m as dark as I was before I had to stop tanning....  this lotion really is great... a light sent that keeps you from smelling funny after tanning.  I hight recommened this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great looking tan. I have used all types of products and besides the designer skin this is the next best thing!!</li>
    <li> This is absoultely a great tanning lotion, I just purchased it and tanned 3 times. I already have great results. I highly recommend it, the smell is great kind of similar to her other lotion.</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion and most definitely cannot beat the price!! will be back to buy more...and it shipped and came super fast!!</li>
    <li> good product, would absolutely purchase it again. i love the smell! i love the color it gives especially since I don&#x27;t tan very easily. And it doesn&#x27;t streak either!</li>
    <li> Great bronzer, the aroma is not that bad, plus after tanning there is still a nice fragrance, unlike some products after you have tanned.</li>
    <li> My daughter love this</li>
    <li> Being fair skinned I never thought I could get a deep dark tan. With JWOWW Ultimate 50X it made it possible.  I am so happy with the results. I would highly recommend it. The other great thing is you can use it outside, it&#x27;s not just for indoor tanning!  I&#x27;ll buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this lotion 4 times previously (different sellers) and it&#x27;s always been great. This lotion is watery. It&#x27;s so thin, when the cap is off, it comes out when the bottle is upside down. It smells the same, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. I contacted the seller with no response so far. Guess I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> I did not buy from this seller, but want to share my review.  This stuff does a very good job at extending your color...it gets darker after a few hours and stays really well.  It didn&#x27;t get five stars because I do not like the smell at all.  It doesn&#x27;t  &amp;#34;stink,&amp;#34; per se, but I just don&#x27;t like the odor.  It is also rather sticky and not very moisturizing.  But it is among the best I have used for extending your tan.</li>
    <li> Great stuff color great</li>
    <li> This product, sold at the solan for over twice what I paid.  The service is escellent, the product works as billed and provides a bronze tan better than any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Jwoww obviously knows what she&#x27;s doing!  :)</li>
    <li> Always works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I love this one.  Gets me the darkest and I love the smell.  Goes on easy and makes my skin feel great.  Tans me closest to my natural tan (more of a cinnamon/bronze brown rather than dark brown.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and makes my skin nice and dark!!  Great product would definitely suggest getting! One of the best tanning lotions I have used!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to purchase tanning lotions online because you never know what you are going to get, however this is the exact same! The girl at my tanning salon was a little snobby at first when she realized I didn&#x27;t purchase it form there, so she tried giving me a lecture on, &amp;#34;You never know what you are getting.&amp;#34; She then insisted a comparison with the salon bottle... after comparing the lotions she finally said, &amp;#34;You got lucky this time because they were in fact the same.&amp;#34; Now on my third bottle I will continue to purchase online, especially because the price is great. Amazing color and only after a few uses (I&#x27;m very fair naturally and have used many lotions), and what I love most is you never get that &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; look but instead just a great color tan. Jwoww tanning lotions are the best by far! Bottom line: buy this product if you want an amazing tan!!!</li>
    <li> Really love it. Tan a lot faster and helps my skin not to get so dry.I will order more. I use it outside.</li>
    <li> people should really state how PALE they actually are, im already pretty tan, and i see NO results with this product.  if youre already  tan go with a tingler.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the salon where I tan. I have tanned two times and I also am seeing results. Its a great lotion this is the reason I went online to see if i could find it Cheaper. Im so happy I did, but I was also willing to purchase more from my salon at there price just because its so great!</li>
    <li> Hey everyone,&lt;br /&gt;I used this for three months until the bottle was empty. I hit what the salon owners called my tanning \\&quot;Plato\\&quot;. Its where your lotion is no longer really doing you any good to get darker. You&#x27;re staying the same. It works for starting which is what I used it for. I now use something stronger. This is a good smelling non tingle lotion for starters! I liked it until now when I want to get darker! Hope this helps everyone! (:</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my tanning salon a week ago. Ive only used it about 4 times so far and have noticed incredible results. I was really skeptical when the women at the salon recommend it. Tanning usually makes my skin so dry but this has a lot of moisturizers in it to keep that from happening. I have never gotten this dark in only 4 sessions before. I would highly recommend this. Next time I will defiantly buy from amazon though! Great price! My salon charged $50 on sale.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion about 2 weeks ago and have only used it 3x so far. Once when I first got it and twice last week, and guess what? I am pretty dang dark! My front and backside are the darkest but my legs and arms are not too far behind! After using it one time I did&#x27;t really see that much of a difference because the bed I used the bulbs weren&#x27;t very strong but I had some color. Then after a week or so I went to a tanning salon and used their beds. WHOA! I got out of the bed and was shocked at the color I got, then a few hours later my boyfriend came home and was suprised at how dark I had gotten that day! If a man noticed the difference you know it&#x27;s some good stuff! Then I went back the next day and became even more tan. It&#x27;s not orange what so ever but a nice brown. Kissed by the \\&quot;sun\\&quot; type of look I like to call it. I haven&#x27;t been tanning since Friday and today is Monday and I&#x27;m still glowing strong! This afternoon I&#x27;ll go again and maybe add a few more shades to this tan! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this lotion is it feels a little greasy until your skin sucks it all in. And after I tanned I scratched my shoulder and the lotion made little balls where I had scratched it off. But I can live with those It doesn&#x27;t rub off on my white sheets or anyhting like that. But make sure you wait a few hours to shower so you get the full effect of the bronzers and achieve your dark tan!</li>
    <li> It really moistures and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and smells good too.  I haven&#x27;t used it that much but I do believe out of all the products I have used it rates at the top.  The best part is it is so much cheaper to purchase from amazon then at your salon and it arrived really quick.</li>
    <li> Order was received in excellent condition and on time.  This was a recommended quality product.  It was used very well and I recommend it to anyone who plans to tan.</li>
    <li> I went on a spree and bought several brands of bronzer for indoor tanning.  I have this one and the One and Done.  I alternate between those two and the Snookie brand.  They all seem to do what they say.  I can&#x27;t really tell that one is any better than the other. They have all helped to increase my color and all are very moisturizing.  They also have a pleasant smell.  I will continue to use them. They are of high quality and are more reasonably priced than the same bottle at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> i got a better tan with baby oil and iodine  i used this for 1 week every day by the pool  and never even had tan lines and i have olive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dejuan neilson&lt;br /&gt;280 wheeler rd&lt;br /&gt;gray, ga 31032</li>
    <li> Gives you such a deep dark lasting tan! Used it for prom tanning indoors and outdoors! I love this one of my favorite bronzing lotions, and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> first, the product isn&#x27;t for me. My wife hasn&#x27;t used it yet, so I am unable to attest to its quality. however, if the results are as outstanding as the delivery, I will change this to 5 Stars. the order was placed on the evening of the 16th and was in my mailbox this afternoon. I was not expecting it until next week sometime.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos Market Solutions. Keep up the prompt shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now, I am tanner than before but I&#x27;m not seeing drastic results like others have claimed. But then again everyone has different skin types, so results may very. Smells better than most tanning lotions, even after tanning it has a light scent. It&#x27;s a light brown color lotion, goes on smooth but I do have to rub it in a little more for my skin to absorb it. Great product. Purchased online&#x3D; great savings. At my salon it runs for $80.00.</li>
    <li> It made me darker, smells wonderful, but it makes you feel supper sticky. I still like it better than most..</li>
    <li> I have always bought Howe lotion but when I ordered it from Amazon it was horrible it was watered down and have me a horrible rash I do not approve of buying it off amazon</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after reading the reviews that this might be a fake product, but figured I could return it Amazon if it was.  The package I received was sealed and unopened, and I compared it directly to the real bottle I had purchased from that tanning salon and it was the exact same.</li>
    <li> The best tanning lotion. I Always come back to it year after year, have tried others in the same price range &amp; they don&#x27;t compare. It  Won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is awesome, I&#x27;ve gotten so much more color in the last two times I&#x27;ve gone then with my other lotion of which by the way been using for MONTHS... I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a good product not really sure of the smell. Used it once. May work for others. I heard it is a good tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great. Although i haven&#x27;t experienced all the crazy effects that other reviews have discussed i have gotton a nice tan from it. I am about half way through the bottle now. This item shipped very quickly. It is alot thicker than most lotions that i have used that have also been the brand JWOWW. That is the only difference that i noticed. It has a strong smell to it as well but it is not a bad smell. Overall i think this is a good product for the price. I would stay away from buying it in a salon it will be much more expensive this way, i would recommend buying it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this lotion. I have tried all JWOWW&#x27;s products and this one is definitely the best. It has an amazing scent that even smells good even after tanning, not like the usual burnt skin smell. It is creamy and super moisturizing, and does not streak. It also makes me really dark!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion was a real disappointment. It didn&#x27;t bronze like others I have used and left my skin with a grainy feel/appearance. I won&#x27;t use the rest of the bottle which is a waste of money. Wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it!</li>
    <li> Product did not do anything more than any other tanning product. Smell was nice, but nothing to improve the speed or shade of the tan.</li>
    <li> Love it !  Jwoww got here when it said it would, and it works great, but the only down fall is , it doesnt smell very good, but i use mosturizer afterwards amyways so that helps</li>
    <li> This lotion does not disappoint.  It is dependable and the results are predictable.  I will use it again and again.</li>
    <li> I never have written a review before but I just want to put this one out there because I&#x27;ve never had such an awful experience with a tanning lotion. This stuff is so thick and sticky it seems impossible to rub in without a thick coating sitting on top of your skin, no matter how little I put on or how long I spent rubbing it in it just felt awful. I rarely get pimples but this stuff made me break out all over. The thickness and stickiness causes such an uncomfortable feeling I will never ever be getting this stuff again nor do I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit product! Do not buy this product it is not original. Amazon need to fix this as they are now working as a dealer on this.&lt;br /&gt;It has also been confirmed but the tanning salon where i go and by the Australian gold sales rep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the poster child for Irish girls...super pale! I needed a tan or my version of tan for a tropical vacation I was going on. I bought this and two others to get quickest tan possible. This was the best one by far. I got a nice color within a week. It smells really really good. Only down side was it kind of turned my hands orange. But by wiping hands before getting in bed helped a lot.</li>
    <li> The lotion brand itself is fine.  I love it.  But this seller is a joke. My lotion was used not new like the description said when I ordered and never heard back from them when wanting my money back and ended just having to go by the lotion from my salon. Crappy seller, false advertisement and will never purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fairly white person, without tanning - so keep that in mind. I&#x27;ve been indoor tanning since September (2012) up till now. I had purchased this in hopes of being &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;, or super tan. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now I feel like it&#x27;s getting me whiter not tanning. I was much darker than I am now after using this product. I&#x27;m NEVER using this product again.</li>
    <li> It smells great! And works just as well! It&#x27;s well worth the price!!!! And suggest anyone who loves tanning to buy this !</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t stick or have that burnt smell after you get out of the tanning bed. A bit pricey but worth not having to go back to work and everyone notice a funky smell.</li>
    <li> I loved this lotion! I bought it because I had a good base tan, but I wasn&#x27;t as dark as I wanted to be. After one tan I was really dark! It looked really good, not orange at all. The only thing is, just make sure after you put the lotion on, wipe your hands off with a baby wipe, or in-between your fingers will look like a bad spray tan. I would definitely buy this lotion again, awesome buy.</li>
    <li> All JWOWW products work pretty well, one of the best tanning products.</li>
    <li> just what i ordered . love it</li>
    <li> Best price found for this great product is at Amazon. I used previously and was glad to find at fraction of retail. Good moisturizer and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t get that tan from it. After a bunch of uses I see a little extra color but that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> As an avid tanner I am always looking for the best lotion out there. The day I realized amazon.com had tanning lotion for discounted or cheaper prices I went crazy. The only downside of purchasing things like tanning lotion or perfume online is that you can&#x27;t smell it, and the smell of fried skin is never appealing. But this lotion of Jwoww&#x27;s smells amazing.., TO ME. Everyone has their own fragrances they like. This lotion in particular isn&#x27;t fruity, sweet, or fresh smelling but more of a musky, sultry, womanly smell. My favorite smell. This tanning lotion is my absolute favorite. I haven&#x27;t used anything but the tanning lotion since the first time I purchased this product, and I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times. This lotion gives you GREAT color, it is a bronzing lotion so that helps with the color and the speed of how fast you tan. My friends are always so envious at how fast I get color when I&#x27;m using this lotion. I do have an olive skin tone so that helps. It has it&#x27;s cons as well just like everything in the world. I would say that it is more of a greasy lotion, not like the velvety feeling you get from a silicon based lotion. However I don&#x27;t feel super greasy after I get out of the bed. Like I said, it is a bronzing lotion, so it&#x27;s a good idea to wash your hands before you leave the salon. Your hands won&#x27;t turn super orange if you forget to wash every so often. But when using bronzing lotion it&#x27;s always a good rule of thumb to wash your hands after tanning. I hope you find this review helpful!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I got really tan the first time using it I was convinced this is the only lotion I will ever buy.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product great price. A bottle lasts a long time. I get the deepest darkest tan ever with this product! Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> I am kinda new to tanning so I&#x27;m having to experiment with different lotions. I started out using JWOWW&#x27;s One and Done and once I got a base tan I started using this. It has gotten me quite a few shades darker than the other and goes on great. It has an awesome bronzing affect. One bottle only lasted me about 3 weeks but that was with me going every day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion! Gave me a real nice tan! It also smells amazing and you can&#x27;t beat that price :)</li>
    <li> I tried this bronzer tanning lotion last summer and love it! I am pretty fair skinned but tan only in summer. This stuff is great! I wo&#x27;nt use anything else!</li>
    <li> This stuff really tans you well. The smell is perfect for a woman or a man. Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasey.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It smells good, it&#x27;s thick and goes on very well and actually gets you dark! It does what it is suppose to do. Worth the money since you will see results. My favorite lotion hands down!</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion . It works really well and can tell a difference with lotion compared to others . I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave you with that tanning bed odor ugh ! It&#x27;s a pleasant smell of lotion that will leave you where you don&#x27;t have to go right home to shower if you can&#x27;t . So glad I purchased this from amazon for the best price I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was as described.  This product does help give a pretty bronze color to the skin.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it is not a pleasant smell like most of these type products are.</li>
    <li> In all my years of tanning, this is literally the worst lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought. It smells AWFUL and has done nothing for my tan. I will never buy another JWOW type lotion. Waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I have medium toned skin, and this product gives an OK color.. However, it makes me brake out, and after tanning it smells like stinky feet. Also, the bottle is extremely stiff, which makes it hard to squeeze out the lotion.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> So I just got the package, I am always skeptical when I buy lotions online, but the packaging on the bottle is a little messed up &amp; off. Plus when I opened it, it looked like its been use. Not impressed idk if its the real thing.</li>
    <li> after two tanning sessions with this lotion you can totally tell im darking. it gives you a summer glow and not orange at all.</li>
    <li> it smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t darken as quick. It does leave a great color, but I would like something more.</li>
    <li> I loved this lotion!  Smells great and goes on well.  Sometimes I wondered if it was the real thing but I still loved it anyway.  Good color for a bronzer.  not too much...</li>
    <li> The contents of the bottle is Not the real deal. The color, smell, and texture is all wrong. Do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;I would have selected no stars but amazon forces atleast one star.</li>
    <li> I give this product a 5 STAR rating because it is well worth it!!!  Bronzed is what I have become!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great tan, awesome smell, make skin happy</li>
    <li> I have purchased Jwoww products for two summers in a row. Am 46 years old and this does not make me look &amp;#34;stained&amp;#34; like self tanners or overly tanned (Jersey Shore Anyone??). I only use 1-2 times per week while in tanning bed for short amount of time. Looks natural and feels great!</li>
    <li> I live this stuff!!!!!! I gives you a very deep and dark color.  I will buy more and more!</li>
    <li> I think everyone needs to give this a try. I showed results in 2 days. Makes my skin look wonderful and I look great</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and I think it&#x27;s definitely a great tanning lotion. I gave 4 stars because my skin feels sticky after putting it on. Doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin quickly.</li>
    <li> I love being tan. But I do have somewhat fair skin and in order for me to keep a tan I have to tan almost every day. With this lotion I only have to tan about once a week because it has 50 bronzers in it that actually last. It goes on so smooth and it smells amazing! Most tanning lotions make you smell so bad when you get out of the tanning bed, but this one holds its luxurious scent even after you&#x27;re done tanning. I don&#x27;t think I will ever try another tanning lotion again. This one has me sold.</li>
    <li> When I leave the tanning salon the employees all say, Wow! You are dark.\\&quot;  This is the best color I&#x27;ve ever had and will continue with the JWOW. My skin feels great. Hubby calls me his coppertone girl.</li>
    <li> This is not the product it says it is.  I&#x27;d rather pay the full amount to get the correct product.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives good color. Has a pleasant smell and I would recommend it to anyone. Reasonably priced compared to salons. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This lotion is AMAZING! JWOWW got it perfect when making this lotion!! It reminds me of being on the beach, &amp; does not streak at all. The bronzers in it I can tell work immediately &amp; I only have to tan once a week to maintain my color. Delivered so quickly, safely packaged &amp; the price is unbeatable! Triple the price in salons! I highly recommend this seller &amp; lotion to anyone looking for a great deal AND a great tan!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I used a sample of this at the salon and paid $10.00 for it! I was glad to find it on Amazon for a great price. This brozer really makes my skin glow and it even smells great! Who knew JWOWW tanning lotion would be so amazing! Highly Recommend this for a sun kissed glow!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this lotion. With the JWOWW name and the reviews I thought it would work better for me. It smells nice and has a nice texture, but it didn&#x27;t help my tan at all. I have fair skin and this didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well for me as the Playboy Boost did.</li>
    <li> I was a little skepticle because the pricing was so good. The product, however, was great. Seems to be the real thing and I really enjoy the products aroma.</li>
    <li> The shipping was prompt and on time!! Could not have been quicker! The product is amazing!!! Hands down the best non-sizzle lotion I&#x27;ve used! I usually use hot lotions that&#x27;s what I thought this was, but I am happy to say it is better! I tan 5 days a week and this lotion keeps me smooth and spot free. I haven&#x27;t peeled once using it and I am darker than I have ever been and it only took me a few days to see the difference!! For those of you that are picky about the smell of your lotion, this one smells amazing even my boyfriend loves the smell and he usually complains with other lotions. The only complaint is a little one I just wish there had been a little bit more info about the product, other than that I completely satisfied. Happy tanning :) And thank you!!</li>
    <li> I tried a sample and liked the results as well as the scent. It&#x27;s a Very good product! I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion but its not my favorite. It does have a nice sent and doesnt leave an orange or streaky color behind but it doesnt bronze as quickly as it states and I&#x27;ve had other lotions that have helped me get a lot darker. I tan easily so it typically doesnt take a lot but this one just added a nice scent to the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of different tanning lotions in my life so its getting easier to tell which ones I like and don&#x27;t like. I am very fair skinned naturally, but have my own tanning bed at home. I use bronzing bulbs in my bed and with this product I have seen results! It&#x27;s no better than Snooki though. Snooki in my opinion smells better. This one doesn&#x27;t stink but just not as good as Snooki. I believe when I finish this bottle I will go back to using Snooki! I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t recommend this product because it does work good, but Snooki is just a better choice for all around in my opinion!</li>
    <li> This was bought for my daughter as a gift, all I can say is I have not heard any complaints.</li>
    <li> I really Was impressed by this product works great for me. I have told Many people&lt;br /&gt;about it and I have almost used all of it up. Great product</li>
    <li> I have used the Jwoww One and Done and loved it.  I decided to try this, I was SOOO much draker after one session.  The fragrance is great as well as the moisturizing properties.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great. and it doesnt smell like Vanillla-which is awesome!  I would totally recomend this and Jwoww products are awesome</li>
    <li> Goes on well, doesn&#x27;t leave you orange, and gradually gives you a healthy normal darkkk looking tan. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. I love it!</li>
    <li> The smell is awful, especially after coming out of the bed, I smelt like French fries.. No joke. Also I didn&#x27;t even notice a color change. The Walmart brand one I used last year worked 5x better. Don&#x27;t get this, it&#x27;s awful</li>
    <li> If I could rate this as NO stars then I would. This lotion came to me EXPIRED and it smells bad.. It honestly smells like old lotion and chemicals. The seal on the lotion cap was flimsy and led me to believe it had been opened before... Do not waste your time on buying from the seller ALLSTAR.. The lotion is usually an amazing lotion and WILL get you dark quick but not when it is expired.. Sellers give products bad names when they do this. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very good for a bronzer. I use in once a week during my tanning session and my tan lasts until the next visit. Great lotion for the price!</li>
    <li> i love this tanning lotion it got me tanned very fast ,it was shipped and recieve on time and fast .i would recomend it to anyone that loves bronzers .i will buy again</li>
    <li> Makes me look orange! Won&#x27;t order this tanning lotion again! However I will buy the tanning lotion that I use now though them!</li>
    <li> I ordered this about two weeks ago now, Ive used it several times and nothing. I have no difference, I think it may be a tad watered down though, the packaging is funny. I wont be ordering offline again, Im sad too, I was looking forward to a nice tan and plus I love jenny so thought her stuff would work .. but nope :/ Glad I didn&#x27;t spend 80-90 $$ online for it!</li>
    <li> This lotion rocks, love the bronzers, and it smells so yummy! I will definitely be buying some more in the near future!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! Haven&#x27;t used anything else in like 5 years lol!</li>
    <li> Used this for about two weeks. I didn&#x27;t see any immediate results, but after tanning, if I didn&#x27;t shower for the night I woke up and it showed a little. Which is good, Bc it didn&#x27;t turn me orange. But not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 tans and I LOVE it! I have gotten very dark and I have stopped burning completely. I recommend this to anyone starting to tan. The smell is great too.</li>
    <li> I actually was going to replace my tanning bed bulbs thinking I wasnt getting a good tan due to them. But first I was going to find a good lotion and try it, DUHHH that was my problem the whole time, my bulbs are fine! IT was the fact that i wasnt using a good lotion, I used this 3x already, Friday, Sunday &amp; Tuesday and JWOOOOWWWWW I am so golden dark! Not orange at all! Highly Recommend this, it makes my skin so soft also and smells good.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get a tan&lt;br /&gt;Have to tan several times&lt;br /&gt;Not as dark as I thought it was</li>
    <li> This remains my favorite tanning lotion of all time.  You get so dark SO fast!</li>
    <li> I tan very very easily even without going to the tanning beds! I go to get an even tan, I used this thinking it would work just as good as all the others I&#x27;ve tried and has not done a thing for me. It&#x27;s almost like its not the real deal or watered down!!!! I have gone about 10x now to try and keep using it and saw no changes. I read the reviews which is why I got it. I felt complete opposite and wish I would have tried something that worked!</li>
    <li> i always turn to amazon for top name lotions because the cheaper ones usually dont work well for me, so i read reviews on this lotion from here and other sites.I already love jwowws products so i found it here for $30 when it retails at my local salon for 70.. this is absoultly by far the best lotion i have ever used.. gave me instant color the 1st time( i mean the first time tanning all summer).. i highly recommend this lotion. i bought from one stop beauty source and ive never had any problems with them so if you can buy from them they&#x27;re your best way to go... 100% real!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!  You see results instantly!  It has a nice smell, goes on smooth and spreads evenly.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fantastic tanning lotion. Gave me a great tan when we were in Barbados. The lotion is thicker than the usual lotions and has a nice smell.Good value for money, and will buy again when this bottle runs out...which is soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and it didn&#x27;t seem to do much. But I did get a lot for my money</li>
    <li> So i have tried many types of tanning lotion, and thought this one would be great, after reading the reviews about it. But what I didn&#x27;t realize, was this product has sunless tanners in it, and after using it 4 days in a row, left my hands  and between my fingers orange! I was not expecting this at all. I have tried many brozers in the past, and none of them did this. You do get decently tan after using it, but it&#x27;s mostly due to the sunless tanners. Also, it does leave your skin feeling soft and smooth and moisturizes really well, but also leaves that Jergens sunless tanning smell that lingers long after tanning. I wont&#x27; be buying this product again.If I wanted a sunless tan, I would have just gone to walmart!</li>
    <li> I really like Jwoww. It is really good lotion. It can be a little pricey in salons but if you get it from Amazon it is more reasonably priced and works really well</li>
    <li> Fast shipment! Great product! It was only. Few days after I purchased the item that I received it, they also sent a sample packet, the tanning lotion it&#x27;s self works great! I&#x27;m extremely pale and can&#x27;t find anything the works on my skin, this does!!</li>
    <li> I am rally white with BARELY any capabilities of tanning. This stuff is FANTASTIC. I&#x27;ve used it about 3x&#x27;s now and have a base tan. I can&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;t wait to use it after a few more sessions and see where I am!!! I recommend it to everyone! An it SMELLS sooo good. I don&#x27;t want to wash it off. xoxo</li>
    <li> I love this!!!!! I&#x27;m an experienced tanner and needed something that would further my tan and this did it in one use. Shipped really quickly. I like the smell. All around great product. Glad I got it :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this lotion. Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other lotions have. It is really thick and a little goes a long way. Plus it smells good!!! I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this per my wife&#x27;s request. It arrived 4 days ahead of estimated time. She is happy with it which makes my life alot easier. She even received a sample pack of a different kind just to try out. She tells me that this works better than any she has tried. I myself having the complexion of a marshmallow wouldn&#x27;t know. I am sure she will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this lotion. I achieved a satisfying dark tan using this. Definitely my favorite lotion yet :) I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> great stuff very moisturising</li>
    <li> Too thick, and smells like sunless tanning lotion! Sorry i did not find it that great of a buy&#x27; would not buy again</li>
    <li> Got really good color. After about a month I am not to fond of the smell anymore. It smells fruity but then it doesnt and leaves lotion feelingnif u dont shower right after tanning</li>
    <li> The lotion has a strong self tanner smell. It stays with you for a full day. It does provide good color but the smell will make me think twice about buying again.</li>
    <li> Awesome results! Just make sure you dispense it thoroughly or else it may provide blotchy/dark marks on your skin. Otherwise, love!</li>
    <li> My order was shipped SO fast!! So far Iam happy with this lotion! I priced this in my tanning salon and its alot more!</li>
    <li> This lotion was the worst lotion I have ever bought. I always buy Designer Skin lotions and this was the first time I strayed.  I got it for a good price and wanted to see how it compared to others. It smells horrible, went on greasy, and made me smell burnt afterwards. The worst part is, within three days the bronzers were rubbing off in the shower like they do when you get a spray tan.  This lotion will keep you dark if you use it 5 times a week, but who wants to do that? Because the bronzers were rubbing off, I could not keep my tan. This lotion is just garbage.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, not as good as the JWOWW One and done, but still very good.  Smells nice and is not sticky.</li>
    <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I was extremely disappointed. I already had my base tan and wanted to deepen my color for that dark brown look, and all if the reviews I read in this said this lotion was the perfect one for that. It was not. I didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff-  This really worked for me..</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it is def nice. It smells nice and it gets you tan fast! I am bronzed now and I am fair skinned</li>
    <li> I love this lotion I recommend it to everybody I love the smell of it to!!! and the way it feels just putting it on</li>
    <li> product works goo, and unlike other tanning lotions it mails good before and after use. over all satisfy with this product.</li>
    <li> Love JWoww tanning products! Each new line that they come out with has even better lotions. This was my favorite in 2012 and now in 2013 I am using JWoww One and Done! I love her lotions and I would definitely recommend this one as well as many others to anyone!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is 4 times as much at the tanning bed!  It was shipped within 2 days without paying more, was sealed, and exactly as promised!!  I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Very glad I only bought a packet at the salon to try when I left my tanning bag at home. This is very thick and sticky, doesn&#x27;t smell that great to begin with then really stinks after tanning!! I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable color change using it in the Sunboard for the max time of 15 minutes.  Will never buy a bottle of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning every other day for about 9 months and have developed a pretty sold tan, however, I felt like my skin had plateaued...but I was wrong - just needed the right lotion!  I love JWOWW&#x27;s Ultimate 50x Black Bronzer Lotion. Not only does it smell great, but it enhances your color beyond what you ever thought possible. Try it out, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received the product that I ordered and I love it.  I got it like promised, two days.  I have told all my friends about the product and where I purchased it from as well.  Thanks again and I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love jwoww and I must say I am extra dark this time tanning useing her lotion . The smell could be better but I&#x27;m very picky with smells. Overall I loved it . I feel like it really helped make me darker. Could work on a prettier scent.</li>
    <li> I.am fair skinned and blonde hair. within three times of using this, I am darker than ive ever been in June</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Its the best smelling one I have ever purchased so far. Just used one time and already can tell a difference in my color,  and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. Its great. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> good product easy to apply</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had hoped. Doesn&#x27;t make you orange, but takes a long time to see results. Even when using a stronger tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I didnt think it were possible for me to tan. I have light skin and freckles and with this product i have reached my tanning goal. I love it and swear by it. The tanning salon I go to wanted $70 for this lotion but I found it on amazon for way cheaper. It also smells really great, i usually go on my lunch breaks and instead of coming back to work smelling like a coconut like typical lotions I come back to work smelling like perfume. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Now everybody&#x27;s skin is different. I&#x27;m pretty pale, but tan extremely easy. I used this 4 times and got a pretty good base tan, but after that i wasn&#x27;t getting any darker. I used the original JWOWW last year and got REALLY dark along with using Epihpany by designer skin. I was so exited because of all the great reviews for this product, but i think this lotion is only good for beginner tanners. I got another packet (Made to Be Dark) to see if it was me or the lotion, and it was defiantly the lotion. Maybe i already hit my maximum with this lotion, but i was a bit dissapointed with little color i got with this lotion. It does smell amazing though even after you get out of the tanning bed! I wouldnt recommend this product if you are already tan.</li>
    <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work as well as before</li>
    <li> fragrance is wowwwwww so cool testure is good my body got tanned very heavy so very good product i think</li>
    <li> I have only tanned 4 times using this product and I have had amazing results! I will never use any other tanning product!</li>
    <li> Seems to be getting my skin a nice natural tan color and smells like candy and not burnt after getting out of the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Great product for the $. This works well. Very pleased with this, it is well worth the money. Would definitely recommend. :)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for several reasons---&lt;br /&gt;1. Works well, and turns you a dark bronze! Especially for new or experienced tanners looking for fast color!&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t tingle or burn on your skin! Has a nice scent to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loveee this product!</li>
    <li> This product is a rip off I received it in February of 2013 and it had an expiration date of August 2012. Not to mention it has been tampered with! The product clearly states that it is new but it obviously has been used. Not recommended this is a scam.</li>
    <li> The bottle is beautiful! And it smelt very nice!:) I tanned pretty quickly, not super fast, but fast enough! It seemed to have last awhile to. Will repurchase!:)</li>
    <li> I am a very pale, light skinned girl that can&#x27;t tan very easily. It takes a reallly good lotion to get me tan. Jwowws 50x black bronzer got me pretty tan after a few uses. i noticed a difference after one use. but after about a week, i was extremely darker than i was. the smell is wonderful and leaves your skin really soft after tan. it doesn&#x27;t leave a very strong after tan smell. i definitely love this product and i will repurchase after i am out.</li>
    <li> Like all of Jwoww&#x27;s tanning lotions this one works so fast! i absolutely love it &amp; will continue to buy her lotions &amp; all other products!</li>
    <li> I love this. I could really tell a difference in one use. I definitely recommend this. It is worth the money for sure. :)</li>
    <li> Smells really good! I noticed results fast. Really great for that perfect golden glow color. Only complaint is that my skin felt super sticky when this product was on! Maybe it needed a chance to soak in longer but I washed it off soon as I got home.</li>
    <li> great lotion, first use got a great color. Only have to go every other day to keep tan. love it</li>
    <li> Smells good,works great and does the job! Only used it for a week and got sweet color. So far no Orange tan. Saved lots of money too. The Salone would charge way more.</li>
    <li> When I received JWOWW I was definately excited . I had used the old one before and knew this one had more bronzing capability . I usually use designer skin brand , which has very good lotion so I&#x27;m very picky (luminary being my favorite by them). Anyways, I was very happy with the sleek feel of the lotion both before and after tanning . I don&#x27;t feel residue like some other lotions, I feel mosturized. Also, the smell is very nice after tanning. I wouldn&#x27;t say its overdone though, so if you like the intense perfume smelling lotions I wouldn&#x27;t get this lotion. The only thing that disappointed me was that I thought it would have a bit more intensity compared to the other JWOWW, it definately has more bronzers but I am not tanning as fast as I would have thought. For how much I paid online, you can&#x27;t go wrong with buying JWOWW, its a steal !!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try the newest one !</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on various reviews after my girlfriend and i scouted various options..i personally have never applied it, as this was a gift. My review is based on my notice to her distinctions example: appearance, touch, and smell..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion did tan quicker than expected..&lt;br /&gt;Bronzer wasnt effective, infact more brown-orange in certain lighting and flash photography.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was a little too overwhelming..and that scent sticks to everything.&lt;br /&gt;Her skin has become very soft to touch after using this product, so it must do a good job at moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the JWOWW Ultimate 50X Black Bronzer Tanning lotion. This is by far my favorite. I use it on my face too and my face is actually keeping up with the color of my other body parts.  This goes on smooth, has a great smell and a great after smell as well. It gives me a nice bronze flow without looking orange or streaky.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a great bronzer, and it definitely gives me a dark, rich, brown tan. The downside is its not very moisturizing, and it smells a little funny. But overall I like it a lot, and it was SO cheap buying it through amazon. its like an $80 lotion, and I paid like $20 for it. You cant get much better than that!! Also, I have read a bunch of reviews on here about people getting fake products when they order tanning lotions from amazon, but this was definitely the real deal, i have bought the same lotion at my tanning salon, and this was identical to it. So overall I would definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is amazing! It smells good and really bronzes your skin.  I have never been more tan than I am now.</li>
    <li> Very dark lotion, works well for a tanner that only tans 2 times a week, or in between non-bronzing lotion usage. The more applied the darker it gets, however, it will stain tight clothing like bras.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this but didn&#x27;t want to pay the local price of over $65.00.  It worked ok.  Expected nicer scent, it was annoying to smell by the end.  overall, it moisturize, bronzed poor to fair.  Glad I got it on here, but I didn&#x27;t like it enough to purchase again.  My expectations were a bit higher.</li>
    <li> I usually love me some JWOWW Tanning Lotion. I&#x27;ve been using her tanning products for a couple years with great results and an added bonus they smell great. Not so much this one, sadly. Great results though so I really cant complain</li>
    <li> Smells good, but lotion is thin almost watery. Seems to work fine though.</li>
    <li> Love it and great price. Will order again! It really made my tan darker so I think you should buy it</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this but didn&#x27;t notice much darkness. I tan really quick and am already dark but I&#x27;ve used OC tan products that work 10X faster and better.</li>
    <li> I just received the new 2012 australian gold jwoww lotion.  I have only used it twice, and i am noticeably darker.. already! The price is defenately worth it!!! i recommend this tanning lotion to everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was a little skeptic of buying it online but it i probably one of the best purchases I have made!</li>
    <li> TOTALLY ripped off not the original product as stated ! DO NOT BUY,  a fake wrapper over the bottle, not the same wrapper as the real deal, who knows what is inside!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My tan is even darker with this and smells great. It also leaves my skin soft and healthy looking</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! I have used it one time and I can already see that I have a tan started.. It was delivered before the expected delivery date. I would HIGHLY recommend this to my friends and family. I did purchase another bottle as a gift for my sister who tried some of mine and said she really liked it......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of tanning lotion, but this lotion has to be the best i&#x27;ve ever used.  I am at least 7 shades darker from using it 4 times.  It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good lotion that actually makes me tan because i&#x27;m so fair.  I am now very dark! very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love all the JWOWW tanning products! I think I like the scent of the Black better than this one, but they both work well a the price is so much better than at the salon :)</li>
    <li> Love the way it tans and the scent it has. Will order this again when I run out of it,.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly. It gives a nice even, bronze color. I got a free packet of facial tanner which was awesome too!</li>
    <li> I would absolutely recommend this lotion to anyone who is looking for a new bottle. This is the second product I&#x27;ve purchased from All Star Tanning and I&#x27;m very impressed. It&#x27;s priced so much lower than any salon in the area, and arrives very quickly. The only (minor) complaint I have is that the first bottle I bought came wrapped in plastic wrap for extra protection in case the cap were to come off. This one didn&#x27;t, however the lotion was in perfect condition when I received it. The best part about this purchase is that it makes my skin SO SO dark. I&#x27;ve never had a tanning lotion make me darker than this does. I&#x27;m extremely impressed and will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> It says on the bottle that it has a bronzer in it, but I see no evidence of a bronzer at all. Usually when I buy a bronzer my skin looks more brown pretty quickly, that has not happened at all, since using this product. I was very excited about the price in comparison with the prices at my tanning salon, but I am very, very disappointed with my results, I would not buy this product, again.</li>
    <li> I love the JWOWW product it works great and I get good results and will order again love it great.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion so far! I would highly recommend it &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Other lotion burn after but this one gives you a tan look!!</li>
    <li> I thought it would have more bronzer in it, but it only has a subtle bronze. I actually like that because it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. The smell isn&#x27;t too overwhelming which is good, but as with any tanning lotion, you do smell like tanning afterwards. I would never buy it for the salon price, but for what I paid on Amazon it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Worked good. I seen noticeable results in the first use. But I wasn&#x27;t amazed by it as a lot of people were.</li>
    <li> Be very carful to not buy this product expired!! It may or may not work but I wouldn&#x27;t know because the stuff I got is old!</li>
    <li> this lotion smells very yummy. and it made me darker then any other lotion i have ever used! unbelieable !</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of days ago.  It smelled good in the bottle, but once I put it on, it made me sick.  I thought it would go away once in the tanning bed.  Instead it got worse.  I left the salon and went home and had to shower.  Will not buy this product EVER again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it smells good afterwards&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not strong and overpowering smell&lt;br /&gt;Love the bronzer. You can tell you&#x27;re getting darker after only a couple of tans</li>
    <li> I love this product! I used it for 3 days and I am still seeing the results weeks later! I would highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I had been using cheap tanning lotion, what a huge difference using JWOWW has made!!!  I am so much darker and look and feel great about it!!!  Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Shipped on time at a good price. Have had better bronzer and the smell a little strong but still a good product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the product. I have been using everyday for a month with very little color. However, it smells much better than other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see the color I&#x27;m used to getting from the Jwoww line. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, either. I liked the other lotions in this line, so this was a let down.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself however daughter loved it so much I no longer have. :)</li>
    <li> I usually by my lotions on amazon because they&#x27;re so much cheaper and I normally get great lotions but this one didnt seem right. I instantly noticed the smell of it wasn&#x27;t pleasant. It smelled old or mixed with another lotion. I overlooked the smell and still tanned with it. The lotion absorbed very quickly into my skin and left my feeling sticky later on. I had 2 ppl that worked at the salon smell the lotion &amp; they both said it smells fake or old. I wish I remembered the name of the ppl I ordered this from. A tanning salon in Tampa, FL. Waste of $.</li>
    <li> I got my base tan with two weeks. The lotion is great and works... the only problem I had was I lost it. Time for a new one</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great. I used it after having a base tan and I noticed a big difference in darkness.</li>
    <li> ive used this a few times and it has tanned me pretty well. smells great and dont feel oily. I also bought the jwow shimmering body lotion for after tanning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and I can&#x27;t really tell anything.. People at my work say I look orange and I smell like burnt French fries when I get out of the bed :/ it smells good putting on but not after tanning... I will not be buying this product anymore... I&#x27;ve very light skinned and it takes me forever to tan I mainly stay red for a month... Hope this helped!!</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning lotion at the gym yesterday because the stuff I had wasn&#x27;t getting me dark very fast. I don&#x27;t like to spend $50 on tanning lotion, but I am going on vacation and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I hadn&#x27;t tanned in about 3 weeks due to time, but figured it was time. I should say that I usually do tan really easy, but I was shocked when I noticed I was really tan after only 12 minutes. I figured it was mainly the tanning lotion because it is pretty thick, but  (I really didn&#x27;t notice it had an odor, definitely not a negative odor to me) after I showered I was still really tan. I&#x27;m pretty excited. This morning I look like I have tanned several times.&lt;br /&gt;I see reviews about lotion not being in the correct bottles, maybe that is what was wrong with the other stuff I had, but if you get the legit JWOWW you should be pretty happy.</li>
    <li> Product does not perform how it is advertised. They are actually discontinuing it at my salon. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> This lotion smells awesome, When your done tanning it stays with you like your wearing a perfume. Gets you dark fast too.</li>
