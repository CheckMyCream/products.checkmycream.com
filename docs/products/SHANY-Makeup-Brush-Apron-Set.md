<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife loves it and uses it for all of her makeup jobs.</li>
    <li> This belt is great when working on a set for weddings, videos, photo shoots and etc. Great buy for make-up artist!!</li>
    <li> The truth for a bit of confusion and not paying attention to the description I thought that included brushes. is a nice case and high quality but expensive</li>
    <li> Every Freelancer will benefit from this apron it&#x27;s a quality product at an affordable price!! I&#x27;m getting 2 because it&#x27;s always good to have a backup!![[ASIN:B0061YRVUQ Shany Cosmetics Professional Vinyl Makeup Apron with Makeup Artist Brush Belt, Light Weight, 8 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I bought this brush belt because i needed it for an event im going to be doing makeup at, but once i got it i was soo happy that i bought it. All my brushes fit in here and it still has space for more brushes, I have 60+ brushes. I defiantly recommend this brush belt to any Makeup Artist or to anybody that just wants one. Another thing i loved was the price. I saw a lot of smaller brush belts and were more expensive. This is a good quality brush belt at a great price. As a Makeup Artist I recommend this brush belt %100</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I thought I would be using it all the time. Since I got it I have used it only twice. There is not enough spots to hold brushes and the spots are too wide and either too shallow or too long. Not a good product at all</li>
    <li> It was great! but the strap started to rip after I used it on my first job. I probably overloaded it, but I was hoping it could stand more weight.</li>
    <li> This is the almost perfect brush pouch. I would absolutely love it if it had some sort of snap to keep it closed when it is folded in half for transport and if the strap was adjustable enough to be worn over-the-shoulder or as a belt option. But that is asking a lot. This is great for the price and holds a good amount of tools and such.</li>
    <li> Cheap and hairs fell apart fast</li>
    <li> Any pro artist should have a belt/apron for their brushes! It&#x27;s a total must have so your brushes are close at hand.  No more searching counter space for them.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I hate to be the negative review but I want to save other very thin women some disappointment.  Yes...this apron looks great and will hold all your brushed.  It is way too big on me (5ft5, 115lbs, sz 0/2) Even on the smallest tightest setting it slipped over my hips and fell to the floor. Totally unusable and I had to return it.  Given my hips are 33 inches that is saying something since this should go around your waist.  Bummer</li>
    <li> Ok, for vinyl I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but this apron belt blew my socks off! There is SO MUCH space for every type, shape and size brush you can think of and they are so easily distinguishable! GET THIS!!</li>
    <li> This brush belt could be useful but I have found a few major issues so far.. Small brushes will get lost in this belt.. If you have little short precision brushes they will get lost.. The holder is deep.  My second flaw in this belt is that it&#x27;s to small around.. Not every MUA is a size 12 or under... With this adjustable strap it barely fits my normal american size 14 waist lol... so if your a bigger girl trying to find an adjustable belt.. This is not for you!</li>
    <li> This thing fell apart the first time I used it don&#x27;t wast your money on this piece of crap thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I just needed a cheap tool belt to hold my brushes at work. I was pleasantly surprised by this one! The shipping was fast, the belt fits nicely, and it holds the brushes perfectly! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the quality is a little bit cheap, but for the price, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Sister-in-law loves it for her class.</li>
    <li> this is a very light weight apron for all my makeup brushes. great for when i&#x27;m doing makeup and can&#x27;t go back to my counter to get my brushes. would really recommend to any makeup artist.</li>
    <li> As a professional makeup artist, I have a lot of brushes that I was having trouble keeping track of. This product made it easier for me to organize my equipment because FOR ONCE all my brushes are all in the same place because they all fit in the belt. I like that the pockets have two kinds of depths here, (one for normal length brushes and one for longer brushes) so all of my brushes can fit here. If you&#x27;re going to run into any problems with the belt it&#x27;s going to be that the strap starts to rip as mine has started to do but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain. Still recommend this!</li>
    <li> item is awesome. Looks very professional and good quality. Very roomy and space for lots of brushes and misc items.</li>
    <li> because it reminds me alot of the mac apron it has so many pockets for brushes now I don&#x27;t have to search thru my case any mre for loose brushes.</li>
    <li> This is very handy. I didn&#x27;t realize that the brushes did not come with the makeup apron. Now I need to buy the brushes</li>
    <li> no recomiendo este articulo lo compre y por el precio supuse que incluia los accesorios o pinceles y nada solo el estuche mucho dinero para un pedazo de estuche,</li>
    <li> It holds all my make up brushes.  It needs a few more smaller pockets to hold some of my smaller brushes.</li>
    <li> The product is very nice for vinyl. I got this because I could not find any holder for my brushes without buying more brushes that came with it. I&#x27;m not planning on using it as an apron but just to hold all my brushes. I&#x27;m satisfied with it.[[ASIN:B0061YRVUQ Shany Cosmetics Professional Vinyl Makeup Apron with Makeup Artist Brush Belt, Light Weight, 8 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> i bought this belt/apron because i got tired of having to twist and turn to grab brushes i really like the way way it folds into a book so i dont have to have so many different brush cases to carry around. i like the fact that i can hold all of my brushes in it so thats a plus</li>
    <li> This is a must have brush set every kit should have. It includes your brush belt and some of your tiny detailed brushes that are sometimes hard to find in other brush kits. I recommend this set to anyone, especially freelance and beginners!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say this is one thing anyone with tons of brushes should have in there house and maybe even more then one because lets face it with so many brushes you always need extras to store them and carry them in. This apron with belt is great because it can be worn to match any outfit that you will wear since its a basic black. This fits a  lot of brushes, I have to say its worth a go.</li>
    <li> Just another one of those amazing things to make doing freelance makeup just that much easier. Holds many brushes, keeping your hands and station free of clutter.</li>
    <li> I received my make up belt earlier than I thought - lovely surprise! It is of good quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I LOVE this apron. It can fit more than one brush in the sleeve which is nice because I have so many brushes. It&#x27;s great quality and has various sizes of sleeves to fit skinny and thick brushes. q</li>
    <li> I do a lot of makeup for my little sister and her friends for homecoming dances, proms, etc. This belt is perfect! I get to look like a professional without breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> I have never seen a make up apron this is very intresting. The belt just snaps around your waist and can be transported that way and very lightweight as there are only brushes in it. Priced reasonably. I guess you could use this to take to work for a get together afterwards or maybe school.Great find and idea.</li>
    <li> looks professional and quality made. i would recommend this for any artist. fits all of my brushes. even the thicker ones i wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
    <li> it service its purpose</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than what I expected, I thought it was going to be small.This is my 1st apron and I like it a lot. Would recommend it for anyone that does make-up.</li>
    <li> When I see or rather saw this I thought the brushes came with it.  Of course that is what I get for not reading the reviews before buying.  This product is probaly very good for ppl who have a brush set and ready for use.  For a person like myself, I have no brushes and never used any before.  So, this is a good holding apron, yet I still say, if you are going to put a picture online of the item, take one with the brushes then one without so the costumer will know what they are getting.  ^_^</li>
    <li> i look forward to useing it with my new makeup trunk and was as it was said to be. a grate price.</li>
    <li> This is so awesome!&lt;br /&gt;The professional vinyl make up apron really does help when you are doing your make up!</li>
    <li> I do makeup at pageants every year and never had thought to buy an apron before this year. One of the mothers run a salon and told me I should get one. I am going to get this one and try it out because I&#x27;ve been nothing but satisfied with the Shany products I&#x27;ve bought. The only concern I would have is the durability because I have a feeling if I ever left it out my cat would destroy it. Other than that I find it perfect, it has plenty of pockets and it&#x27;s not too large or too small. I&#x27;m buying it this weekend, I can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> A must for a \\&quot;makeup/makeover party\\&quot;! This is great for the Amatuer or Pro Makeup Artist! Helps keep you organized and professional looking. Holds a variety of makeup brushes, and I love that it is made of vinyl so it just wipes clean!</li>
    <li> Love this belt. It fits my brushes and then some. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> thought this was nicer then it was, has great reviews, BUT sucks. its cheap feeling and looking and falls apart faster then youd expect. i bought a five dollar one from my area, and its 100000000 times better. dont waste your money</li>
    <li> For my aspiring make-up artist daughter.  She is very pleased with it.  Says it will come in handy when she uses it on location.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it&#x27;s nice to put a good amount of makeup brushes in but mine actually tore on me. I believe of how I was taking it everywhere with me and it just got so worn-out but it&#x27;s good for starters!</li>
    <li> This product is great! If you are like me and have many brush sets this is perfect and has so many slots for each brush it makes it okay to mix the sets up! The belt makes it easier to have hands off application! Not only this but even if Im practicing my skills in  makeup for fun at my house, it creates a more professional and serious atmosphere! Your future career comes to real life</li>
    <li> This belt can hold all my brushes whether its big or small and a few other makeup accessories. The strap is durable and comfortable around my waist.  There&#x27;s lots of space if you carry many things. I usually clean it with a wipe if there is product on the pouches which comes of easily. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Just started cosmetology school and I love this Item! It makes getting to my brushes SO much easier. And it&#x27;s so funny to watch all the other girls going through jars to get to theirs.</li>
    <li> this apron is a must for all artist. It fits well and looks professional. Holds brushes securely. Made of sturdy material.</li>
    <li> My daughter said this was a perfect accessory for her job.  she does freelance makeup and loves having her tools ready and available</li>
    <li> I love the design however if you are a plus size this will not fit</li>
    <li> This belt brush is great and comfortable.  I&#x27;m able to fit many brushes and the additional pockets are pretty deep.  Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> This item was a let-down as the photo shows the brushes, thus I was expecting them too. However, perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the description properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the brush holder, I thought it to be cheap and shinny material. Also my waist size is 32inches and it didn&#x27;t fit even when I reduced the waist band to the smallest size. So I sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waist size ought to be stated and the photo ought to have a banner across it stating \\&quot;comes without brushes\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to continue looking at their items as I&#x27;m sure I will get the right one - some day.</li>
    <li> The belt is fine but it does not include the brushes, I was under the impression that it did. So the belt alone, is not worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this for a friend that is a makeup artist and she LOVES it. It holds so many brushes while still keeping them easily accessible. I would also recommend this to people that sell beauty line products, such as Mary Kay! Great product for a wonderful price!</li>
    <li> This comes in so handy when I&#x27;m doing my friends make up. I have all the brushes at my finger tips when I need them. It&#x27;s come in handy so many times!  I&#x27;ve been looking at higher priced ones but this is just great! Works really well for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly and I was surprised how professional looking it was. Good quality, pockets for pretty much any brush you could ever wish for and I love that it folds over so you can carry it kind of as a bag and when its ready to start applying make up you can unfold and attach to your waist if you choose. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast but it looks so cheap and is for plus size women. I would never buy from them again</li>
    <li> Nice quality.....fast shipping...nice gift...To bad it didnt come with all the brushes! :) Nice size pockets..very comfortable. I will buy again</li>
    <li> You will not belive the ammount of brushes in this brush belt.You might expect it to weight a lot but it does not.The brushes are soft and pick up color well.</li>
    <li> I was slightlu dissappointed at first when i bought is product- I still love it to hold my brushes except I clearly didn&#x27;t pay attention to detail. I though this included the brushes but its only the pouch. Didn&#x27;t matter though since I bought a set of shany brushes to go I to this pouch (even though that came with a roller pouch). Ya I probably spent a little too much on the pouch and on top of that a set of brushes to go I. It. It it didn&#x27;t matter. I did like this pouch. Makes it easier now for being more mobile too when I go to my friends houses and they ask me to do their makeup. It&#x27;s eliminates the clutter and scramble for looking for brushes. Use a brush, put it in the apron so it doesn&#x27;t get misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars because my stupidity shouldn&#x27;t deter anyone from buying this. I should of read what I was getting otherwise I would be owning this. I decided not to because I knew I could still use it. If I didn&#x27;t think I could of used this then ya I&#x27;d either gift it to a friend or get rid of it/get my money back. The quality is fine and I just did t read lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
    <li> Plenty of space for all of my brushes and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the brush apron.  She uses it for storage and when we travel to keep all the brushes in place.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got it. It looks really nice and the apron holds many brushes. Good quality as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my daughter.  She was really impressed as a makeup artist on the rise.</li>
    <li> for $15? are u kidding me? I don&#x27;t like it. this bag is for very long brushes, that no one has. It doesn&#x27;t hold itself</li>
    <li> I bought this to use while i am doing my make up to make it easier to have all my brushes together but the pockets turned out to be too wide. However, I instead decided to use this to hold mascaras, lip sticks, liners and other make up tools that don&#x27;t have a storage space. In that regard this turned out to be the perfect unintentional investment!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this belt. There are SO many pockets and it is very functional. It can be adjusted to fit just about everyone. My only complaint is that the material is very stiff. I will it was softer and lighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say this is one thing anyone with tons of brushes should have in there house and maybe even more then one because lets face it with so many brushes you always need extras to store them and carry them in. This apron with belt is great because it can be worn to match any outfit that you will wear since its a basic black. This fits a lot of brushes, I have to say its worth a go.</li>
    <li> I only received the apron. No brushes!!!!</li>
