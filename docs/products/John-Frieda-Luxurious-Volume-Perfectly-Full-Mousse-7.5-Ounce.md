<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not especially Thought it would work better than it does.thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> my favorite hairspray</li>
    <li> I hated the way this made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the volume it gives to my hair</li>
    <li> John Frieda Luxurious Volume Building Mousse makes my hair feel and look greasy. It does nothing to volumnize and actually makes my hair flat and lifeless.  I would not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s almost fragrance-free. Good hold for my short hair.</li>
    <li> I use this mousse on my hair after each shampoo, and it works really well at adding volume to my baby fine hair. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, this product is not my favorite.</li>
    <li> The John Frieda Volumizing hair mousse is a terrible product. It leaves a filmy, sticky residue on the hair and actually breaks it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mainly because I needed a mousse to help give my fine hair some volume, plus the reviews were decent and the price was right.  I have to say that I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this mousse.  I guess you get what you pay for.  As someone with fine hair, I have to be careful not to use too much of this since it will easily weigh my hair down.  It gives a little volume but when I finish the can I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> If guys have have wax for their hair this is definitely the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; thing for the girls. Great for those who likes styling their hair on their own.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does.  Great Volumne and you don&#x27;t need to use very much.  I had some of my old mouse left and just threw it away.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> it works very well. After blowing the hair, I got the volume hair . I would recommend it. Worth trying</li>
    <li> I buy and use this regularly to add body to my hair. The price on Amazon is the best I have found and it can cost several dollars more at brick-and-mortar stores. More expensive products I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t work any better than this.</li>
    <li> My favorite Mousse so far. Love John Frieda products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mousee, not to die for kind....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to use mousse in my hair, just because it&#x27;s usually so sticky.  This mousse, however, is different and I love using it on my short hair!  It definitely provides volume and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> this product is supposed to give lots of extra body but I found that it weighed my hair down. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite either.</li>
    <li> It made my hair soft to the touch and I would definately buy this again in the future.  Gave more volume.</li>
    <li> This product really didn&#x27;t perform, it left my hair greasy and just didn&#x27;t seem to add any substantial volume.  Seems to me those are two pretty important issues so, while it&#x27;s not the worst product ever, it just didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to.  I&#x27;d say avoid this one if you can.</li>
    <li> it makes my heir a little dry.</li>
    <li> All of John Freida&#x27;s products are excellent.  With a wife as a hairdresser it was given extreme scrutiny and passed with high reviews</li>
    <li> This dried my hair out terribly.</li>
    <li> Good Product and easy to use mousse for your hair.  If your fine hair needs body, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and cannot find in stores anymore. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product. A wonderful product to add volume and shine to hair. Makes hair manageable.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat John Frieda products. The lack of build-up and residue from this mousse is note-worthy! A lot of &amp;#34;volume building&amp;#34; products tend to really deposit gunk into your hair, and they leave your scalp feeling icky. This mousse does build volume, but no leave-behind. It works much like the Crystal Clear hair spray. Excellent hold, not heavy.</li>
    <li> I usually never use any hair products except shampoo and conditioner, but decided to try some this summer. I loved this mousse because not only it gives some volume to my thin hair but also it makes it appear &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; for more days than usually. Usually I have to wash my hair every other day. The only issue I had is that the pump broke off so I have problem squeezing out the mousse.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
    <li> And you simply cannot beat the price, this is a go-to product and I say that as someone who has never bought a mousse before. It will really control even really thick hair and make it look good.</li>
    <li> great for my straight blonde hair</li>
    <li> Nothing great about this.It did nothing to make my hair appear fuller and I will continue to search for a product that does.</li>
    <li> I glad I decided to try this brand, because I have spent alot of money trying soooooo many brands of mousse and FINALLY found something that works!!! AMAN</li>
    <li> Once I reviewed this product with 5 stars.  I am changing it now due to the severe dryness and breakage this product caused.  It works TEMPORARILY--but be warned!  Regular usage results in brittle hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many others and they have not compared to the volume I get with this product.  I use it at the crown of my head (roots) and it&#x27;s not drying and it is the best I have tried out of the many I have tried and I have very long hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, beats any salon product I have used.  I have long hair that will get wavy/curly if I use this product.  Gives hair a nice lift too. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down.  I use quite a bit, as I like the curl.</li>
    <li> This is a very good mousse, above the average on the market.  I like it and it&#x27;s at a good price.</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite mousse so far. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff &amp; crunchy, but gives me volume. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using much product but this one is great.  It holds all day.</li>
    <li> I have other mousses that cost a lot more, but this one works so so well, and it is less expensive.  I would highly recommend it for beautiful volume and bouncy hair.</li>
    <li> This makes your hair look really full! When I put it in and separate my hair it is difficult to find a part!</li>
    <li> This mousse is the best I&#x27;ve used. The price point is amazing for such a great product. I have fine hair, but I have TONS of it.. So it gets weighed down even with a short haircut. I use this after every wash, even if I&#x27;m not going to fix it/style it because it keeps my hair from falling in my face and just gives more volume overall. I&#x27;ve used salon brand name products, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried!! And it still leaves my hair soft &amp; manageable. I can&#x27;t do without this mousse!</li>
    <li> This product kind of leaves my hair a sticky mess. I bought it because it was cheap. I am disappointed. It feels like it just attracts dirt into my hair</li>
    <li> I use this product as a styling tool after using Nick Chavez Amazon Hair Body Building Spray just like I would use mousse.  It leaves my shiny and very natural looking.</li>
    <li> I thought it would provide some body, but it really doesn&#x27;t do anything...</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this mousse gives my hair some extra body. I put it on after I dry my hair, which I guess isn&#x27;t the way it should be used, but my hair is so limp and I found that doing this helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse .. excellent for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Product leaves my hair stiff and brittle</li>
    <li> As all John Frieda products I&#x27;ve tried, this is a great quality product. I have short hair with a structured cut &amp; need a good quality mousse to make it &amp;#34;work.&amp;#34; This does the job, without weighing down my hair or making it stiff. A small puff gives me just the right amount of body, with absolutely NO stickiness or next day flaking.  I order mine through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save service; highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and on a whim decided to try this for my hair even though I don&#x27;t need extra volume and I love it! This is the second time I bought this mousse. I use it on damp and dry hair and my twistout comes out great each time. Twistout crash course: on damp or dry hair add mousse, let dry (I prefer overnight), unravel without breaking curls.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse - helps my fine hair have body.</li>
    <li> No great difference here compared to other volume building mousses, but it does add some body and life to my very long baby fine hair,  which I have a good deal of,  when applied after detangling, and before blow drying.  Application is simple, don&#x27;t need a lot.  Passable product, for the price</li>
    <li> Love this and so much cheaper on here.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I didn&#x27;t like the product for my hair as its very thick and sticky, even when I use just a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair product. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly gives nice volume. After a shower, I apply some to my root area to give my hair a boost. It really does help keep the \\&quot;flat\\&quot; at bay. However, too much product &#x3D; crunchy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mousse lasts a long time and is in a sleek, attractive bottle. Even though there is a lot of product in the bottle, I probably will repurchase when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a normal, everyday volume boost, this mousse does the job.</li>
    <li> Ok but not all it is reported to be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product for me and primarily all that I use in the way of mousse.  Like it much better than the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Expensive mousse that leaves the hair fluffy stringy and undefined. It is curly girl approved though, but there are others that work better.</li>
    <li> Left my hair so crunchy I couldn&#x27;t style it.</li>
    <li> Well it came but broken.</li>
    <li> Works nicely...this mousse prevents frizz, adds shine to your hair and as a bonus, it smells good too!  &amp;#34;Subscribe and save&amp;#34; and the price goes down!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores around me and I miss it! Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love it, better than all the rest</li>
    <li> Works great On my baby fine hair..Gives me more volumen than  any other i&#x27;ve try, and  i&#x27;ve traied lotsof they</li>
    <li> If you were to look at my reviews in the Health and Beauty catergorize, you&#x27;d notice that I use John Frieda products a lot. Some I get from the Vine program to test and evaluate but I suspect most of the products reviewed are purchased by me because I am so fond of the line.&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought this at CVS. I hadn&#x27;t seen it on the shelf before and I have no idea how long this has been marketed.&lt;br /&gt;I am not into &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; per se. Guess you&#x27;d call me a wash and wear type. As long as the hair is clean, has texture (my hair is very straight and fine and of average or better thickness), has volume, and doesn&#x27;t lie flat, I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this, I washed my hair and towel dried it. I applied this mousse per directions and  used a hand dryer to style my hair under blowing it. My hair had a lot of volume and looked nice for the entire day. Yes, it looked styled though that was not exactly my main goal and it was soft and flexible.&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this mousse was it wasn&#x27;t sticky and didn&#x27;t have a lacquered look or feel to it. It is somewhat similar to Nexxus Mousse and in general very easy to use rendering (as I was to discover) consistent and easy positive results.&lt;br /&gt;If you are craving texture, volume, and overall dimension this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference between this mousse and other mousse&#x27;s that I have used.  Nothing outstanding about it, it&#x27;s just an ordinary mousse and keeps the fly aways down.  But don&#x27;t see any big difference in volume in my hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT ONLY THING THE NOZZLE WAS BROKEN.. UGH!!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite mousse!  Really thickens my hair and adds texture and body.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD MOUSSE. GIVES GREAT HOLD AND BODY.</li>
    <li> {Really 3.5 stars} I love the product itself. It holds the shape of my natural curls well, and it prevents frizz for a good part of the day. My hair is soft and yet defined, which is difficult to find in an affordable product. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, generating just the right amount of bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container design could use some improvement, however. Every single time I&#x27;ve used this product, the dispenser part breaks. I&#x27;m hard on my stuff, admittedly, occasionally dropping it, occasionally knocking it on the side of the sink. But how many people baby their $5 bottles of mousse? They desperately need to improve the dispenser because it always breaks within a couple of weeks. I can still use it because I jimmy it in place when I need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along those lines, the dispenser spits out far too much for one use. I usually end up with a giant blob covering my hand after a gentle half-second squirt. I have fine hair, even though it is pretty long, which means I often either use a bit too much product or waste some.</li>
    <li> This product works very well in adding volume and body to my hair. It pumps out of the container into the consistency of foam; much like shaving cream.  When applied to damp hair and then followed with blow drying, it leaves no sticky, tacky, stiff feeling or dried looking residue. After blow drying and flat ironing my hair was left very soft with plenty of volume and body.  My hair is about 6 inches. I use a small palmful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first time I used this product, I applied a little to my dried and already styled hair. I got more volume, but in that case, my hair felt slightly stiff. Similar to the feel after using a good hair spray.  My hair is relaxed. It didn&#x27;t revert when applied to dry hair; however, it works best when used as directed....applying to freshly shampooed and conditoned hair that is damp and following with blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the John Frieda works better than Nexxus Volumizer for adding fullness and body to the hair. Frieda also sells a \\&quot; root booster\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s only applied to the roots. The \\&quot;boost\\&quot; lasts all day. Generally, I use them separately, but if I want a really full looking hairstyle, I&#x27;ll use them together. With the John Frieda Luxurious products, limp hair will look fuller and thicker.  You don&#x27;t have to settle for limp hair if that&#x27;s not wanted. These products deliver.  I&#x27;m happy because they&#x27;re inexpensive, too. Much less than most other salon products.</li>
    <li> This product works great and really leaves you feeling like your hair has gotten thicker.  It&#x27;s not always easy to find so buy it when you see it.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion &amp; was a great product!</li>
    <li> This was one of the WORST body-building products for hair I ever tried!!! After two days, I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Used this after the same type of shampoo and conditioner. Was pleased with hair volume. My only drawback was it felt a bit stiff after I was sweating, but as soon as my hair got dry again I brushed the volume back in my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sticky on my hair..</li>
    <li> My hair is not as thick as it once was. This mousse does give it a noticable difference in thickness.</li>
    <li> This is favorite product of mine and you can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
    <li> Only thing that works a little on my fine, limp hair.</li>
    <li> The mousse basically works fine. I would love it to be a bit lighter on my hair, since it is so fine.  Not as heavy as some other products, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A TINY spritz of this is plenty of mousse. The product expands once it has been dispensed, and gives more than I need for short hair. Bummer to waste extra product each time, but it does work well.</li>
    <li> it is a very light light mouse that packs a lot of hold without weighing down my hair. I will be buying more definitely</li>
    <li> This mousse gives great styling ability and adds volume &amp; body.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous others until I found this product. My search is over.</li>
    <li> Not sure how a volumizing mousse caused such flat and crunchy hair, but this one did just that. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I got a super deal on this. Love it.</li>
    <li> Came on time.  It is just what I wanted.  My hair is generally pretty flat and this product makes my hair look great.  One thing I like as well is that my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
    <li> This is such a great mousse. I bought it for my mother, and she ended up loving it! I have bought salon products for triple the price that arent as great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for mousse. I don&#x27;t think it adds any volume to my hair and doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as other kinds I&#x27;ve tried. I will use it up and not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a mousse person generally but this seems to work well.  Not too much scent if that is important to you.</li>
    <li> This is great in humity and does not make my fine hair flat.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair and have tried tons of different products and this also did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse! My hair has thinned out a lot and this adds so much volume! The scent is great! My hair stayed scrunched all day!! Would definetly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I have natural blonde hair so already my hair is thin so I wanted to try this. It doesnt really add body as it makes your hair stucky so it sticks to itself. On the bright side it smells good.  I won&#x27;t waste my money on it again.</li>
    <li> Great mousse! Luxury product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Finally a styling mouse that truly does build volume in fine hair. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I received this on time. It is a nice size container.  It did add volume to my thinner hair but it left my hair looking dull.  I was disappointed but it may just be my hair type.</li>
    <li> This mousse is excellent for fine, thin hair! I have tried many, many brands and this is one of the best. The price is great also.</li>
    <li> As noted in my review of JOHN FRIEDA Luxurious Volume Anytime Volume Refresher, this product is unbelievably effective in that it produces more body and adds thickness to my fine, thin hair.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my hair; gives body, but no stickiness.  Good price also.</li>
    <li> This is a great mousse, gives touchable, smooth body to your hair. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I feel like the volume it gives is just normal, not particularly spectacular. But, it is really great mousse. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all, which I like, and it comes out as thick foam but applies smoothly. I also like that it isn&#x27;t too sticky or crunchy. I have only ever used it with blow-drying though, so I&#x27;m not sure how it applies when left to air-dry, but I suspect it would be more to the oily than crunchy side, if that helps.</li>
    <li> Not the best mousse I&#x27;ve used, but it is fine. Not sure if I would buy again though since it doesn&#x27;t seem to give my hair the body other products I&#x27;ve used have</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and thankfully this adds a bit of body and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells decent - not a strong odor at all.  I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes so this is a big issue with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Finally have found something for my fine hair! Love it.</li>
    <li> works as described. not heavy. has a good scent.  great price.</li>
    <li> good for volumizing fine hair</li>
    <li> makes my this hair look dirty</li>
    <li> it works! I like the scent and it works without leaving your hair stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a few reviews saying that it&#x27;s best for fine hair, but I&#x27;d have to disagree. Right after blow drying your hair it looks amazing, but come lunch time you have flat hair. If you use too much product, it will just go flat (duh) but a little does go a long way for fine hair at least.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a John Frieda product.  The mousse is nice and a step above the usual suave quality.  Try it if you can get a decent price.</li>
