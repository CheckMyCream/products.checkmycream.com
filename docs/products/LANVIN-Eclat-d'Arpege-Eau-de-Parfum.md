<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume........</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife&lt;br /&gt;She wears it, I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used others but this is the best. It is french</li>
    <li> I just love the smell. And now my best friend wants me to buy her a bottle for her birthday. It smells like a million bucks but lucky for us, it don&#x27;t cost that much.....Enjoy :)</li>
    <li> Irreplaceable. Such and exquisite, elegant, dainty  scent. You can wear it day and night. I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
    <li> It is light and exotic! I wear it everyday. I love it! I&#x27;m so sad it was discontinued. I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This french parfume is so wonderful! My daughter keeps sneaking sprays on her way out the door. I adore lilacs so I bought this. It does remind me of my favorite flower--yet better!</li>
    <li> I received this order, along with two other fragrances. When I first sprayed myself with the perfume it was lovely. However, the next time I sprayed it on it had a very strange odor and was terrible.  I have had to throw it out because the smell of it is quite bad. It completely changed and I should have returned this item and received a refund.  What can I do about this?&gt;?  I will never order fragrance from Amazon again.  Out of the three fragrances I ordered only ONE of them was good.  Never, never again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend used to have the same perfume and she  loves it. But she didn&#x27;t like  the one I ordered here. It doesn&#x27;t last long, the smell of perfume dissapeared in an hour. Seems like a poor quality item.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I get many questions about the parfume. It must smell good not only for me, but for others the same way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I went to a perfume store about 3 years ago, searching for something new to wear, the lady there tried so many perfumes on my, so I couldn&#x27;t make a choice at that moment, then I went home and I found that this one perfume smells great whe you just put it on you as when hours go by. So I told my then boyfriend, and he got it for me as a Christmas gift. It is absolutely lovely. I love when I got to sleep at night and I get to smell it on my hair, on my clothes, delightful.</li>
    <li> so i went to Europe this summer. and they had this parfume in Kolonna stores.. but like for 60$ .. i didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on parfume.. so i waited till i get back to usa and bought it from[...] for half the price!!  so all i can say ENJOY!! :))</li>
    <li> Hi, your service is very good, i admit that, it took a little bit long to come,but i guess its bc its far. the product came all in original package, but i thought that eau de parfum will stay long and the smell last long. I had this before and i love the smell is stays on for so long. the next week i can even smell it on my cloths but this one, its goes alway in 5 min and the smell become a uneasy smell, like a skunk.</li>
    <li> I was gifted this parfum about 10 years ago and I loved it. I had forgotten the name and I was looking for it desperately. Finally, I found it by googling purple parfum and surprisingly it appeared among the top results in google images!&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews about this parfum on some websites that carry it and I realized that a common concern was if the product was indeed original. I finally decided to buy it from Amazon, since the reviews were better. Today, I received the purple parfum! And I confirm that it is exactly the same as the one I had before: the glass box, the stand, the container and most importantly the scent are just right.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume a couple months ago, and I always get compliments in my choice of perfumes, but this time with this one, everyone gets closer just to smell me and say that they love how smell, I can tell that this time people would actually say that \\&quot;I\\&quot; smell good instead of asking right away about the perfume i&#x27;m wearing... what I&#x27;m trying to say is that this fragance becomes part of you and is not overwhelming at all like other perfumes. Try it!, you&#x27;ll also love it ;)</li>
    <li> Yaaay, my favorite fragrance I was so excited to have found it... It came pretty quickly, wrapped, I&#x27;m very satisfied. Thank you Amazon.. :)</li>
    <li> It Is everithing OK. Tks</li>
    <li> I have smelled this on a friend and really loved the smell.  I ordered a bottle for myself, and I am so disappointed.  It has no aroma whatsoever - it&#x27;s as if I sprayed water into the air, not a hint of aroma.  Thinking it may just be me, I asked my husband, son, and a friend if they could smell it; none of them smelled anything either.  Maybe I received a really old bottle?</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a special someone because she loved how it smelled. So I got it for her and she is loving it. Since she loves, I love it, and the fragance actually smells awesome. For the price, it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The smell is light, fresh, young. I don&#x27;t get sick from it, I almost don&#x27;t feel it at all on me, but people notice and complement it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have  purchased this perfume as it is my favourite. Almost everyone comments on the fragrance wherever I come.The price is great too. Definetely will buy more!</li>
    <li> Everyone will ask you what your wearing, but don&#x27;t say... Shh!!! A fragrance for a classy, distinctive lady... Most stores do not sell this fragrance, so you won&#x27;t smell this on to many people. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love love this perfume, its the best purchase i ever make from pefumes:) Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume after falling in love with it at Nordstroms. I was impressed to see all the great reviews and at such a great price! However, I received the item (packaging looked normal) and sprayed it. Heaven! HOWEVER, the smell lasted less than a minute. I knew something was wrong since this was a parfum, the scent should at least last longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;I read that another customer/reviewer experienced the same watered-down item that I had. I informed Amazon, and they were able to assist me and refunded me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of French perfumes, but this one is by far my favorite scent. One of my past boyfriends bought it for me when he went to Paris, and I got so many compliments on it that I bought more when it ran out! No matter where I go, to a restaurant, to the movies, etc. I always have people, even random strangers, come up to me and ask me what scent I&#x27;m wearing! I love the smell of it, and since it&#x27;s eau de parfum it lasts all day long. I&#x27;ll probably wear it for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell. always get compliments when i wear it. it&#x27;s my new favorite! if u like d&amp;g - light blue or moschino - i love love, cheap &amp; chic, u will definitely love this one too!</li>
    <li> I love E&#x27;clat D&#x27;arpege! The scent is absolutely perfectly lovely and light. Unlike some perfumes, it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze or give me a headache. But, the scent is still strong enough that it stays with me for the day--it&#x27;s great to have a perfume that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm me and everyone else around, but is still noticeable to the point that I get compliments on it all the time!!! I&#x27;ve had so many people ask me for the name of the scent so that they can buy it.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume! This is the one perfume i never get sick of wearing. The fragrance is sometimes compared to dolce &amp; gabbana light blue but without the buttery scent. The Fragrance is fun, not too musky &amp; not too flowery, but a good combination including citrus. I love it and so do my male friends!</li>
    <li> If you go to buy this perfume at any other store it is a light purple color as it is in the picture.  The bottle I got was clear with mold on top of it.  I returned it and recieved a new bottle in the same condition.  You have to go to Nordy&#x27;s to buy the real deal.</li>
    <li> It is what I like to wear because it is light, mixes well with my chemistry ....AND I am not allergic to it as I am with most perfumes . Someone always comments about what perfume I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Very mature and elegant scent. I love it!</li>
    <li> Good quality, good one to use, morning, and night use, sexy, good for any time, I love to have it all the time, recommend it to</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this perfume before and absolutely loved it. This knock-off, however, smells much more like alcohol upon first application and the scent fades within 5 minutes. You also cannot return this product with Amazon, as perfume is considered a flammable/hazardous substance, so you&#x27;re stuck with it. I wish I had saved my money for the real thing. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDER!!!</li>
    <li> I was impressed with how quickly it arrived.  I love the fragrance and it lasts for quite awhile.  Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first designer perfume but I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth. Have had a lot of compliments wearing it. It&#x27;s a fresh, crisp scent that&#x27;s almost aquatic - not too floral or musky. Perfect for special occasions or even daily use.</li>
    <li> It is not a real E&#x27;clat D&#x27;arpege By Lavin.(But nice made copy of the bottle).</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it, nothing special. The fragrance smells very ordinary, which totally not impress me at all. And the box is dirty when I open the package, looks like already stay in the warehouse for a long time.</li>
    <li> This perfume seems lovely at the first 10 minutes.  It is light and not overwhelming. But it doesn&#x27;t last AT ALL!!!  You won&#x27;t smell anything after 30 minutes even though you sprayed TONS!  I don&#x27;t like this item! I want to return it, but Amazon says it is hazardous materials and doesn&#x27;t accept return.  So I&#x27;m very confused.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and DISSATISFIED! Well, lesson learned is DON&#x27;T buy perfume online!</li>
    <li> My mom likes it a lot. Good for 30+</li>
    <li> So disappointed. A friend told me what she was wearing so I ordered the perfume. There was no fragrance whatsoever once it was on my body! I feel it may have been old or watered down?!?</li>
    <li> I am rating the perfume itself, not Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect, that&#x27;s all there is to it. While it&#x27;s very hard to agree on scents in general, this one is very light, airy, feminine, and addictive. My friend sent me a bottle of it from Europe, and I guess she knows me too well. I fell in love with the scent and so did my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found this as a gift set at TJ Max two days ago... Very reasonably priced. :)</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for years and have gotten countless compliments - often from total strangers or, for example, from a salesperson or receptionist. I love this scent because it is not too sweet and yet does not have any musky undertones.  I am not sure why some reviews call it \\&quot;casual\\&quot; because I wear it everywhere, day and evening. Perhaps because the notes are not as \\&quot;high\\&quot; as some \\&quot;dressier\\&quot; scents. However, it is a wonderful floral type of scent that is timeless.  This is truly a classic, classy scent and you will be very happy that you bought it. By the way, the price here on Amazon is about 1/3 that of most department stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent Service and amazing product!</li>
    <li> A very soft, feminine scent. Long lasting but not overpowering. Fine for day time or a romantic evening</li>
    <li> So happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I gave 3 star only because the product is not the same as the one I brought from the department store. The scent does not last that long. Shipping and handling was amazing. This product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have bought this for my mother several times. When she&#x27;s done with one bottle, she asks me to buy it for her again. Smell is floral, subtle and delicate. The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. Light, sensual and feminine but not flowery at all. Also unique,I never met anyone else wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts on my clothes and lingers in my hair for days.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume and was very happy to find it for this price. It&#x27;s not an overpowering perfume and I wear it daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume years ago and have been looking for it ever since. I absolutely LOVE it! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Let me tell you what a great perfume it&#x27;s. Every time I&#x27;m wearing it, I get a lot of compliments and beside that, the seller is great,fast shipping and very careful packaging.This is my 2 time ordering it from this seller, 1st time I ordered for myself and as a gift for my mom.My mom fall in love with this perfume too. Highly recommend perfume to everybody. Thank you, Diana.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this perfume almost every time I wear it! It smells so sophisticated and is not overwhelming! I love it!</li>
    <li> sooo many compliments i cant even count...Exceptional product, and so reasonable on Amazon.  No other place to get this at this price point...try and you will fall in LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Magical, defining, long lasting great day or evening.  A modern version of a true classic, loved it for many years!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fake, don&#x27;t waste your money. The bottle looks different from the original. The scent doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
    <li> wonderful fragrance. I get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> I like to switch around the perfume I wear every so often, but I have been using this for the past year and a half.  Perfume is a personal thing... seems to work with a persons own natural body chemistry,  and one scent can smell completely different on 2 people, but this one works really nice for me.  I honestly have gotten more compliments on this perfume than any other perfume I have ever worn in the past. I love it. ; )</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume since it came out in 2003. I love this. People stop and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> This scent will make you glad you ordered it, and you will not feel overwhelmed by too strong a scent.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!!!!</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I wanted! Excellent service!!</li>
    <li> I just love it.. This is 3rd time I have ordered.. My friends also asked which perfume do you use.. 😊&lt;br /&gt;She ordered it too&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have read ALL the reviews and I have searched for this perfume at many different online sites, including Target. I ordered it once from Target, the package never came and they ended up canceling it and now you can&#x27;t order it from Target. So, I am not sure about the fake versus real. But, I have a real bottle of this stuff at home that I purchased in the mall and I compared it to this bottle and they seem to be the same. There are few differences. For example, the cap and the nozzle are both a little bit smaller than the real bottle at home, the real bottle at home has 80% on the bottom while this bottle has 78%. Other than that, the drawings and the artwork are all the same and the barcode is on the bottom of the glass case the perfume arrived in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test: I sprayed it on my arm early in the morning the other day, did many chores, ran around, washed dishes, etc, and the smell was still there when I went to shower at 11pm. I am wearing it today at work and I will continue to test it, but I think it is the real stuff. Even if it is fake, this is a good fake because it did not burn when I put it on, the smell is exactly the same and it has stayed for an all day wear. AND, the price is just right:)</li>
    <li> Smells very good, although very similar to some mainstream perfumes, such as Light Blue.  The packaging is beautiful, and after testing on a piece of fabric, it lasts days.  I did so to make sure I didnt give my wife a fake for Christmas.  If you are concerned with receiving fakes, I would suggest ordering from &amp;#34;Top of the World&amp;#34; which is another Prime vendor for this item.  They guarantee genuine products and I can attest to that...and for only a few dollars more than Amazon.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the question I get a lot, followed by compliments. I like to use fragrances that are little known or used, and this fits the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to a high end department store (which is the only place I&#x27;ve found them in SF) and the price for this triples. Love Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume from a french perfume shop at the mall for a gift at more than twice the price I&#x27;ve seen it on Amazon for since then.  I loved the sample and the person I gave it to loved it also.  I loved it so much I had to buy a bottle for myself.  It&#x27;s not too sweet smelling and I love the light citrus scent.  It&#x27;s definitely my favorite perfume now.</li>
    <li> bough this for my ma and my ma in law last xmas, they fricking love it!  Your 30 yr old girlfriend/wife what have you, will also love the smell. Sporadic compliments will come- no joke, happens to my Ma in law. Makes me look good.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Had lots of compliments especially from the guys. Does not too long but good price and cute packaging. Highly reccomend it :)</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing! I Love it! My boss has it and ever since I smelled it, I fell in Love with it.  I received it just a few days after I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I almost don&#x27;t want to write this review....this perfume is the best kept secret....so light and wonderful.  I cannot stand strong over powering perfume....this is great!</li>
    <li> This is a light fragrance that is very appealing.  I get tons of compliments every time I wear it.  You can&#x27;t beat the price compared to the top trends.  It lasts all day, too.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and everyone I know now wears it because it&#x27;s so great. It smells really clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Easy breezy summer smell. I love it!</li>
    <li> This scent is just okay for me. It reminds me a little of Anais Anais (which I don&#x27;t like). But, there are other scents in the mix that save it from being completely like Anais. I guess I was expecting more. It&#x27;s dry down is nice but for the Anais fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a revised review. After having this perfume for more than a year, I&#x27;ve actually grown to love it. I don&#x27;t know why, but, I did think that I should edit this review. It&#x27;s not my favorite perfume, and it&#x27;s not my usual flair, but I have grown very fond of it.</li>
    <li> One of the best perfume. It is very crisp. light and fresh. Love it!</li>
    <li> I wish I could put Zero stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing this fragrance for years. I&#x27;ve recently moved and no longer live near Nordstrom so I thought I could just order it online from Amazon and be fine. Turns out I was wrong. It may cost more to purchase this from a high-end retailer website, but at least it is the real thing. So dissatisfied. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some points-&lt;br /&gt;#1- the packing it comes in nor the bottle itself do not say &amp;#34;Lanvin&amp;#34; anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;#2- it is a very darker color purple than the true product.&lt;br /&gt;#3- the scent is a lot heavier than the true product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly getting complements on this perfume... People describe it as soft, clean, fresh, light but, it&#x27;s powerful enough for them to smell the fragrance when i&#x27;m in the room or walk pass them... I&#x27;m told that it smells very good on me...  I love this perfume!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really review this product.  I mean it&#x27;s perfume, yeah?  My (adult) daughter wanted some of this particular perfume..found it on Amazon..it qualified for Amazon Prime, so I ordered it for a Christmas gift, free shipping, arrived in about 1 week.  What more could I ask?</li>
    <li> This is my favourite perfume</li>
    <li> In so glad I was able to find this online, it&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores, good price for the amount  of  perfume.</li>
    <li> Smells like the real thing, packaged perfectly. Love this perfume. Light and subtle, perfect for anyone- not too overwhelming at all.</li>
    <li> Great product that came quickly, and exactley as pictured. Smells wonderful, and came packaged just as in stores.</li>
    <li> I have owned the original, and compared side by side. This is 100% FAKE!!! Dont waste 40$ on a FAKE. Get the original, its my absolute favorite/signature scent. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> My ultimate favorite scent. I think this is my signature scent for life. As long as they continue to make it I will buy it. My boyfriend loves it and my nieces love to hug me just to smell it LOL.</li>
    <li> I tought that because of the really good price, it would not be as strong (or last as long) as the original. But it does! I really seems original (that was my biggest fear). The scent is amazing (not too strong) and I get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Super Fast Delivery...Arrived new in box..Love this perfume!!</li>
    <li> Great smell! Love it.</li>
    <li> I wear it since 2008 and never stoped to wear. It is a great perfume.</li>
    <li> That is my favorite perfume. the delivery was fast, item was packed well. The perfume itself is what it is supposed to be. So if you like lanvin - it is a deal for you.</li>
    <li> Smooth scent not strong at all. Perfect a night outing. Thank you Lanvin!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this same perfume from Amazon, and I made sure the seller was Amazon, because I thought I would be getting the real product. I am so dissapointed. The perfume I got is like water, it does not even have any scent. Be careful about purchasing this item. I should have paid attention to all the other reviewers. If you can get ahold of the real thing though, this is a loverly perfume.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years along with my Bvlgari Omnia.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, super fast shipping. A+ all around.</li>
    <li> The product I recieved I am 99% sure is a fake. I have been wearing this scent for well over 10 years and this was NOT my scent. I gave it a couple days to see if I was becoming immune to the scent, but even after giving it some time, I know this is not the real deal. It is such a distinct smell that I would recognize it instantly….and this isnt it! I&#x27;m soooo dissapointed and confused because I bought this perfume from Amazon last year. I hope whoever their supplier is is taken off their list. And the worst part is that I can&#x27;t return it since it is considered a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; by the post office. So I&#x27;m out the cas with a perfume that I won&#x27;t wear and can&#x27;t return so I can buy another one (from a different seller). Not cool Amazon, not cool.</li>
    <li> absolutely love the smell. its so worth the money I paid for it! you will not regret this purchase! love it!</li>
    <li> This is similar to Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana with the added touch of lilacs.  It is a touch sweeter than Light Blue and the longevity is not as good, but I love it so much I don&#x27;t mind spraying extra.  The bottle is beautiful!  I feel relaxed when I wear this and sometimes wear it on my wrists when I go to bed.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> E&#x27;clat D&#x27;arpege is a perfect scent for the summer. Not in the least over powering,or a commercial scent. I get compliments from women at work and in public places asking me what scent I am wearing. Lemon, peach, amber, light,light musk and cedar. Since it is not over powering I become unaware of how it smells on me. But the compliments are my reminder. It is a romantic scent.</li>
    <li> First off - I received this perfume order in 24 hours!!!! You cannot beat that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - I have received so many compliments on this perfume (women and men) I cannot stop wearing it.  It smells amazing, mature, sweet, slightly floral, citrusy.  MUST TRY</li>
    <li> I love this parfum, my daughter actually bought this for herself. That is all it took to get me hooked, I have had so many people ask me what the name is of my perfum. It is wonderful, soft vet mytic.</li>
    <li> Great value for money. A classic perfume that is in the top three for me, at a great price with free shipping. Brilliant!</li>
    <li> great scent for the value.</li>
    <li> so excited to have arpege again - it was a favorite of mine for years, and now I have the opportunity to wear it again and feel like I am walking in Paris!</li>
    <li> Smells great but fades really fast...</li>
    <li> So happy I bought this perfume. I tried it in a store, and couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist. The bottle is beautiful/</li>
    <li> The  smell of flowers and sweet and citrus everywhere I go people ask me what perfume I using! Ive been buying this for 5 years now</li>
    <li> This is the perfect perfume for my wife. It came on time and intact. She loves it so much. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> E&#x27;clat D&#x27;arpege gives just enough hint of its floral, soothing scent to make me fall in love with it right away.  I don&#x27;t prefer strong or sweet scents in general since one gives me a headache and the other reminds me of being a teenager.  This perfume is perfect for day or night and doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this scent while sitting next to a woman on an airplane who was wearing it. It is subtle and very feminine, but not over-powering. The only retail store in my area that carries it, is Von Maur. It is 99.00 retail for the smaller bottle. It&#x27;s a steal at this price!! If your looking for a soft, clean scent that has people constantly asking you what your wearing...this is it!! I have actually had men standing in line at Starbucks tell me I smell amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice perfume... I buy it for my mother and smells wonderful and delicate. Above all, very good quality because the fragrance lasts a long time on her.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife as its her favorite perfume. She loves it!</li>
    <li> fragrance disappears very soon</li>
    <li> I buy my wife a new bottle every year. It is soft and delicious. I like it because it is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a while for my mother.  It was wonderful to find it on the web.</li>
    <li> No scent delivers as consistently as &amp;Eacute;clat D&#x27;arpege for my wife. It&#x27;s bright and sparkly. Not flowery. Not fruity. Just fresh. I love it on her.</li>
    <li> Why spend more money than you have to in a department store? This is my favorite perfume and now I can afford to buy it.  Came very fast in the mail. It always comes quicker than I expect and smells beautiful. I get compliments all the time. Thanks for the great service.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  It smells light but lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This sweet smelling French perfume has always been my favorite and signature scent and I can&#x27;t see myself wearing any other perfume than this, ever.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, everyone ask what I&#x27;m wearing.I love this perfume.</li>
    <li> Everything was excelent!!  Service and product!</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for a few years now. I love the soft scent. I have had several compliments on the fragrance even at the end of an 8 hour work day someone would say what is the fragrance your wearing? This is just about the only perfume I wear. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume. so sweet and fruity scent makes me pleasure. I like this gentle and long lasting smell.</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments each time I wear this. Light, simple but absolutely lovely scent. I&#x27;ll never be without a bottle of this perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to so many perfumes, but this causes no headaches.  I love the layers of scent within this one!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this perfume and everybody is always complementing the fragrance.This is the third  one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sutile, but smells wonderful. People will ask what perfume i&#x27;m using. I wear it in my wrists and when I move the smell spread and people notice it.</li>
    <li> It has incredibly delicate very distinct aroma.&lt;br /&gt;It was my discovery. Because it’s not so well-known I’ve been asked many times what an incredible perfume I’m wearing.</li>
    <li> This scent never fails to get me a compliment. Very unique, fresh, and just beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love love love this perfume, and it&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite on me too.  Everytime I put it on he tells me I smell good.  Plus, this price on Amazon was so inexpensive for what I&#x27;ve seen it in stores for (up to $90 for the 3.4 oz size).</li>
    <li> I always get compliments whenever I&#x27;m wearing this perfume.  It has a clean, fresh scent, plus it&#x27;s light and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Very feminine...not too overpowering...clean classy scent</li>
    <li> This perfume is simply lovely, soft for everyday use.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Perfume was exactly what I had sampled at the mall. It&#x27;s not an imitation and the price is great for the size compared to the mall store prices.</li>
    <li> THIS ISN&#x27;T THE SAME ONE I purchased in the past.  It&#x27;s as if they watered it down.  Not happy with this seller</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this fragrance at Nordstrom for $64.  This is a steal deal and of course, the fragrance is lovely.</li>
