    <li> This bag is great for carrying around smaller items, but you can not fit binder or large folders into it. If you are using it to carry small books (not textbooks) this is good for that.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a teen and they loved it, looks just like the photo.  Not sure how durable it is, but it was well worth the price and it shipped very quickly.  They use it as an overnight bag.</li>
    <li> People ask to take pictures with it. Fits my laptop, granted it&#x27;s a small one, but carries that, the coard and some files with no problem. Good value too.</li>
