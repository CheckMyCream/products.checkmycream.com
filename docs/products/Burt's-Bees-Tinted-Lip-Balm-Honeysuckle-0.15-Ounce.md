    <li> This balm feels buttery, not waxey. Though there is no scent, I have not detected a bad taste to this.  There is a very light tinting, so it is nice as a touch-up or natural look.  I used to be partial to the beeswax balm, but this is my new fave because it feels much better on my lips.</li>
    <li> I liked this very much.. Love the color and the long wear. Do not have to apply as often as other chap sticks..</li>

    <li> Honeysuckle is a very pale color on your lips.  Looks almost natural.  Smells good, and leaves lips soft and moisturized.  Love that it is a natural makeup without added chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.  Very subtle color and great moisturizing power!  The only thing I was disappointed about was the sized.  I thought it would be just about the size of the container, but the lip balm is the same size as any lip balm you would buy from the store.  So it comes in this fat, pretty, cardboard container and there&#x27;s just this little lip balm rattling around inside.  I would have considered another brand if I knew it would be so small.  But great Burt&#x27;s Bees quality!</li>
    <li> It feels great when you put it on, but I was hoping for a little more color.  Next time I&#x27;ll order another color.</li>
    <li> I am always happy with Burts Bees products.  This balm is smooth and lightly tinted.  Perfect for every day wear.</li>

    <li> More great lip balm :-).</li>
    <li> What can you say about Burt&#x27;s Bees?  It is a perfect product and can&#x27;t be beat. I have tried a lot of other balms, but this is by far the best!  Love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this is another one I&#x27;m adding to the list. I wanted a tinted lip moisturizer without having a lot of color. This is a nice sheer, light nude color. Just a hint. Nice enough that I plan on try more colors.</li>
    <li> Right level of moisture and love the color</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t buy enough of these lip balms.  I need one for each jacket and pants pocket</li>
    <li> The shade was lighter than the colour shown in the picture. Product was ok.</li>
    <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees products and put the Tinted Lip Balm on my wishlist. My sister got a hold of the wishlist and this was one of my gifts. I don&#x27;t remember the color, but I like that this balm keeps my lips moist and adds just a touch of color to my already dark-colored lips.  I would buy this on my own when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a  medium pale skin tone, this looks very nude on me but requires a lot. Still I love Burts Bees for it&#x27;s natural and no animal testing.</li>
    <li> tastes good and very moisturizing with a nice natural tint.</li>
    <li> Perfect nude color, smooth application.</li>
