    <li> Holds the items well. Snap it great.</li>
    <li> Bought a stamp plate set and needed a case to help hold them together.  This little wanna-be leather case is pretty sturdy and durable so far.  Held all the plates and you can actually fit 2 plates per but I&#x27;d be careful with that since you don&#x27;t want to scratch them up.  That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re getting the case in the first place, right?  Overall a good purchase that I would make again if this one ever did fail.  But I don&#x27;t see that happening so this is also a great one time purchase!</li>
    <li> Can hold 56 plates safely. 28 plates if you want to be able to view them all. Has two clasp positions for varied thickness. Nice little case. This is a great inexpensive way to store nail stamping plates. Fits Konad and generic nail stamping plates I bought. You can fit two plates in each page because each page has two individual sleeves.</li>

    <li> Great for holding plates.  When the case is all full it is a little hard to get the plates out of the back slots but at the same time I have 2 plates in each slot so single slots may work better. The case is very durable and I love the pink.</li>
    <li> Very cute!! I ordered the pink one. For many people complaining about the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; leather, well what did you expect for the price? The cover and back leather feels flimsy but it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to be throwing it around for it to rip, it seems like it will do it&#x27;s job perfectly and looks just like the picture!! Each page had a front and back slot for two plates per page and holds all of my cheeky beauty plates really great. I don&#x27;t have any problems with the close tab button. Will likely buy more once I buy another set of plates.</li>
