### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great value!</li>
      <li>this Clinical Protection deodorant from Dove is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Dove deodorant is the best.</li>
      <li>, this is the best.</li>
      <li>package is beautiful and the 1/4 moisturizers are great</li>
      <li>My arthritic hands weren&#x27;t happy.</li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>Dove makes great products, so I was eager to give this one a try.</li>
      <li>As with all the clinical deodorants, this one is great.</li>
      <li>Very nice scent.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, and works for my level of perspiration!</li>
      <li>Smells really good.</li>
      <li>The scent is a nice pleasant one - it reminds me of baby powder.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the performance of this Dove Clinical product.  </li>
      <li>I, personally, am more than happy to smell floral-y rather than like death</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Dove deodorants often and been pleased with them, but this clinical protection offering is particularly good.</li>
      <li>This works great, love the light scent.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is very strong.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am very happy with Dove Deodorant Clinical Powder Soft.</li>
      <li>Even after a long day of work, my wife was impressed that she still smelled nice.  </li>
      <li>and I love that I no longer have to worry about stains on my clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely to feel secure when I lift my arms!</li>
      <li>I love clinical protection deodorants.</li>
      <li>I found it does work better if applied at night, I just didn&#x27;t always remember to before bed.</li>
      <li>Dove is the &amp;#34;#1 dermatologist recommended skin care brand&amp;#34; and I love the silky softness of gliding this deodorant on as it softens and conditions my skin while protecting me against wetness and odor in the 100 degree Texas heat.</li>
      <li>The smell is great and product works for high stressful days.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any particular scent in this product, which I liked, but if you want a powder soft scent, this isn&#x27;t the best choice.</li>
      <li>Most important for deodorant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product is easily dispensed by twisting the bottom of the stick.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh, light, powdery scent!</li>
      <li>I need a strong antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Off the bat, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled because it took far too many clicks to get the product to come to the top.</li>
      <li>My preference is to apply it after I shower in the morning, and it works just fine for me this way.  </li>
      <li>This antiperspirant does an excellent job keeping me dry and fresh smelling.  </li>
      <li>It is lightly scented and moisturizes and conditions</li>
      <li>If I raise my arm over my head, I DO NOT want my audience to see a great big sweat spot under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and stays in place.</li>
      <li>But of all the regular and clinical products I&#x27;ve tried, this one does the best job for a reasonable price and doesn&#x27;t irritate my under-arms if applied immediately after shaving.</li>
      <li>But the reason she won&#x27;t use it every day is that it likely contains aluminum, and absorbing that is not the best thing for one&#x27;s health.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, clean scent and does a good job at keeping her dry.</li>
      <li>I now have a new favorite deodorant, and I&#x27;m putting it on Subscribe &amp; Save, just to make sure I never run out.</li>
      <li>buying a deodorant I am looking for three things: something that will last all day, smells nice without being overwhelming, and won&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good enough to get through a day.</li>
      <li>and I prefer a clean fresh scent instead.</li>
      <li>and it is super.</li>
      <li>The deodorant  has a light floral and powdery scent which I like very much.</li>
      <li>Not only does it have a lovely scent and applies ultra smooth, but it SUPER protects the wearer.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>The powder smell is nice, not too over powering but enough to smell it.</li>
      <li>The smell was quite nice, like baby powder -- but would I stink the next day?  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that powder fresh was baby powder.</li>
      <li>clinical* strength is worth it.</li>
      <li>I love the powder soft one</li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh smell of powder (a little strong if you go right up to the container and smell it) and it lasts and lasts.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>I liked that this didn&#x27;t dry my underarms out</li>
      <li>My only wish is that the manufacturer change the product so that it doesn&#x27;t take as many turns to get the deodorant started.</li>
      <li>I cannot use most regular ones as they don&#x27;t stop me from perspiring.  </li>
      <li>I like the clinical protection products and Dove products always have light soft effect.  </li>
      <li>, it did seem like it wasn&#x27;t going to come out at first, I had to twist ir a lot to get it out.</li>
      <li>If excessive sweat is an issue than it would likely be in your best interest to apply at bedtime exactly as the instructions specify.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;--It works pretty well to reduce stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quite nice and doesn&#x27;t overpower other smells.&lt;br</li>
      <li>scent is definitely sweet powder but after a few minutes it&#x27;s suitable for guys too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While the box says the deodorant can be applied before going to bed at night and will last all the next day, I am used to putting deodorant on in the morning ( a habit I have that I can&#x27;t break although some say it is better to put it on at night) and it has worked fine for me.</li>
      <li>I have exercised in the hot weather and this deodorant has stood up very well even as I sweat while exercising.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just enough to make you smile, without being heavy enough to interfere with your perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the protection that Dove Clinical provides to me as both a thyroid patient and a menopausal woman.</li>
      <li>You can find this product in a lot of places so give it a try before you buy a large number of them.</li>
      <li>This product contains more aluminum than your traditional deodorants and anti-perspirants (this is the ingredient that blocks sweat), and it does a fantastic job of keeping me dry on extra-hot days.  </li>
      <li>but once you spread it around it really is plenty</li>
      <li>Besides that, I really like it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s extra-strong so you you don&#x27;t need as much as you think you might.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see that it makes much difference,</li>
      <li>The powder scent doesn&#x27;t compete with perfume as much as fruit/citrus scents do, so it doesn&#x27;t turn into a hodgepodge of smells.</li>
      <li>My wife has use the Dove Clinical Protection antiperspirant deodorant before, and has always liked it (enough that it&#x27;s been in her &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; of regular brands).</li>
      <li>It works so good that going from 60 degree summer weather on the coast of Oregon to 95 degree 100% humidity in New Orleans the same day lasted all day long and kept me comfortable for 7 long days of walking all around the Big Easy.</li>
      <li>only note for those who are sensitive to smells is that the baby powder scent is pretty strong and does linger.  </li>
      <li>Dove Deodorant Clinical Powder Soft can be used in the morning or at night right before going to bed.</li>
      <li>While powder scent is not usually my preferred scent for things I use on my body I don&#x27;t mind this one at all - it seems a little strong at first but quickly fades</li>
      <li>I have had way too many run-ins with neighbors and friends (who also enjoy running in my area) to be caught without some serious protection.</li>
      <li>I tried Dove Clinical Powder Soft yesterday for the first time.  </li>
      <li>It controls her perspiration (living in South Carolina and keeping track of three little girls under 4 years of age all day, this is no small task), has a pleasant, but not overpowering scent and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a whole lot of white residue all over her clothing (not even on the darker pieces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One application is enough to last all day, even on the hottest, most humid (100%) days that the US South East has to throw at you.</li>
      <li>you aren&#x27;t devoted to any particular deodorant</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very active, have taught many dance classes, and also perform on stage as a singer.</li>
      <li>She took it on a trip to Cabo where it was 95 degrees F with high humidity, and one application of this deodorant lasted her all day, even when she went swimming.  </li>
      <li>I just use it as normal deodorant</li>
      <li>Helped prevent sweating and smelling and made her feel good throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Small container for the price.</li>
      <li>I am not a person who regularly uses deodorant, I rarely sweat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now the next day, and I&#x27;m happy to report, not only am I dry as a bone, but the only smell I detect on my pits is the baby powder aroma of the Dove.  </li>
      <li>The next step is to click the bottom back and forth several times until the creamy product makes it way to the top.</li>
      <li>I do occasionally use it on days that are abnormally hot.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>This is a pretty standard plus level of protection for a deodorant.  </li>
      <li>My underarms still smelt baby powder fresh at the end of the day and, while I was sweating everywhere else, my underarms stayed dry.  </li>
      <li>After running around in 85 degree weather all day, my armpits stayed dry and smelled fresh.</li>
      <li>At first you&#x27;ll have to do this quite a few times to get it coming out, but after that, a twist (or two, tops) will give you just about the right amount of deodorant.</li>
      <li>I still got white on my black tank top</li>
      <li>She uses it when she must attend official functions that last a very long time, and this holds up better than her regular deodorant.</li>
      <li>Certainly the price that Amazon has it for currently is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the performance of this Dove Clinical product.  I have fairly sensitive skin but have had no problems with this; no breakouts, redness, or irritation.  It performs well as both deodorant and antiperspirant.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the baby-powder fragrance, though, so I will choose a different fragrance when I buy it again.</li>
    <li> The deodorant I previously used was great during the winter months, but as soon as Summer got here, my Secret deodorant started failing me.  By the end of the day, I smelled like Stink City.  I tried Dove Clinical Powder Soft yesterday for the first time.  The smell was quite nice, like baby powder -- but would I stink the next day?  It&#x27;s now the next day, and I&#x27;m happy to report, not only am I dry as a bone, but the only smell I detect on my pits is the baby powder aroma of the Dove.  I now have a new favorite deodorant, and I&#x27;m putting it on Subscribe &amp; Save, just to make sure I never run out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> I love clinical protection deodorants. They give me that little extra boost of protection that I need to survive Louisiana summers. Personally, I don’t follow the instructions to put this on at night before bed. I just use it as normal deodorant and it works great. The scent on this particular fragrance is very soft and is not overpowering to any other scent you want to wear.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant does an excellent job keeping me dry and fresh smelling.  I recently had to travel to SoCal for my child&#x27;s competition during a ridiculous heat wave which included a very rare, for California, level of extreme humidity.  I tried the Dove antiperspirant during our trip which was held out in the blazing sun for 9 hours.  My underarms still smelt baby powder fresh at the end of the day and, while I was sweating everywhere else, my underarms stayed dry.  Quite an accomplishment for this heavy sweater.&lt;br /&gt;My only note for those who are sensitive to smells is that the baby powder scent is pretty strong and does linger.  I, personally, am more than happy to smell floral-y rather than like death but I wanted to throw that out there for those with sensitive noses.</li>
    <li> While I wear Tom&#x27;s of Maine on the off-days from my workouts, I select this for those 90 minute runs. I have had way too many run-ins with neighbors and friends (who also enjoy running in my area) to be caught without some serious protection. And, does it work? Wow! It definitely does!  Not only does it have a lovely scent and applies ultra smooth, but it SUPER protects the wearer.  Now, the one element I was concerned about was staining my clothes. Weirdly, I bought a Degree Clinical Strength, used it, put on a black tee-shirt ... and under ten minutes later, my underarms were white! It did not bleach the shirt, it just must have leaked through? (I don&#x27;t use these products to excess). I had no such problem here. Thank goodness!  Highly recommended  for those physically stressful days!</li>
    <li> As with all the clinical deodorants, this one is great. I love the powder soft one and this keeps you dryer than dry. I have worn this when I have gone running before and it is super. Dove deodorant is the best.</li>
    <li> It works so good that going from 60 degree summer weather on the coast of Oregon to 95 degree 100% humidity in New Orleans the same day lasted all day long and kept me comfortable for 7 long days of walking all around the Big Easy.</li>
    <li> Long lasting protection</li>
    <li> My wife has use the Dove Clinical Protection antiperspirant deodorant before, and has always liked it (enough that it&#x27;s been in her &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; of regular brands). It controls her perspiration (living in South Carolina and keeping track of three little girls under 4 years of age all day, this is no small task), has a pleasant, but not overpowering scent and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a whole lot of white residue all over her clothing (not even on the darker pieces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easily dispensed by twisting the bottom of the stick. At first you&#x27;ll have to do this quite a few times to get it coming out, but after that, a twist (or two, tops) will give you just about the right amount of deodorant. One application is enough to last all day, even on the hottest, most humid (100%) days that the US South East has to throw at you.</li>
    <li> Dove brand is our #1 choice and has been for years. Dove Clinical Protection is no exception and has also made it onto our permanent shopping list.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant comes with the standard plastic lid. Lifting it off, there is a foil seal that you peel off to expose the holes. The next step is to click the bottom back and forth several times until the creamy product makes it way to the top. This takes a bit of work, so don&#x27;t give up!&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend applying at night. I elected to not do that, and apply in the morning as I always do. I love the fresh, light, powdery scent! It&#x27;s just enough to make you smile, without being heavy enough to interfere with your perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the protection that Dove Clinical provides to me as both a thyroid patient and a menopausal woman. It&#x27;s lovely to feel secure when I lift my arms!</li>
    <li> If sweat is a big problem for you, this is a product you need to try. It stops sweating under your arms, flat out stops it. That means it also stops any odor you might not want as a side effect of sweating. I used it when I was exercising and found that it kept my underarms dry but did not prevent my body from cooling off efficiently by other mean... let&#x27;s be blunt, your underarms are not the only body parts to sweat so this will only solve part of any sweat and odor problem you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a problem to use with your nicer clothing or any clothing you do not want to risk getting white marks on. This is not a go on clear solid at all. It didn&#x27;t damage any of my clothing but it did mark up some tank tops. At least the marks came out in the wash, right? I didn&#x27;t notice any particular scent in this product, which I liked, but if you want a powder soft scent, this isn&#x27;t the best choice. You can find this product in a lot of places so give it a try before you buy a large number of them.</li>
    <li> Dove is the &amp;#34;#1 dermatologist recommended skin care brand&amp;#34; and I love the silky softness of gliding this deodorant on as it softens and conditions my skin while protecting me against wetness and odor in the 100 degree Texas heat. I like that it delivers protection all day long and I never worry about close quarters in a car or elevator that I am giving off odor.&lt;br /&gt;The package is beautiful and the 1/4 moisturizers are great but I prefer other scents in the lineup as &amp;#34;powder soft&amp;#34; is too baby powder smelling and I prefer a clean fresh scent instead.</li>
    <li> I like this Dove Deodorant but it&#x27;s not all that much different than the other brands I like.  If it&#x27;s on sale I would buy it and recommend it.  Certainly the price that Amazon has it for currently is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--What I really like is how it goes on, which is as a dry powdery substance.  It also doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;--The scent is definitely sweet powder but after a few minutes it&#x27;s suitable for guys too.&lt;br /&gt;--It works well to reduce perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;--It works pretty well to reduce stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t devoted to any particular deodorant this Dove Clinical is one you should add to your list of candidates. It works well.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. She uses it when she must attend official functions that last a very long time, and this holds up better than her regular deodorant. It has a nice fresh smell of powder (a little strong if you go right up to the container and smell it) and it lasts and lasts. But the reason she won&#x27;t use it every day is that it likely contains aluminum, and absorbing that is not the best thing for one&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> I like using clinical strength deodorant for the simple fact that it lasts all day. Dove makes great products, so I was eager to give this one a try. Off the bat, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled because it took far too many clicks to get the product to come to the top. My arthritic hands weren&#x27;t happy. The deodorant  has a light floral and powdery scent which I like very much. It goes on smooth and stays in place. After running around in 85 degree weather all day, my armpits stayed dry and smelled fresh. After using it for multiple days, my underarm skin seems much smoother and healthier. My only wish is that the manufacturer change the product so that it doesn&#x27;t take as many turns to get the deodorant started. Besides that, I really like it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. It has a nice, clean scent and does a good job at keeping her dry.</li>
    <li> As someone who sweats a lot, I struggle to find a deodorant that actually works. I gave this a try and it definitely does help. I found it does work better if applied at night, I just didn&#x27;t always remember to before bed. The powder smell is nice, not too over powering but enough to smell it. I noticed in some reviews people had trouble getting the deodorant out initially, it did seem like it wasn&#x27;t going to come out at first, I had to twist ir a lot to get it out. I would purchase this deodorant again.</li>
    <li> I need a strong antiperspirant. I cannot use most regular ones as they don&#x27;t stop me from perspiring.  This Dove deodarant does the trick!  I will be purchasing this in the future and recommend!</li>
    <li> For those days when you just need a little more protection, and you know your regular deodorant isn&#x27;t going to cut it - this Clinical Protection deodorant from Dove is perfect.  This product contains more aluminum than your traditional deodorants and anti-perspirants (this is the ingredient that blocks sweat), and it does a fantastic job of keeping me dry on extra-hot days.  Because this product is more expensive than regular deodorants and contains more aluminum, I usually only use it on days when I know I&#x27;m going to be sweating my butt off (doing an outside activity on a hot day, or going to the gym, etc.). While powder scent is not usually my preferred scent for things I use on my body I don&#x27;t mind this one at all - it seems a little strong at first but quickly fades and I don&#x27;t smell it at all unless I stick my nose into my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little product definitely goes a long way - the instructions say to only raise the dial two clicks and apply that mount of product under your arm - this doesn&#x27;t seem like it will be enough but once you spread it around it really is plenty and it&#x27;s extra-strong so you you don&#x27;t need as much as you think you might.  The instructions also say to apply the product at night before bed - I&#x27;ve tried this and I don&#x27;t see that it makes much difference, to me it seemed weird to do this when I shower the next morning.  My preference is to apply it after I shower in the morning, and it works just fine for me this way.  If excessive sweat is an issue than it would likely be in your best interest to apply at bedtime exactly as the instructions specify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s works extremely well although it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;ll keep on hand for sweaty and hot summer days.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, and works for my level of perspiration! It also rubs in well so it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Dove Deodorant Clinical Powder Soft can be used in the morning or at night right before going to bed. It Reduces underarm wetness and is designed to last through the day. It is lightly scented and moisturizes and conditions your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When buying a deodorant I am looking for three things: something that will last all day, smells nice without being overwhelming, and won&#x27;t stain my clothes. Dove Deodorant Clinical Powder does all three things. While the box says the deodorant can be applied before going to bed at night and will last all the next day, I am used to putting deodorant on in the morning ( a habit I have that I can&#x27;t break although some say it is better to put it on at night) and it has worked fine for me. I have exercised in the hot weather and this deodorant has stood up very well even as I sweat while exercising. The scent is a nice pleasant one - it reminds me of baby powder. Finally, I have lost count of how many times I put on deodorant, put on a shirt, gone to work, and once at work noticed the deodorant hadn&#x27;t quite dried after I put it on and has stained the bottom of my shirt. This has not been an issue with this deodorant and I love that I no longer have to worry about stains on my clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Dove Deodorant Clinical Powder Soft.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is very strong.  Even after a long day of work, my wife was impressed that she still smelled nice.  The powder scent doesn&#x27;t compete with perfume as much as fruit/citrus scents do, so it doesn&#x27;t turn into a hodgepodge of smells.</li>
    <li> I have always had a sweat issue. I alternate antiperspirants day to day so my body &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t get used to them&amp;#34;. I have never found that paying extra for *clinical* strength is worth it. I would say out of the all the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength formulas I have tried, this is the best. Secret sucks and Mitchum did less than nothing. I liked that this didn&#x27;t dry my underarms out so they were itchy (like others do). I still got white on my black tank top buy hey, beggars can&#x27;t be choosers can they? No way it&#x27;s 24 or 48 hour protection if you have a sweating issue but it&#x27;s good enough to get through a day.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff.  She took it on a trip to Cabo where it was 95 degrees F with high humidity, and one application of this deodorant lasted her all day, even when she went swimming.  Dove isn&#x27;t exaggerating when they say &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> My wife tried this one, since I found it a bit too feminine smelling. I think it&#x27;s designed that way, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t smear or wipe onto clothes&lt;br /&gt;- Smells really good. Quite nice and doesn&#x27;t overpower other smells.&lt;br /&gt;- It works! Most important for deodorant. Helped prevent sweating and smelling and made her feel good throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Small container for the price.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. Got it on sale. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I have tried close to a dozen different kinds of deodorant over the years. I&#x27;m very active, have taught many dance classes, and also perform on stage as a singer. If I raise my arm over my head, I DO NOT want my audience to see a great big sweat spot under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t rid all sweat, but I am a pretty heavy sweater as far as females go. But of all the regular and clinical products I&#x27;ve tried, this one does the best job for a reasonable price and doesn&#x27;t irritate my under-arms if applied immediately after shaving.</li>
    <li> I am not a person who regularly uses deodorant, I rarely sweat. I&#x27;ve been like that always. I do occasionally use it on days that are abnormally hot. With that being sand, this works fine for me, but I hate that baby powder smell. I didn&#x27;t realize that powder fresh was baby powder.</li>
    <li> I like the clinical protection products and Dove products always have light soft effect.  The smell is great and product works for high stressful days.&lt;br /&gt;Love Dove products continue to buy them for me and my family</li>
    <li> This works great, love the light scent.</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. This is $3 cheaper here than at my local grocery store. Great value!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty standard plus level of protection for a deodorant.  I&#x27;ve used Dove deodorants often and been pleased with them, but this clinical protection offering is particularly good.</li>
