      <li>I also bought a roll on for &#x27;energy synergy&#x27; and love it.  </li>
      <li>Love the roll on.</li>
      <li>I love the scent (reminds me of fall) and wasn&#x27;t sure how well it was working for germ fighting...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Surely will order more.</li>
      <li>In fact I think we need more.</li>
      <li>I use it in the office, because so many people come and just stop at my desk hacking and coughing.</li>
      <li>to use it, and they say they feel better.</li>
      <li>Great scent, though not so much a summer time scent.</li>
      <li>I love how convenient this is to carry around and we use it all the time.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the roller variety for travel and it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>I put it on bottom of feet and my daughters when she goes into the kid care :)</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I purchased two more bottles and had no issues with those.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite blend, not because it doesn&#x27;t work, but because its not my favorite oils in this blend.</li>
      <li>they all love them.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes in a roll on.</li>
      <li>I bought many of these and have passed them out to co-workers, family , and friends..</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to mix anything with this one, so I can just throw it in my purse.</li>
      <li>I use it more in the winter for battling germs.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m hack/cough free!!!</li>
      <li>but it is strong.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m really happy with that because I&#x27;ve been wanting to get rid of those for a long time!!!  :-)</li>
      <li>I carry this in my purse and it&#x27;s been great to have at sporting events where there is often only a port-a-john.</li>
      <li>Excellent all &#x27;round.</li>
      <li>This oil blend seems to be working great for us over the last month.&lt;br</li>
      <li>application is quick, clean and easy.</li>
      <li>This roll on is so user friendly.  </li>
      <li>Reviews were positive and the price much better</li>
      <li>If it helps stop one of our frequent colds I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
      <li>Only used a handful of times seemed good.</li>
      <li>If you are looking into some of the distributor oils this is an easy to find out if you&#x27;ll even like oils in the first place.</li>
      <li>I havent had a complaint and they have already contacted me just to make sure I am happy.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly from Plant Therapy.  </li>
      <li>It is so fast and easy.</li>
      <li>This is the first year without a lingering respiratory illness!</li>
      <li>It seems to me that there is nothing to loose since it smells better than most any plane, office or business.</li>
      <li>&amp; shipments are extremely quick too, was not expecting it so very soon!</li>
      <li>I applied the germ fighter to my feet right before bed.</li>
      <li>I ordered this last fall and have been pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>I love Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
      <li>By the first evening, the cough was minimal and by the next day, I felt great.</li>
      <li>so they are not as strong as other oils on the market, however coconut oil is fabulous for natural healing.</li>
      <li>I used this on my whole family this winter</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>How do you know if it&#x27;s really working?</li>
      <li>I was spending a LOT of money on a similar popular brand to help protect against all the ickys out there- especially during the winter months.</li>
      <li>When it was time to order more I researched other companies and found Plant Therapy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not getting sinus infections like I normally do, so it must be working.</li>
      <li>It is similar to thieves but they are distinct.</li>
      <li>I am new to EOs and after research I came across Plant Therapy.  </li>
      <li>I would rub this on their feet, and throat and chest, and usually by morning they were better.  </li>
      <li>Love this for &#x27;green&#x27; cleaning!</li>
      <li>My husband and I have been using this for several month with positive results and am going to be purchasing the 6-pack of Plant Therapy favorites.</li>
      <li>So far it has worked for me.</li>
      <li>This is the second time buying the Germ Fighter Synergy, but the first buying this one that&#x27;s already mixed with a carrier oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rather new to using essential oils.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it took a few days, but while others had colds and sickness that held on for weeks, we were better in a few days.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Helps with my allergies, colds and sinus problems.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Germ Fighter roll on to carry in my bag. I also keep one at home, along with Immune-Aid. I roll both onto my family prior to going out to dinner or run errands for immune support during flu season. We also diffuse the immune aid blend at home after we&#x27;ve returned from an outing.  I&#x27;m happy with the product and feel it works as well as some &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; oil company blends.</li>
    <li> I keep in my work bag for use in hospital. When exposed to so many germs in a hospital setting it is nice to have this product to roll on and has a nice pleasant smell.  We need all the protection against germs we can get especially as a health care worker. I would recommend all doctors and nurses, health care team members keep a bottle of this handy in their pockets while at work.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, easy roll on application.  So far it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> I keep one in my car and purse so I can use it when I run into sneezy, coughing people. Since I have been using this product in various forms, I have not had a cold or flu. I&#x27;ve taken several flights and sat by people (children) that were obviously ill and haven&#x27;t caught anything yet. Several of my friends have had similar experiences, even traveling to Nepal. It seems to me that there is nothing to loose since it smells better than most any plane, office or business. This time of year when traveling, partying and rushing, why take any chances? I simply rub it on a tissue and take long breaths or in a hurry I rub on my wrist or just inhale  from the bottle.</li>
    <li> Nice cinnamon smell, and not too overpowering. I use it in the office, because so many people come and just stop at my desk hacking and coughing. So far, I&#x27;m hack/cough free!!! Maybe I should share with the other co-workers.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE!  EASY TO USE!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this actually works like people claim that it does.  I just like the scent.</li>
    <li> I am new to EOs and after research I came across Plant Therapy.  Great Reviews and Outstanding products.  The Germ Fighter Synergy is one of my favorites, convenient, effective and smells wonderful.  I carry one one in my purse in case I forget to apply it before leaving home.  My husband and I have been using this for several month with positive results and am going to be purchasing the 6-pack of Plant Therapy favorites.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this oil for cold and flu season, but the way viruses go round summer and winter these days, I started using it as a precaution.  Haven&#x27;t been sick a day since.</li>
    <li> Received item fast and its great!!! thank you!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Only used a handful of times seemed good.</li>
    <li> I am using this and it has worked well to keep me healthy!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my purse. I work with preschool and the kids are constantly sick. This works great as a hand antibacterial and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I tried this on the bottom of my feet when I had a nagging cough. By the first evening, the cough was minimal and by the next day, I felt great. It arrived quickly from Plant Therapy.  I love that it comes in a roll on. Very simple to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and for myself - if I am near anyone who is sick or if I feel like i am coming down with something, I roll this on the bottoms of my feet and my lower back and it seems to fight off the germs!!  I also love their Germ Fighter esssential oil blend, which i use in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> I had been fighting a cold/sore throat for 3 weeks and could not get rid of it for anything. I applied the germ fighter to my feet right before bed. The next morning the sore throat/ tickle and cold were gone! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;ve been telling everyone I know to try this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it had the same ingredients as Thieves...  I love the scent (reminds me of fall) and wasn&#x27;t sure how well it was working for germ fighting... BUT... one thing it DID do was get rid of my skin tags!  I googled &amp;#34;Skin tag removal&amp;#34; (without thinking about essential oils) and one of the sites I came across said to put thieves on your skin tags at night before you go to bed for a few days and they will fall off.  So I rolled a little of this on my two skin tags last night and this morning one was gone... just a little red mark where it used to be.  And the other is smaller.  So I&#x27;m really happy with that because I&#x27;ve been wanting to get rid of those for a long time!!!  :-)</li>
    <li> Awesome oil! Really does help you not to get sick! I always get sick entering the gym. I put it on bottom of feet and my daughters when she goes into the kid care :) were the healthiest weve been</li>
    <li> No sickness in our household since her fighter/ thieves oil. Flu, pink eye, and who knows what else has been lingering around us; but this essential oil plant stops them all.</li>
    <li> I feel you will be amazed when you purchase this oil. If you are looking into some of the distributor oils this is an easy to find out if you&#x27;ll even like oils in the first place. Know these oils are cut with coconut oil so they are not as strong as other oils on the market, however coconut oil is fabulous for natural healing. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Works great! I use it on my entire family when I know we&#x27;ll be around germy places or have been exposed to others who are sick. It always works for us.</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy Essential Oils. This is the second time buying the Germ Fighter Synergy, but the first buying this one that&#x27;s already mixed with a carrier oil. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to mix anything with this one, so I can just throw it in my purse. I&#x27;m a huge believer in this Germ Fighter Synergy as when my husband and I felt like we were coming down with something, I rubbed it on our feet and we never ended up getting sick. Also, when my kids were sick with colds, I rubbed this on their feet and their symptoms quickly improved and their colds did not last nearly as long as they have in the past. I will always have this stuff on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly. How do you know if it&#x27;s really working? I&#x27;m not getting sinus infections like I normally do, so it must be working.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it! I am buying one for myself, husband, my grandmother... I love it.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t go to work without putting this on the bottoms of my feet.  I teach school and this oil is a must!</li>
    <li> Love this for &#x27;green&#x27; cleaning!</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite blend, not because it doesn&#x27;t work, but because its not my favorite oils in this blend. I use it more in the winter for battling germs. A great product from Plant therapy, They never disappoint!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather new to using essential oils. I was introduced to them at a gathering of friends for a presentation of another brand and I decided to try them.  When it was time to order more I researched other companies and found Plant Therapy. Reviews were positive and the price much better so I ordered a few varieties. I&#x27;ve used Germ Fighter almost daily and have made it through the winter without any illness even while working in a school health center where germs are plentiful. This is the first year without a lingering respiratory illness! I recently purchased the roller variety for travel and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is great, I keep it in my purse and when I&#x27;m around someone&lt;br /&gt;who seems sick, I rub it on my wrist and behind my ears.  I have allowed&lt;br /&gt;others to use it, and they say they feel better. Will keep this on my use list</li>
    <li> Well packaged and item was as described and what I expected. A good value.</li>
    <li> Perfect,&amp; ready, easy on the go! This oil works for us, I don&#x27;t care what anyone says--- definitely works! Using daily! &amp; shipments are extremely quick too, was not expecting it so very soon! Excellent all &#x27;round. Surely will order more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Very quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I carry this in my purse and it&#x27;s been great to have at sporting events where there is often only a port-a-john. It smells fantastic and makes me feel good that I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals on myself or my children.</li>
    <li> I was spending a LOT of money on a similar popular brand to help protect against all the ickys out there- especially during the winter months. I found the germ fighter to be just as good/ if not better. I bought many of these and have passed them out to co-workers, family , and friends.. they all love them.</li>
    <li> There are not a lot of instructions, but I did roll it on my skin where I had some scratches and they healed. And if I have a sore throat I roll it over my neck, but not sure it does anything. Has a pleasing scent and it is sort of comfy. I gave everyone in my family as a travel gift when we were having a family re-union. Convenient.</li>
    <li> My only complaint was the bottle came opened, and it seems to continue to leak. I purchased two more bottles and had no issues with those.</li>
    <li> rub it under the ear across throat when feeling a sore throat coming.</li>
    <li> This oil blend seems to be working great for us over the last month.&lt;br /&gt;The application is quick, clean and easy.</li>
    <li> But I hope it&#x27;s working. It is similar to thieves but they are distinct. I love how convenient this is to carry around and we use it all the time. In fact I think we need more. We live in Chicago and sick people feel the need to walk around infecting everyone. If it helps stop one of our frequent colds I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> I use germ fighter all the time when I am sick. Now I can take it with me everywhere I got because it is already diluted. It is so fast and easy. Plant Therapy products work great and are the best price on essential oils I have found. Recommend to use this product for sure!</li>
    <li> I ordered this last fall and have been pleased with this product.  Whenever we have had illness in the home this has been able to knock it out.  Sometimes it took a few days, but while others had colds and sickness that held on for weeks, we were better in a few days.  When my kids started to come down with a sore throat or runny nose I would rub this on their feet, and throat and chest, and usually by morning they were better.  I also diffused in the house when I knew there were sicknesses going around and kept the others from getting sick.</li>
    <li> Great when traveling.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my feet if I feel a cough and I put it in my humidifier tank and it makes the house smell amazing!! A few drops in each wash load helps kill germs in clothing as well.</li>
    <li> Use it daily. Great scent, though not so much a summer time scent.</li>
    <li> This roll on is so user friendly.  I already am a user of &amp;#34;thieves&#x27; the expensive version of this blend, and now I can afford to have a quality product in my purse.  Have roll on will travel.  I also bought a roll on for &#x27;energy synergy&#x27; and love it.  This company, Plant Therapy has provided A+ customer service.  I havent had a complaint and they have already contacted me just to make sure I am happy.  I think they should rename their business, Happy Therapy!</li>
    <li> Great brand. I use oils all the time.</li>
    <li> Smells good but it is strong. Love the roll on. I don&#x27;t know if this worked to keep me from getting sick but I traveled a third time across the country and this time, with this oil on the bottom of my feet, was the only time I didn&#x27;t get a sinus cold. Might also be the zinc I&#x27;ve been taking. But every little bit helps.</li>
    <li> I used this on my whole family this winter and we managed to avoid getting sick until this spring when I wasn&#x27;t using it!</li>
    <li> I was getting a sore throat and rubbed this on the outside. Woke up next morning with no pain in my throat. And bonus? My hubby said he really liked the way I smelled! LOL! :-)</li>
