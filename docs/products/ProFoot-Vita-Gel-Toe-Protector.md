### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best product I have found to keep my hammer toe from rubbing all  day  in my shoes.</li>
      <li>It protects my damaged toe perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Ideal product for me.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>These work nicely but roll them on and off...if you try to pull they will become mis-shapen and retain the mis-shapen form.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and hold their position for hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many but these are the best and always use on my big toes.</li>
      <li>and I simply love them.  </li>
      <li>These top protectors provided the needed cushion to my index toes to allow me to continue to workout on my TreadClimber.  </li>
      <li>and I had not been able to find anything  that was not too bulgy.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this item.  </li>
      <li>Worked well for about one week but easily got out of shape and wore holes in the protector.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to put on and not noticeable while wearing.</li>
      <li>Work well, plenty of room for my especially large toes.  </li>
      <li>These are fine &amp; do the job</li>

      <li>Toe protectors don&#x27;t seem to be as strong as old ones.</li>

<li> Wow, I can not cure the toe</li>
<li> WOW</li>
<li> have tried all the toe separators and cotton and wool separators, bigger shoes to accommodate all the remedies and then I discovered this little soft, spongy cover for that toe and Viola!</li>
<li> Did not last long.</li>
<li> They last for a very long time.  </li>
<li> The ones I bought in the store lasted a long time!</li>
<li> so I think they are expensive in that respect, but I find the protection worth the expense.</li>
<li> It does not require any fuss or tape or mess or meds, just slides over my sore toe</li>
<li> Waste of money..</li>
<li> So now I just slide this little Toe protector on, my socks, my shoes and I never have to ache or limp or give my toe another adjustment or thought!</li>
<li> Even my Podiatrist was not as helpful as this little Via-Gel!</li>
<li> Hard to get on hammer toes.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;effecting my walking, throws me off balance and creates my getting tired and unable to work or play as I want and need.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I found them difficult to use.</li>
<li> By the time you return the defective products the postal charges make it impossible to even break even.</li>
<li> Very disappointed !</li>

    <li> Took forever to get them. I found them difficult to use. No way for air to get to toes. Clammy.</li>
    <li> Work well, plenty of room for my especially large toes.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I think the product is over priced.&lt;br /&gt;I does work.</li>
    <li> The first one broke almost right away!  The ones I bought in the store lasted a long time!</li>
    <li> Toe protectors don&#x27;t seem to be as strong as old ones.</li>

    <li> Vita-Gel Toe protector is the solution for my Foot pain. Like Dominoes, one of my toes hurts and my whole foot hurts, which leads to&lt;br /&gt;effecting my walking, throws me off balance and creates my getting tired and unable to work or play as I want and need.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all the toe separators and cotton and wool separators, bigger shoes to accommodate all the remedies and then I discovered this little soft, spongy cover for that toe and Viola! Wow, I can not cure the toe but I can create a bed for that toe so I can get on with my buzy life. WOW It does not require any fuss or tape or mess or meds, just slides over my sore toe and away I go! So now I just slide this little Toe protector on, my socks, my shoes and I never have to ache or limp or give my toe another adjustment or thought! I have used this Vita-gel Toe Protector for the last year plus after spending money and time altering other toe separator products which were good products just not the quick and easy solution for my Toe problem.  Even my Podiatrist was not as helpful as this little Via-Gel! Thanks for listening, Cindy Sagar</li>
    <li> They fell apart within three days.</li>
    <li> ProFoot Vita-Gel Toe Protector&lt;br /&gt;Great product &amp; I use them all of the time.</li>
    <li> These are fine &amp; do the job</li>
    <li> Made skin redden and peel. Did not like. Waste of money..</li>
    <li> I have hammer toes and cannot wear shoes without them hurting my feet.  Vita-Gel Toe Protectors, over my toe, enables me to walk without pain.  I was introduced to them a couple of years ago and I simply love them.  What a relief!</li>
    <li> ordered for my mom and she loves them. she has hammer toe and it protects and keeps them from rubbing. Second time for me to order them.</li>
    <li> Did not last long. Hard to get on hammer toes.</li>
    <li> Worked well for about one week but easily got out of shape and wore holes in the protector.  Cost too much to have it wear out so fast.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this item.  I have a callus on the inside of my toe and I had not been able to find anything  that was not too bulgy.  I have ordered these several time.  They last for a very long time.  I will continue to order these because I have found nothing else that works as well.</li>
    <li> As a competitive tennis player my feet and toes take a beating. I&#x27;ve tried many but these are the best and always use on my big toes. Very comfortable and hold their position for hours.PR</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found to keep my hammer toe from rubbing all  day  in my shoes. They do only last a couple weeks through a couple washings so I think they are expensive in that respect, but I find the protection worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Two of the three I ordered was defective and split. I have been using this product for ten years prior with no complains. By the time you return the defective products the postal charges make it impossible to even break even. Very disappointed !</li>
