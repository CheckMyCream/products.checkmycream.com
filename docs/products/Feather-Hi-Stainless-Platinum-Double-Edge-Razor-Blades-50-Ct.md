<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Some people say these are too sharp, but I think they&#x27;re perfect.  They irritate my skin less because I don&#x27;t need to apply as much force to get the closeness I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> These get me baby&#x27;s bottom smooth in two passes tops.  I also have (if you can believe it) never nicked myself in a year of shaving with these blades.</li>
    <li> There was a learning curve. My husband doesn&#x27;t cut himself as much as he used to. Very sharp indeed.</li>
    <li> The best razor blades I have used so far. Also the most expensive blade I have used. But hey, its still cheaper than a Fusion cartridge, or whatever is popular these days!</li>
    <li> Very sharp razor blades that fit well within my Edwin Jagger safety razor. These blades are fantastic and much less expensive than the current trend of disposable blades.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp and awesome. I use them exclusively after trying out Derby and a couple of others. I&#x27;ll never switch.</li>
    <li> Got this blades fast. It&#x27;s really sharp and cost effective compared to regular Gillette</li>
    <li> Go old school and get a superb shave while savings hundreds of dollars a year! You cannot get a better shave using ANY of the current mufti-blade gimmick razors on the market today. I spend about $50 A YEAR using this product with an old school Feather Double Edge Shaving Razor (about $15) and get the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> These blades are to sharp for my skin,They really cut my face real bad this is the first time i have used them.I will give them away to my son...</li>
    <li> Referred to some as &amp;#34;Assassin Blades&amp;#34;, these are phenominal. I have used these blades in a couple different DE Razors and they deliver as advertised. Remember, the object of the game is to have the sharpest blade when you shave. Dull blades are what will make you bloody, not sharp ones. Have been averaging 6-7 quality shaves per blade with these depending upon your beard type. That can either go up or down along with technique. This will vary between individuals. I average 2 passes when I shave and my neck is tricky, so usually 3 passes including below the Adam&#x27;s Apple to be baby smooth. My face is 2 passes and I look like a teenager again. Great product along with great price point since they last as long as they do.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used Feather brand razor blades and I have to tell you...I do not understand the repuation that these blades have. You hear about them all the time in myth and lore about being the sharpest razor ever.  Well clearly not in my case. I havent cut myself once and the tug and pull my face is receiving on just two day old stubble is beyond brutal.  I have 49 blades left and will experiment with different creams water temps etc. But as of now this is the worst blade I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have used to date.  Super sharp.</li>
    <li> My favorite ones; i use one blade a week and they stay sharp for 5 good shaves. Other brands I tend to use 2 blades a week.</li>
    <li> Love these blades.  One of my favorite blades!  Best blade for the price!</li>
    <li> Great blades.  I used Merkur blades in my Merkur 34C, but these provide a closer shave.  Apply pre-shave oil and use light pressure and you won&#x27;t get cut. My employer has a clean-shaven policy.  These blades get close enough that I can shave every other day.  I&#x27;m sticking with Feather from now on.</li>
    <li> Feathers are the best razors in the world..!</li>
    <li> Sharp razors.  Inexpensive.  easy to use and dispose of.</li>
    <li> My husband is new to using a safety razor, just started 5 months ago, he loves it. At first we bought a multi pack of blades (like this http://www.amazon.com/RoyalShave-Double-Safety-Shaving-Multipack/dp/B0047ADBZ0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1430687707&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;safety+blades+multi+pack ) to try different brands and see which works best for his skin, I would recommend doing that since everyone&#x27;s face is different. These Feather blades ended up being his favorite though, they&#x27;re closer to the sharpest end of the spectrum. He uses one blade for 4-5 shaves.</li>
    <li> Favorite kind of blade. These or Derby for me. Feathers are a lot nicer on my face. I have sensitive skin and other brands seem to leave a lot of nicks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with double edge blades for over 20 years and I&#x27;ve found that feather blades are by far the sharpest blades I have ever used! Not sure how they get these things that sharp but I can get a single blade to last one week where as I can only get 4 to 5 days from other brands. I shave everyday so I need a blade that is sharp aand can last. These are the ones you need to buy!</li>
    <li> Very nice. I can easily get three shaves out of a blade and my beard is rather wiry.</li>
    <li> Only ones Iv ever used but they work fine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, just started back in April so take this with a grain of salt. Personally I&#x27;m on the fence about these blades. They are super sharp, no doubt about that, but that&#x27;s where I have an issue. Since my tecnique isn&#x27;t quite perfect yet, these give me wicked razor burn. I had to switch back to my Astra blades which are more forgiving for people still trying to master the art of wetshaving. So if you still don&#x27;t have the right angle down yet, or have sensitve skin like I do, then these may not be the blades for you. But I think for someone with more experience, these blades would be the best you can get.</li>
    <li> Got to be the best blade out there.I have tried 4 or 5 different ones.This one cuts the best and lasts longer than any i&#x27;ve tried.But everyone is different and should try varies blades to find what is best for you.</li>
    <li> These blades just do not work with my face. I simply cannot shave with getting multiple nicks and major razor burn, and I&#x27;m not even getting that good of a shave when I use them. I&#x27;m also using Astras currently, and I get better shave with those with no issue. Better yet, the Astras are half the price. Maybe they&#x27;ll work for you, but I would strongly recommend getting a sample pack before buying 50.</li>
    <li> I love shaving with these blades in my razor. These last longer than Gillette Mach 3 blades and are so much cheaper. The shave is really close but be careful because they will cut you if you apply too much pressure.</li>
    <li> best blades I have ever used. I was so scared about the &amp;#34;xtra &amp;#34; sharp blades but after the first couple times and learning to use these blades I can shave nick free.</li>
    <li> sharp razor are sharp</li>
    <li> No other blade even comes close. Ignore the scare tactics you might read from some other reviews. This blade glides effortlessly over my face with no drag or irritation. Using this blade there is no feeling of needing to add any pressure to the razor. Just let the blade rest against your skin and listen to the sound of a smooth cutting tool doing an excellent job. After you have completed your shaving ritual you will feel the smoothest skin you can imagine where a beard and stubble used to be. I change to a new blade weekly although I am sure I could get another three or four  days out of each blade.</li>
    <li> Wow, coming from the Personna blades, I can&#x27;t believe how much better these are. Definitely worth the money over the Personna&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great international shipping options.  Awesome product</li>
    <li> A quick review of feather DE razor blades And my thoughts and comments  http://youtu.be/nP3EhYTDYTI</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I wondered if I should actually get these blades. Since I was nicking myself daily with a more dull blade (Micro Touch One) that came with the razor I was afraid of looking like hamburger with the Feathers but bought them anyway. Finally mustered the courage to try them and - - - I haven&#x27;t nicked myself ONCE! NOT ONCE! I have no clue why some people seem to consider them just short of a facial murder weapon. They shave cleanly, even after letting my rather tough beard grow for several days and using a relatively cheap handle, and they  last a good while. HINT: Not much pressure or angle is needed to achieve a close shave. Maybe that&#x27;s your problem guys!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why these are so difficult to find in the US. This shipment came from Thailand. It was quick and exactly what was promised - at a good price - so I have absolutely no complaints with the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice of a DE razor blade is very personal, but you owe it to yourself to at least try Feathers. They definitely have a unique character of their own.</li>
    <li> If you shave daily, these are great.  Otherwise, you may want to use the Gillete Goal or Lord which are a little more forgiving and won&#x27;t burn your skin as much, letting you make more passes when you do shave.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Husband is very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Good value in the 50 pack.  Very sharp but, the reason for the 4-Star rating is that they only work for me for 3 shaves and others last longer and are a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> Good blades for a single blade razor. Shipped quick. What else can I say, really?</li>
    <li> The sharpest razor I&#x27;ve tried.  Produces a wonderful shave but take caution it will nick you up if you don&#x27;t know how to shave.  With this blade you must remember to let the weight of the razor and a smooth motion do the cutting.  If you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;presser&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll get a little cut up.  SO.....GREAT product but make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing.....</li>
    <li> I have tried various blades and have never some across anything quite like these Feather blades. They are defiantly the sharpest, and that (if your careful) will give you the best shave of your life. I&#x27;ve had a lot of issues with other blades tugging my stubble and just not quite preforming to my preference. Overall these blades are fantastic and will be the best complement to your shaving kit!</li>
    <li> I purchased a safety razor for my husband a few months ago.  Now wishing I&#x27;d done so years ago. He actually (finally!) enjoys shaving, since he&#x27;s no longer been dealing with razor burns.  I have very sensitive skin, so appreciate being close to him without getting hives due to irritating stubble.  He&#x27;s tried 3 different blades with his new Edwin Jagger Safety Razor.  The \\&quot;Feather Double Edge Blades\\&quot; won, hands-down.  A great investment, considering what we&#x27;ve been spending on Mach blades in bulk at Costco. The Feather blades purchased from this vendor shipped via air from Thailand, so took a little longer to arrive than most of our Amazon purchases--still well worth a little wait!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, as represented.</li>
    <li> The best shaving blade I&#x27;ve found. I have tried many others and so far, have always returned to Feather blades. If you are new to double edge blade shaving, be advised, these blades are SHARP! It may take a few shaves to adapt and develop your technique.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Came on time. Easy purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice, sharp blades for when I&#x27;ve gone several days without a shave.  They are quite aggressive.</li>
    <li> I love these blades, VERY sharp and consistent quality.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get here, but these give several great shaves from one blade. Worth the wait.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re tired of getting burned by high priced razors and blades these days, try these.  They have really given me a good comfortable shave.  Also look for the &amp;#34;Shaving Oil&amp;#34; together, you&#x27;ll love the shave..</li>
    <li> For my face, Feather is simply the best in each safety razor I have tried&lt;br /&gt;(Compared against the sample pack found here: http://www.westcoastshaving.com/DE-Blade-Sampler-Pack-Everything_p_292.html).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, Feather was also the best for this Straight Edge: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002PQZEHQ/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1_1?qid&#x3D;1426540758&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;pi&#x3D;AC_SY200_QL40&amp;keywords&#x3D;straight+razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised how much of a difference these razors made. I own a Muhle R41 and was using a Merkur blade at first followed by a Derby blade. I found that the Merkur irritated my skin so much that I had to send it back. The Derby blades were smoother, but still had the occasional tug. I was beginning to question the razor itself until I received these in the mail. Over night, I went from needing two passes with minor cuts and irritation to a single pass, no irritation/cuts, and baby butt smooth. To make this blade better, you can purchase 50 for the price of 10 Merkur blades. I highly recommend this product and would use this on any razor that I use in the future.</li>
    <li> These guys stay sharp and last a long time. Perfect for my setup. I use them for my head, and my face.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest blades that you will find for a reason. If you are a beginner, it behooves you to look elsewhere. If you are experienced, these things would shave the spidey-sense off Peter Parker.</li>
    <li> Good blades. I can usually get 2 shaves out of them. 50 blades will get me through a year, so at this price, you have to ask why you&#x27;re lining Gillette&#x27;s pockets with those blade attachments. A double edge razor won&#x27;t clog like the multi blade razors which is nice if you have thick, coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with these blades. I think they are good quality blades. After trying them I found out they were not the right type of blade for my skin type. I tried several other brands of the same type and none of them worked. So again, I have nothing against the blades. They are just not the right type for my skin.</li>
    <li> Okay I am a man in my 40s and just started shaving just a few years ago. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair and so it is on the thin side. I have been using several different types of blades. I have been with shaving with a safety razor for just a couple months. Having that said feathers are pretty good the are extremely sharp. The sharpness they provide is what I think a straight razor would provide.  Today for the first time I have&lt;br /&gt;nicked myself but I did not even feel it. The shave with this blade kind of reminds me of a shave with marker blade but a lot smoother and hardly any pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think that this is a very good plate perhaps for someone that has thick and full facial hair. I will stick by buying Astras, So far they provide the best shave for my type of facial hair.</li>
    <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades.Super Sharp.</li>
    <li> Excelent blades. Using them for over a year. Why pay $ 20 for four blades, when you have a better shave for fraction of cost.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> They glide right through my thick facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use some jojoba oil as a pre shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont buy any other blade, they&#x27;re the best hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and they last forever, seeya later disposable crappy razors!</li>
    <li> When reading this review, the Crystal Brand isn&#x27;t available anymore, but they are the exact same blade as Israeli Personna, so whenever you read Crystal, you can substitute Israeli Personna... or you can just cut and paste the revised link @ the bottom of this review to go right to Amazon&#x27;s page for the 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a 100-blade sampler pack a few years back, and tried every blade in it. No other blade compared to the Crystal Platinum blades (my friend tried every blade in the sampler also, and w/o me bringing it up, he said the same thing... that there was no comparison to the Crystals), so I went through 100 of the Crystal&#x27;s, and when it came time to buy more, I thought I&#x27;d try the Feather instead because it had such good reviews and it wasn&#x27;t in my sampler. I made the mistake of buying 30 Feathers rather than just trying 5... granted the Feathers are the second best blade I have used, but I will not be opening another pack of these... they&#x27;ll just go into my obsolete blade graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crystal Platinums shave noticably closer and don&#x27;t cut me like the Feather brand... I&#x27;ve been cut pretty bad by the Feathers, and I&#x27;ve even been cut on the flat of my cheak where I&#x27;ve never been cut by another blade. With the Crystals, I would only get nicked when I wasn&#x27;t paying attention at all. With the Feathers, I pay 3x as much attention (because I have too), and I still get cut about 10x as much as the Crystals... all for a lower quality shave than I was used to with the Crystals. It goes without saying that it is much more enjoyable and faster to shave with the Crystals... if I hadn&#x27;t tried all the other crappy brands out there I would have rated these a 1 next to the Crystals, but I know these are actually quite a comfortable blade compared to most. I shave with a Murker Classic, and my facial hair is pretty tough. Here&#x27;s a link to what I recommend for blades from my experience, but you may have to cut &amp; paste it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS...

    <li> I&#x27;ve got an extremely sensitive face and I&#x27;ve been through 2 or 3 sample packs now trying to find the most comfortable blades. I&#x27;ve tried them all (Astra, Wilkinson Swords, Gillette 7 O&#x27;clocks, Persona, etc)  and I always come back to the Feathers.  They are ultra sharp, don&#x27;t burn, and give a very close shave. For durability I&#x27;d say they are probably mid pack. I get about 3-4 shaves per blade. Excellent blade and hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> The best DE blades available.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best i have used. They cut through like a warm knife through butter. My face feels better after shaving. Other blades feel more like sandpaper compared to these blades. Not to mention it saves a look of money versus using cartridge blades. Written by Gaylene&#x27;s husband...</li>
    <li> Best blades made period !</li>
    <li> Great blade! I use this in my 34c, haven&#x27;t had any issues. Blade is nice and sharp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades since I first started shaving, they&#x27;re great. I can have 3 days worth of stubble and it comes right off in one pass with these. I actually prefer a slightly less sharp blade for my Merkur 35c, which is a heavy razor, but these seem to shave well with any weight.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave and lots of them.  Just need to rinse thoroughly after each shave.  Don&#x27;t believe a the other posting about being too sharp and cutting yourself.  I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The only blade I use anymore, and I&#x27;m not looking back.</li>
    <li> They are the sharpest blades available, last a good 4 - 5 shaves (depending on your beard type), and perform very consistently. The seller provided excellent feedback but the order did take a while to get to the States...plan ahead but the price was hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Great shave that saves money too.</li>
    <li> great blades hold a great edge</li>
    <li> These are the best blades available.</li>
    <li> feather blades are very sharp but i wouldnt say a whole lot sharper than any of the other blades. shaving with a safety razor is way better than shaving with the mainstream cartridge contraptions no matter which blade you choose</li>
    <li> Best blades on the market.</li>
    <li> One of my longtime favorite blades. Precision made and extraordinarily sharp compared to other blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razors.  After talking about it for a while my wife bought me the razor that is pitched by the pawn shop guy on TV.  It came with cheap razors which seemed to do OK.  But I was never really sold on the quality of the shave I got.  When those ran out I tried these Feathers, and it made all the difference.  The cheaper razors felt like they were scraping across my face hacking through my beard.  These feather razors are so much sharper.  Almost no effort needed, and you don&#x27;t get that scraping feeling or that &amp;#34;snick&amp;#34; sound as it cuts the hair.  As far as longevity, I have a thick beard, so I only use a blade twice.  But the cost difference between these blades and the cartridges makes it so I don&#x27;t even mind changing them after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these feathers because of all the positive reviews about them, and was not disappointed!</li>
    <li> Extremely Sharp, no tug.  A shaving revelation to switch to a DE razor from a cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp and deliver an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Why did I ever try another razor blade for my Merkur? These blades are where it is at!!  When I first started shaving with a DE I used Derby blades which were great for me.  After months of improving my technique and lathering capabilities I decided to step up to the Feather blades and I am sure glad I did. They are smooth and super sharp.  I get the same results in 2 passes as I did with 4 passes with a Derby Blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every person is different when it comes to blades but before you settle on a brand try these!!</li>
    <li> If you do double edge shaving, you&#x27;ve tried feathers. Love em or hate em is the standard review - I, for one, love them. Sharp as hell, last a long time with my facial hair and shaving routine, and overall a great value. If you have an adjustable (I.E. fat boy), turn it down a notch or two the first shave, these blades are wicked sharp.</li>
    <li> best blade you can buy. Sharpest one for sure. Worth the money for very close shave.</li>
    <li> Super sharp!! These are the best.</li>
    <li> Best blades I have ever tried. Yes you can cut yourself.  Get a good lather, don&#x27;t rush, don&#x27;t use any pressure, cut at the right angle, PAY ATTENTION... You&#x27;ll be fine. Buy the 50 pack and forget about it for 6-12 months.</li>
    <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> These are the ones. Tried a dozen different types of blades, was wary at first due to some comments about them being &amp;#34;dangerously sharp.&amp;#34; Feel stupid for actually listening to them. Seriously, you want your blades as sharp as possible to avoid cuts. I will never go back to a different blade now.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, cheap, the only way I&#x27;ll buy Razor Blades</li>
    <li> I shave 5 to 6 days a week because I&#x27;m in the military. I can use 1 blade a week! This pack will last me nearly a year! You can&#x27;t beat that. I think I&#x27;m on about month 6 now and couldn&#x27;t be happier not buying those expensive disposables anymore. Even those shave &amp;#34;clubs&amp;#34; can&#x27;t beat this. Do yourself a favor, get a good safety razor and these Feathers, oh and a decent shave soap and badger brush. The cheap brushes for around $15 work just fine and the Propraso soap is great. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Been using these blades for a couple of years now and they are super sharp for my very thick and coarse beard. They are probably the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve used but could be a little rough.</li>
    <li> These are the only blades that I purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that they&#x27;re made in Japan and platinum coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sharpness is unparalleled and the shave is pretty close to perfect.</li>
    <li> I feel like they are not sharp after one use. but their cheap</li>
    <li> My husband and myself both truly enjoy using this blades. What a Big difference in price from your other blades. We both went back to old school using double edge razors! Saving money..</li>
    <li> Sharp.  I get about 7 shaves out of a blade.</li>
    <li> They are indeed sharp. Just be sure to moisten and lather up.</li>
    <li> Sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Original&lt;br /&gt;The Yellow Cover Version&lt;br /&gt;Best that I have had the honor of using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For use with your standard Double Edge Razor</li>
    <li> Unlike, perhaps, most men I actually enjoy the ritual of shaving.  I switched from conventional &amp;#34;shaving systems&amp;#34; with their half dozen blades in a cartridge and eye-popping prices per cartridge years ago and experimented with everything from cut-throat razors, to dozens of safety razor offerings.  These blades from Feather, are without a doubt the sharpest and best blades you can buy.  Scalpel sharp. So sharp that I stopped using them for a time because I couldn&#x27;t seem to stop making my face bleed every morning.  More experimenting ironed out the problem. Shaving post shower when your face is supple and super-hydrated. Using a super rich shaving cream. (L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Crene A Raser CADE is a bit pricey but worth it) And using shorter strokes. End result is a silky smooth, clean feeling shave. There are less sharp blades I like because they&#x27;re less menacing, but I found myself needing to lather and shave twice. Feather&#x27;s do the job with one pass and treated with respect I no longer nick myself as before I used them properly. They seem to last longer also, though I generally use them for 2 or 3 shaves at most before replacing them. Highly recommended and worth the slightly extra cost.</li>
    <li> Made a great Fathers day gift</li>
    <li> I love these blades always a great shave just don&#x27;t be in a hurry :)</li>
    <li> The finest and sharpest blades on the planet. I will not use anything else, ever.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blades as they offer the closest shave I have experienced yet. I started wet shaving with a safety razor a year ago, and got sample packs of many different blades before settling on Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is wisdom out there to not start shaving with Feathers due to their sharpness and the chance of cuts/nicks. However, other blades I have used pale in comparison to the quality and consistency of Feathers. I say go ahead and start with the best quality blades possible even if you are a beginner. With little to no pressure and effort, these blades will give you a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest DE blades that I keep in my rotation and I never have any issue with them. They always provide close, smooth shaves.</li>
    <li> They are great and I get a nice shave every time</li>
    <li> The one thing about these blades is that they&#x27;re sharp and each blade last about 10 shaves (two weeks for me), so for the price of a 4-pack of Gilette fusions, I&#x27;ll have clean, sharp shaves for close to two years! Economize where and when you can, but these are a steal and are worth more than the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is excellent, so is the packaging.</li>
    <li> Consistently the best blade fo me.</li>
    <li> Used these for my first DE shave at advice from a friend . I have no other blades to compare them to but holy cow. 10x better shave then my Mach 3. They are sharp you can tell the moment the blade hits your skin. Gives a VERY close shave. I have a  tough beard and somewhat sensitive skin so these are perfect for me. A bit of irritation but I am still getting used to DE shaving , and nothing a good after shave balm can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best blades I have ever shaved with in my double-edge safety razor.  I&#x27;ve tried many different blades and none match the sharp cutting edge of these Feather blades.  I doubt that I will ever be able to find a better blade.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, great product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are good blades, don&#x27;t last more than 2 uses, but good blades.</li>
    <li> What can I say? They&#x27;re Feathers. Some of the best, sharpest blades you can get. They work just as they should, and I find myself having a better shave with no irritation with these blades- so 10/10 will continue buying these.</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving with a DE razor and I love it, however I didn&#x27;t see the point in using other inferior blades before going to the best. Many reviews say to learn to shave with other DE razor blades then graduate to the feather blades but I shaved twice with other blades that came free with my razor then ordered the feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I cut myself maybe once every two shaves but these are not going to sever your internal jugular just by looking at them at wrong angle as some other reviews might have you believe. If you treat the blade with respect, use a good shave cream (I use the poraso), and take your time, you won&#x27;t find a better DE blade in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I use each blade for approx 4 shaves and I could probably use each blade for a few more shaves, but with the under 10 cents that I pay for a blade, why risk it? These should be a definite buy for any person getting in to DE shaving.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp, thin and give you the best shave ever. A three pass shave with these blades will keep you smooth at least 36 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed my other blades out. I will say this, get your technique down before buying these.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!! Took three weeks to arrive but worth the wait!!!!! I would highly recommend. I don&#x27;t shave everyday but these blades unlike disposables give me a close, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This many razors will last me several years and they&#x27;re all amazingly sharp. How can I give this anything other than 5 stars?</li>
    <li> Sharp!! exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> The only blades I can use.  Super sharp at a great price.</li>
    <li> Absolute best razor blades available. Extremely sharp with zero pull.</li>
    <li> I use these blades with a Mercur adjustable razor.  They are very sharp so I start on the lowest setting and increase a little each day.  I have been using these blades for some time and have been getting at least two weeks of decent shaves from a blade.</li>
    <li> Not sure these are the best but they are sufficient and I would recommend them to anyone. The protective paper on my lot is stuck to the blade and this makes it dangerous to remove.</li>
    <li> The blade Sharp, light, and rust free.  Give truly close shave.  Easy to clean, just rinse with water and you are done.  Each blade lasts through about 10+  shaving sessions and therefore much more economical then the fancy Gillette/Schick brands shavers</li>
    <li> These are by far the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I will never try another brand again! With the Feather razor, I can literally let my razor do the work, instead of having to &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; other razor&#x27;s across my face to shave…</li>
    <li> When I first considered trading in my disposable razors for a double edge razor I did my requisite research right here on Amazon. These were what I settled on. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to, as far as other brands of double edge blades, but I do like them better than any of the many variations of disposables that I have used. I get them delivered in my Amazon care package (Subscribe &amp; Save) every two months. I never have to worry about running out. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered the assortment of blades and decided to use the Feather blades last because everything I have read said they were not for beginners/amateurs.  Well I have finally made it to the Feather blades and all I can say is WOW!  These things are sharp and glide over my face like fingers over a piece of oiled glass.  I will not be buying any other type of blade from this point forward.  Sure you pay a little more per blade but when you think about it you are still saving a ton of money in the long run compared to Mach 3 or fusion cartridges..</li>
    <li> last over two weeks.. have not even been nicked once yet</li>
    <li> I recently converted to double edge blades after many years with electric . I tried Derby , Wilkinson and then the Feather blades. They are by far the sharper of the three and hold an edge longer. Use them with care as a careless move can cause discomfort but for a close shave this is my choice.</li>
    <li> Almost no drag with these even after several shaves. At this rate the 50 I purchased should last well over a year.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know, you should!</li>
    <li> Superb Blades - no doubt and no question about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I use Personna Medical Prep Blades which IMO are just as good and are made in the UUSA.</li>
    <li> Too sharp for me and the combination of a razor with medium aggressiveness turned out to be a mistake for me. YMMV.</li>
    <li> They give my husband a nice, close shave.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades for my Weber safety razor.</li>
    <li> I use a Merkur 1904 model and these are the only blades I will use.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different, but if you are looking for extremely sharp blades that consistently offer a smooth shave, you will not be disappointed with these.</li>
    <li> Shipped from Indonesia, took about a 3+ weeks to arrive in a cardboard sleeve with funny elephant postage stamps. Very sharp, have used these in my safety razor for some time now. These razors last a long time, and will cut you without you feeling a thing! Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Always Sharp, the best blades to shave with. Just be careful to have a light touch with these blades or you will nick yourself.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest double edge blades on the market (that I know of).  I have particularly rough/course facial hair, and these blades last a few shaves. with every other blade, I can only use it once.  the sharper the blade, the less likely it is you will cut yourself, assuming your technique is good.  Definitely worth the higher price in my book; highly recommended.  For starters, you may want to us a less sharp blade to begin with and work your way up to the Feather.</li>
    <li> I personally feel these razors are overrated, they get the job done, but aren&#x27;t magical.</li>
    <li> Really fine blades.  Last a good long time.</li>
    <li> Quality blade that works.</li>
    <li> When  you put a sharp pencil to shaving costs, a double edge razor can save you considerable money.  Extend that savings over a year or even longer, and you are talking serious cash.  I use these in my vintage Merkur razor, and the results are not only faster, but closer that all the expensive multiple blade razors that cost a fortune.  Very sharp, but I have no problem with nicks or cuts with the quality Merkur Razor (look for them used on ebay). I just wet my face, place a dab of Geo. F. Trumper&#x27;s rose shaving cream (Amazon sells) in my hands, rub together, then rub on my face.  Then put my Mekur to it.  All done in 2 minutes or so.  Go back to old school, and it&#x27;s still the best way to shave, and fun.</li>
    <li> I went through a trial pack of various blades, which included these.  These gave me the most comfortable and closest shave, so I bought more!  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Best of the brands I have tried so far. Very sharp, and last several shaves more than most.</li>
    <li> Best blades money can buy!!</li>
    <li> Very sharp.  Love these blades.  As long as you aren&#x27;t a barbarian and know what you&#x27;re doing, you shouldn&#x27;t cut yourself.  There is honestly allot of hype about these being so brutal.  It&#x27;s all skill really.  But if you have skill these get the job done.  They are VERY sharp. I like them.  Can&#x27;t say they are smooth though, but I haven&#x27;t had enough experience yet to make that determination.</li>
    <li> I have used these for about a year now and I love how sharp the blades are. They don&#x27;t have any trouble cutting through my beard. Beginners beware if you apply too much pressure you will cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Rolls Royce of Blades.  You need to respect these, they are the sharpest razor blades out there.  In the right razor, with the right creme or soap and the right technique you will get no better shave.  If you are in a hurry, try a blade that isn&#x27;t as sharp.  My technique got much better using these.  They are not forgiving just an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great price. I use each razor about 3 times.  Wish I started using these years ago, would have saved big bucks vs. using disposable razors.</li>
    <li> My favorite of approximately 5 brands tried.  Sharper than most, so best reserved for use after using a less sharp blade when/if first using a single-blade.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Good bargain. I don&#x27;t get nicked/cut with these blades.  And they&#x27;re inexpensive enough that I change them after every 2nd-3rd day.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. I use one every time I shave. Great deal since buying traditional razors can cost so much. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I tried many different blades and this was my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;They seem to last me about 7-10 shaves before I have to replace it, compare that&lt;br /&gt;to the disposable blades and they are cheap to use!</li>
    <li> After over a year of shaving exclusively with Astra Superior Platinum blades, I decided to try the Feathers.  They are certainly very sharp, but I felt like they gave me a rougher shave after just a few uses than the Astra blades do.  For three times the price of an Astra, I do not think I will reorder them when I&#x27;ve finished with my 50 count.  A nice blade, but not worth the inflated price.</li>
    <li> I tried two other brand of blades with good ratings on amazon, l though they were pretty dam good until I  try the feather brand of blades and trust me like others have said  here these are the  sharpest blades and they are  worth the extra cash.</li>
    <li> I think I have enough blades to last the rest of my life with this purchase! I am a woman who got sick and tired of buying expensive replacement heads for my plastic razor so I bought a great Parker 65R razor and these replacement blades. I love these blades. They shave clean and close and are very smooth. They also last a really long time, unlike the expensive replacement razors and heads which become dull after just 2 or 3 shaves. A great product at a great deal!</li>
    <li> So far I had loved these blades but to my surprise I found that the quality of the blades was inconsistent. Most of the blades are perfect but at least one out of ten feels edgy and not sharp enough, which was pretty disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the quality is very good and the blades very sharp, maybe I just encountered a batch that suffered from poor quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it 4.5 out of 5 but I can&#x27;t give half stars.</li>
    <li> Got into wet shaving very recently. Figured I could save my face from razor burn while saving some money in the long run.  I bought the Feathers very soon after I bought the original kit, and candidly it took a little getting used to. I&#x27;d been shaving with cartridge razors for the better part of a decade and had become habituated to applying a ton of pressure and yanking the blades down my face (in case you had wondered why I got a lot of razor burn).  The Feathers were not so forgiving when I took this approach and- as you might expect- nicks and cuts very quickly presented themselves. That said, once I learned how to glide the razor down the side of my face using the weight of the handle they worked like a dream. I had seen words &amp;#34;like butter&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;shaving with a katana&amp;#34; used by other reviewers when describing the experience and honestly that&#x27;s not far off the mark. I&#x27;ll add my own contribution by saying that it&#x27;s almost like the hair isn&#x27;t there in the first place. It&#x27;s a strange yet satisfying feeling once you get it right. Finish off the process with a good styptic pen/alum bloc and some quality aftershave lotion and you&#x27;ll have a face that&#x27;s smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Great product overall, definitely plan on re-upping once I run out.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Feather razor and these blades to go with it.  I have been very satisfied with the shave that I get from these blades.  Being able to switch out blades frequently means that every shave is with a like new blade.  Very satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that they come in 5x plastic containers of 10 blades each, and each blade is individually wrapped in paper.  This makes it very easy to bring with when traveling, and also disposal of the razors is very easy as I just put the old blade into the wrapper of the new blade, and then I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting it in the trash.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get any better than these. You get an uber close and comfortable shave with feather. I simply love these blades since I transitioned to DE shaving a few months ago never going back to cartridge blades again.</li>
    <li> I used to use shark razor blades because they were free with the razor, but those ran out, so I tried these.  They are much sharper(I learned the hard way), as you can tell by reading the other reviews, but they also last much longer too.  I haven&#x27;t had to change my blade yet after 4 shaves, but my hair is not very thick at all.  I bought 50 of them, so this will last me for many years to come.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Very,very sharp Gives a smooth shave. I was a little concerned about how these would do on my skin after hearing all the warnings about how sharp they are but I had no problems and they cut the wire like hair on my face very nicely. I shave every day but weekends and so far I can get about 5 shaves before it feels like they are getting dull Give a pack a try and you will probably like them</li>
    <li> These blades are nice and sharp. Be aware, if you&#x27;ve used a dull blade before you WILL cut yourself.  Not that it really hurts or anything, but you&#x27;ll know when you are doing your after shave ritual. I&#x27;ve used Shark Blades, Merkur Blades, and Astra, and by far these are the sharpest and longest lasting.  I only keep a blade in for 3 triple pass shaves and the sharpness of this blade at the 3rd shave is equal to the Shark&#x27;s at 1st shave. I use with a Merkur HD, Taylor of Old Bond Street Shave soap, perfect shave.</li>
    <li> I will preface my review by saying that shaving is very subjective, what works for one person doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for another, but there is a reason these are regarded as the premier blades on the market.  They are simply the best.  Do a quick online search and you will turn up pages of people singing the praises of these.  I have tried lots of blades, including Astra, Bluebird, Derby, and numerous Gillettes, and the Feather blades are by far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp.  Like crazy, unbelievably sharp.  I read that before I tried them and didn&#x27;t quite believe the hype, but it is true.  They take no effort to cut hair or skin, but you shouldn&#x27;t be scared to use them if you grasp the concept that more pressure doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean better shave.  They are probably the most expensive of all the DE blades, but even at 32 cents a piece I can get a years worth of the finest shaving blades for around 30 bucks.  Take that, Mach 3!</li>
    <li> If Hattori Hanzo were commissioned to make a DE razor blade, these are what he would deliver. They don&#x27;t last as long as others, but they are able to slice down my offending whiskers like so many Deadly Viper Assassination Squad members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best shave I have ever gotten has been with the following setup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dr. Bronners Peppermint Soap Liquid with a washcloth to scrub my face clean&lt;br /&gt;- A little Proraso Pre Shave Cream&lt;br /&gt;- These blades</li>
    <li> Very nice blades. As all of the reviews I read before purchasing these blades said they are very sharp and holds a great edge. Blades usually only last me 3 shaves but these blades are up to 7 shaves and still going strong still extremely sharp.  Absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> Tried using wilkinson and big box offbrand name razors and i just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. With these razors i get a very close, tug free shave every time, and i happen to have pretty thick facial hair growth. These are the only razors i use.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Very sharp blades! Can&#x27;t go wrong with these blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to wet/DE shaving, and I have tried a few different blades at this point.  I have dense coarse dark facial hair which grows very fast (i.e. I have a  9am shadow).  I was sold on my 1st shave with these.  This blade cut through my hair like a hot knife through butter....No tug back, no nicks.  These blades are surgical sharp.  I also appreciate that you can dispose of the blades in the same pack you are using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather is the only blade you need to use. Period.</li>
    <li> Closest shave yet with since I switched to shaving with a shavette. Theses things are very sharp. I wouldn&#x27;t start with these blades if you are new to this. But they are not so dangerous that you should avoid them too long either. I&#x27;ve been cut enough by dull blades that this is a welcome change. I won&#x27;t be switching back any time soon.</li>
    <li> These are great. I haven&#x27;t used many other brands yet, but they last and leave no irritation on my face.</li>
    <li> These blades last me for 50 to 70 shaves before I decide to replace them. My beard is quite tough, I have to let the shave soap soak for a couple of minutes prior to shaving. No other blade gives me this comfort or longevity of use. Combined with my Edwin Jagger razor I get 50 to 70 comfortable shaves for about 28 cents per shave. I can not beat this price or satisfaction of quality and comfort with anything else sold to shave with. I bought a couple hundred of these blades to last me till the end of my life if need be. They beat spending 8 dollars or so for one of those foolish multi blade razors that last about 2 weeks.  Had my 70th birthday last month (April 22). Back in 2013 I criticized a young man who said he could hear the blade cutting individual hairs.  I stated that he must be super sensitive or overly critical. .. Nope!  With my new hearing aids plugged into my head, shaving sounds like someone dragging a stick over a concrete side walk. Sorry that I criticized the young man.  Wish my ears worked as well as his.

    <li> The best safety razor you can buy!!!!</li>
    <li> These are the best blades available</li>
    <li> Long lasting. I&#x27;ve been using them now for several months with no complaints. Fit perfect and easy to change out.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has used Feather Blades stay with Feather Blades. Top quality baby smooth finish never used or found a better blade.</li>
    <li> I was initially suspicious to see these razors will show up in a very small envelope packed with shreds of Chinese-printed newspaper.  There&#x27;s a very thin clear wrapper around the razor package, and a little pull-string to unwrap (just like a pack of chewing gum).  Inside, each razor is very carefully individually wrapped.  Once out of the package, the razors are absolutely the sharpest, thinnest razors you have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband swears by these razors.  After 20 years of disposable razors and electric razors all resulting in ingrown hairs and razor burn, he finally switched to these and has seen an incredible change in his skin over the last year.  No more burn or ingrown hairs, and even an improvement in blemishes!!  If you have sensitive skin and issues shaving, these are absolutely worth a try!</li>
    <li> excellent and have bee using it for more than 2 years.. tried other brands but nothing is comparable to feather</li>
    <li> these are the rolls royce of razor blades. very sharp and smooth.they are a little pricey for a double edge blade,but to me they are worth it.i just dont know why you cant find these blades from a U S vendor.it seems a bit silly to have to wait a month to get such a small  package from anywhere in this day and age. for those new to  shaving like a man,ha ha, dont be afraid of the impending self sacrifice and blood letting described in many of the other reviews. relax take your time and let the razor do the work. these are great blades.</li>
    <li> These are fantasticly sharp blades and I am glad to have purchased them!  I have run through two blades so far and wont need to restock for a while.</li>
    <li> Definitely the sharpest blades I own. Maybe too sharp (maybe I&#x27;m lacking skill) as I get nicks here and there vs no nicks with the Personna Blues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using the 50 I bought. Lesson learned, buy a sampler pack.</li>
    <li> Best Blades you can buy.</li>
    <li> Way better than the Merkurs</li>
    <li> The best blades you can buy</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blades. I have very a very coarse beard and tend to go through blades fast. With these blades I can make a blade last at least 2 shaves longer than with the others I&#x27;ve tried (derby, astra, sword, ect.). The blade are in 5 per pack plastic box and individually wrapped in wax paper. The boxes also have built-in spent blade storage. I use a merkur slant on head and face most days. I can get 3-5 complete shaves per blade. I also have never found a dud blade like I have with other blades, not sure if luck or better qc at feather.&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> sharp but not to aggressive. maybe if your a green horn and your technique a&#x27;int quite there yet this might nick u up. but since ive been de shaving since 16 these just are the best. samurai sharp and consistent.</li>
    <li> lots of razor blade brands, yet feel I choose the most oustanding in results.  Each blade individually wrapped with a clever way of disposing of the worn/used blade.  It cuts  well; I give each blade 6-7 shaves.  If I&#x27;ve prepared the beard well, the Feather responds to my satisfaction.  I use a shave oil rather than a soap thereby avoiding clogging my razor and dulling the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Let the weight of the razor do the cutting and avoid pressing the blade into your sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased these after purchasing a sample pack of blades that contained many different brands and makes of double-edged razors. The Feather blades provided the best shave, with the least irritation, and as an added bonus seemed to last the longest (4 to 5 shaves) of any of the other blades I had tried. For the people who complain they are &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; sharp, I wonder if they are properly using their safety razor. Albeit, I&#x27;ve only been using a safety razor for a few months, I&#x27;ve yet to cut myself. Be patient, and go-over your face twice with a light touch and you should be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> After trying a few brands of blades, I came across various reviews indicating that Feather is the sharpest available.  They are simply superb, and make for an unbelievably close, comfortable shave.  After having prepared your beard with a good quality shaving oil &amp; cream (I really like Geo F. Trumpers), you will get an exceptional shave with no bumps, pulling, tugging, etc.  Some reviews indicate that Feathers are harsh; I have not found that to be the case.  However, all beards and faces are different.  These definitely work for me, and they are now the only brand I use.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic razors.  I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and by all the reviews I&#x27;ve read, feather blades are the best.  After using three different razors, I concur with the other reviews that Feather is the best.</li>
    <li> I get a couple of uses but these can be re sharpened on glass. I would recommend these as they are cheaper than using a multiple blade set.</li>
    <li> I recently re-started using my old Safety Razor having grown tired of my Norelco and razor-burn, not to mention the ridiculous cost for new blades and parts. I saw the reviews for Feather and took a chance. They are very nice blades. I get about one week of use from one blade and flip it over at mid-week to even the wear. Very smooth shave with brush and Creamo shave cream. Almost as good as a Straight Razor. I understand Feather make Straight Razors and I hope to give them a try in the future. Note: I have Essential Tremor in my hands and chose this method of shaving as a form of therapy to get better control as the condition has worsened with age. Very therapeutic and completely relaxing.</li>
    <li> This is the best and sharpest blade</li>
    <li> Very sharp. So, be careful. Excellent blades. I can get 3 or 4 shaves from each blade.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Everyone seems surprised that these blades are sharp. Yes, they&#x27;re sharp - razor blades are supposed to be sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what other reviewers have written, these razors can NOT split the atom, nor do they contain mythological super powers capable of cutting a hole into the space-time continuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this may come as a surprise to some, when you shave, you want a sharp blade.</li>
    <li> These are the real deal.  I love Feather blades!</li>
    <li> Sharpest blades you can find</li>
    <li> If you use double edge razor blades, you have to at the very least try feather blades. I don&#x27;t get a better shave from any other blade. They are the sharpest I have ever used, and I can use them at least 4 times before throwing them away.</li>
    <li> I went from Derby to Wilkinson&#x27;s sword to Feather.  These blades are the best I&#x27;ve used.  They are the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve used, and they make shaving even more enjoyable.  They tug so much less than the prior blades.  While these are sharp, I do not worry about cutting myself (several other reviewers commented on this fear due to the blades&#x27; sharpness).  They are very manageable.  I will certainly be ordering more.  FYI, I use these in an Edwin Jagger DE89.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Merkur razor for about 1.5 years. Maybe I&#x27;m just used to shaving with a dull blade by my previous pack of 10 blades last lasted me the entire time! Just ordered more because they are awesome, shave so much closer than a Gillette, etc and far less expensive too. I keep some disposables for air travel but otherwise wouldn&#x27;t consider giving my my safety razor. Feather blades are just incredible. Made in Japan for what it&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ve used German blades too. I cannot tell a difference between the two.</li>
    <li> Feathers are by far the sharpest DE blade on the market.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what you throw at this blade it will hack it off.  Unfortunately being the sharpest blade on the market, it is not the smoothest.  I&#x27;ve found that this was way to sharp for my face and I need to stick to crystals and Gillette Platinums.  However, if you have tough skin and a blue beard (it&#x27;s a thing), then these blades may be perfect for you.  Just not if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These are the real deal. Sharpest blades out there. Period. 4 stars due to the fact that despite how much respect I give these blades (they DEMAND respect) I always ALWAYS end up with a nick or two. BBS in two passes every time...</li>
    <li> Comes from Taiwan, so delivery is slow.  Other than that, the razors themselves are fantastic. I&#x27;ve never had a better shave than with with feathers.</li>
    <li> My DE razor is not overly aggressive, so I wanted a very sharp blade to use in it. After trying a few different manufacturers, I settle on the Feathers and have never looked back. I easily get 4-5 shaves out of each blade and since I only shave every second day, this pack gives me a year of blades for an incredibly low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just know that, if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving or a DE, these blades are very sharp and may not be the best brand for those who are brand new to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> With other blades, I get razor issues on my neck (ingrown hairs especially).  These are sharp enough that it cuts the hair cleanly and I do not get those issues with these.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the extra money vs. the other blades, for me.</li>
    <li> Great blades. As good as any.</li>
    <li> definitely not the sharpest blades out there</li>
    <li> These are by far the highest quality blades out there. They are very sharp and hold their edge well. I have very thick beard hair and these hold up much better than other brands. Other popular brands will only last me 1-2 shaves before they are to dull to use but these last 5-6 shaves.</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s my favorite type of blades and the only ones that I use. I recommend to anyone that likes sharp blades.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest blades I have tried and I get about one or two shaves more out of them than others.  I have a bunch of Astras I have to use up and a few Bluebirds but it&#x27;s Feathers for me from now on.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These blades are amazing. The only problem I&#x27;ve had involves the fact that I had some minor imperfections in my skin from the ol&#x27; Mach 3. Slightly inflamed hair follicle? Gone. That thing that looked like a zit? Gone. My skin is now smoother  than ever, I&#x27;m pretty sure these are sharp enough that if I&#x27;m ever found dead in the bathroom with my throat cut, it means I probably sneezed at the wrong time.</li>
    <li> About the same as other blades.</li>
    <li> These are my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; blades. Great shave with these blades.</li>
    <li> Outstanding blade! I&#x27;ve tried a sample pack of five different makes. Feather out-shaved them all. Shark brand was a close second. All others are not worth a mention. I found that using the weight of the razor on the blade with little added pressure gives a cleane shave. My beard is not coarse, so I can get up to 6 shaves before having to replace the blade. So I ordered fifty more through Amazon. If the USA made a blade like this, I wouldn&#x27;t be buying from Japan.</li>
    <li> Best value for the price.</li>
    <li> Sharpest blades you will find.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell you why but Red Persona are better</li>
    <li> Better than any other blade I have used in my Mercur.</li>
    <li> Great blades! I was using Merkur brand, and these just arrived and I have to say, they are the best I&#x27;ve used yet! Very sharp, for a nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I own/use:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;Proraso shaving soap - Eucalyptus and Menthol</li>
    <li> Super sharp.  These blades work very well for me so I decided to invest in bulk!  Very happy that I did!</li>
    <li> After using this batch of blades for a while now I am&lt;br /&gt;wondering if something is wrong.  This batch is no where&lt;br /&gt;near as sharp as previous Feather blade purchases I have&lt;br /&gt;made. I have not changed anything but the blade and I can&lt;br /&gt;tell the difference.  I will order my next batch from somewhere&lt;br /&gt;else.</li>
    <li> I have been using a double edge safety razor for about 4 years now, and these are the sharpest blades by far. I have extremely tough facial hair and these razors slice right through like **** through a goose. I don&#x27;t use them to shave my head because I get nicked easily. I use another brand for that which is not as sharp but sharp enough for my head. The bottom line is that wet shaving is inexpensive after the initial cost of a razor, shaving brush, etc. The five bladed torture devices cost roughly $20 for a pack of 4 and do a horrible job at slicing through facial hair. I can buy a 50 pack and that will last me for almost an entire year. I spent $15 on these and I am set. I don&#x27;t plan on going back to the old way of shaving. Though I might take up the straight razor if I can muster the courage to use it.</li>
    <li> Both  my wife and I use these blades for shaving. Well suited for our skin types.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Razors are awesome, they&#x27;re cheaper than Fusion, Mach 3, and others...they also shave better and last longer.</li>
    <li> Feather blades. Nothing more to say if you know them.</li>
    <li> These could shave the hair off of a fly&#x27;s ass mid-flight.  My absolute favorite blade for that!</li>
    <li> Hard to beat feather blades. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blades. Sharp and do not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> These blades slice through facial hair like butter. On average, I use one blade per week but I only shave every three days or so. My girlfriend likes me a little scruffy so I let it grow up then use a fresh blade to clean up at the start of every week. They are so much cheaper than department store blades you can afford to use it just once or twice and then throw it away.</li>
    <li> Man do I love these blades. When I first started double-edge shaving I did not like them at all. They were too sharp and I hadn&#x27;t developed a good-enough technique to not either cut myself, or apply pressure and cause irritation. Now that I have the technique down, these are the best blade for me anyway. I can usually get 3-4 shaves out of one blade, they stay sharper longer than my 7&#x27;Oclock blades I was using (I can only get one shave out of those before it feels like they are pulling rather than cutting).</li>
    <li> My older brother has been shaving with the original safety razor for several years and loves the ritual.  He has tried multiple types of blades and he reports that it holds it&#x27;s edge the longest as well as giving the closest shave available.  This will be purchased for years to come.</li>
    <li> Not real cheap imported knock off.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. It&#x27;s been said, in every review, but in case you still thought \\&quot;well maybe they&#x27;re not really THAT sharp,\\&quot; I&#x27;ll step in again here and inform you that yes, they are indeed THAT sharp. But after a month of shaving my head with Gillette 7 O&#x27;clocks, and cutting the ever loving naughty words out of my scalp, I shaved with a feather and got the cleanest closest shave my scalp has ever enjoyed, mostly with one ATG  pass and some clean up, and not so much as a nick. Recommend.</li>
    <li> These blades are awesomely sharp. Do yourself a favor and save some dough by  getting a safety razor and these blades. Learn how to shave properly, then toss the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I heard good reviews of these so I tried some.&lt;br /&gt;They just are not very sharp and the blade quality is poor.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I only bought a few, I am going back to my Derby blades which are competitively priced and easily twice the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been shaving with double edge blades, you probably already have an idea that Feather blades are the leader of the pack.  These blades are great.  They give you a better shave than any other brand.  If you&#x27;re looking for refill blades and you want a smooth shave, get this.</li>
    <li> Simply the best blades I have ever had. Extremely sharp and stay that way for many shaves.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.</li>
    <li> These are considered to be the sharpest blades made.  Works great for me in the muhle r-89 grande. Great blades.</li>
    <li> I expected a super amazing shave from these because all the stories you read about &amp;#34;Feather Razors&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s all hype. These are run of the mill blades. Work just as good as my Astra blades. I have kind of thick hair so I need something super sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I accidentally dropped this package off my stairwell as I was ascending to my apartment. Oddly enough, I also dropped a bowling ball I had just received and both items hit the ground at the exact same time. I wonder if there is some theory that can explain this phenomenon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather makes the best blades, bar none. After much sampling of various blades this is the only one I will use. Sharp, close, clean shave, no irritation. These are some of the sharpest blades available, so be careful if you&#x27;re new to DE. There is no difference in blades between this packaging and the silver/black/white looking packaging, in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
    <li> As many others have commented, these are very sharp.  I am very impressed. Close shave and seem to maintain their sharpness for a long time.</li>
    <li> Simply the best blade in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I would never use any other as long as I live.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades! These work for me in a variety of razors. The shipping from my seller was a bit prolonged, but the product is awesome.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. Not TSA-friendly, but cheap as water, man. I use a fresh blade every-to-every-other time I shave (2-3 times a week, sometimes less) on my Merkur long handle safety razor with basic shave cream (not the foamy kind, but something by Neutrogena or Nivea I think). Sometimes the second time around, I get razor burn, so I change them as frequently as I can. I go anywhere from 2-5 days between shaves so the blade might oxidize and nick me. These are sharp and smooth. With the grain and against the grain. Cuts like butter.</li>
    <li> Blades are sharp as can be. I&#x27;ve experimented with other blades and there are some very good ones, but I really like this blade and it is a great bargain considering what the pharmacies are get or the multi-blade cartridges</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many samplers and different blades for my safety razor collection.  These are the only ones I will be buying from here on out.</li>
    <li> All razors are not created equal, and the Edwin Jagger proves it. It is of the highest quality&lt;br /&gt;and shaves better than any razor I have ever had and combined with the super sharp Feather blades it is an unbeatable combination.&lt;br /&gt;TCB</li>
    <li> Just started DE shaving and these worked great.  Takes some practice some blood the first week but once you learn how your hair grows you can avoid excess irritation.  Very sharp tested on cardboard cuts through little effort.  Shipped to SF bay quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good blades. High quality. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a consistently sharp blade. I have a heavy beard and make one to two passes max and I get 3+ good shaves from each blade.</li>
    <li> butter smooth shaves with this one</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve found so far.  They glide effortlessly over your face and shave very close and clean.</li>
    <li> Visciously sharp razor blades. These won&#x27;t work for everyone but I found these ideal for giving myself a baby-smooth shave. They&#x27;re sharp and durable enough to last me about 4-5 shaves too.</li>
    <li> Favorite blades so far!</li>
    <li> Husband uses these in his vintage Gillette 3 piece tech. They consistently last longer than the other blades he has purchased and shave better overall.</li>
    <li> So I got these to go with my shaving head I got from Art of Shaving, and the blades are a smidge too wide so they don&#x27;t cut all that well due to the too little clearance between blade and my skin.</li>
    <li> One of the best blades, but don&#x27;t last quite as long as the Merkur blades. After two shaves they seem to lose their ability to glide through the beard, so they end up chopping instead of cutting.</li>
    <li> For all you double-edge safety razor wet shavers out there, these are some of the best blades you can get.  They&#x27;re extremely sharp, which provides an easy shave for even the toughest beards out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks say that Feather blades take a bit too much skin as you shave; that they&#x27;re too aggressive.  But I&#x27;m a firm believer that any issues of this type are related more to technique than to the blade itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not consider myself an expert yet, but I have focused a lot on my technique and I find these blades giving an fantastic and easy shave every time.  After experimenting with many options, these are now my go-to blades.</li>
    <li> Blades are very nice but the wait wow....</li>
    <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
    <li> Consistently the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I use these with a Merkur Futur on setting #4, and they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
    <li> Shaved hair off frog, so Sharp.... All my barbers are now hooked... Best shaves! Georges Barbershop South Daytona Florida 32117</li>
    <li> I tried other brands through a variety mix pack and I can honestly say that the Feathers are still my favorite. Super sharp and gets the job done. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting into the DE game, start with a variety pack and find what you like. I think I&#x27;ve been through a couple hundred of these blades now and I don&#x27;t see myself changing anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Best. Razor blades. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course blades are a individual preference so there is that.</li>
    <li> Best razors I have used so far.... I am new to wet shaving and have tried a few other brands (Derby and drug store variety), but these are hands down the best...the search is over...great blades.</li>
    <li> I just used feather blades for the first time, I highly recommend them, smooth close comfortable shave. I received my order a week before the anticipated shipping date, and they were very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> For my husband and son. They both love these blades!</li>
    <li> Best blades you can buy. Go easy with them. In the Merkur I get nicks in the neck area unless extremely careful. These blades are sharp! But with the feather razor? Man. This is as good as it gets. Close shave - no stress. Mild and close. That&#x27;s as good as it gets in the shaving experience.</li>
    <li> The best shave in your life will come from a Feather blade - unless you are paying a highly skilled barber to do it.</li>
    <li> Very very sharp...&lt;br /&gt;Feather makes surgical scalpels for hospitals...&lt;br /&gt;These are fantastic</li>
    <li> Very sharp and provide an excellent shave with my long-handled Merkur. I love shaving this way... no need to spend the big bucks!</li>
    <li> The BEST double edge blades out there if you like aggressive razors. The Gillette Silver Blues (my second favorite) hold an edge a little longer, but aren&#x27;t as sharp as these. I use these with a Weber DLC and a Feather AS-D2 and they pair great with both.</li>
    <li> They are everything a feather should be.</li>
    <li> Made such a difference when I switched to feather blades from Derby. No drag and no irritating.</li>
    <li> These are the best for my face...Ive tried the variety packs and keep coming back to these.</li>
    <li> The sharpest and for me the most comfortable blades available. The extra shaves (6 to 10) I get more than make up for the cost.</li>
    <li> amazing, I love the quality of these blades and did not have any problems as mentioned by others</li>
    <li> Sharpest blades you can buy for the most cost effective and comfortable method of shaving!</li>
    <li> These are the best so far with one minor caveat. They are pain to unwrap from the waxy paper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for shaving for almost two years, and after going through variety packs, I haven&#x27;t found another kind of razor that gives me the same feel these babies do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a beard that says 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 6 AM, and I sometimes question if I have to do another pass. They just stand up better and last a bit longer than other razors I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you are ready for these and prepare your face before you start shaving with these. Do not rush the process. These blades are very sharp, and can nick and cut with ease if they are not given the respect they deserve.  I tend to get the best results right out of the shower with them. A preshave oil doesn&#x27;t hurt, but if you prep properly, it is not necessary. Plenty of lather folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid of it. Embrace it.</li>
    <li> Best blade ever by far.</li>
    <li> Great Razor Blades!  I wouldn&#x27;t use any others!</li>
    <li> These blades are superior to any others I have used. Be careful and make sure your razor is adjusted for these. I use the with a Merkur Futura and get an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have used to date</li>
    <li> These do a very good job. They are nice and sharp</li>
    <li> Awesome. Interesting that the 10 pack is the same size as the 5 pack, but there are definitely 10 blades in each pack</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband as part of a shaving kit for Christmas. Works excellently, very sharp which is great for his thick hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> these are the sharpest blades I have used so far.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, high quality DE blades an extremely smooth shave- just what I was looking for.  If you&#x27;ve got this type of shaving method dialed in, then I highly recommend this product, just the best, bar none.</li>
    <li> Feather blades have this reputation of being super sharp. So far they&#x27;ve done a great job. No cuts, smooth shaves, and they last me about 3-4 shaves. But keep in mind I change Astras, and Gillettes after two shaves. The Feathers are definitely becoming my favorite blade. But blades are probably the most subjective part of DE shaving. If you&#x27;re a newcomer buy a sample pack and see what work for you.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love these blades in our safety razors! close clean shave and no ingrown hairs! Plus they are economical</li>
    <li> Best blades money can buy.But watch out, they are super sharp.</li>
    <li> Obviously have to find the best blade for ones own self and that&#x27;s what I did here.  Most gentle on my skin.  No other brand compares</li>
    <li> Love these blades. They are sharper than most, so be careful.</li>
    <li> Purchased on recommendation of my son.  He loves them, best razor blades.</li>
    <li> Well most reviews seem to be from pretty experienced wet shavers so thought I would give my take as a beginner since these are the much feared Feather blades where some reviews make it sound like you decapitate yourself if you are not careful.  I have been wet shaving with a Merkur 34C HD for about 2 to 3 week now, I have a pretty coarse beard with sensitive fair Irish skin.  I finally got around to trying these out and I am still alive and no nicks or cuts.  I thought the Feather blades to be a nice close shave, but not a huge difference with a 3 pass shave with the other blades.  For the cost I don&#x27;t believe these blades are at all worth the difference in price.  Out of all the blades I tried these were not the smoothest across the face but they were about even even with the Astra blades for the closeness of the shave, but maybe just slightly more irritating to the skin.  Out of all my sample tries this would not be my final choice but I would use them if I had them.  Keep in mind all blade reviews are very subjective you may like them much more or much less than I did, definitely worth a try.  Had to take a star because of cost compared to most brands of blades.  I have done a video of review of 6 different blades I have tried from around the world, including the Feather blades with more details on each.  Click the link to check it out.    http://youtu.be/FFF_wJgcYUk</li>
    <li> Nice blades; just switched over from Mach 3 to &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; shaver and am looking forward to saving money. These provide a nice, close shave. They last about 7-8 shaves.</li>
    <li> I love these blades! They&#x27;re extremely sharp, which helps cut through my course facial hair easier than any brands I&#x27;ve tried. I can usually get 2-3 good shaves out of a single blade, which I&#x27;m happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face reacts differently to different shavers and blades, so I can&#x27;t guarantee that these will work for you. What I can say is that they are well made blades that are very sharp and economical compared to cartridges.</li>
    <li> The most common recommendation to newbies is to try a variety of blades. This isn&#x27;t necessarily wrong in terms of the consumer world. But let&#x27;s speak plainly. DE users want a close comfortable shave. If you are smart enough to seek that, you can reward yourself and save some money in the bargain and order these Feather blades. That&#x27;s what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these blades lasts me about a week. They are very sharp. Smooth, close and irritation-free shaving. No problems whatsoever. The plastic cases they come in has a convenient slot to put your used blades. A real plus: The last thing I want is bathroom decor sharps disposal that reminds me of a doctor&#x27;s office and further clutters limited space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the Feather in a Merkur razor. Great combo.</li>
    <li> Awesome safety razor blade they are nice and sharp. They shave hair with no irritation!</li>
    <li> great product! and as promised...shipping takes a while, so keep that in consideration when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;completely pleased with purchase - shall purchase form them again!</li>
    <li> Stayed sharp through 6 shaves per blade. Top quality and the used blades slide nicely back into the dispenser when done.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp. There will be no tugging. These can cut through any beard with ease. Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.</li>
    <li> This is the best blade I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> Some blades work better than others in different shavers.  In one of my shavers, Feather blades are the best -- in another, they&#x27;re scary and painful.  Try them all, choose the one that works best for you.  While I wish I could use the 10 cent blades, like Derby, I find that these cut so much smoother and easier that I&#x27;m willing to pay extra.</li>
    <li> SUPER SHARP.  I lost respect and started shaving too fast...and took a chunk of my face off.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade these for any other brand.  The Feather DE shaver is a perfect match for them.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to review.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are well made, well wrapped, and nicely packaged with a, &amp;#34;blade safe&amp;#34; built into the bottom of the plastic housing.&lt;br /&gt;If you need the sharpest DE blade known to mankind, here it is!  Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;You might have a skin type or beard type that requires this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it is WAY TOO SHARP!  No matter what I do, no matter witch razor I shave with I slice me face to bits when I use Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with Derby or Merkur blades.</li>
    <li> When I first got my safety razor I ordered several brands of razors to try.  Feather is the best of the bunch.</li>
    <li> everyone warned about using this blade too soon in you DE blade experience. so i stayed away for a bit. bad idea. dont strugle and butcher with cheaper blades. go strait for the good one and youll save yourself alot of hassle and discomfort. i would compare it to learning to play guitar with a $60 wlamart special instead of a taylor. go for the taylor. youll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Simply the best razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Super sharp, no burn.&lt;br /&gt;And great for the price.</li>
    <li> These blades are great.  I had previously been using Astra, and these blades are both sharper in the beginning and hold their edge better over time.  They also feel great and only require a very light touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best example I can provide is that I used to have to shave some areas under my chin with multiple swipes at different angles with other blades to completely remove the hair.  These blades get the job done in one sweep and (as you would imagine) help reduce burn as a result.  Great product for anyone using a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I hate to think that I am a shaving equipment junky, but I keep looking for perfection.  Feather blades used with a Feather approach perfection.  If the shaver handle was longer I would  like it better, but it is the third one I am trying and the best and smoothest.</li>
    <li> I like these blades. They are very sharp so be careful not to cut your skin. For some reason they do not fit the Merkur Long handle razor that well. One side of the razor is sharper than the other.</li>
    <li> Shaving with these blades is like cutting butter with a butter knife.</li>
    <li> I can use this blade for at least 2 weeks worth of shaves before having to switch it out, and I get very little irritation.  My winning combination seems to be shave oil + Burts Bees shave cream.  For some reason, the combination of those two makes every shave really comfortable even for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I tried a few other brands and like the Feather the best.  Different skin will like different blades so this may not be a match for you.  I recommend getting a cheap variety pack (with these in there) and trying some different brands.  I didn&#x27;t think it made a difference which one I used after the first two brands I tried, then I got these and love em.</li>
    <li> I started using Gillette blue blades in the 50&#x27;s.  Suddenly they wouldn&#x27;t hold an edge long enough to finish a single shave.  Stainless blades came out, and held their edge longer than the blue blades originally did. I tried many different SS blades over the years, and most gave 4-6 decent shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Feather blades, and am impressed.  Now I get 4-5 excellent shaves, and 2-3 more decent shaves.  I bought 50 blades for less than I used to pay for other brands.  I so happy to get such excellent shaves, that I just put in a new blade every 5th shave..</li>
    <li> Super sharp, a very light touch is required when shaving.  Let the blade do the work for you.  I have noticed that these blades tend to nick you more when it is a fresh one, after one shaving session, they don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp, but they aren&#x27;t dull by any stretch of the imagination.  I was previously using Dorco blades, but found that after 2 or 3 shaves (3 passes each shave) I was replacing the blade because of tugging and pulling on the hair and cuts because of uneven blade wear. The Dorco Blades would last me about 1 week.  However with these Feather Blades I find that I replace the blade about every 6 or 7 shaves (still 3 passes).  They last me nearly twice as long. At this rate, it will take me 2 years to go through this 50 count package.  I have a medium beard growth so your shaving mileage may vary.  A friend of mine recommended them to me and I&#x27;m glad he did.</li>
    <li> Love these. Super sharp. Sharper by far than the Merkurs I was using.</li>
    <li> These are great blades.  They&#x27;re sharp out of the box and remain so shave after shave.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but find myself coming back to Feathers.</li>
    <li> Holy Hell! These suckers are sharp! They shave all the hairs off my face as advertised. Note, if you have parkinsons, steer clear of these razors, or you&#x27;ll probably turn yourself into a pez dispenser. Maybe the government should regulate who buys these, because someone might not have the proper training needed to utilize such a fine blade. What do we want? Safety Razor training! When do we want it? NOW!</li>
    <li> These blades are great. A bit more expensive than other brands, but well worth the extra cost. They are sharper than other blades I have tried, and slightly thinner as well. I had tried the Persona blades, but found myself having to re-shave areas or getting nicks. With the sharper blades, I find that my shaves are not only smoother, but I have less nicks because I do not need to re-shave or press harder on certain areas. The sharper blades really do make a big difference. I am not sure if the &amp;#34;Platinum&amp;#34; coating really does anything.</li>
    <li> Up until this purchase, I had been using Astra blades. I thought they were sharp and pretty good quality, and then I bought the Feather blades after hearing nothing but great reviews on them. Hands down, the Feather blades will make any other double edge blade seem like you are shaving your face with a butter knife. The Feather blades are by far the sharpest and best blades that I have used to date. I highly recommend these blades!</li>
    <li> These work great.  I don&#x27;t know what the nonsense everyone is posting here about some sort of magical shaving ritual is about; you shave with these just like any other blades.  I find the sharpness of these blades great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Sharp best blades out here for safety razor use it daily</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp, gives me a very smooth shave — love em&#x27;.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best. I love shaving with a double edge razor. All of the reviews on other products keeps me coming back to these. I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> Very good blade period! I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and have been DE shaving (at least part time) for 25 years. The last 10 or so with the DE razor exclusivly. I&#x27;ve tried many blades and found many I like. Astra, 7 o&#x27;clock yellow, Merkur and Persona (blue) are among my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;These are razor bllades so, yeah they&#x27;re sharp. Useless metal if they aren&#x27;t. They are a little sharper than most but nothing to fear. If you cut your shelf with the blade you are currently using, these will make you bleed a little more. If you get razor burn now you&#x27;ll get it worse with these.&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, if you are a guy who understands what no downward pressure means and you want to take your time and get a really close shave this blade will provide it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it in my Merkur 34c, 1956 Gillette Super Speed and 1960 fat boy. Three pass shaves each time and all great results. I have a little bit of a hard water issue which means soap film can stay on the blade causing it to seem dull faster. By cleaning them with alcohol after each shave I&#x27;m able to get 4 great shaves with a blade ( never tried for more ).&lt;br /&gt;If your a beginner with a DE my adive is use Derby, Gillette Blue (both good blades) to get your feet wet or you may end up scared (literally). For a steady handed experience shaver, you may find this blades equal but you won&#x27;t find its better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read many reviews saying &amp;#34;find the right blade for your face&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s carp! It&#x27;s not that at all. Find a blade that matches your technique. Hair differs greatly. My beard is very curly and filled with grey. It takes serious prep with any blade and this is no exception. Prep poory, shave sloppy and it will end badly for you. But, with good prep and good technique it&#x27;s one hell of a blade.&lt;br /&gt;Again for all beginners who like the idea of throwing this puppy into a slant bar or old adjustable Gillette set to 9, go for it. You&#x27;ve been warned.&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest of you, enjoy this fine blade and thank you fordoing you part to say... well you know, to the people trying to force feed us $3 per shave carp during every deadball on Saturdays and Sundays. Break out the TOBS, warm up the brush an do what ever you to prep your face, then enjoy. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Best razor blades I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Some are sharp and some are not.</li>
    <li> Sharp, aggressive and consistent. As good as they come.</li>
    <li> Sharpest, smoothest shaving blades I have ever used.  Paired with my Edwin Jagger razor it makes a wonderful shave</li>
    <li> Highest quality blades and ultra sharp.</li>
    <li> It really is the best. I&#x27;ve used other blades but these really are the sharpest when compared to other common blade brands. They are a good bit more expensive though. I would try some of the less expensive blade, maybe like shark and decide whether you need sharper for your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end though it isnt just hype, these really are the sharpest. They can make a really cheap safety razor have a quality shave just because of the blade</li>
    <li> Very sharp razor blade. Too sharp for my sensitive skin. The blade consistency is very good with no noticeable variance between blades or in blade reveal.</li>
    <li> The only brand I&#x27;m using for my safety razor. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use these with an older razor and they work great. Smooth finish and none of them were dull.</li>
    <li> An impeccable deal. Do yourself a favor and save about $400-$600 a year by purchasing a razor handle, some shaving soap and these blades. Great training blades as well.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades. Clean shave. If you know how to properly shave you will not cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Great blades, great deal.  My husband and I share this account, but I&#x27;m a woman and I use these blades in my Merkur DE Razor to shave my legs, armpits, and lady bits!  I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen blade brands from a sampler pack, and these were by far the best.  I&#x27;ll be a Feather fan for life.</li>
    <li> I was looking for sharp blades since I shave my neck and my head. I have used many of the other brands and while good they dulled quickly and required more pressure to get a consistently close shave. With Feather blades not only do they last longer they start out sharper and produce cleaner and closer shaves. But please be aware that they are definitely the SHARPEST double edge blades I have ever used and as such required an adjustment in my shaving style. Less pressure and maintaining a 30 degree angle is critical for safety. I will not go back to lesser blades as long as I can get Feathers. They come individually wrapped in paper, too.</li>
    <li> These blades are so sharp it&#x27;s scary. It&#x27;s like something out of a sci-fi novel. I&#x27;ve shaved every bump and protuberance right of my face. After a week all that&#x27;s left is smooth skin. The shave was actually more comfortable after about a week of use when it dulled down a bit. Pack of 50 blades ought to last 2-3 years for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go very very slowly when shaving with a new blade. A slight rush can result in a huge gash.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Effortless shave.</li>
    <li> Best safety blades that I have ever tired. Super sharp and the edge lasts for few shaves. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave.  Consistent good quality.</li>
    <li> sharpest razor, closest shave. i&#x27;ve tried Wilkinsons, Merkur, Astra...always go back to Feather.</li>
    <li> These hold an edge and are very sharp, leaps and bounds sharper than cheaper razors.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints, the Mach 3 from Gillette used to pull my whiskers under my nose, so I switched to a safety razor and it stopped.  I don&#x27;t know why the world stepped away from safety razors, they still shave better than the new multi blade razors,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them and I keep coming back to these blades.  Nice shave and seem to last longer than a lot of the other options.</li>
    <li> Sharpest shave blade I&#x27;ve ever used. Two shaves per blade and no nicks, scratches, or cuts. Just baby smooth skin!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 7 or 8 different blades and this is easily the best.&lt;br /&gt;I stocked up on enough to last me for maybe five years.</li>
    <li> I own a big box of Astra&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used Derby. These Feathers bring everything down, in my opinion, to a smoother finish than both of those brands.Now you will need a minimum double pass (I like at least three, with a light four pass clean-up) shave to do the job right. In my case my face finishes up with a nice tight feel. Some say these blades are really sharp. I say that they are just the right sharpness IF (the big &amp;#34;if&amp;#34;) you have an experienced hand at shaving. I enjoy shaving and do so once a day. I experience no razor burn, what-so-ever. I use a Edwin Jagger with Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood cream. These Feather blades come in neat little plastic slide boxes with ten blades in each box. I am able to comfortably get 2 shaves with each blade. I could get more. The price of these blades is higher than some, but hey it&#x27;s your face, be cheap if you want.</li>
    <li> I use these with my Merkur short handle and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;Second day seems to be the best.  they are almost too sharp on day one.</li>
    <li> Best blades I have found so far for my face and great price. No problem with getting them on time from the seller.</li>
    <li> Although I am fairly new to shaving with a safety razor, these blades are by far the best of the 4 or 5 different kinds I have used. They are a bit pricier than other double edge blades but still 1000 times cheaper than buying cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to never shave against the grain with cartridge razors because of how awful the razor burn was. With these blades I can shave against the grain with minimal irritation for the closest shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Since I made the switch to safety razors a couple months ago, I&#x27;ve tried several different blades, and these are my current favorite.  I&#x27;ve managed to get about 3-4 shaves per side, though my facial hair is not very coarse, so your mileage may vary.  The razors are noticeably thinner than others that I&#x27;ve used, and they fit my Merkur #MK333C just fine (I haven&#x27;t come across any blades that haven&#x27;t, but I&#x27;ve read reviews of some that don&#x27;t fit squarely between the cap and guard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the sharpest of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, which includes BIC, Astra Superior, and Derby, all of which are still good razors, but I get more use from the feather ones.  The only downside is that they are noticeably more expensive than other blades, but I get about twice as many shaves out of one blade, so it comes out to breaking even, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as what will get you a closer shave, that comes with technique - the blades you use won&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the value.  Very affordable.  The only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t seem to be sharp enough, or not as sharp as I thought.  I have to stroke the kit several times against my skin in the same place to get the desired result.  I thought I could get away with fewer strokes.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best razor blades I&#x27;ve tried after using the variety pack sold here on Amazon. They stay sharp for about a week of shaving while others dulled very quickly. I recommended them to a friend and he chose them without even using the variety pack. Save yourself the time and money and just buy these is my advice.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the feather blades you&#x27;re missing out. If you know of a better blade please comment so I can try them out.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Works great in my Edwin Jagger DE 89 razor. Be careful. These blades are no joke. The first shave with each blade is an adventure in light touch and smooth shave. After the very first shave however the blade seems to calm down leading to a great shave.</li>
    <li> As always feather delivers a great shave. I put this on my new merkur 39c slant and hade the best shave of my life.</li>
    <li> While some say these things are Ninja-Assassin sharp, and shy away from them, I would argue that is probably because they lack good technique. Yes, these things are sharp, but they produce such an excellent shave!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of the variety packs to find a blade that I liked the best, and without a doubt, these are my favorite.  Everyone&#x27;s beard is different, but if you have good technique, give these a try.</li>
    <li> These feathers are very sharp, but they are not for me. I tried a sample pack and while I couldn&#x27;t feel myself being cut while shaving I definitely noticed the nicks and blood lol. Got the stubble off a little to well for me, but may work just perfect for you-every face and everyone’s technique is different.</li>
    <li> These blades are very sharp and give me the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, super smooth!  *Added bonus* it will also shave off any facial imperfections.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great value.  These blades are sharp, and seem to keep a nice edge for up to 2 weeks, with daily shaves.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and stop using that Mach 3 razo. I switched to a DE safety razor a year ago and I love it. After initially spending around 50 bucks on a razor (Merkur long handle), a brush (Tweezerman badger hair), and some other Proraso soap and these blades, I&#x27;ve spent almost nothing and I use about one blade a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sharp, I&#x27;ve only tried out the Merkur brand in comparison but these seem to give me a closer shave.</li>
    <li> After trying just one blade for one shave, I immediately threw out the rest of my Derby blades. These feather blades are SHARP and SMOOTH. Every face is different, so I&#x27;m not making any blanket statements, but for me, these blades are amazing. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how sharp these feathers are. They must come from the highly-intelligent razor bird.</li>
    <li> Definitely some of the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.  Perfectly clean shave every single time.  With that said, do be very very careful, with how sharp these are, it&#x27;s way too easy to cut yourself and not even notice.  Only blades I use these days, am yet to find anything better.</li>
    <li> These blades are by far the best I have used!  Give you a very close shave and I never get razor burn.  For this prise I change my blade every shave to keep from getting nicked!</li>
    <li> blades are a personal choice, but if you like these I would recommend them/ the seller A+</li>
    <li> These are undoubtedly the sharpest razor blades on the planet.  They come well packaged with a built-in blade disposal.  Perfect for tough beards..</li>
    <li> I have dense facial hair, Feathers are about the only brand that I can shave without feeling a pull. Great blades, nice price, much better than paying Gillette.</li>
    <li> If you are a fan of the old-fashioned double edge safety razor (and you should be, because you&#x27;re getting ripped off by the major razor brands) then you cannot find a better blade than Feather.  They are the standard by which all blades should be measured.</li>
    <li> Great blades and if you&#x27;re the kind of person who likes to get lots of unasked for emails from folks who bought your name, you&#x27;ll be even more delighted.</li>
    <li> The blades are awesome. I have a full head of hair but shave it bald once a week. This blade lasts me at least two head shavings and multiple face shaves in between. Way better shave than the stock Merkur blade that came with the long handled razor.</li>
    <li> Sharpest blade I have tried. Works great on face and head. The bad PR about cuts is unfounded. I have been using Feather for two years and just made my second order.</li>
    <li> great product at the right price</li>
    <li> Excellent and problem-free transaction!</li>
    <li> Excellent blades. Yes, they&#x27;re sharp but that&#x27;s what you need. Just pay attention and shave.</li>
    <li> Sharpest blades on the market, I&#x27;ve used quite a few and feather has kept my pretty sensitive skin razor burn free</li>
    <li> Just like previous posts, these blades are SHARP. I bought this 50 pack, as I was tired of buying cartridges for $15/5 pack. If you have sensitive skin like me, I would suggest a pre-shave oil. The 50 pack is a great buy for the quality of blade.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades! I&#x27;m relatively new to safety razors, but I love these blade.</li>
    <li> Great blades, good price.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing blades! Considered the sharpest in the world, and for good reason. I have a fairly heavy beard and shave twice a day. One blade will usually last 2 weeks and still shave well. Bought in bulk, less than 40 cents a blade, vs $4 for a cartridge that doesn&#x27;t cut as well. Less waste, too.</li>
    <li> I used this blade back in 90s and went on to other products thinking they appeas easier. Finally found the same old blade I start my shaving with is teh best out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different, well rated, brands and this one works the best!  You will not be disappointed!  These are the only ones I buy now.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years.  Amazon has the best price I have found. Would go any where else.</li>
    <li> the best blades I have ever used for my beard, Sharp and Smooth. the only blade I use shipping is always quick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using a double edge safety razor, but compared to the Merkur blade that came with my razor, this is like a light saber.  The Merkur worked, but wasn&#x27;t great and wore out quickly.  The Feather blades shave much better, with less irritation... however they do dull quickly.  Keep in mind I shave both my face and my head with this blade, so it gets double duty every day I shave.  Overall I would say these are much sharper than the Merkur, and at the low cost when buying in bulk, I don&#x27;t mind tossing them every other time I shave.</li>
    <li> Great product. Sharpest razor I have used thus far. Gives a smooth shave. If you have thick beard, then this is the best razor for you.&lt;br /&gt;It is obvious why it is called feather, because it is so sharp that you don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure to skin for hair removal. This results in less skin irritation due to the reduced need for multiple passes on skin for satisfactory hair removal.</li>
    <li> Screaming sharp, which I love.  These will offer the closest shave available and will hold their edge well.  I shave with a straight razor and these are the only DE blades i will buy to get as good a shave.</li>
    <li> These blades are the sharpest by far of  all the double edged blades I have tried. I shave on average every two days and get 5 shaves on a blade, so for me I am changing the blade every 10 days. You might have a coarser beard and may not last as long for you as it does for me. I also like the fact that on the back of the plastic case that holds the blades is a slot to dispose of the used blades.</li>
    <li> These have become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blade.</li>
    <li> These are not real Feathers or they&#x27;re seconds. Should have known when they took two months to receive from Thailand. I&#x27;ve using Feathers for years and could tell from the first blade. Nothing but tugging and pulling. After struggling through two packs thinking maybe I got a bad one, I decided to buy a pack from my usual REPUTABLE site, Lee&#x27;s Razors. And just as I suspected the difference was night an day. Your going to pay a little more, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These blades are wickedly sharp, respect them and you will be reward with a smooth and comfortable shave. I alternate between Feathers and Astras, but the Feathers are my secret weapon. I like the fact that they come in a rigid plastic box which has a blade disposal slot on the back.</li>
    <li> They are great but incredibly sharp, almost to the point where I may throw them away. I often look like I&#x27;ve been in a knife fight after shaving.</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp blades, perfect for wet shaving</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors and these are the best that i&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, One of the sharpest blades on the market!!</li>
    <li> Nice sharp blades. No problem for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Get these instead. Do not buy BIC brand, they will cut you. So far I am very happy.</li>
    <li> If any razors, feather, derby, or any other brand are sold from thailand/vietnam there&#x27;s a 99% chance you are going to receive a fake item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy from US sellers they might be a bit pricier but at least they are REAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the fake blades are dull and uneven. One side is longer than the other. also the packaging honestly looks real from the outside. but you&#x27;ll notice the string thing on the plastic won&#x27;t pull properly if its fake. also the individual razors are wrapped with this awful smelling glue. i boiled 1 razor just for safety measures because they looked like resharpened old blades, with the font print fading and with the font size different from the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY US OR FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best blades on the market. These are super sharp, and very thin. Good to use if you hair is thick, the only blades I will buy.</li>
    <li> I love this blade. I bought a sample first and now back for a pack of 10. Also I recommended this to a colleague from work. Shaving is a personal experience, and I get it why some people may not like it. The right thing to do is to let the weight of the Safety razor&#x27;s head to do the job, especially  if you shave backwards for the second pass. Do not apply any additional pressure as you shave backwards, this is the best way to avoid nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> Too much whooping and hollering regarding these blades! They&#x27;re plenty sharp, but when all is said and done, they&#x27;re just razor blades. Nothing mystical, nothing magical. Put them in your razor and if they give you a good shave, use them...otherwise don&#x27;t. I prefer Merkur blades over Feather and I&#x27;ve never drawn a drop of blood with a Feather blade, so I have no axe to grind with the Feather folks. If a Feather was the last blade on earth, I&#x27;d use it without complaint, but having said that...my face and beard just like Merkur more. Maybe a little less irritation, maybe a little closer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best there is? Period? Come on...that&#x27;s a stretch.</li>
    <li> good price, and a good shave for the most part, but it seems like every once in a while you get a dud blade</li>
    <li> These may be the sharpest blades on the market, but that&#x27;s mitigated by them not being very smooth. I still find myself pulling and tugging at two days growth with these in my Merkur 23C. Sure, the 23C is not the most aggressive razor, but blades this sharp should not have an issue. I have actually had issues with these in my 37C too. I have consistently whipped up thick, slick, voluminous lathers before shaving with Feathers, so I&#x27;m not sure what I am doing wrong.. I really want to like these, but their lack of smoothness does not do my sensitive skin any favors. I do find that Feather blades are best used sparingly. I can get very close shaves with these in my 23C (though not the most comfortable shaves), but my face can only stand a shave with Feather blades once a week. I tried using these as my regular shaving blade -- I hacked my face up and caused plenty of irritation. They just lack the smoothness to be used on a regular basis. Personna Lab Blues are my new go-to: nearly as sharp, but much smoother.</li>
    <li> Feather seems to have a cult of followers who&#x27;d like you to believe that shaving with the blade requires the unlocking of some secret of the ancient world. It has been my experience, that these are very good, sharp, double edge razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;I used them for the first time without having to meditate under a bodhi tree, or snatch a pebble from my master&#x27;s hand...and I managed to complete a two pass shave without having to use my bath towel as a tourniquet. I did not approach the shave any differently. There was no special prep...no extra focus, or steadying of a nervous hands. I simply shaved in the same manner that I would shave when using a personna, voskhod, gillette yellow, or astra.&lt;br /&gt;These are very good blades. They are sharper than most and can chew you up if you use an aggressive razor. But, they are nothing to be intimidated by. If you aren&#x27;t cutting yourself with your Derby or Merkur blade, then you probably won&#x27;t cut yourself with these. All that you have to do is exercise the same, rational, prudent amount of caution that one would while holding any razor honed metal up their throat.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades that shave closer than any other blade!</li>
    <li> Love these blades. They are high quality blades and sharp, but I shave better with these without the occasional nicks and cuts which are inherent to DE shaving.  I change out weekly and am really satisfied with Feather. Will standardize on these from now on.</li>
    <li> great quality.  I have thick facial hair.  I use it every day, and replace them about once per week.  I will never go back to cartridge razors again!!</li>
    <li> I am new to double edge shaving. I was using the Merkur blades at first, but realized I needed a shaper blade. I get a smoother shave.</li>
    <li> I used to buy German Merkur (solingen) blades for decades, but now I buy Feather made in Japan. THe Japanesse have just out done themsevles in the blade industrie and are just the best, maybe it&#x27;s from all that sword making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. the German blades are great also, it&#x27;s just that the feathers are just a bit above in my book.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen complaints about these being knock offs. I don&#x27;t know if they are or not, but I can tell you they are better than any blade I&#x27;ve ever tried. I love these blades! These are very sharp and give me the best tug/tear (as in eye watering) free shave I could ask for. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> They are very useful and I am glad to have bought a big supply. They come from Thailand, and are made in Japan, so be patient as to their arrival.</li>
    <li> Ok... ANOTHER review saying the EXACT same thing... I know... but one more can&#x27;t hurt...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prologue:&lt;br /&gt;I use a Murkur Futur DE razor.  Until now I&#x27;ve used Murkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are better packed, the paper is sealed on w/ a wax, which doesn&#x27;t affect the blade at all, but just shows they put a little more effort into their product.  At first inspection, they looked like a nicer quality blade... It was hard to explain why, but it just looked like a better blade..  I lathered up, and on my first pass I could tell there was almost no resistance to my blade..  Normally my thicker wiskers would offer a little resistance and the typical cutting sound was almost unauidible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.. I&#x27;ll never use another blade..  I did nick myself a few times which i didnt even feel... The blades take a little more getting used to.. I may need to play with my adjustable razor settings to find a sweet spot..</li>
    <li> The best - excellent shave. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love feather blades!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband, and let me tell you... He does not stop telling me how amazing these blades are. He would love to give 10 stars if he had the chance too.</li>
    <li> best blades at a good price</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the doomsayers who say you&#x27;re going to slice your face into ribbons if you do so much as look at it the wrong  way; It&#x27;s a razor. It&#x27;s supposed to be sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these with an Edwin Jagger DE89, and they perform flawlessly. I have absolutely no complaints. I get about 3 shaves per blade.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 shaves, they&#x27;re still usable, but I have 50 and I don&#x27;t mind buying these in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend every wet shaver try these out at least once. Buy a 5 or 10 pack, because they&#x27;re absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and smooth. Not quite sure if they&#x27;re worth the extra money compared to other brands but I haven&#x27;t tried other brands yet as I am brand new to all this. They last only about 5 shaves. But I do like them quite well.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best...</li>
    <li> Got these as a gift for a male friend who decided to try shaving with an old-school double-edged razor, and he loves them. But Interestingly, the package came hand-wrapped from Thailand.  Importing such a simple product strikes me as ridiculous waste of resources.</li>
    <li> Feather blades I would recommend to anyone.....the edge holds up for 6 shaves before you have to replace it...good product.</li>
    <li> Good and sharp but shipping took forever...</li>
    <li> Feathers are extremely sharp as everyone claims, however the Astra&#x27;s are just as sharp and I find a little smoother. I think the razor being used determines which blade will gives the best shave.  I suggest trying both and forget the rest.</li>
    <li> better than the rest though in my opinion not as good as the mach razors but close to the same shave and cheaper.</li>
    <li> These are wicked sharp double-edge razor blades. Shaving with them is a pleasure and a challenge -- the blades just slide across my face, but if I&#x27;m not careful I can easily nick myself as well. They live up to their reputation.</li>
    <li> Recently ran out of feather blades and had to use the blades that came with my safety razor. I went from a nice smooth save to feeling like my skin was being ripped off. I quickly re-ordered these blades and have enjoyed a comfortable shave ever since!!! I would highly recommend a new comer to safety razors to try Feather blades before dismissing the razor due to comfort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been shaving with a safety razor for about 6 months, but I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of DE razors:  Shark, Sharp, Astra, Durablade, Gilette, but these Feathers are the best ones I&#x27;ve used.  They always give me a smooth shave, and if I use proper technique razor burn is never an issue.  I&#x27;ve read other comments/articles about how these are for &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; wet shavers, but don&#x27;t listen to them.  As with all DE razors, if you use proper technique, take your time, and let the weight of the handle do the work, you won&#x27;t have a problem.  The 50 count box was reasonably priced.  For about $16 dollars, and getting 3-4 uses out of each blade, shaving about every other day, this will keep me supplied for almost a whole year.</li>
    <li> These blades have a great edge that really does the job. I can usually get a week out of each one which really lets me rack up on the savings over modern multiblade setups.</li>
    <li> Great product great price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very sharp but they tug after 2 uses. Still better value than overpriced cartridges.</li>
    <li> Like tiny samurai swords for your face. I cannot recommend these blades enough. My face is supremely sensitive, and I get almost no razor burn with these even when shaving on a semi-daily basis.</li>
    <li> I have a Edwin Jager DE razor and find Feathers to be sharper than any blade I&#x27;ve tried thus far (tried Derby Extra, Astra Platinum and Gillette Silver Blue).  The Gillette Silver Blues come the closest in terms of price/shave but the rest are junk.  Feathers are sharper and last longer IMO but you&#x27;re looking at 28% increase in cost versus the Gillettes.  This price difference is more than justified if you use the blade for just one more shave (which I do).  The Blues come out to be $11.96/yr at used 52 uses/yr and Feathers are $8.96/yr at 39 uses/yr.  I shave 3 times per week in case you were wondering how I came to these numbers.</li>
    <li> tried several but feather is my favorite. Very smooth and so sharp! I needed to pay closer attention since they will cut you! When I am careful they cannot be beat</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving January, 2010. I bought one of those variety pack of blades and a Mekur Long Handle DE razor and all the other necessary goodies to make shaving become a spa-like experience. From the get go I never had any real problems with nicks or ingrown hairs. I guess I had read enough and watched enough You Tube videos to make the learning curve for my shaving technique relatively flat. I do not have a course beard. I have a mild beard. As such, I wet shave every three days and if I need to touch up for an event I&#x27;ve got a nice electric that serves me well. In any event, in trying all the blades, I fell in love with the feathers. I had heard all the &amp;#34;horror stories&amp;#34; for lack of a better term about how sharp they are and that&#x27;s true, they are the sharpest of the bunch. But, when combined with a well lubricated face (I prep with Musgo Lime Soap and Proraso Pre Shave) after two passes, and an occasional third along my chin bone, my face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I&#x27;ve now just ordered the Popular Feather DE razor (the approximately $20 one, not the $180 one). I heard it gave a &amp;#34;mild shave&amp;#34; and for someone with a mild beard, such as mine, that&#x27;s ideal. The only thing is to change the shave technique from using an approximate 30 degree angle with the Mekur to a 45 degree angle with the Feather razor. However, I think the combination of the Feather razor with the Feather blades is unbeatable. They just make superior products. Sure, the blades are more than most but when compared to any other means of shaving they&#x27;re still ridiculously cheap and the fact that these are currently available through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save Program just adds to the appeal. A super sharp blade, such as the Feather, when used properly, is simply the best type of blade to use regardless of what type of beard one may have. Check out some You Tube videos and see how some men with seriously heavy beards, who have let themselves grow for three days, will come out with a fantastic shave after just three passes.a fantastic shave after just three passes.</li>
    <li> Yes, these are sharper than any blade out there. I started with an assortment pack about a year ago. I finally went with the Feather because the shave is smoother. If you&#x27;re not careful you will nick yourself more often. It&#x27;s worth it though. The end result is great. Can&#x27;t beat the cost per shave.</li>
    <li> These unbelievably sharp blades work well with my Merkur. I shave everyday and have a pretty thick growth with sensitive skin so it&#x27;s important I use good quality shave products, these blades compliment my supplies wonderfully.</li>
    <li> If you are new to DE shaving, this may not be the right blade to start out with because they are very sharp. This may seem counter-intuitive because by default razor blades should be sharp, but these are among the sharpest blades available. These blades give a good shave, but they require that you be quite careful. The choice of razor will also play a big part in your results. I use a Merkur 34C HD, which is considered a good razor that is not too aggressive, but if I do three passes with these blades, no matter how careful, I always end up with cuts; not gushing wounds, but small cuts. My previous razor was a M&amp;uuml;hle R89 and putting these blades in that razor was akin to embarking on a suicide mission (do not even consider going against the grain). If you use the R89 razor, closed or open head, consider yourself warned. I think these blades are better suited to a heavy beard, and people with less sensitive skin. I have a normal beard (visible after 24 hours but not necessary to shave every day, definitely necessary to shave after 48 hours) and my skin is sensitive in certain areas, but on the whole not prone to razor burn unless I shave every day and make three passes. My skin does not agree with that. My normal blade is a Personna and I get a very close shave with three passes every other day.  I do not get cuts from this blade on the first pass, it always seems to be on the third pass that I end up cutting myself. I bought a package of 30 and I have not used them all in the four months that I have had them because I use them less often. For my beard, they hold their edge for 3-5 shaves. I usually change the blade after the fourth shave. Your results may vary. These are quality blades and therefore are more expensive than most of the other DE blades on the market.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, very reasonably priced, 100% recyclable, old school panache.  I&#x27;ll buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I had tried these previously, and had given up on them in favor of another brand (initials &amp;#34;D.E.&amp;#34;).  The original reason I wasn&#x27;t sold on these was that while they are sharp, they wouldn&#x27;t hold an edge for more than two shaves given my tough beard (and they were 3x the price of the D.E. blades, from which I could reliably get three shaves).  Lately the &amp;#34;D.E.&amp;#34; product hasn&#x27;t been up to par, though, so I gave these another try, and will probably stick with them.  My initial comments still stand, but there&#x27;s not as much bloodshed with these as with other brands, so they&#x27;re probably worth the slightly premium price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my face. Sharp as anything, leaving a nice smooth finish.</li>
    <li> These blades are SHARP!</li>
    <li> Put the Merkur blades to shame. Much easier shave with less pulling and irritation. Just be careful with it, it&#x27;s sharp! Less weight is needed, you barely graze it against your face to shave.</li>
    <li> i have used all kinds of blades: blue birds, gillette 7o&#x27;clock, 7 o&#x27;clock black, feather blacks, astra, derby, merkur, bic, whatever you can think of, but these blade; they take the cake. I have never used blades quite like these. Although you reap the full rewards of a great shave with practice, and flawless technique, which does take time, once you get your hands on these blades your search for the best blade ends. these are it, the best blades on the market....hands down. will never waste my money on anything else. super close shave even with 2 passes, WTG and XTG. no tugging, no pulling, no irritation, no burn; just a smooth BSS shave. if you are questioning trying them, just ask yourself 2 questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Is my technique and form to the point where i have almost NO nicks? (if yes)&lt;br /&gt;2) Do i want the closest shave possible? (if yes)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy these blades. Enough said. i just bought 2x100ct of these.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best razor blades ever made.  They are very sharp and I enjoy the very close shave I get from using these blades.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with double edged blades 45 years ago.  Then along came along the double blade and triple blade razors.  Eventually, you could no longer find find double edge blades.  I finally gave in and went to the triple blade razor.  Now I can once again buy double edge blades via Amazon!  I have tried several brands and find Feather to be the sharpest.  Now for the score!  Feather blades are $0.31 each and I easily get 15 shaves per blade. The triple edge blades I use are $2.50 per blade and I get 30 plus shaves per blade.  Obviously the feather blades are much cheaper....but.....I would rather use the triple blade razor.  After being away from using my old Gillette adjustable razor for years, I find it hard to go back.  It takes twice as long to shave and I&#x27;m back to the occassional &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t missed for years.  The triple blade razor wins for me because it is far faster and gives a much closer shave. (Boy! That sounds like a 1960&#x27;s commerial).  But, for the price and quality you still can&#x27;t beat these Feather blades.  I will use them for that &amp;#34;nostelgic&amp;#34; shave.</li>
    <li> From all the reviews I read these blades were supposed to b sharp WOW they were!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been wet shaving with a Double edge now for about 2 years and always used Merkur  blades but always felt I needed sharper blades as I shave every other day and my beard is very&lt;br /&gt;Course !! So I had finally used up my 200 Merkur blades so I read all the reviews and ended up ordering the feathers they are by far exactly what I needed they glide much easier and no tugging on the hairs with minimal pressure ! These blades will b with me for a long time ! I see no need to try any others. All I can say if you have a course beard&lt;br /&gt;And need SHARP blades these are your answer  1 note I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these&lt;br /&gt;Blades 4 a beginning double edge shaver&#x27;s as they are extremely sharp !!!&lt;br /&gt;As I found out the hard way !! First time in a year I had to pull out my styptic&lt;br /&gt;Pencil  for a nick 😧</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other blades.  Some believe they&#x27;re too sharp (ummmm hello, they&#x27;re &amp;#34;razor blades ...) but I&#x27;ve been using them since I started wet shaving (safety razor) and haven&#x27;t had any issue (learning to slow the process down was the only hurdle).  My stubble, especially around my chin, is especially coarse, so I just use the blade once.  But I&#x27;ve heard of others dropping them into rubbing alcohol and using them multiple times.  I would never go back to a cartridge razor.  Between cost and the pulling of the hairs (which is what causes the razor rash in the first place), just not worth it.</li>
    <li> Ultra sharp blades that works well with Edwin Jagger DB98</li>
    <li> The Feather blade is simply the sharpest I have found and gives the best shave around. When used with the Feather razor I get the best shave ever. I have tried lots of blades and for me and my face I can only use these or the Crystal brand blade. Anything else does not give me a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended product.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades and the only kind I trust my face to.</li>
    <li> I just recently got into shaving with a safety razor.  I wanted to leave behind the expense of replacement cartridges for the Gillette and Schick razors I used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with Feather blades based on the positive reputation they have on the internet and in reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a unit price of 0.32 per razor, these really are a tremendous value.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results and durability.  They are incredibly sharp and give you an extremely close shave when paired with a nice shave cream like Proraso.  I usually replace each blade at the end of the week, though honestly they could probably last an additional week if I pushed them since I don&#x27;t grow a thick beard and only need to shave every two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can argue with a year&#x27;s worth of high quality shaving blades for 15.99, especially when you consider how much those packs of replacement cartridges cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really not that hard to shave with a safety razor, nor does it take any longer than a conventional multi-blade razor.  Do yourself a favor:  pick up a pack of 50 Feather blades, a Merkur razor, a reasonable shaving brush, and Proraso.  You will get a nice shave and save a ton of money.  Nothing beats telling Gillette and Schick to go pound sand with their overpriced garbage.</li>
    <li> These get the job done. Thanks, Fast shipping also!</li>
    <li> I had read many reviews commenting on the fact that the blades were too sharp...... They are perfect!! Absolutely no pulling or tugging, and I can use one blade for a full week. Although they are more expensive they last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Feather, I will never use another blade.</li>
    <li> These work incredibly well. The blades that came with my razor were worthless compared to these. I will be buying these exclusively from now on.</li>
    <li> As advertised these work great.  I use them 3-4 times each.  Never tried another brand.  Cartridge blades are expensive baloney.</li>
    <li> these are great blades , i get 5 shaves from one blade......feather blades for me and no other.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Feather razor blades for a while now. I find them to do a fantastic job for shaving!</li>
    <li> Nice sharp blades that don&#x27;t nick. Delivery took a while, but with a few blades in reserve, you should be fine.</li>
    <li> Switching over from Astra blades to the Feather DE blades on my Edwin Jagger DE89 gave my wet-shaving experience the extra smoothness I was looking for. These things are WAY sharper than any blade I have ever used (on a safety-razor). Until I started using these blades, I hadn&#x27;t nicked myself in months. These things require you to really have good technique, and keep the blade angle at 30 degrees at all times, but you are rewarded with a much closer shave with much less passes.</li>
    <li> Best blades i&#x27;ve bought...ever.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a large batch of these blades.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> These blades just work. Tried Astra before and came back again to these. $.31 a blade I can change weekly and will be way ahead of the Gillette cost by 8 weeks. No going back to those overpriced things IMHO. Love shaving again old school. Wife loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I have been a wet-shaver ever since I became a metrosexual back in 2000 and I had always heard about the Japanese Feather brand of razor blades but I never considered buying them and with the Altra blades insteads... that DEFINITELY was a mistake because they don&#x27;t cut very well and they are very tinny, they ABSOLUTELY SUCK in my opinion and and I would have gone with the Personna blades or even the Merkur blades but I just didn&#x27;t think about it at the time...&lt;br /&gt;  So needing new blades to shave my thick, Pancho-Villa style beard and moustache I went with these blades and my God I am SATISFIED... these cut like NO OTHER, they have the razor-sharp blades of a Murasame or Masumune samourai blade and I LOVE THEM!!!  I will be meeting my friend Richard tomorrow for lunch and I will shave my beard clean and with these blades that will be no effort at all!  Thank God for the Japanese, BANZAI NIPPON!!!</li>
    <li> Super sharp so you better know how to wet shave, i wouldnt use them until you&#x27;ve got your technique down and maybe in a razor thats not too aggressive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor</li>
    <li> Top quality ... and very, very sharp and durable. I&#x27;ve used other blades with mixed satisfaction, some pulled noticeably, some weren&#x27;t consistent from blade to blade, some were only good for 3 or 4 shaves. I&#x27;ll get from 6 to 8 shaves with one blade. These are worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Been waffling back and forth between Feathers and Personna&#x27;s for a while. Feathers are dramatically sharper, Personnas are way more durable. I have exceptionally coarse hair and I only shave about once a week, the personnas were holding up but giving me a fair amount of burn. I went back to Feathers after about a year of Personnas and that problem is fixed, however I only get one shave per blade.</li>
    <li> Fantastic blades. The best. But be warned, they&#x27;re super-sharp.</li>
    <li> Whether you love or hate these depends chiefly on your razor, your technique, and your choice of shave cream/soap. The biggest factor is the razor. Different razors have different sized gaps and impose varying angles on the blades, meaning different razors let your skin meet the blade differently. Some razors are very mild, others quite ferocious. In a Merkur 34C, or a Gillette Super Speed, or a Feather, or a Merkur Progress on a low setting, Feather blades are great. Sharp, comfortable, durable. In a more aggressive razor, they leave my face a bloody mess, the irritation lasts for days. I love these blades when I put them in a razor that&#x27;s mild. In a razor that&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s like shaving with a cheese grater.</li>
    <li> I was using Gillette platinum before I switched to feather blades and I&#x27;m glad I switched. The blades extra sharp edge provides and very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Shave better, look less like a trendy Lumbersexual. These are an old reliable blade.</li>
    <li> Feather makes great blades. These shave as close as multi blade razors but with less irritation.</li>
    <li> Sharpest blades I&#x27;ve ever used--I&#x27;ve only used Merkur, Wilkinson&#x27;s, and these.  They will also cut you easier if you are not being careful.  That goes without saying</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hardcore Feather enthusiast. These are great blades at a great price!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, can get three great shaves.</li>
