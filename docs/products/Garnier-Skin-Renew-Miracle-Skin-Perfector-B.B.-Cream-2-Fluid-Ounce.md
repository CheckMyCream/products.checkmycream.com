      <li>Lightweight, good coverage!</li>
      <li>(Lol)</li>
      <li>but great coverage</li>
      <li>After hearing great reviews from YouTube, I decided to purchase the Garnier BB cream.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, been using for over a year.</li>
      <li>Excellant customer servoce and a great product.</li>
      <li>product has amazing coverage!</li>
      <li>Perhaps more cooler storage is all it needs but just wanted to add that from a travelling perspective, best to store in a ziplock...</li>
      <li>but, good coverage, great for combo or oily skin, lasts all day</li>
      <li>I like the way this cream sits on my skin although the shade is rather fair.</li>
      <li>: No breakouts or anything of the sort; good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s QUITE as good for my oily skin compared to the Smashbox BB and CC creams, but at $12.99 for 2 oz compared to $39 or $42 for 1 oz</li>
      <li>I ended up buying the Garnier Combo/Oily BB cream after reading some good things about it on the internet.</li>
      <li>The light to medium is great too, giving you a great canvas to where you can use bronzer/colored powder to get the desired color.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Goes on great, and blends easily.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>It has AMAZING coverage as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on kind of &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;, but it blends in nicely and leaves your skin feeling smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice coverage.</li>
      <li>good product light weight</li>
      <li>Nivea pure effect clean deeper soap along with the tonic and the cream, they make the perfect team for save the day if you are a girl with oily face.</li>
      <li>It feels very comfortable and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so so in love</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I think I like it, it seems nice and light</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Great for those days when you don&#x27;t want to wear much makeup.</li>
      <li>but the coverage is about a million times better.</li>
      <li>I added some finishing powder on top.</li>
      <li>You can do better</li>
      <li>I love that this is a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than a tinted moisturizer in that respect.</li>
      <li>I love this bb cream, much better than the reg one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I thought the color match was pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Not thick and flawless, but good and basic, allowing skin to breath.</li>
      <li>I applied it over my face and it did do a pretty good job at lightly covering up redness and evening out the skin tone.</li>
      <li>Upon opening the cap of the tube I immediately noticed that this is a very watery and runny cream which I think is a good thing, because it makes it easier to apply.</li>
      <li>Although coverage is not as great, provided decent coverage without being too oily like its original counterpart.</li>
      <li>This BB cream is light, non greasy but offers great BB coverage.</li>
      <li>If this shade is too dark for you, which it is when I am not tanned, then mix it with the light to medium to customize the shade that best suits you.  </li>
      <li>but it blends in easily and smoothly.</li>
      <li>I bought this product instead of the Super Goop!</li>
      <li>So the next day I put the bb cream on and checked in my bathroom mirror and everything looked great</li>
      <li>Had some problems receiving my item and they shipped me anothwr one free of charge.</li>
      <li>This one is cheap for a reason.</li>
      <li>I thought it was too light</li>
      <li>but it was too light.</li>
      <li>use the light in the winter and medium in the summer.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product, but so far no all in one product exists.  </li>
      <li>I offered it to my teenage daughter who is much lighter skinned then me and matched her perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I will NEVER go back to foundation, and this BB is by far the best one ever.  </li>
      <li>I bought this about a month ago and so far I love it!</li>
      <li>Be advised that this is very liquidy, which makes it glide on very smoothly with a brush.  </li>
      <li>Its a moisturizer and at the same time provides good coverage.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t do a full coverage i.e. you do need your concealer/foundation for something like that</li>
      <li>Coverage is medium to full..</li>
      <li>In conclusion I would recommend this product as a cheap and easy way to cover blemishes, protect skin from sun and provide a somewhat reliable oil absorbing agent.</li>
      <li>also have super oily skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly rated by a couple of MUA YouTube bloggers like &amp;#34;WhatWouldLizzyDo&amp;#34; among many.</li>
      <li>The runny product goes on my skin pretty smoothly but as soon as I put it on I can feel and see the oil on my T zone.</li>
      <li>I like to consistency of the Combination skin version much better than the Normal Skin one.</li>
      <li>However there are some great things about this bb cream like it covers blemishes really well, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t make your face oily.</li>
      <li>Overall I love this product!</li>
      <li>I will be back for more!</li>
      <li>really worked miracles on my skin to correct the dark spots from breakouts in just a few applications, very good coverage, smells great, not too oily....</li>
      <li>It covers very well, and glides on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Once you blotch you can really see the oil absorb onto the paper towel and you can go another couple hours shine free.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth trying.  </li>
      <li>If you have extremely oily skin, then I would recommend just putting a powder over it, and you should be good to go..  </li>
      <li>Just the right mix of moisture and cover.  </li>
      <li>The color is kind of orange, which is okay on my yellow toned Asian skin.</li>
      <li>I was surprised a BB cream give me such a good coverage, just like a foundation.</li>
      <li>Oily skin is a great choice for people with Normal to slightly Oily skin who want lighter coverage and a lighter feel than they get with foundation.</li>
      <li>Oily skin is a great choice for people with Normal to slightly Oily skin who want lighter coverage and a lighter feel than they get with foundation.</li>
      <li>I could not believe I had been walking around all confident looking like my face was red!</li>
      <li>It does have a pretty matte finish when you first apply it though.</li>
      <li>Im a avid tanner.</li>
      <li>Love the coverage for such lightweight product.</li>
      <li>I was expecting coverage to be more like a tinted moisturizer, but I would put I would put coverage at a solid medium.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use A LOT of different foundations and this is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>Because the coverage is so good, I think it could make color matching a bit more complicated than a more sheer BB cream.</li>
      <li>Because the coverage is so good, I think it could make color matching a bit more complicated than a more sheer BB cream.</li>
      <li>If you have oily skin, this is your nev best friend, also if you are a beginner in makeup, or just hate all that of foundation, contouring and more, this works as a foundation, sunscreen, and hydrate cream, also</li>
      <li>I decided to buy the medium/deep shade, because when I first found the light to medium shade in my local drugstore</li>

    <li> If you have oily skin, this is your nev best friend, also if you are a beginner in makeup, or just hate all that of foundation, contouring and more, this works as a foundation, sunscreen, and hydrate cream, also Nivea pure effect clean deeper soap along with the tonic and the cream, they make the perfect team for save the day if you are a girl with oily face.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this for me after seeing it used on Utube. I ordered medium/deep andd unfortunately it was far to light for me. Im a avid tanner. So that kinda sucked for me butt I offered it to my teenage daughter who is much lighter skinned then me and matched her perfectly. Shes lovvvin it now. (Lol)</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I bought the medium/dark in color as I am pretty dark but it seemed a bit too dark.  I just bought the light/medium at my local Walmart but it was too light.</li>
    <li> I think I like it, it seems nice and light and I like the idea of a sunscreen.  My skin does seem to be breaking out a bit but it has been really humid so it might not be the fault of the product.</li>
    <li> This product is just as advertised. It works so much better than heavy and very expensive foundation makeup. I would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> good product light weight but, good coverage, great for combo or oily skin, lasts all day</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream sits on my skin although the shade is rather fair. But it becomes oily within an hour and causes me pimples. I still have almost a full tube left. It was not very expensive but still...</li>
    <li> This product is great! I definitely noticed that it gives the skin a more even tone and covers up imperfections or dark spots well.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have kinda dry skin and I hated it! I bought this foundation and it&#x27;s amazing!! It mousterizes my face and it doesn&#x27;t look dry and flakey anymore! It has AMAZING coverage as well. It looks airbrushed almost. I literally get complements on my skin everyday and get asked what foundation I use. I&#x27;ve use A LOT of different foundations and this is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> I am a young male and have very oily and blemished skin due to acne and was in search for a BB cream that could not only lightly cover blemishes but also provide oil absorbing agents. Prior to using this BB cream I had tried a couple of others including the Proactiv BB cream and they all left me with a somewhat shiny complexion and it only got worst throughout the day. After hearing great reviews from YouTube, I decided to purchase the Garnier BB cream. After arrival of the BB cream the next day I decided to try it and see for myself. Upon opening the cap of the tube I immediately noticed that this is a very watery and runny cream which I think is a good thing, because it makes it easier to apply. I applied it over my face and it did do a pretty good job at lightly covering up redness and evening out the skin tone. I ordered the Medium/Deep because I have a medium/dark skin tone and the cream seemed somewhat lighter, however, after blending into my skin it almost matched my color. Upon putting the BB cream I noticed that my complexion was not shiny instead it looked matte. Also I should mention that using this BB cream did not make me break out at all and recommend this cream for acne prone skin. One downfall that I did notice however is that since I have acne prone skin I do tend to shed skin at higher rates even though I exfoliate two times a day, therefore, if I do not apply moisturizer before using this cream it tends to look really cakey and  flakey on the dead skin or on top of pimples. However, if you moisturize and exfoliate it should not be too much of a problem. As far as the oil absorbing agents go it did absorb much of the oil for about 4 hours, but after 4 hours I could see a shine start to build up on my T-Zone. Also you might want to keep this cream away from your eye area, because while it does cover dark spots it also tends to make your eyes red and watery if you wear it too long. One of the tricks that I learned is to go to the restroom and get drypaper towels and blotch the oil don&#x27;t rub because it makes the BB cream fall off. Once you blotch you can really see the oil absorb onto the paper towel and you can go another couple hours shine free. In conclusion I would recommend this product as a cheap and easy way to cover blemishes, protect skin from sun and provide a somewhat reliable oil absorbing agent.</li>
    <li> Although coverage is not as great, provided decent coverage without being too oily like its original counterpart. I did not find it watery like other reviews mentioned.</li>
    <li> Garnier Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector Bb Cream, Combination To Oily is perfect for my combination  skin which even in my 60s is blemish prone.  Just the right mix of moisture and cover.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It feels sticky after applying it on my face. I have a wheatish brown complexion and i purchased a medium shade, but the color doesn&#x27;t match well with my skin.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed, because i received another bb cream. I ordered garnier bb cream for combination to oil skin, medium / deep, and the one i received was the old one version in light/ medium tone.. So, i am very upset because this is not what i ordered</li>
    <li> Coverage is medium to full.. My skin is medium, not as light as my other friends even though I&#x27;m an Asian. I decided to buy the medium/deep shade, because when I first found the light to medium shade in my local drugstore I thought it was too light but they didn&#x27;t have the darker shade , so I purchased the medium to deep shade on Amazon. First I thought it was too dark and give my skin a yellowish feeling. But I decided to give it some more tries. I was surprised a BB cream give me such a good coverage, just like a foundation.</li>
    <li> amazing product!! really worked miracles on my skin to correct the dark spots from breakouts in just a few applications, very good coverage, smells great, not too oily....totally met my expectations!!!</li>
    <li> Initially when  I tried this I was switching from MAC trying to give my face a break from the usual routine of moisturizer, prep+prime, fix it, and mineralize; followed by a usual routine of blush and mascara.  However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my face feels extremely dry and dehydrated.  I may have to use a moisturizer with this product, I did buy the combination to oily skin as my skin is combination; however I think stopping my moisturizer in hopes of getting an all in one product was not a good idea.  This is a good product, but so far no all in one product exists.  I may try the normal BB cream for normal skin; however according to reviews it is oily.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream, much better than the reg one. It does not make your skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> ****Combination To Oily..*******Garnier Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector Bb Cream, Combination To Oily..is the best BB cream yet.&lt;br /&gt;I use the light in the winter and medium in the summer.  Yes I do go in the sun. This BB cream is light, non greasy but offers great BB coverage. No orange tones on my skin.</li>
    <li> I received this product awhile ago, and it does not help with oily and combination skin what so ever!&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and believe it or not, this made it so ,such more oily and not to forget, it has made my face break out bad. :(&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, my skin was much nicer when I was using BB foundation for normal skin!&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend if you have oily/combo and some what sensitive skin because it is not worth the break outs.</li>
    <li> I like using BB creams for days when I want the natural, no-makeup look. The Garnier ones work well for that purpose. They don&#x27;t do a full coverage i.e. you do need your concealer/foundation for something like that but if you want some basic coverage that neutralizes any redness, reduces visibility of spots etc, this works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses: neutral/no-makeup look; covers up readness&lt;br /&gt;Lasts: I&#x27;d say 5-6 hours; after that sometimes seems splotchy....&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No breakouts or anything of the sort; good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have&#x27;t noticed it yet with this particular one, but in the past with the previous version of this product, I found that the tube sort of tended to be spill out the minute you opened it. Perhaps more cooler storage is all it needs but just wanted to add that from a travelling perspective, best to store in a ziplock...</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Had some problems receiving my item and they shipped me anothwr one free of charge. Excellant customer servoce and a great product.</li>
    <li> I was using this product for three months and thought it was the best bb cream ever, but I was totally wrong! Me and my twin have the same skin and we often share the same make up and I noticed as we were walking to school her face looked red and asked her if she was wearing powder over it but she said no. So the next day I put the bb cream on and checked in my bathroom mirror and everything looked great but when I checked in the mirror outside my face look red like it had been sunburned (by the way I use the medium deep one). I could not believe I had been walking around all confident looking like my face was red! The fluorescent lighting in lightbulbs will trick you, like it did me.I am very disappointed about this product. However there are some great things about this bb cream like it covers blemishes really well, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t make your face oily. If you do but it go outside in natural lighting to see if it really looks like your natural shade.</li>
    <li> The box was damaged when I received it and the product did not live up to the hype.  The limited colour range did not match my skin tone and made me look like a corpse.  Back to the lab Garnier, African American skin is unique and the shades and undertones varied.  You can do better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good bbcream!!!</li>
    <li> The color is kind of orange, which is okay on my yellow toned Asian skin. But I do have combination/oily skin and I had high hopes for this product&#x27;s claim to &amp;#34;control shine&amp;#34;. The runny product goes on my skin pretty smoothly but as soon as I put it on I can feel and see the oil on my T zone. I bought this product instead of the Super Goop! CC cream because it was 1/3 the price... This one is cheap for a reason.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Its a moisturizer and at the same time provides good coverage. Great for those days when you don&#x27;t want to wear much makeup. Just put this on and a little mascara and you are done!</li>
    <li> this is the best BB cream EVER !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m so so so in love and this is a must have&lt;br /&gt;just do not forget to set it with BANANA loose powder !</li>
    <li> Looks good in home mirrow but not good in daylight.</li>
    <li> Best BB cream! Love the coverage for such lightweight product. Lasts me for hours. It&#x27;s highly rated by a couple of MUA YouTube bloggers like &amp;#34;WhatWouldLizzyDo&amp;#34; among many. Lightweight, good coverage!</li>
    <li> Bye bye oily, caky skin, this BB is awsome, I really see the difference with each use. I&#x27;ll  recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is the first time in my 30 years in this world that a beauty product actually do what it says will do, WOW!</li>
    <li> This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I absolutely love this stuff.  It does what it says it does.  It does not feel heavy or look cakey on my skin. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I started with the light/medium shade earlier in the year and just moved to the darker color. I like to consistency of the Combination skin version much better than the Normal Skin one. Goes on great, and blends easily. I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> This is much lighter (color) than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I bought assuming it would be the same results as on TV and not even close. I will not buy again. What a waste of money...</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago and so far I love it! It has replaced my old foundation, I will never use it again since I have this.&lt;br /&gt;This product has amazing coverage! About the same amount as my foundation, however, it doesn&#x27;t feel very thick on my skin at all. It just feels like my skin. The formula is very liquidy so I was very surprised with the amount of coverage it gave. The medium to deep is a bit dark for my NC 30 skin, but after I set it with a powder it matches.&lt;br /&gt;I also have super oily skin and I find that this controls that for about and hour or two and then I get shiny again. But I also have terrible oily skin, nothing ever seems to get rid of it completely so I wasn&#x27;t that disappointed. It does have a pretty matte finish when you first apply it though. Overall I love this product! I would give it an 8 out of 10 (: only because I wish it kept my skin matte all day.</li>
    <li> I love that this is a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on kind of &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;, but it blends in nicely and leaves your skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;20SPF is great to protect you from sun damages.&lt;br /&gt;enjoy!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, been using for over a year. Nice coverage. Not thick and flawless, but good and basic, allowing skin to breath.</li>
    <li> It covers very well, and glides on smoothly.  It definitely does all it claims.  I will NEVER go back to foundation, and this BB is by far the best one ever.  Be advised that this is very liquidy, which makes it glide on very smoothly with a brush.  It hold all day long, and doesn&#x27;t make you shine.  If you have extremely oily skin, then I would recommend just putting a powder over it, and you should be good to go..  Definitely worth trying.  If this shade is too dark for you, which it is when I am not tanned, then mix it with the light to medium to customize the shade that best suits you.  The light to medium is great too, giving you a great canvas to where you can use bronzer/colored powder to get the desired color. Back to this one medium to deep, if too dark, either mix with light to medium, or use a light colored powder ... preferably translucent loose powder.  Truly a great BB cream!!!</li>
    <li> doesnt stay on very long maximum is like 5 hours even with primer.. but great coverage</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Fresh face, sunscreen, and the amount of product lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> I ended up buying the Garnier Combo/Oily BB cream after reading some good things about it on the internet. I was confused about color but chose Medium/Dark. I actually have light medium skin (foundation color matches for me are Estee Lauder Double Wear in Tawny 3W1, Estee Lauder Double Wear Light in Intensity 3 (slightly dark for me), Mac NC30, Mac Mineralize Skinfinish in Medium Plus, Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation in Medium, and Light Medium in the Smashbox BB (slightly dark for me) and CC creams and Lancome Teint Idole Ultra 24 H in 330 Bisque - N). Looking at the list, I appear to be a foundation junkie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I thought the color match was pretty good.  I wanted Light/Medium but ended up getting Medium/Deep because Light/Medium was out of stock.  Medium/Deep looked dark coming out of the tube, but it blended so well it wasn&#x27;t a problem. It&#x27;ll be perfect in summer when I get darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage was FAR better than expected. I was expecting coverage to be more like a tinted moisturizer, but I would put I would put coverage at a solid medium. It&#x27;s about equal to the Smashbox in terms of coverage and a LOT better than the Too Faced or Urban Decay BB Creams that I&#x27;ve sampled. My skin is pretty clear but I have hyperpigmentation from past breakouts and it really evened out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was REALLY surprised by how liquidy this is but it blends in easily and smoothly. A little goes a long way. If you&#x27;ve tried the Urban Decay BB Cream, the texture is liquidy like that one but the coverage is about a million times better. I added some finishing powder on top. It feels very comfortable and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s QUITE as good for my oily skin compared to the Smashbox BB and CC creams, but at $12.99 for 2 oz compared to $39 or $42 for 1 oz that&#x27;s ok. I found myself getting shiny sooner than I&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s better than a tinted moisturizer in that respect. I haven&#x27;t done this yet, but I suspect that a mattifying primer will extend wear.  SPF is 20.  If I were to spend all day outside, I&#x27;d add Neutrogena Dry Touch SPF 45 underneath, as I&#x27;d do with any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Garnier BB Cream for Combination/Oily skin is a great choice for people with Normal to slightly Oily skin who want lighter coverage and a lighter feel than they get with foundation. I think it&#x27;s probably too hydrating for moderately to extremely oily people like me without a primer and finishing powder. As for colors, that could be a challenge. Because the coverage is so good, I think it could make color matching a bit more complicated than a more sheer BB cream. There are only 3 or 4 colors.will extend wear.  SPF is 20.

    <li> Not the same formula as it is in store. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> All it did was make my skin extremely oily, and didn&#x27;t match my skin tone.</li>
    <li> It is so great... 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Does nothing for oily skin, it was a waste of money.</li>
