<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great moisturizer but zero noticeable firming. I&#x27;ll stick with Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter skin firming lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this regularly but see no difference. It smells good and is a good cream but see no tightening effect.</li>
    <li> Smells good, anything else really depends on the user</li>
    <li> hi .. excellent very good …thank you for your business …  fast deliver...</li>
    <li> works good, nice fresh scent</li>
    <li> keeps your skin super soft better than kiehl&#x27;s</li>
    <li> The smell is still very strong. I was hoping that maybe at some point they would make one that has a scent that would make you want to wear it more. Because of the strong scent it is hard for me to use.</li>
    <li> I decided to use this because I am currently on my way to getting healthy. I could tell after two weeks that my skin was doing a lot better than it was when I wasn&#x27;t using the lotion. I worked out for 2 months before I started using this and I could tell my skin was getting loose from the weight loss. After two weeks of using the lotion I could tell that skin was starting to adjust better to the weight loss. I know its not going to make skin tight but it has definitely helped in firming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use two pumps for my stomach, one pump for my bum, and another pump for my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Nivea gel version, but I didn&#x27;t feel it was doing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Firms but doesn’t give “tightening feel”</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the cost...I didn&#x27;t notice this lotion doing anything, and it is very thin like a normal lotion, I would have expected it to be thick and more moisturizing, less liquid.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this lotion based on the positive reviews- I attributed the negative reviews to people having sensitive skin. I have never reacted badly to a skin product and I&#x27;ve used a ton of different kinds, so I felt confident that I wouldn&#x27;t have any problems with this product either. Wrong! After a few days I developed a frightening rash on the front and inside of my thighs that extended up onto my hips and down past my knees. It was angry and red, but didn&#x27;t itch. I assumed it was from dry brushing a little too vigorously. My boyfriend, having already informed me that the smell of this lotion was &amp;#34;not his favorite&amp;#34;, suggested it was the lotion causing the rash. I thought he just wanted me to stop using it because he didn&#x27;t like the smell, so, like the genius I am, I kept using the lotion. It took me another two days or so to finally admit that the redness was from this stuff. After I stopped using it, my skin turned flaky and now my legs look like I am in the middle of metamorphing into a lizard. I&#x27;m not sure which is more unattractive, the rash or the flaky reptile skin that came next, but I AM sure that I won&#x27;t be using this lotion ever again.</li>
    <li> Best  on the market in my view.</li>
    <li> This lotion works very well on my skin. I am glad to find it available as a subscribe and save item on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great lotion. Feels nice and does a pretty good job at reducing my extreme dryness. Isn&#x27;t oily. The consistency is great.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  I have very dry skin and it keeps my skin hydrated. I&#x27;m pretty sure the Q10 also works as I get many compliments on my skin :). Really ladies, I you are already applying lotion, why not use the one that will keep your skin firm.</li>
    <li> I did post a good review on the Wal-mart website BUT it won&#x27;t let me change it and I feel people should know. I did really like this lotion to begin with but for some reason after I shave my legs I get an awful itchy razor burn like rash after I use this lotion. It has happened twice. The first time  I thought it was this lotion but it was also winter so I thought maybe I just got bad dry skin....so I stopped using this on my legs for quite some time. I just started using it on my legs again and shaved and the same thing happened! It&#x27;s odd to me because I use this on my arms, chest area and butt and don&#x27;t have a rash, even though sometimes I do seem to be red like a sunburn and itchy on my chest, but not om my arms at all. Now I need to try a different lotion because my legs itch like crazy and have razor burn-like red bumps. Also I must add I don&#x27;t regularly get razor burn. And I really haven&#x27;t noticed any firming action either. It also sometimes did feel a little sticky, I think maybe that&#x27;s because I put on too much. I do have sensitive skin I guess so if you do, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has a horribly strong menthol scent that will give you a headache if you use too much. The scent is so strong it makes my bedding and clothes have a hint of menthol scent to them. I noticed I began developing a small red rash and I had only been using it a couple of days.I won&#x27;t buy it again and I wont recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion very hydrating without a greasy feel. I bruise easily and I think the Q10 helps the bruises heal</li>
    <li> This lotion is so nice!  It has a very silky feel and soaks directly into your skin.  I haven&#x27;t noticed the skin firming abilities yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so far.</li>
    <li> My skin tightening regimen began with Nivea&#x27;s *other* skin firming gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Nivea Skin Firming &amp;#34;Cellulite&amp;#34; Gel two months ago for my post-pregnancy belly. I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight in the past year, plus having given birth 15 months ago, I had excess skin that needed help returning to its original &amp;#34;pre-baby&amp;#34; shape. I work out regularly, lots of cardio and toning- there was definitely muscle underneath the skin. The only reason I originally went to the cellulite gel was because it seemed it would help me with my stretch marks in the same area, as well.  I didn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;cellulite&amp;#34; on my stomach, but the skin was imprinted and needed repair to regain smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within two days of using the cellulite gel, twice per day, my stomach looked &amp;#34;beach ready&amp;#34;.  I was highly impressed and my confidence shot through the roof.  Well... then I ran out of the gel.  So, I ordered this &amp;#34;sister&amp;#34; lotion (which I&#x27;m reviewing now). The only difference between the two appears to be the cellulite description and the gel consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion goes on like any lotion, doesn&#x27;t have any particular smell to it , not strong at all, compared to many other lotions. It does some tightening of the skin. But, compared to the gel of the prior cellulite cream, my stomach has lost some of the toned appearance- despite increasing my cardio and toning regimen since starting any kind of skin tightening creams. I use this lotion 3-4 times per day and still am not getting close to the same impressive results that I had with the other Nivea gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... long and short is, this stuff works. But I highly recommend the Nivea skin firming cellulite gel over this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect lotion. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, but it still leaves my skin refreshed. This is the perfect lotion for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to try some other brands that have the same coQ10 firming ingredient. Either their scents were strange, or they didn&#x27;t glide on with the same ease as the Nivea. It&#x27;s really easy to quickly rub all over your body. The fresh smell is great but not lingering, and it&#x27;s probably the best value out there.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results as far as the firming goes but it is a good moisturizer. Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use it.  I don&#x27;t think it feels greasy.  I can&#x27;t answer as far as firming since I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> Better than other lotions. Worth the extra and last longer as you use less than the cheaper stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Use S&amp;S to save extra</li>
    <li> This cream is a dream!  Soaks into the skin with no greasy residue and a nice smell. Its all I use.  And of course cant beat. Amazon pricing !</li>
    <li> I have really dry and sensitive skin and this lotion is very very good on my skin. i was skeptical at first because the lotion seems a a little watery compared to other lotions i have used but i was blown away by the results. All i have to say is that you know you have great lotion if you never have to reapply it during the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea Skin Firming Hydration Body Lotion at the suggestion of a friend for over a year.  I used it first to firm up some areas on my body.  It can be used as a hydration body lotion which provides moisture, firming lotion which works on firmer areas of the body, face, skin that could use assistance, or just as a lotion to use daily.  My mother started using Nivea on my skin from childhood, which I have been using throughout my adulthood.  I have tried numerous Nivea products, although I did not try this product, until a friend suggested it to me based on the results she has received from this product.  I can state that this product, as well as other Nivea products work miraculously on my body, and I have seen great results over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for this lotion on the Amazon website is a better price than what I have seen in major, surrounding, and neighborhood discounts stores. The packaging was great; the lotion can go a long way, since much is not necessary.  The quality of this lotion is seen in the results to your skin, and there is no fragrance in this lotion.  The delivery was on time, and I am very happy with this product.  I would recommend anyone looking for a lotion that has many different uses to give Nivea Skin Firming Hydration Body Lotion a try.  Thanks Nivea, a product you can trust!</li>
    <li> I love this cream...smell wonderfull ans suprisingly is not stick...thanks nivea now i wanna buy the only specialize in cellulite when the price goes down...or there is a deal!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I live in Colorado and our humidity gets very low; this helps a lot and I like the smell!</li>
    <li> have tried several cremes and really like the nivea  Q10 creme</li>
    <li> I decided to spoil myself and order this moisturizer. Being Disabled it&#x27;s hard to get to the store like I want well I am so pleased that I did. It does as advertised and more and has such a pleasent scent. Trust me you&#x27;ll feel good naked!</li>
    <li> This is just one of the best lotions I have ever used.  Very hydrating and I also have noticed an improvement in the tone of my skin.  I have included this item as a subscribe and save monthly purchase with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!! It is my favorite and Costco used to sell it and they don&#x27;t anymore and it is so expensive at the store, so I ordered it online and it is just the same!!</li>
    <li> Love it! This is the only lotion my husband and I will use. Saw dramatic difference in skin tone in only a few weeks. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Get rid of micro-wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on a whim, and I have been pleasantly surprised. I had a baby a year ago and my skin has changed. I also lost a lot of weight and I too noticed the crepe paper look appearing. I started using the cream once a day and have noticed a big difference. I also was left with tiny little stretch marks around my belly button and it seems to help smooth those out as well. Im a highly allergic individual and so far have not had a reaction.</li>
    <li> Bad bad bad itchy red bumpy rash!! At first I didn&#x27;t make the connection with the lotion but after today&#x27;s rash worsened and reading other reviewers experience, I&#x27;m convinced this lotion is causing it. I bought it at my local Taget. Throwing it away!</li>
    <li> I truly love this lotion. You can not find a better skin firming lotion on the market for the price.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Keeps my skin soft and smooth! I will no use anything else but this and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a month now, here are my findings: acne and no results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) This lotion is making me break out. I have acne break outs anywhere I&#x27;ve used the lotion. Plus, I can&#x27;t think of anything else that has changed to give me acne. I&#x27;m really annoyed because now I&#x27;m spending money on acne lotion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) And, I don&#x27;t see any &#x27;firming&#x27; anything. I have used firming lotions before that made a difference. I thought it was Nivea but I think it was St. Ives.</li>
    <li> This feels so light and leaves skin smelling fresh.  It does seem to help tighten skin. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a cellulite cream, but general skin tightening in arms and thighs.  There is a subtle but nice difference after just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell.  It&#x27;s not a heavy lotion - very light and moisturizing - just smells to flowery!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells AMAZING and makes my skin feel sooooo soft after I use it. I haven&#x27;t seen signs of firming yet, however I&#x27;m still so relieved that it still does something great, MOISTURIZE!!!! and it especially helps now due to the cold weather we have now in the winter.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! Firms my skin and also great for dry skin. I use it everyday! I can&amp;#34;t imagine not using it!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this &amp; her skin DOES feel smoother.</li>
    <li> Very good and not greasy</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. Not sure about the firming aspect on skin but it leaves a soft feeling.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel good. I don&#x27;t se it often enough to see firming though</li>
    <li> This lotion was heaven for about a week.  Seriously the best lotion I have ever used.  It was too good to be true.  After about a week, I developed a rash on the inside of my arms and lower legs.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to a skin product, so I&#x27;m not sure what happened.  I&#x27;m just super bummed.</li>
    <li> the price, the product. i love it. it makes my skin so smooth. i don&#x27;t know if it works on the cellulite but just the smell and softness are amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using nivea for more than 5 years now and I have no complain about any of their product thus far. I get compliment about how soft my skin is.</li>
    <li> I love Nivea lotion with the CoQ10.  It&#x27;s not overly thick which makes application easy.  It leaves winter dry skin very soft</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon but I&#x27;ve been using it for a while I use it more as a treatment not as a regular lotion twice a day on areas like under my arms and inside my thighs that have loose skin and also the gel on my face as well as my stomach I have found that it does a good job and actually was looking on Amazon for a better price then getting it in the pharmacy</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product on Amazon - I bought it in the grocery store.  However, after developing a horrible rash on my arms and legs after using the product for about a week I went online to see if others had developed a rash and I discovered hundreds of people saying they too had a rash.  Mine doesn&#x27;t seem to itch though....it&#x27;s just unsightly and I hope it will go away!</li>
    <li> great everyday lotion to help firm skin!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the BOMB! It keeps my skin hydrated, soft, and actually reduced the cellulite on my thighs (while following a work-out regime). I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product, Good value</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer. My family love this lotion. It hydrates, smooths and gives your skin a youthful glow.</li>
    <li> I am usually a fan of Nivea products.&lt;br /&gt;This one gave me a nasty red bumpy rash on my upper chest area that lasted for days, after only using it once.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d seen the other reviews that mentioned this before I bought it.</li>
    <li> We met this produce over seas and were very satisfied with it and were glad to see it in the U.S.  It is perfect for dry skin and aging skin.</li>
    <li> Love this and smells great. Havent noticed firming but I have only been using it for a month. I do love and recommend the gel cream, that has really helped.</li>
    <li> I have never been brand conscious when it comes to lotion.  Whatever is cheap and meets my scent whim of the moment is usually what I end up with.  That was until I started using the Nivea, and not just any Nivea, the Skin Firming Nivea.  Now I&#x27;m sad when I travel and end up with hotel lotion or whatever is in my travel bag.  Something about this lotion just feels right.  Creamy, not watery, but not thick and greasy.</li>
    <li> I like it but not very visible firming.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a few weeks and love it.  It smells great and really seems to be starting to firm my skin.The best thing I like about this lotion is that it seems that it keeps moisturizing your skin all day.  It does not disappear like some moisturizers.  It keeps on working.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite lotions -</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a magic potion but it&#x27;s better than nothing and I feel super moisturized after one use and feel as if it just keeps things at bay, then I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I have never had an allergic reaction to any cosmetic product until this one. after 4 days i developed a very itchy red rash on all the ares i applied the lotion. I wish i knew what ingredient was causing this reaction but i DO know that i am never using it again.</li>
    <li> Nice texture and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite lotion!! She has had a hard time in the last couple of years finding it. It has a great scent to it and it leaves her skin really smooth. A bit pricey, bit that tends to happen with items that are hard to find.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product, has a light scent to it but did not notice any tightening or toning to my skin after a month and half of use. Went back to palmers firming butter</li>
    <li> love this product, one of the kind, good for winter use.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it smells really good made my skin so soft the first time I used it thanks so much</li>
