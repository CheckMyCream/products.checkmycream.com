### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with this curling iron.</li>
      <li>No clamp to make funky seams in your hair; adjustable heat; and the perfect circumference.  </li>
      <li>Great Brush Iron.  </li>
      <li>I think it will be good for travel.</li>
      <li>This is a good curling brush.</li>
      <li>Would not get another Helen of Troy product if this is a fair example of their merchandise.</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron!  </li>
      <li>it works great, i use it for my daughter a lot, she is 5, and gets a lot of tangles, and this works very well for that, and leaves her hair so pretty, i have used it on my own hair as well, and it works well, it heats up very fast, easy to use, no problems with it, have had it for a while, and still perfect.</li>
      <li>Perfect size wand for med short hair!!</li>
      <li>Helen of Troy is my favorite brand of curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many others and some have on/off switches that are in the way of my fingers as I work on my hair.  </li>
      <li>The line of teeth slipped in easily.</li>
      <li>This was very cheap feeling, did not heat up very hot.  </li>
      <li>Light weight and easy to use.</li>
      <li>H of T is my favorite brand because the irons get REALLY hot.  </li>
      <li>It is so fast and easy to use!  </li>
      <li>I know straight hair is in right now, but that just doesn&#x27;t work with my face - and this is good to get just the right amount of wave or curl.</li>
      <li>It feels and handles beautifully, it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to style quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is a good tool, especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great for short straight hair that needs curl or body.  </li>
      <li>It works but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
      <li>I like the way it works except for one thing - the rows of teeth slide out as you&#x27;re using the curling iron, and did this the very first time I used it.</li>
      <li>This one has just the right features that I need.  </li>
      <li>It does not get as hot as I would like.</li>
      <li>Pretty much no heat from this thing.</li>
      <li>Easy to use; doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, which is a huge plus because my hair is subject breakage.  </li>
      <li>You can easily get burned if you&#x27;re not careful, but I like the strong heat because my hair is poker straight and a little coarse and the HOT iron gets the job done without me having to do sections twice.</li>
      <li>These days curling irons heat up quickly and have several heat settings.</li>
      <li>They last a long time and are reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>With its low cost, light weight, and small size</li>

<li> I have fine thin long hair!</li>
<li> Even on the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting, this brush iron did not get hot enough to shape my hair, which is thick and curly.  </li>
<li> It was good at first then after couple uses the strips are sliding off the barrel terrible trying to curl my hair</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it has only low and high heat controls and takes a long time to heat up.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t say how long it takes to heat up.</li>
<li> My hair is slightly longer now, so I often use the 3/4&amp;#34; but actually switch and use both.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure that it actually heats up enough to impact hair...</li>
<li> then I run a comb through my hair to fluff up the curls.</li>
<li> It takes a few seconds of patience per curl.</li>
<li> noticed that as I turned the insulated black knob at the end, there was a wider than usual slot.  </li>
<li> These are hard to find.</li>
<li> Heats up very slowly.</li>
<li> It was impossible to tell how what temperatures corresponded to the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; settings.  </li>
<li> Others are Very awkward to use.  </li>

    <li> Very happy with this curling iron. Perfect size wand for med short hair!!</li>
    <li> Even on the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting, this brush iron did not get hot enough to shape my hair, which is thick and curly.  It was impossible to tell how what temperatures corresponded to the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; settings.  I no longer use it.</li>
    <li> This is a good curling brush. My only complaint is that it has only low and high heat controls and takes a long time to heat up. These days curling irons heat up quickly and have several heat settings.</li>
    <li> It works.  It&#x27;s  what  I  needed.</li>
    <li> This is a good tool, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;As I was using it, one line of brush &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; flew out.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that as I turned the insulated black knob at the end, there was a wider than usual slot.  I turned the knob to line up that slot with the slot on the barrel where the line of teeth should go.  The line of teeth slipped in easily.</li>
    <li> Works great for short straight hair that needs curl or body.  It does  not slip off the roller.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> It does not get as hot as I would like. With its low cost, light weight, and small size I think it will be good for travel.</li>
    <li> Pretty much no heat from this thing. Would not get another Helen of Troy product if this is a fair example of their merchandise.</li>
    <li> This was very cheap feeling, did not heat up very hot.  It did nothing on my coarse hair.  Returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> It was good at first then after couple uses the strips are sliding off the barrel terrible trying to curl my hair</li>
    <li> Helen of Troy is my favorite brand of curling iron.  I&#x27;ve used the 1/2&amp;#34; iron for a couple of years.  I tried to order the 3/4&amp;#34; version, but only recently found it in stock at Amazon.  My hair is slightly longer now, so I often use the 3/4&amp;#34; but actually switch and use both.  H of T is my favorite brand because the irons get REALLY hot.  You can easily get burned if you&#x27;re not careful, but I like the strong heat because my hair is poker straight and a little coarse and the HOT iron gets the job done without me having to do sections twice.</li>
    <li> Easy to use; doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, which is a huge plus because my hair is subject breakage.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron!  It is so fast and easy to use!  I have tried many others and some have on/off switches that are in the way of my fingers as I work on my hair.  Then my fingers touch the switch and it is off.  Others are Very awkward to use.  This one has just the right features that I need.  I bought 4 and have one at my daughter&#x27;s and one in my suitcase and a spare.  They last a long time and are reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Great Brush Iron.  This is the curling Iron I buy.  Hope they never quit making it!</li>
    <li> These are hard to find. A must have when I curl my hair. Light weight and easy to use. Get&#x27;s the job done</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  It works but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin long hair! Can&#x27;t say how long it takes to heat up. I just turn it on and about 20 minutes later curl my hair. I wait about 15 minutes then I run a comb through my hair to fluff up the curls. The curls last all day.</li>
    <li> it works great, i use it for my daughter a lot, she is 5, and gets a lot of tangles, and this works very well for that, and leaves her hair so pretty, i have used it on my own hair as well, and it works well, it heats up very fast, easy to use, no problems with it, have had it for a while, and still perfect. would hightly recommend!</li>
    <li> Heats up very slowly. I&#x27;m not sure that it actually heats up enough to impact hair...</li>
    <li> No clamp to make funky seams in your hair; adjustable heat; and the perfect circumference.  I know straight hair is in right now, but that just doesn&#x27;t work with my face - and this is good to get just the right amount of wave or curl.</li>
    <li> yes, it would be recommended to anyone&lt;br /&gt;because we like it a lot and we both use it&lt;br /&gt;i chose it because had one before like this</li>
    <li> It feels and handles beautifully, it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to style quickly.  It takes a few seconds of patience per curl.</li>
    <li> I like the way it works except for one thing - the rows of teeth slide out as you&#x27;re using the curling iron, and did this the very first time I used it.</li>
