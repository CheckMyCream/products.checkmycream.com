<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has a nice clean smell.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  We&#x27;ve used this for over a year.  For our family of 5, it lasts over 6 months.</li>
    <li> Huge value for the money. Lasts a long time and washes your hands clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite handsoap by far. No harsh chemicals (my hands can be really sensitive, especially in the winter), and the lavender smells great. A bottle lasts our whole household (2 adults) over a year.</li>
    <li> First off let me tell you that I love EO products.  They are very clean and made from quality ingredients.  It is very cost effective to buy hand soap in this large refillable size.  This soap is wonderful!  It lathers up great and the lavender scent is spot on - great!  I love the smell every time I wash my hands.  Thank you EO for this great product!!!</li>
    <li> love the product and love the company. Not only does the soap smell and work great but the company is environmentally concious and cares about what they put in the products (how they treat the earth and our bodies). win win!</li>
    <li> Beautiful lavender fragrance.  Lovely soap for bath and sink!  It lathers nicely and does not over dry skin.  The large refill is handy and economical.  I save my bottles at my bathroom sinks to refill.  I highly recommend it.  (love the foaming hand soap as well!)</li>
    <li> Scents can evoke great changes in my mood and outlook.  Lavender brings me a sense of peace and well being.  EO has AMAZING Lavender essential oils and the deliver a product that is balanced and pure.  Getting clean with their products always makes me smile!</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this delight at The Charles Hotel in Cambridge, MA.  Since then I have made purchases at Whole Foods.  Pretty impressive places which stock only high quality goods.  The hand soap is fabulously scented, pleasant but not overwhelming, and ultra soothing to the skin.  It conveys a sense of something special, lifts my spirits, and makes me feel truly pampered.  A small price to pay for such luxury.[[ASIN:B0061WJA3O EO Liquid Hand Soap Refill, French Lavender, 128 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent. Too peppery.</li>
    <li> I bought two of the foaming hand soap dispensers for my home, plus this gallon refill and the pump to go in it.  I put 8oz of HOT tap water, 8 squirts of this hand soap in the foam dispenser and give it a good shaking (after putting the top on, of course!)  It&#x27;s EXCELLENT.  I even use this soap on my FACE, and my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I have long struggled with combination skin... from acne on my \\&quot;T Zone\\&quot; to dry skin around my nose and cheeks but... ever since I have been using the EO liquid hand soap in French Lavender, my skin has been balanced and feels clean without the harsh feeling that some acne medicines leave.  The lavender smell offers a calmness which results in my face being just that... calm.  My 15 year old son also uses this soap at night, and, in the morning his face is not red like the dermatologist prescription does and his acne has lessened since using EO.  I don&#x27;t believe it is just hand soap anymore for our house!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP!!!  I&#x27;m a yoga instructor and this is the soap they use at Kripalu.  I always feel so healthy after washing my hands with it.</li>
    <li> I love EO - small local environmental friendly.  And I love this soap.  It is gentle enough to use with no reaction on my sensitive skin, still cleans well and the smell is lovely.  I have traded out ALL the other hand soaps we have and now use just this to refill our containers in bathrooms and kitchen.</li>
    <li> The soap is great.  However, the bottle came partially crushed and it did not appear to be full.  Because the top was caved in, it has been hard to pour the refills.</li>
    <li> As a longtime user of EO products, it&#x27;s a pleasure to say this liquid hand soap is extremely mild, effective, and a pleasure to use. I appreciate the absence of Sodium Laureth Sulfate too.</li>
    <li> Ooh my this soap is wonderful! I wish they would make a cherry almond scent. If they don&#x27;t I will most likely purchase this again. Everyone always says something nice after they wash their hands with it. Nice. Best way to keep the germs away.</li>
    <li> The scent is not entirely Lavender, something else chemically in there, lemon?  Something...</li>
    <li> Great soap!  I love this and will always use this.  Smells great and works great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years from Whole Foods.  I started out with the 12oz blue pumps and then started refilling those from the larger sized bottles and then finally graduated to ordering the gallon sized refill bottle.  Note, there is a pump you can buy and re-use (I got mine from Whole Foods on the first time buying the 1 gallon jug).  I think some reviewers may be pouring it from the gallon jug into their smaller bottles that they use to dispense the soap at point of use.  Given how thick this stuff is, I would think that to be a big pain in the behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is my first time ordering a gallon jug from Amazon.  I hope it arrives with no damage and ready to go.  I&#x27;ll update this review then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh I get the French Lavender.  The scent is great.  Not overwhelming as most products that have lavender &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; added as the lavender scent.  In this case it&#x27;s essential oils.  Very nice and gentle and just the right amount of scent.  I&#x27;m your basic germaphobe and do lots of handwashing.  And I love this stuff.  Not drying even with lots of use.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap, but the lavender scent is a little strong.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other product.  Great smell, not too overpowering and gentle cleaning, non drying on your skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hand soap!  Have used it for years, just refilling my original pump bottles as needed.</li>
    <li> I ran out of the smaller bottle and refilled with something I had on hand.  My husband wanted to know where the good soap was!  He has NEVER commented on hand soap before.  So I bought the gallon.  The scent is very light, but very nice.  Gets hands clean but doesn&#x27;t dry them out.</li>
    <li> Soap has the best lavender scent of most liquid soaps! Is rich and not drying, somehow. Also, it is not full of artifical fragrance, etc.</li>
    <li> Just love this product. Gentle on the skin but a great cleanser. The aroma is truly enjoyable. Having a lagre refill jug is helpful as we run through this product frequently.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!  Has a very pleasing lavender scent - not overpowering like some soaps, lotions, air fresheners can be.</li>
    <li> I live across the street from Whole Foods where I&#x27;ve been buying this by the quart for around fifteen dollars, times six &#x3D; sixty dollars, so this is a bargain. I use this soap in the kitchen and both bathrooms, and I go through about a gallon a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this soap is that it rinses off so well and it is very mild. Even in the depths of winter I find this soap to be very mild. Plus, I love lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay bulk!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent. Pleasant aroma, good feel to the soap. That said, the vendor should be shot for horrible packaging. The gallon jug was placed in a cardboard box with no packing material. The box was closed with one piece of clear tape and when delivered, was 3/4 open. Surprised that the jug didn&#x27;t fall out along the way. A better box, packing and a few more strips of tape would have been easy and effective.</li>
    <li> I am a big proponent of BULK refills and using natural products as much as possible, so it was a no brainer to purchase the Soap Refill. I have two hand soap dispensers that I have refilled over the last year and I still have some. It just takes one squirt to have enough soap to wash you hands, so this product goes a long way. It smells lovely, soaps up quickly, and no nasty residue or lingering smell. I love EO and their French Lavender products.</li>
    <li> i bought this one year ago  and I still have about 1/4 of a jar left  -- It has a nice smell to it  washes your hands and don&#x27;t have to worry any un necessary chemicals  --  --  I was going thru my amazon account and realized I hadn&#x27;t made a review  -- I was flabbergasted because you don&#x27;t alot of soap and it lasts such a long time  -- yes I would recommend  --</li>
    <li> This is the third or fourth time I&#x27;ve bought this product.  I like the fact that it really smells a lot like lavender and isn&#x27;t sickeningly sweet-smelling, as so many liquid soaps are.  It also does its cleaning very well.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a more economical refill for my soap dispensers.  Loved the way it&#x27;s made and that it&#x27;s cruelty free. With as often as I wash my hands using something antibacterial strips my skin and makes it extremely dry.  Love it and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. We are a family of 4 and mix this soap with water to use in a foam pump. I bought this in February (it&#x27;s now the end of Oct) and am still using the same bottle. It&#x27;s more expensive, but my hands do not get nearly as dry as they did with other soaps. Plus mixing it with water for foaming soap helps make it last longer. When my big bottle is out, I will be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product and supplier did a great job packaging to avoid leaks. I feel good about my child using this soap.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who even thinks they like lavender and wants a liquid soap.  Buying this in small containers is very expensive and wasteful if you use another dispenser.  Buying by the gallon is better.  Thanks for carrying this large size.  I&#x27;ve used this for years now and hope I never have to change to another liquid hand soap.</li>
    <li> i really enjoy the scent of this soap. it seems to last forever and washes of my hands easily. i would buy this again.</li>
    <li> EO is a great product, and love the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this for the naturalness of it. The smell is a little strong for some of the kids. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s soap!  I smells delightful and I get tons of compliments from people asking about it.  I use it all over the house, and I prefer using the larger jugs to refill glass or ceramic soap dispensers rather than buying disposable plastic dispensers.  I love that the soap is naturally scented and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals.  If you like lavender, you will love this scent!</li>
    <li> I love French lavender hand soap but it is often so expensive.  I recently discovered EO Liquid Hand Soap, the price for a gallon what I had previouly paid for a 12 oz. container of other brands.  To my delight, when it arrived, I put it in my own dispenser and it is wonderful.  It is a nice gentle soap and the scent is the French lavender I love.  Now I can have it in all the hand soap dispensers in my home.</li>
    <li> Love the lavender fragrance and the way the soap leaves my hands. I have it in every bathroom and in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> One saves 60% buying in bulk and gets the same product.</li>
    <li> Smells like I went outside and picked fresh lavender!!!</li>
    <li> I buy the volume size twice a year and refill the bottles I have at home. It makes less trips to the store to buy the small bottles and I think it&#x27;s less on the environment.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It cleans my skin without excess drying. AND SMELLS GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> Use this in my clinic and it always imparts a nice smell and great feel.</li>
</ol>
