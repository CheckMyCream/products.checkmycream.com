### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So I believe that it really is great for them!  </li>
      <li>Excellent product and seller, would purchase again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I cannot say they looked perfect but better.</li>
      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>Makes the nail look shiny and healthy, but it&#x27;s the oil making it look good.  </li>
      <li>Okay, I realize it&#x27;s made from oil.  </li>
      <li>Love.  </li>
      <li>I wish it smelled better.</li>
      <li>However,  I love, love, love tea tree oil.  </li>
      <li>but I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>Probably a great moisturizer overall!  </li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;m very much out of love with the smell of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Also arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This was very reasonably priced and fragrant.</li>
      <li>The brush is very helpful in applying the tea tree oil.  </li>
      <li>Really like this nail treatment works well.</li>
      <li>Eventually I started getting a fungal infection under around the new growth causing it to raise and look bas.</li>
      <li>Nail fungus gone after 2 weeks of use (nail looks like new)</li>
      <li>now if they just made polish with natural dyes</li>
      <li>This will work if you use it consistently and for a long period of time.  </li>
      <li>After using this for 3 weeks they are almost back to normal!</li>
      <li>I think either I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results, or it really doesn&#x27;t deliver what it promises.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really helping my particular problem</li>
</ol>

    <li> I stubbed my big toe and tore 1/4 of the nail off back to the root. Eventually I started getting a fungal infection under around the new growth causing it to raise and look bas. I started this products use after reading the reviews 4 months ago.  Makes the nail look shiny and healthy, but it&#x27;s the oil making it look good.  Been 4 months and  4 bottles later and no real positive results.  &amp; yes I kept my nail trimmed.</li>
    <li> Jason brand! A lot of their products are gold, some don&#x27;t place though. now if they just made polish with natural dyes</li>
    <li> I think either I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results, or it really doesn&#x27;t deliver what it promises. The jury is still out on this product!</li>
    <li> Has not done a thing for me..</li>
    <li> Using this at night at bedtime and after a few days my nails are stronger, no icky odor and the bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This will work if you use it consistently and for a long period of time.  I generously apply this to the affected nail every night before bed, putting a sock over my foot so it doesn&#x27;t stain bed linens.  Then reapply every morning.  I did this for a year and the fungus did go away.  Just takes consistency and patience.  I refuse to take a fungal oral medication due to the side effects.</li>
    <li> Definitely nourishes the nails..</li>
    <li> Good stuff I&#x27;ve used this in the past. Also arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars - this is why:  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but I can already tell a difference in my cuticle health. So I believe that it really is great for them!  Probably a great moisturizer overall!  However,  I love, love, love tea tree oil.  Love.  This does NOT smell like tea tree oil to me.  In fact, I&#x27;m very much out of love with the smell of this stuff.  In addition, it&#x27;s so freaking oily!  Okay, I realize it&#x27;s made from oil.  But I used it at work, and now there is oil all over everything.  I guess I&#x27;ll take it home and just use it at night.  I&#x27;m going to up the starts to 4 now.  I believe it deserves a 4 star.  I can deal with the oiliness since it&#x27;s made from tea tree but I can&#x27;t handle the smell. I wish it smelled better.</li>
    <li> Thought it dries up like a nail polish would. BUT after a few months of using i decided to update the review. Its a great oil for your nails, helped made my nails get stronger and the yellow stain from using nail polish without base go away. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Really like this nail treatment works well.</li>
    <li> After years of wearing nail polish on my toes my nails became very yellow and damaged.  After using this for 3 weeks they are almost back to normal!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really helping my particular problem</li>
    <li> The brush is very helpful in applying the tea tree oil.  The oil seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is my go-to for care and conditioning of my cuticles.  This was very reasonably priced and fragrant.</li>
    <li> Nail fungus gone after 2 weeks of use (nail looks like new)</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller, would purchase again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Love the Jason product line.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the idea that it would help heal my well bitten fingernails. The review said I&#x27;d notice some result within two days and I&#x27;d have to say, I did, not much but some. The layers of nail seem to come together or lay flat. I cannot say they looked perfect but better. Unfortunately, due to the liquidity of the product, I have not used it regularly and cannot say definitively that it works but I am glad I bought it.</li>
