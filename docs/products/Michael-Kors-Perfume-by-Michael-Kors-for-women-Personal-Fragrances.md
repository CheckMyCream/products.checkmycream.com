<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome fragrance - my wife loves it!</li>
    <li> This item is one of my lady&#x27;s favorite perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very alluring scent.  She was pleasantly&lt;br /&gt;surprised and I appreciated the savings.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my niece&#x27;s birthday expecting a smaller size than I get at Macy&#x27;s or Dillards and to my surprise, it was the same size I pay 20% more at the department store. Will never get from either of those places again and will only order from Amazon. thanks</li>
    <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gave it to my wife for Christmas.........she loved it.  Great price.</li>
    <li> For my granddaughter......she loves it!</li>
    <li> Great deal saved $30 on Amazon vs. Department store.</li>
    <li> I had researched this product and it had a surplus of great reviews.  Here is another!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing perfume. I bought it for my wife and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely perfume for all ages.&lt;br /&gt;its have a lovely soft jasmine scent which lingers throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Its very feminine and not over powering&lt;br /&gt;a great buy</li>
    <li> very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Mother in law was happy with it. Not my kind of smell but it&#x27;s her favorite and right on time.</li>
    <li> The way it develops is pure genius.  The opening spritz is floral, yet it is a cheerfully refreshing morning floral.  It starts very bright.  It develops into a round, well balanced feminine yet light fragrance.  Perfection for your day at work or a nice lunch.  At the end of the day, you are left with a woodsy, sensual, musky fragrance that is perfect for an evening date without touch up or reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give high enough praise to this scent.  I have worn it almost every day to work for almost 10yrs.  What can you say above that?</li>
    <li> it smells like alcohol, like it is old perfume</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and much less expensive through Amazon.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend  loves this perfume!!</li>
    <li> Amazing price...Great smell... Shipped quickly...</li>
    <li> This can&#x27;t be real! Michael Kors is my absolute favorite and this is the first time I have ever purchased it online. BIG mistake! The real Michael Kors scent would stay with me all day. I spray this and the scent goes away in just a few minutes. Regret not reading the reviews regarding the same issue before I purchased. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SCENT FO MICHAEL KORS PERFUME. THANKS FOR SENDING ME THIS PERFUME.</li>
    <li> The product arrived early and was as described.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. Great price and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> In a perfume world where everything smells like some kind of schlocky hotel soap, all of them battling to outdo each other with their power of soapiness, this is a treasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in Macy&#x27;s, between floors in the mall, moving purposefully from one purchase to another when I caught a whiff of this as I strode through the ladies&#x27; makeup department.  It hit me like an olfactory smack in the side of the head, and I stopped and spun.  Now, I&#x27;m no stud and no ladies man, but I went right up to the woman showing this to the lady customer, and boldly and without the slightest bit of hestiation told both of them that it was the most original and intriguing thing I&#x27;ve just about ever smelled, and that I had to hear and smell some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t help right then but think of the lessons I&#x27;d read about in the amazing [[ASIN:0060554738 The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists]], and whaddaya know, my opening had both of them paying attention to me and nothing but me.  But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a good long pull of this stuff on a sample wand.  I had the girl put some on my wrist and I checked it out.  At their offer, each of them put a bit on, on wrists and then necks, and I got close-in samples from both, wonderfully sensual.  And it was subtly different on both, and also magnificent on both.  I told them so, and they were flattered, as I intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not interested at all in the two ladies, as nice as they were, I had my purchase in hand within ten minutes, and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it home to my sweet lady wife.  Praise Bog in his castle, she liked it too, and it&#x27;s just about all she wears.  She and this lustrous scent are inextricably linked in my mind now, and it&#x27;s a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this perfume I smell an impossible and unknown range of fruit.  I smell juice and rind, zest and core.  I smell the deepest and sweetest tropical flowers I&#x27;ve ever encountered, and some that have never existed.  As ridiculous as this is, I smell maturity and grace, and a distinctly sexy confidence.  I&#x27;ve only ever smelled this scent on another woman one time, and although I didn&#x27;t meet her or even speak to her, in the instant it took for me to recognize this scent she had my undivided attention and my respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This perfume is absolutely magnificent.  It accentuates the divinity of my wife the goddess, and then some.  It has a powerful, powerful effect on me, and I have never grown tired of smelling it.  Ladies: get some for yourself today and transform.  Men: get some for your ladies today and touch the magic.this is, I smell maturity and grace, and a distinctly sexy confidence.

    <li> My wife has used this perfume for several years now and has always been satisfied with the scent. It has never been overwhelming or \\&quot;too much\\&quot;. It has a very feminine odor that men will notice. Sort of expensive but well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I love floral scents and this was a great price, much less than retail. Michael Kors is great.</li>
    <li> Good perfume just as described</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, will buy more.</li>
    <li> The delivery was correct and the price was way lower than the rest of the sites, including the official sales point.</li>
    <li> Original product as promised! Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Michael Kors is absolutely amazing!.... Strong  natural Gardenia scent that must be worn by real ladies!...You may enjoy your tea with your pinky up now....&lt;br /&gt;Love this bottle design,  I prefer this one unit spray bottle. No top to worry about losing....Mirror in the top too...Excellent for small purse / clutch nights. Smells rich, smells successful....Smells confident and sexy....yet clean!. Enjoy!!&lt;br /&gt;*Worn this for years...Best deal is right here on Amazon, better than Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
    <li> This perfume surely has a subtle and unique scent. I really love this perfume and enjoy the refreshment after pumping.. I do never intend to degrade the quality of one of my favorite perfumes by saying this, but it is somewhat comparable to the one of the air-fresher scents that was so refreshing as well.. But one thing that I like to point out is, this one has a little too heavy and dense aroma comparing to other products, so I&#x27;d rather pump it only once or twice. It maybe because this one is &#x27;Eau de Parfum&#x27;..not &#x27;Eau de Toilette. I highly admire the maker&#x27;s talent to discover/create this special scent.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE AND SO MANY PEOPLE ASK M E WHAT THE NAME IS AND WHERE DID I GET IT.</li>
    <li> I got the best price in the market, and the product arrived on time. When I wear this parfum people ask about it because they like the scent.</li>
    <li> good price and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff my wife loves it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Always get so many comments on this perfume when I wear it. Always a fave with my friends, and people who get too close to me in line : )</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother. It is currently her favorite one. It arrived quickly and came with a couple of samples and a lip balm which was nice.</li>
    <li> Well packaged, super fast delivery.  This perfume smells amazing, very seductive :)  I recommend you try a sample at a store first to make sure it works with your personal chemistry.  THANK YOU AMAZON...</li>
    <li> Over the years, no matter what this fragrance is what I keep coming back to.  I really like this scent and the price is great.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite perfume at a reasonable price. Can&#x27;t beat it! I will order again and again and again!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume.  Not too strong.</li>
    <li> I have been stopped on the street from someone that got a whiff of my perfume. He said he wanted the name so he can buy it for his wife. I like the gardenia smell. It&#x27;s a fresh scent. this perfume can be over sprayed and be overwhelming if sprayed too much. Out of all of my perfumes, this one gets the most compliments from men and women.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume; This is a great value.  From another site paid more than double the price here.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for a friend and I didn&#x27;t know at the time what it smelled like so I was worried...a month later she&#x27;s sprayed it on me and it smelled nice</li>
    <li> Like summer and leather in a bottle</li>
    <li> She loved it!!! and you can&#x27;t beat that price!  It took awhile to get here though!! It&#x27;s missed her Mothers day present.  That wasn&#x27;t fun to tell.</li>
    <li> Everything was great, no problem it was like buying it from a department store.</li>
    <li> Bottle leaks everywhere and spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t work. Fragrance wears off very quickly. Feels like a knock off.</li>
    <li> My favorite. It smells awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a review for the newer formulation of this perfume. When it was launched in 2000 it quickly became a best seller and an award winning perfume, it was hard to find in stores and you had to pay full retail price to acquire it. The scent was so long lasting and smelled heavenly on me. MKors had elevated the humble white tuberose to new levels, the perfume smelled floral and oriental and woodsy at the same time. Not heavy oriental like Samsara but a fresh and young oriental, and it fast became my favorite go to perfume for a date night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all that success MK launched Kors that flopped and was discontinued. Over the years, they&#x27;ve dumbed down this scent for some reason, maybe the cost of the ingredients went up and they made some substitutions that did not quite work out. A tragedy as the newer version that I purchased did not smell the same. If you do purchase this perfume make sure you do so from a store rather than Amazon as several people seem to be selling knock-offs in original bottles and it&#x27;s hard to tell whether they&#x27;re fake or real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what the original composition was like:&lt;br /&gt;Top Notes: Dewy freesia, Tamarind, Incense, Chinese osmanthus&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes: Tuberose, Blue orris, White wings peony, Arum lily&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes: Cashmere woods, Musk, Vetiver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formulation does not smell the same and smells too chemical and manufactured. I no longer like the perfume and it does not react the same on my skin, smelling dull and heavy rather than floral, warm and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is indeed still your favorite fragrance, make sure you buy directly from Amazon.com and not another seller as there is a greater chance of getting a fake.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Great price for the amount I was able to obtain</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this perfume through Amazon (specifically PerfumesWorld!) I was hesitant that the bottle could be either faux or broken upon arrival, but it came packaged securely and in beautiful condition within the Michael Kors box. I purchased the 3.4 ounce, the largest bottle, and not a fraction of an ounce was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine uses this perfume and it has such a divine, delicious tuberose scent, that I just had to have my own. I don&#x27;t even wear perfume! That&#x27;s how much I like the scent of this one, as does my boyfriend. It is a fresh and elegant scent perfect for younger or older ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase this one through  Amazon again.</li>
    <li> This is not real, it is a cheap knock off. I have worn this perfume for years but this bottle was not the same as all the others. The smell did not last. The product did not spray correctly. Do not waste your money. Spend the extra $20 and get it from a legitimate seller, I promise the real product is worth it but this is not real.</li>
    <li> Perfume does not smell the same as the original Michael Kors. Does not have the same color either. Totally disappointed being that this perfume is very hard to come by.</li>
    <li> This bottle is very easy to spray so you don&#x27;t use too much; what an amazing scent. My new favorite now!</li>
    <li> For a while my husband bought me this perfume for every occasion until I had to tell him I have enough to last 10 years.  He actually could&#x27;ve written the review by rugby007, but alas, he&#x27;s not that poetic. He loves it more than I do.  That&#x27;s saying a lot.  I wear two perfumes, this and Fracas by Robert Piguet.  Both have a dominant note of tuberose, but are very different.  Michael attract comments from men, while women compliment me more when I wear Fracas.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the eau de parfum.  It does not fade.  They also make a shimmering body creme to die for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel qualified to describe well the scent.  I&#x27;d call it a rich tropical floral, but it is more complex than that.  What I can say for certain is that the product was from Discount Perfumes, it is genuine, arrived in good condition, doesn&#x27;t leak and sprays as it should.</li>
    <li> I have worn the fragrance almost everyday since I purchased it. I get a lot of compliments and it&#x27;s definitely one of my favorites. I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for a couple years and get more complements than any other fragrance I have ever worn! Feminine and very fragrant.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume..Everytime I wear it someone stops and asks me the name of the scent and I tell them they can purchase it through AMAZON</li>
    <li> I am a Michael kors fan, this fragrance adds more to this collection ladies you have to have if you are a fan</li>
    <li> Everyone loves this- I get so many compliments and this is a HUGE discount from department store prices. This is a great gift to give and get!</li>
    <li> Oh, my!  This fragrance is delightful and can be worn day into evening.  Lots of compliments when I wear it.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I received Michael Kors Eau De Parfum 3.4 oz. It was wrapped in the box and looked new. However when I went to use it it leaked everytime I would spray it. Obviously it was tampered with- now I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m spraying on myself. I will never buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! And it was $40 cheaper than at a department store! Fast shipping, very happy!</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful, sensual and exotic, intoxicating floral scent.  I once tried a friend&#x27;s Michael Kohrs Hawaii(which he doesn&#x27;t make anymore) and it was stunning.  This scent is very similar to that one, I absolutely love it.  Great for day or evening.</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing. Everytime I wear it I always get compliments. Subtle and unique.</li>
    <li> I love the floral scent of this perfume!</li>
    <li> The spray mechanism broken on two bottles.  Replaced once with same problem again.  Will not purchase again.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of my most favorite perfumes.  Loved it from the moment I smelled it. TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  Try it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes me feel like a sexy strong woman when I wear it. My 2nd favorite perfume of all time. Unfortunately, my boyfriend thinks it smells like his grandma mixed with a cigarette lounge (it&#x27;s too musky for him). But I love it</li>
    <li> Smells great and came super fast.  Decently priced and will purchase again in the near future.  Recommend to anyone looking for a gift quick.</li>
    <li> I have many perfumes but I always get compliments on this one.  I hope they never stop selling this.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I borrowed (if you can borrow perfume!) this from my mother&#x27;s vanity and sprayed it on before stepping out to drive to a restaurant for dinner.  Inside the car, the smell of tuberoses became overwhelming.  I couldn&#x27;t smell any top, middle or base notes, just tube roses.  I had sprayed it on me only twice and honestly, I was embarrassed at the restaurant for smelling like the concentrated essence of a flower.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume but worry about fakes. This is the original scent and I&#x27;m thrilled with the purchase. FAST DELIVERY. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. Definetely original. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift. The recipient told me it is a five out of five. I&#x27;ll take that.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume! I get so many complements on it from both men and women! I have allergies and am really sensitive to many perfumes, but this one doesn&#x27;t affect me at all and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I walked into Michael Kors smelling this perfume in the air and i thought i had to get it, i asked the lady how much the big bottle was and she said $102 and i knew i couldn&#x27;t afford that, so i went on amazon after i left the store and saw it on here for half the price and i immediately bought it and i love it.</li>
    <li> Updated July 25, 2016:  I have noticed that many reviews claim this is a fake or different from the original scent and they are at least a year old.  I have purchased this from this site for several years and have never had any problems with either scent or packaging.  This one is fulfilled by Amazon, states this right below the price.  I just wanted people to know that I haven&#x27;t had any negative issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:  This is my signature scent and, everywhere I go, people ask what I am wearing.  I&#x27;m known as &#x27;the lady who always smells so good.&#x27;  The bottle is very wide, and I have small hands, so I have to use both hands to spray it and that does not work for spaying my wrists.  I had to buy some small funnels and atomizer bottles to pour this into and it is very hard for my husband to get the original bottle open without breaking it.  I hate the extra trouble and expense, but this is my scent and my husband loves it, so I won&#x27;t change.  I did contact Michael Kors about it as all his perfume bottles look the same, but I have not heard anything.  Probably won&#x27;t as the shape is his &#x27;signature&#x27;&#x27;, but he didn&#x27;t think about the fact that it is for women and how hard it would be for some of us to spray it on.</li>
    <li> The girlfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife demands a new bottle every 6 months as it is the best price point she can find for Michael Kors.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is magic on her and leads to other women frequently stopping her to ask what she is wearing.</li>
    <li> I was nervous when I read other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t smell authentic, the scent wrote off quickly or it leaked...the seller I got it from, OTC was totally legit. It is an authentic fragrance, it lasts throughout the day, the scent and bottle is exactly like what you&#x27;d buy at Macy&#x27;s for over $100. It DOES NOT leak. I will buy this product from this seller again, without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, however it is hard for me to spray. Takes two hands.</li>
    <li> the delivery was very quick and efficient. the bottle came packaged in the box, brand new and unopened. you can definitely trust this seller for what u pay for. the perfume itself is perfection in a bottle. i have never gotten more compliments in my life than when i wear this perfume. if u dont like creamy florals, do not order this scent. this scent is a very heavy, potent, musky, creamy floral. definitely a perfume that is worn as a signature scent and not just something u spray after the gym. love it! will continue to order.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and so is the price! At a michael kors store, the perfume is $102 but I got it for half that here! Smells amazing and get compliments on the daily :)</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! Very soft n sexy. Price is extremely good for the size!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Thank you</li>
    <li> I was looking for something with a strong tuberose scent that would last.  I tried Michael Kors a few times at upscale department stores and airports and decided to go for it.  I love it.  The price was great on Amazon.  It is subtle but sensuous and perfect for romantic evenings.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and consequently mine.  I love the scent when she leaves the room and the fragrance follows her. What more can  I say that will make you want to try it.</li>
    <li> best perfume out there!</li>
    <li> DO NOT purchase fragrances from Amazon.  When I opened this bottle to use it for the first time the spray wouldn&#x27;t work.  It is totally useless!  There is no way to open the bottle and Amazon won&#x27;t allow me to return it as defective because they classify fragrance as a hazardous material!  WHAT A SCAM!!!!!</li>
    <li> great value my wife loves it thanks again</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product. It was the perfect Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Great value and fast service!</li>
    <li> My favorite for years and continue to receive compliments. My daughter calls it &amp;#34;my mommy smell&amp;#34; and loves that her dogs have the scent on them after I&#x27;ve visited.</li>
    <li> Really happy with my purchase! It was much bigger than I thought. I love my Michael Kors perfume! One satisified customer!</li>
    <li> Smells like sex or id have given it 5 stars.  You don&#x27;t want your gf at work smelling like sex do you&amp;#62;?</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed with the purchase.  The spray doesn&#x27;t work.  The parfum comes out in a stream or not at all.  I wish I had bought it at Macy&#x27;s so I could exchange it.  Great fragrance but can&#x27;t really use it.  $80.00 wasted.</li>
    <li> I bought Kors when it first came out and the smaller bottle 1.7 or 1. something the one just below this and this is seriously so much more volume you think it won&#x27;t be because it&#x27;s the next biggest and biggest size to buy in the kors collection, but it&#x27;s amazing!!  When I bought it when it first boomed, my smaller bottle had (I still have it) a top and you squirt pump which I kind of like a little better than this not having a &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; and the basic squirt that you do with your finger................ because sometimes these can come with defaults and don&#x27;t spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is great and smells amazing.  :)</li>
    <li> Met expectations. Nothing above and beyond. It is Michael Kors. Everyone loves it on me! Would buy again. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Love the perfume. I&#x27;ll buy another one, but not everybody likes it, it&#x27;s also super intense and long lasting smell</li>
    <li> good price smells great.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it.  Fair price and fast delivery.  Amazon always comes through with everything for everyone.  I hardly leave the house when shopping now.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I am happy.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with this perfume for a very long time. It is one of my favorites, If you like Dior&#x27;s Fahrenheit for men, than you should also like this smell, because they have the same roots of smell. It is very sexy, very long lasting smell, that  you may wear each season of the year.&lt;br /&gt;It is my must have perfume for already 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;But be aware you may like, or you may hate this smell, it can not be. &amp;#34;it&#x27;s OK&amp;#34;. I am in love with Michael...</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume,and so does everyone else when i wear it. THANKS</li>
    <li> I have bought this product many times.  I received this and noticed that the bottle was only slightly different. After using it, the fragrance completely dissipated in a matter of minutes to which the original perfume would last for hours and hours.  This is obviously NOT WHAT I PAYED FOR and will never recommend this seller (DEALWAY) nor buy anything through them again!&lt;br /&gt;Not Happy!!</li>
    <li> It smelled like it was old.</li>
    <li> Gave as present. She liked it.</li>
    <li> Nice perfume with nice duration as well. One of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; perfumes.</li>
    <li> It is either so old the fragrance has changed or its a knock off. Certainly does not smell right</li>
    <li> Potent! Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> The liquid in the bottle is green (feel free to ask for photos) the smell is more alcohol than perfume and the spray nozzle barely works.  Complete knock off and if would have been cheaper at a swap meet.</li>
    <li> My favorite of all Michael kors.  I will never wear anything else now.  Everyone comments on it when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My all time absolute favorite fragrance.  When I wear Michael Kors I get many comments as to the wonderful fragrance I have on.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrant. My wife loves this perfume and that makes me the hero. Be your wife\girlfriend hero. You don&#x27;t even have to go to the mall, just order here!!!!  Love it!! :)</li>
    <li> excellent and original</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I received but it was NOT MK..I know because I have the real MK that I bought from a dept store</li>
    <li> Love it...will reorder</li>
    <li> Love this scent and the price.</li>
    <li> beautiful perfume,thanks</li>
    <li> This classic floral scent is amazing on any woman. This is what beauty smells like. Understated but not weak. It just smells like a woman.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time package was great just like it supposed to be GREAT!!!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Good quality. Good bargain. Would recommend and do business with again.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Great price even better price than the outlets</li>
    <li> Smells great, wife LOVES it. Bought as a gift, this is exactly what she was looking for. Not too strong or overwhelming and comes in a cool dispenser.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 21 year old daughter, who just loves it! What a wonderful fragrance! Thank you Michael Kors! She loved it!</li>
    <li> Only Pefume My Wife Will Wear !!!&lt;br /&gt;Her and The Girls Love M.K. She Has Me Wearing Michael Kors Clothes now.</li>
    <li> I love using this scent. It arrived on time, well packaged, smells like the real thing. What more can I say? Go ahead and buy.</li>
    <li> I love it I sprayed it on and took a shower and still smell it wow it&#x27;s the bomb</li>
    <li> Sweeter than I remember.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! So many Compliments!!</li>
    <li> I certainly sympathize with reviewers who received a knock-off product - but I think that I received a genuine product. At least the recipient is happy... and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important anyway (from my perspective). My bottle appeared and smelled identical to the MK store version.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume and not matter where I go someone always stops me to ask what I am wearing. This is an everyday wear for me and works for day and night time.</li>
    <li> Two words: TUBE ROSE. If you are a fan of tube rose scent, you will be over the moon for this perfume! I had a similar smelling perfume in High School and was never able to figure out the name of it years later after it had run out and I wanted to buy it again. So-I am SO glad this perfume came around! It&#x27;s a strong scent which will not fade within an hour of spraying it like many other perfumes out there. Also, it&#x27;s strong without being \\&quot;musky\\&quot;, which I also much appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. It&#x27;s a huge bottle and the price is definitely better here than what you&#x27;d pay at the mall.  Seller also sent a coupon for my next fragrance purchase :)</li>
    <li> recently i bought a perfume from amazon (just a different seller) since ive known that perfume for years i knew something was wrong, it didnt smell good, opposite it smelled like some kind of drugs, i was so disappointed that i never wanted to buy from amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however when i saw michael kors for like 40 $ cheaper i wrote to amazon if they were taking the responsibility in the perfumes authenticity, seller was amazon and im glad i purchased this perfume, its great cent, last forever, its different and so nice, whole day i feel like im in the best shape, my husband loves it, always get compliments from everyone around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. i wont recommend any other seller though, bad experience i guess :)</li>
    <li> My friend loves this perfume and uses it frequently. I purchased this from Amazon for her birthday but it did not have the same smell as the store bought perfume. We felt it was a counterfeit product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the MK perfume I purchase in a department store. Disappointed unfortunately !</li>
    <li> I think the fragrance is old.  It does not have the color of the one I purchased from the store.  Smells somewhat different.  For the price it is fine.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume that I wear daily.  Such a great scent that you can wear all year round.  This is my second time ordering from this seller.  I order on Wednesday and received my box on Thursday afternoon.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Gift for my mother. Her favorite fragrance. I like it very much too. Highly recommended. Lasts a  very long time</li>
    <li> i like michael kors.  nice scent.  i had an issue with this order bc for some reason it didn&#x27;t smell right (i have purchased and used this perfume in the past so i know what it smells like).  almost like it had soured.  amazon made good.  no complaints or issues there.  was probably a random weird bottle. haven&#x27;t had problems since.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume in the whole world!  It is not cheap, and I was so happy to find it on amazon a little cheaper then at Sephora.  I am so happy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Great perfume</li>
    <li> Delivery as expected (though I wish it could&#x27;ve been faster but hey, it was free via Prime), product as described with very good packaging to help keep it from getting damaged and WAY cheaper than retail (like almost 50% cheaper).</li>
    <li> This perfume hits all the high notes.  I just got mine this afternoon and everything about it made me so very happy:  the wonderful, strong in a good way scent, the beautiful packaging with the velvety cream-colored box that slides out from the silver cover, the superior quality of this product. It truly is poetry in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Very nice, I loved it. The only thing it came little late. But product is good. And it long lasting smell.</li>
    <li> Nice bottle that this comes in. I got it without trying it on first and have been very happy with the scent. I love it. It was a fair price so I tried it and have been very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER!!!! This is not the real perfume. I have been wearing this fragrance for around 8 years and this smells completely off. I compared it to the almost empty bottle I have and it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
    <li> Nice purfume for that specail one in your life.  Michael Kors hits this one of the park.  This is money well spent to make that special person radiate goodness!</li>
    <li> awesome bought as a gift for wife and she loves it. and i do too damn smells so freaking good.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews here was concerned that is receive a knock-off, leaky bottle, or one with a sprayer malfunction; however that was not the case! I received Michael Kors &amp;#34;Michael&amp;#34; exactly what I ordered!!! It came on the date promised too! I will definitely order it again!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome but the bottle is large and can&#x27;t spray it correctly.  All I can say is,  it it very awkward spraying the bottle..  .</li>
    <li> After asking a friend what fragrance she was wearing and she told me Michael Kors original, I knew I had to have it!!  Ordered this the same day and I am thrilled!!  Absolutely beautiful scent!!</li>
    <li> While this is a nice fragrance that fairs out pretty nicely, it&#x27;s not one that I will add to my collection. Reason being is because I feel it could almost pass for a men&#x27;s cologne. It doesn&#x27;t hold enough feminity and elegance to me and I am definitely not trying to be mistaken for a man, lol. Just my opinion!</li>
    <li> I had smelled this perfume previously at a department store and actually on someone and loved the smell; however, when I purchased it, I found it a little too strong too wear and it has actually given me migraines every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> You know when a woman walks by and smells really good and you want to wear what she is wearing? This is one of those perfumes. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 7 years now.</li>
    <li> I am a bigger fan of Michael Kors Gold....but couldn&#x27;t find any available, so I got this.  It smells great, just not as good as the Gold.  Very happy with it:)</li>
    <li> I love it . It is My favorite</li>
    <li> love my perfume smells great</li>
    <li> Fake MK... Dissatisfied</li>
    <li> Suttle in floral yet warm vanilla undertones</li>
    <li> Awesome value and price. This is my favorite perfume but the price is so high at the mall and on other online places.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it was packed with the other perfume and had a little too much room in box and was concerned when I first opened box. No damage and its just as described and arrived on time and time to spare...</li>
    <li> Absolutely ADORE this!!!  Get TONS of compliments everywhere I go!!!!</li>
    <li> Thanks for still selling the original Michael Kors!</li>
    <li> This little bottle will instantly make you better than everyone else</li>
    <li> Cautiously bought based on reviews.. bottle would not spray when pumped. :(  Returning.</li>
    <li> Daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance! So..a great gift.</li>
    <li> My signature scent for 14 years. SOOO-oooo many people complement me when I wear this. Just a pure, classically beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this perfume in a magazine ad and liked it so much that I ordered a bottle. The scent doesn&#x27;t fade like other perfumes. This is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I have the same size but for some odd reason this one was smaller? Other then that I love it very much...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, Maria</li>
    <li> The bottle has leaked and so the box was all messed up and i lost some perfume due to leakage.  This has a beautiful velour feeling box but due to the perfume leakage, it had soaked the box and the stuff was all over my hands and i had to cut the box because it would not slide out due to being soaked in perfume. I am very disappointed as I have worn this perfume for 10 years and i have never ordered it online.  The price as great but now i see why.  I would not order this again from this seller</li>
    <li> I love how this smells on her. Parfum is so much better than toilette since it consists of oil vs water.  It lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> Packed well and I really like the fragrance</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife. She loves this fragrance and it lasts more than a couple of hours.  Price is significantly less than what you would pay at a department store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years because it is one of the few that lasts. This bottle, however, is different. The fragrance seems &#x27;watered down&#x27;. I can blast myself with it, including clothing, but can&#x27;t smell it after a very short time. I wonder if getting perfume at a discounted price means the perfume is old, counterfeit, or something less than the full price version...</li>
    <li> Absolutely disgusting.  I had not only myself, but four other women of varying ages but who are very tasteful try it and the responses were all the same...\\&quot;Smells like an old lady\\&quot;...\\&quot;Smells like old Avon\\&quot;...\\&quot;Smells like a cheap drugstore perfume back in the 80s\\&quot;.  I am a big fan of most of the Michael Kors perfumes, so this was a major disappointment.  It has a strong, overwhelming scent of gardenia and honeysuckle, and I know some have said that men loved it, but I just cannot see that being true.  I even had a few guys in my office smell it, and THEY said it smelled like their grandmother!</li>
    <li> I bought this and it&#x27;s the worst smell I&#x27;ve ever smelled and I can&#x27;t return it I wasted my money smells like a 90-year-old woman and baby powder smelled in the store and it smells nothing like that I think it&#x27;s expired or something</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite scent. Great price, great service, and I am thrilled to be able to buy my high end scents online so reasonably priced. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this in the past but could find it cheap enough to get again, then I searched on Amazon n was amazed a the price, the shipping was quick , i definitely recommend this product, u will get so many compliments</li>
    <li> The perfume is nice, but too floral for my taste. Tried to get a different scent online without trying in store first... thats the reason for 3 stars. Try it before you buy it.</li>
    <li> I cannot speak to the authenticity of the product as sold here, because I purchased it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That notwithstanding, this is one of my favorite fragrances.  I had no exposure to tuberose before trying this out, and what a wonderful flower it is!  I completely lack the descriptive vocabulary for describing fragrances, but this is a somewhat heavy scent (as compared to the lighter, sporty, water-themed or citrus fragrances), almost musky in a way, so a little goes a long way.  Although they smell nothing alike, the type of scent, and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;heaviness,&amp;#34; reminds me a bit of Dune by Christian Dior - elegant and entirely feminine, pretty, almost formal.  A couple spritzes last an entire day and I never tire of smelling it on my skin.</li>
    <li> Michael Kors is a genius!  This is the only scent I will ever wear.  I remember when I opened up the sample page in my Vogue magazine while in highschool and I became obsessed with the scent immeadiatly.  I get complements everywhere I go day or night.  Great for a gift too.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome.. Took awhile to get here..</li>
    <li> I received this perfume when promised. The sent I just adore.</li>
    <li> Men &amp; Women compliment me on this smell all the time &amp; it works with me all day long. I love this fragrance...time for me to re-order, my bottle is getting low.  I&#x27;m not giving it a chance to run out.  Highly recommended if it works with your body chemistry.</li>
    <li> Although the product is terrific, it arrived leaking product inside its wrapping.  As a result, my wife opened her beautifully-scented gift with about 1/3 of the perfume gone.  For the price paid for this perfume, I would think that better packaging could eliminate such expensive waste.  I enjoy ordering thru Amazon, but as a result of this experience I do not know that I can ever order liquids again in this fashion.  I would like to think that either Amazon or the manufacturer would like to make up for this unpleasant experience.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, smells great on me and I always get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> Its a very good perfume the scent stays all day it smells good</li>
    <li> Love the smell, hate the bottle.  If you have fingernails that are just a bit long, it is almost impossible to spray it.  I am planning on taking it apart, and putting it in an atomizer.  I give the fragrance itself 5+ stars.  I have been searching for a new perfume for awhile now, and found this by accident at Bloomingdale&#x27;s.  This, by the way, is about half the price as elsewhere.  The bottle only gets 1 star.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described!! Smells great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife for Cristmas and she absolutely loves it. She owns 30-40 diferent bottles of perfum and has been using the Michael Kors exclusively ever sence.</li>
    <li> The lowest price I could find, online and in stores. I received it very fast in the mail.  Love the smell..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. I have gotten so many compliments since I&#x27;ve started wearing this more. I really only need one good spray on my neck and that&#x27;s it. It lasts all day and night.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom for Valentine&#x27;s Day. She loved the perfume from just taking the plastic off the box. The box has a suade part. The little things make her excited!! The smell is great as well.</li>
    <li> It did not smell like the Michael Kors perfume I have that I got from Macys. I was very disappointed. Still giving it 2 starts because of the excellent customer service Amazon provided when i contacted them with my dissatisfaction.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> i can only say that everything worked out fine.. i am happy with service and product.&lt;br /&gt;congratulations on job well done</li>
    <li> Love it and it was on time..</li>
    <li> I love this parfume! It lasts a long time &amp; is a nice scent year round.</li>
    <li> Thank you it was great</li>
    <li> The product smell nice, but there was a problem with the spray top. Liquid not coming out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever!  As others have stated, people stop to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing all of the time.  Just devine smelling.</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume &amp; had smelled it before I ordered. I get compliments every time I go out &amp; who doesn&#x27;t like smelling great?</li>
    <li> No es original, su olor dura solo un minuto! It is not original, It lasts only a minute</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loved it. She said MK is one of her favorite perfumes.</li>
    <li> yummmmmy!! my favourite  perfume and i recieve daily compliments!</li>
    <li> I have loved Muchael Kors since the first time I experienced it! This is a classy fragrance that gets compliments from men and women. It stays on you for hours and does not leave a sickening after fragrance when you leave the room. If you are looking for a classy, upbeat, and sophisticated fragrance, this is the one.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite perfume. I always get this same kind, but for some reason- this bottle leaks.  It has ruined the cabinet that I keep it in and seems to leave a film on everything that it sits on.  Love the smell, awesome. However, the bottle ain&#x27;t right.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect and best scent I have ever tried. Not overpowering and I have gotten so many compliments. The seller I also rate 5 stars! I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller.</li>
    <li> Time after time I buy my MK from Macys...However this time I happen to buy it from  the Fragrance co...big mistake...never again. Michael is known to last on all day; Unfortunately this fragrance did not last long at all. After putting it on, it might of last 10 min on...after 10 min of spraying it, no more smell. I can&#x27;t believe Fragrance Co. would state that every fragrance of theirs is 100% authentic. B*** $***.</li>
    <li> When my city opened a Michael Kohrs store in our mall I smelt this perfume for the first time, and every time I went  to the mall I&#x27;d come back for more sprays from the tester! It smells sooo good! It retails for $90 few in the store, so I was stoked to find this for such a good price on Amazon. After waiting a short time for the delivery, I was disappointed when I got the product. The perfume had leaked all over the box, the top of the bottle feels cheap and plastic-y, and the perfume just does not smell NEARLY as good as the one in the store. I thought I was imagining it until I read other reviews stating the same thing. So disappointed in the waste of 50 dollars, wish I bought the real thing.</li>
