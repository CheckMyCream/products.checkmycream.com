      <li>Perfect for a 13-year-old girl.</li>
      <li>Delivery on time, as Amazon is the best at getting my orders here on time.  </li>
      <li>So happy they did!!</li>
      <li>but the perfume smelled great!</li>
      <li>It smells so awesome</li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>Great item at a Great Price!!</li>
      <li>My girls loved the perfume!</li>
      <li>the best woman perfume good deal thank a lot prob</li>
      <li>Great price for the product</li>
      <li>And the price was great.</li>
      <li>They had a great Christmas</li>
      <li>daughter loves this and it was a great price for the size.</li>
      <li>She was so happy when she got it.</li>
      <li>and I was so happy I put some on it</li>
      <li>WORKS FINE IN VENEZUELA, EXCELLENT</li>
      <li>Anyhow I smelled this one day and realized that the missed beloved Electric Youth perfume from Debbie Gibson has been discontinued for ages</li>
      <li>it was a gift, but she loved it</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
      <li>smelled so good</li>
      <li>the purchase and shipment were correct, I am very satisfied with the service.</li>
      <li>I surprisingly LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>This smell is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Its nice and summery.</li>
      <li>; so I bought her her own bottle out of spite, so she could have her own.</li>
      <li>Comes retail packaged nicely in cello wrapped box.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, it&#x27;s one of my top 3 favorite perfumes.</li>
      <li>It was a bit pricey for what I figured was a teeny-bopper perfume, but it was worth it to make her happy.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love the rose top</li>
      <li>gonna buy more</li>
      <li>I love it ....</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasantly sexy.</li>
      <li>Because of my age, when people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing, I just say this fragrance called JB. :)</li>
      <li>It was actually a very beautiful, light, pretty smell and not inappropriate for an 11 year old.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great gift for your teen.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a knock-off called &amp;#34;Today&amp;#34; at a discount clothing store, and liked it so much that I decided to try the original.</li>
      <li>She was excited.</li>
      <li>Light, not too flowerly, not too strong, but just right.</li>
      <li>If you remember that sweet perfume from the 80s and can&#x27;t find Electric Youth anywhere, buy this perfume!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW:</li>
      <li>Smells fruity without being sickly sweet or overpowering.</li>
      <li>It has a strong alcohol smell at First.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money and was shipped in a very protective box!</li>
      <li>Ok so even though I am in my early 30&#x27;s, let me say that I love some hard to find old school beloved scents from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I bought live in love by Oscar delarenta and that was much more intoxicating for only a few more dollars on Amazon.</li>
      <li>now I realized that this smells so similar OR that they took that original scent and recycled it to Justin&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>thanks you</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item!</li>
      <li>Smellsssssss ammmmmaaaaazzzzziiinggg thanks</li>
      <li>so much</li>
      <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I find that his other newer perfume (\\&quot;The Key\\&quot;)is also very identical to Babyphat perfume in Golden Goddess.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s rubbery and soft.  </li>
      <li>My thirteen year old daughter ordered this and loves it.</li>
      <li>Nor inappropriate for this 42 year old Auntie.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 11 year old Neice because her &amp;#34;best friend had it and wouldn&#x27;t let her even look</li>

    <li> I got this at Christmas and I was so happy I put some on it smelled so good I am justin biebers #1 belieber even know justin bieber dose bad stuff.</li>
    <li> Aside from the fact that I&#x27;m 38 and this is Justin Beiber&#x27;s cologne... I surprisingly LOVE IT! I purchased a knock-off called &amp;#34;Today&amp;#34; at a discount clothing store, and liked it so much that I decided to try the original. Surprisingly, it&#x27;s one of my top 3 favorite perfumes. Light, not too flowerly, not too strong, but just right. My boyfriend loves it. Because of my age, when people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing, I just say this fragrance called JB. :)</li>
    <li> It smells so awesome I love it ....Maria</li>
    <li> Ok so even though I am in my early 30&#x27;s, let me say that I love some hard to find old school beloved scents from the 80&#x27;s. Anyhow I smelled this one day and realized that the missed beloved Electric Youth perfume from Debbie Gibson has been discontinued for ages now I realized that this smells so similar OR that they took that original scent and recycled it to Justin&#x27;s! So happy they did!! If you remember that sweet perfume from the 80s and can&#x27;t find Electric Youth anywhere, buy this perfume!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW: I find that his other newer perfume (\\&quot;The Key\\&quot;)is also very identical to Babyphat perfume in Golden Goddess.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Bought it for my niece and cousin and had to get it for myself. The smell is pleasantly sexy.</li>
    <li> Smells fruity without being sickly sweet or overpowering.</li>
    <li> Or is it lasting aroma of wet dog or sweaty socks?  The long lasting, lingering putrid stentch is truly horrible!  Still yucky 6hrs. later!</li>
    <li> My woman smells awesome when she wears this! What else can I say?</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 11 year old Neice because her &amp;#34;best friend had it and wouldn&#x27;t let her even look it&amp;#34; so I bought her her own bottle out of spite, so she could have her own. She was excited. It was a bit pricey for what I figured was a teeny-bopper perfume, but it was worth it to make her happy. She was so happy when she got it. I asked her if I could smell it and was COMPLETELY shocked and caught off guard. I don&#x27;t like Justin Bieber...I think he&#x27;s a chump...but the perfume smelled great! It was actually a very beautiful, light, pretty smell and not inappropriate for an 11 year old. Nor inappropriate for this 42 year old Auntie. As much as I hate to admit it, I&#x27;d actually by this for myself.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d hoped. It has a strong alcohol smell at First. I bought live in love by Oscar delarenta and that was much more intoxicating for only a few more dollars on Amazon.</li>

    <li> Great item at a Great Price!! Well worth the money and was shipped in a very protective box! I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> My niece posted on instagram that she wanted this perfume. I checked Amazon and here it was!! I decided to order and gift it to her for doing so well in school. Comes retail packaged nicely in cello wrapped box. Looks like I purchased at big  fancy retail store.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for herself last year and when we went on vacation I had her bring her perfume and I left mine behind because I like this too. Yep ... I like Justin Bieber perfume. Its nice and summery.</li>
