      <li>For sure this purse would be over $20 at a store at the mall.</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t love it, but I like it.</li>
      <li>but it holds more than you&#x27;d think.</li>
      <li>Its huge and perfect for carrying a lot of things without actually carrying a purse.</li>
      <li>Despite the rating I loved this 1 , and I don&#x27;t mine it is large in fact</li>
      <li>I love it true to size can be also carried as a crossbody.</li>
      <li>This clutch was huge.</li>
      <li>and it was Amazon Prime free shipping eligible</li>
      <li>i enjoy it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>i am a satisfied customer and will love to buy more of this in different colors.</li>
      <li>I May improve rating if refund is processed quickly and seamlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was larger than I thought it was going to be (a very big plus), and it is of very good quality.</li>
      <li>It arrived in less than 10 days, which is amazing, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>

      <li>IT IS ROOMY THAN WHAT I HAVE EXPECTED WHICH IS NICE</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind something being cheap as long as it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
      <li>Other than the glitter that I dislike, I love the size of this bag!</li>
      <li>It was more like a laptop case cover which I been using it for that and my back pack.</li>
      <li>it is exactly how it is pictured.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t think it was that large.</li>
      <li>but it is much to large for my taste.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s too large for my taste.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large and roomy.</li>
      <li>And not a high quality faux fur more like a mangy carpet.</li>
      <li>Materials look very high end.</li>
      <li>I really like it and</li>
      <li>This was a purse that I need to have for a outing and it matched my shoes, thanks for your quickness in delivering</li>
      <li>At first when I ordered this product I thought it was a normal size clutch, should of check the measurements of it.</li>
      <li>Is very room.</li>
      <li>so I really like that</li>
      <li>can hold much.</li>
      <li>WHich costs as much as the clutch did.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this tote it went perfect with my dress got a lot of compliments. It came just in time for my party matched my shoes to a T.</li>
    <li> I like the purse but it&#x27;s too large for my taste.  Not sure what to do next with it.</li>
    <li> I am a Clutch lover....I own OVER 30 and the collection is growing! This clutch is too big...I understand that this is the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; style however, I don&#x27;t do &amp;#34;fads&amp;#34;. When I purchase something I like to be able to keep it for 20+ and it still be a fashion statement!</li>
    <li> This clutch was huge. Not dainty like the photo suggests.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this bag!  I saw a model on Pinterest carrying this bag and thought it was a nice bag and looked good with the outfit she had on.  Imagine my surprise when I saw it on the Amazon site later that same day.  The price was much lower than I would have expected a bag like this to cost and it was Amazon Prime free shipping eligible so I could not resist ordering it.  It came on time and in great shape.  Now that I have it I love it even more!  The texture of the animal print makes it look really high end.  Great bag! Great price!</li>
    <li> Love this!! It&#x27;s a clutch but it&#x27;s big enough to put a lot of stuff in ! Super good quality !</li>
    <li> This was okay.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I returned it because it was actually too big for what I wanted, and the leopard print fabric was kind of creepy :-/.</li>
    <li> This clutch is lighter than it looks in pics and has little specs of gold glitter. Other than the glitter that I dislike, I love the size of this bag! Its huge and perfect for carrying a lot of things without actually carrying a purse. The quality is okay but you get what you pay for. I would purchase this for a friend :)</li>
    <li> The leopard top part is not \\&quot;textured\\&quot; or \\&quot;luxe\\&quot; it is flat out fuzzy. Like a stuffed animal. And not a high quality faux fur more like a mangy carpet. HUGELY disappointed and returned for refund. I May improve rating if refund is processed quickly and seamlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so technically it is returnable... to China. WHich costs as much as the clutch did. What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Size is big enough to hold an 11\\&quot; MacBook Air.</li>
    <li> I love this bag it is exactly how it is pictured. It&#x27;s large and roomy. A must have if you like big bags. I like the versatility of going from clutch to shoulder bag. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PURSE! IT IS ROOMY THAN WHAT I HAVE EXPECTED WHICH IS NICE AND THE SIZE IS PERFECT</li>
    <li> Wayy bigger than what I expected!</li>
    <li> The faux fur material was horrible and due to the distance and cost to return, I gave it away to a theater group.</li>
    <li> This was a purse that I need to have for a outing and it matched my shoes, thanks for your quickness in delivering</li>
    <li> this item is just as it looks in the picture. i am a satisfied customer and will love to buy more of this in different colors. loved it</li>
    <li> gorgeous clutch! it is just the right size for evenings out to hold the essentials including my cellphone. the quality seems good too. my friends are so envious, especially at the price I got this great bag at!</li>
    <li> It was as described I guess but it looks very cheap and the color looks faded and old. I doubt I will carry this. Just not the type of quality I like. I don&#x27;t mind something being cheap as long as it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> It looks just as it is in the picture but its not worth like $20. The quality of the strap is poor</li>
    <li> I love it. The color is brighter in person and it a big cutch  which I loved</li>
    <li> This bag is not what I expected its a little big and hard like fabric is wrapped around cardboard with a little leopard accent all in all I would carry it because I bought it and don&#x27;t want to have to pay to return it . I did read the reviews and saw someone did say that it was kinda big but I said well let me see for myself and it was. I think its something that may be used for labtop or a tablet.</li>
    <li> Despite the rating I loved this 1 , and I don&#x27;t mine it is large in fact that&#x27;s a plus in the bag, the only way it&#x27;s not roomy inside , but it&#x27;s a clutch not a handbag</li>
    <li> Very old fashion I wish my money could be returned . Even my grand ma refuse it as a gift waste of money and time</li>
    <li> Every 1...louv it at my workplace....thnx alot</li>
    <li> I love it true to size can be also carried as a crossbody. would most definatly recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I also received this late and what I got wasn&#x27;t on the picture I saw online.  It was just to big of a clutch. It was more like a laptop case cover which I been using it for that and my back pack.</li>
    <li> Good clutch, the quality is great!! Arrived on time!!</li>
    <li> The clutch is the perfect size for my purpose. It looks really flat at first but it holds more than you&#x27;d think. It arrived in less than 10 days, which is amazing, and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I&#x27;m very happy with this bag.</li>
    <li> okay it doesn&#x27;t seem to well made honestly but i love it !! it works for me and it makes me look buinessy haha i enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;if your looking for something cute this is it</li>
    <li> It was larger than I thought it was going to be (a very big plus), and it is of very good quality. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> It is a nice purse for the price but it is much to large for my taste. I will give it to a taller friend and look for one more to my liking.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is great deal.  It is a larger clutch but comes with shoulder strap.  Very cute bag.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected too big the picture made it look smaller how can I refund it there was no receipt in the package</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;clutch&amp;#34; is humongous. I would call it a purse or satchel. The leopard print part is slightly furry and is DARKER than what is shown in the picture. I bought this to match with something else that is the same brown shown in the pic and so I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. Nice purse tho. Will be using the he&#x27;ll out of it :-p. Oversized clutch maybe but you will be pushing it.</li>
    <li> i was really disappointed when i bought this item. was not what I expected</li>
    <li> love the size.also have inside department for my phone.make up too,love the stripes.my tablet fit in pecfectly! can hold much.</li>
    <li> This came bigger than I thought it was. I guess I didn&#x27;t check the dimensions as I thought it was wallet size, but it is much bigger than that. But good for the price.</li>
    <li> The size is great and It is very spacious. I choose this rating because you have two options, you can wear it as a clutch bag or a shoulder bag.  I love it because I love leopard print. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Beautiful clutch though took too long to arrive but in all, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Leopard panel is VERY dark.  It appears brighter in the photo of the posting.  One can barely see the leopard print because of the dark background.  Otherwise, the quality of the material is very good.  This is not a leather PRINT, but a close nap, like calf hair.</li>
    <li> I just received this in d mail,it looks great. A very stylish oversize purse! 😁😁😍😍 it matches my shoe!</li>
    <li> Love this bag. I took it to ATLANTIC CITY for my bday weekend. Quality clutch, very spacious, great price. Will definitely come back!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, had no idea how large it was and was afraid my daughter wouldn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;She loved it! It was her favorite Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> I love this purse/clutch ! At first when I ordered this product I thought it was a normal size clutch, should of check the measurements of it. When I received it I was shocked that it was so big, as soon as my friend saw it she loved it! I really like it and the price for what is being sold is amazing. For sure this purse would be over $20 at a store at the mall.</li>
    <li> it is really cute but the leopard is darker in person and it is bigger than what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love anything thats leopard. it;s not what I expected. I haven&#x27;t had one person look at it to buy. I guess I will be having to use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this clutch for to match a pair of boots. Perfect! I love the over size and the leopard print. Added just a touch of animal print that I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is a large and I mean large clutch.  I bought it for my niece and she is planning on using it to carry papers and an I pad to class.</li>
    <li> This is a cute clutch. It&#x27;s just bigger than I expected. Still looks cute!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this! Love the size of this. Is very room. Size was perfect!</li>
    <li> I received the Leopard Clutch on time and it was in great shape, It looks just like the picture. Now the unfortunate thoughts,I am not so excited about the size, for some reason I knew it was larger than most clutches but I didn&#x27;t think it was that large. So I have mixed feelings on it. The Leopard fabric is fuzzy not plastic so I really like that and it does hold all my things. The snap closures don&#x27;t alway find their place to close,so I have to take the time to maneuver them into place (you have to snap them close or the clutch looks ridiculous with the flap sticking out). The inside pockets are great. So I don&#x27;t love it, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Materials look very high end. Size is really bigger than the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and I loved the packaging</li>
