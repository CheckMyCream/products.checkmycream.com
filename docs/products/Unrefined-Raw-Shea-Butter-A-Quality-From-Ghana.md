<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received the item as promised.  It was well packaged, and the price was excellent.  I am looking forward to using it.  I know I ordered 10 pounds, but it seems like a lot more in the package.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped in a timely manner...good quality Shea Butter, will definitely reorder when supply is low ... perfect quantity for my small business use.</li>
    <li> Love this item, I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. A little pricey, but well worth the product because it is useful in so many concoctions for my business.</li>
    <li> Good quality butter. Melted and filtered the butter prior to use. Hardly anything to filter and could have forgone the extra step. I use this make body butter, lotion and in my soaps. Love the quality of the finished products. I have previously bought the butter that is ivory colored. Both are very comparable in their results.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s so smooth, and rich, very luxurious, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.  Just a little essential oil and you can&#x27;t even smell the Shea butter.  I&#x27;m going to buy a bigger batch next purchase!</li>
    <li> After correcting their error and replacing the product they sent first that had a few bugs in it they promptly sent a new batch without any bugs in it and the product was as stated in the discription with no problems. It worked out great for what I was using it for. Just being honest so you know what might occur.</li>
    <li> People please do your homework. How could this be grade A organic shea butter ? I ordered this and  was sorely disappointed . It never sank into the skin it had a weird smell so beware, be smart about your purchases pay a little bit more and get really good shea butter . Butter should have a  smooth consistency and melt easily .just felt like Vaseline on the skin it never sink in and it was very strange don&#x27;t buy this if you can avoid it.</li>
    <li> Very well. I will definitely be purchasing more from this seller in the near future</li>
    <li> Great Results, timing of delivery etc...</li>
    <li> I received my order quick and it was exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> love it will be ordering more soon</li>
    <li> Perfect for my home made skin care</li>
    <li> This is my second order and I really love the butter!  It&#x27;s fresh and good quality.  Packaged very nicely.  I received my shipment in a few days. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> this usually cost $10 per pound locally. you can&#x27;t beat the savings!</li>
    <li> Ordered my shea on the 8th and received today I wouldn&#x27;t order from anyone else this is my 2nd box and I love it my hair loves it and skin exactly what I expected and weighed in exactly at 10lbs</li>
    <li> Just a described, arrived quickly with instructions....will definitley buy from them again...I have bought Shea butter before this was raw,smooth and great for body butters.</li>
    <li> Love the Shea butter. Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like Shea butter is very good for the skin. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a great price</li>
    <li> I have ordered shea butter a few times before, so I have some idea of what to expect.  It all seemed fine this time except for the bright yellow color.  I have seen yellow before, but not like this.  It is listed as unrefined, organic, but the usual smell is not there and I just do not know if I really got what I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> Good product.Quick shipping</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with my purchase of 10 lbs. of raw unrefined shea butter. It smell and feels great, the price was awesome and shipping was very fast. I make and sell my own natural hair products and I am so excited to be able to purchase a large amount of shea butter for a reasonable price and shipped in an amazing time. The shea butter was wrapped in plastic with a label stating it is unrefined shea butter and the smell is the natural smell and not spoiled; it was then wrapped in another plastic bag in side a shipping box just like the picture. Once again I am very pleased with my purchase and I will be ordering again even though I am sure this will last me probably the rest of the year. I will definitely recommend this product to others. Thank you Ghana Africa...Please continue providing outstanding natural products.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is great for your skin in the winter. It&#x27;s fresh with a golden yellow color.  I plan to purchase from this company on a yearly basis.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, melts well without smoke, smooth and creamy in my body butter blends.  The value is excellent for the price and amount.</li>
    <li> Leave my skin and hair soft.. Great product..</li>
    <li> CHEAPEST SOURCE FOR SHEA BUTTER. I normally purchase Shea butter from a different site at $7/lb for 10lbs - much cheaper than I had seen at other places - until I found this batch on Amazon. It&#x27;s funny I missed it all this time is beyond me - probably because the smaller batches at $10/lb are what you see more. Also, the $10 shipping fee was not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try BOTH ivory shea butter and &amp;#34;yellow shea butter&amp;#34; (which is really kpangnan butter) and the price was right. Even with shipping, it will be $3/lb - CAN&#x27;T BEAT THAT! I also needed black soap that I planned to mix it with shea butter because black soap is a little too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This product is AMAZING! The scent may be overpowering, but this is truly shea butter not the crap you see all over the place. I also feel this product was much newer than what I purchased from my other source. There may be a smoky aroma to shea butter, but that&#x27;s normal. Look at how they make the product and you will see that the smoky aroma is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USING IT:&lt;br /&gt;The product is a lot creamier and more buttery that my other batch. It&#x27;s thick but rubbing between your palms melts it and it feels so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before use: I use a double boiler to melt it. You may notice minor particles - these are the shell of the shea nut. Once it&#x27;s melted, I line a sieve with paper towel(I was out of cheesecloth) and let the oil filter through. THAT&#x27;S IT. Perfect and particle-free. To make it easier to use, I let it cool a bit and whip it up with some avocado oil and jojoba oil. To tone down the smell, I added some of my boyajian orange oil - it&#x27;s food grade and should be used for cooking, but it&#x27;s what I had on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT: BUY BUY BUY. I was concerned about the review who got less than 10lbs, and I weighed mine. Both were slightly over 10lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY MORE, SAVE MORE: Since I was purchasing 3 items - white and yellow butters and black soap, I purchased directly from their site where the shipping cost was not fixed. Total cost was $72.54. If I had purchased from here, it would have cost $82.47. If you&#x27;re only buying one item, buy from Amazon - you save that way.</li>
    <li> when i click on this the pic was not yellow and when i got product it was soft and still soft, i don&#x27;t work with this for  more people have reactions to yellow shea then white</li>
    <li> It went surpass my expectation.  I will be ordering more by September, if the price go down or stay the same.</li>
    <li> I was amazed as to how fast it arrived. The quality and quantity was well worth the price. It came packaged well. I am very satisfied with the product . When I run out I do plan on ordering from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I purchase a large quantity of this Shea butter and it came just as described. Very rich, fresh, and soft. Will surely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Awesome product !! Just as expected. Do take note that unrefined shea butter has it&#x27;s own earthly smell but it&#x27;s a small price compared to the benefits ! Will buy from this company again!! Shipping was fast too!!</li>
    <li> I buy all my product from this seller and thought I would try the yellow one and I didn&#x27;t care for it as much as I love the Ivory one..it was an experience now I know I only want the Ivory one..Love this seller though product is good and quick delivery always.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter, it is soft and does not take long melt into your skin, great moisturizer and decreases spot and scares on your skin over time with continuous use.</li>
    <li> ordered this last year, made a lot of lotions for friends, stayed fresh and last for over a year in a jar</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and I&#x27;m glad I got 10lbs worth because my family and I go through it quickly! We use it for our skin on a daily basis and we use it in our hair as a moisturizer and scalp. I personally love the earthy scent, however I will put some essential oils in it for fragrance when I make a batch for my mother in law, who also loves it. The product arrived just as pictured and it was in excellent condition. No rancid smell, it was fresh and very soft and easy to work with. When I run out I will definitely order more!! It has done wonders for our skin and hair, especially since my daughters and I have natural hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  High quality, many many uses, very yellow, pleasant taste and smell.</li>
    <li> Love it, best quality I have found so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality &amp; service</li>
    <li> Start notice the difference in my skin after use and also in my hair , Really I like it .</li>
    <li> the product was in excellent condition and quality was great too!&lt;br /&gt;easy to use with other ingredients and already made several jars of shea hand and foot creams</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, great quality. This will last a long time, arrived super fast and sealed, could have packaged it in a resealable bag.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Shea Butter! I have ordered a lot of Shea Butter from other vendors and by far this is the BEST Shea Butter seller. I have natural hair and this is my holy grail product. Smellgood ships the product the same day and it&#x27;s exactly how they describe it to be. LOVE, LOVE the  product.  If you want good quality shea butter, then please buy from smellgood you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> A great price for a quality product.  I paid $25 for a medium sized (quart) container at an art &amp;craft show.  This is 10 pounds!  More than enough to share with all my family and friends. I am very happy with this purchase and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I love Shea Butter and use it for almost everything concerning skin. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve worked with. The only issue I had is it took forever to melt. Once mixed the lotion came out smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> The shea butter didn&#x27;t take long to arrive and it was packaged perfectly. The shea butter itself was great, stored well and lasted for quite a while. It comes in one big solid  block. 5 STARS people.</li>
    <li> has been what I expected every time</li>
    <li> Hi, I used this as a base to create a blend I use for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I added grape seed, avocado, sweet almond, castor oils and a fragrance of orange, peppermint, lemon or rosemary.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter. I love to make lotions out of it. I do have to say that there were some discolored dry areas that I had to throw out. Besides that it is a great product and excellent price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Top Quality, better than I imagined,</li>
    <li> The Shea Butter was nice and you did need to melt it down to separate the small particles in the butter. Very nice for the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> So awesome. I&#x27;ve been giving shea butter out as gifts and this is the best quality I&#x27;ve seen yet. I will definitely continue to buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> great body and hair moisturizer</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and fast shipping. I placed my order on a Sunday and it arrived in the mail on Thursday. The butter is yellow in color with an earthy scent. It melts easily in your hand and can be applied as-is or melted and strained first. Will order again!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Great price and quick delivery. Thank u</li>
    <li> Great quality butter at a good price.  I noticed the price has increased since I ordered it.</li>
    <li> My Shea butter arrived faster than I had expected! I came just the way they had described it would. After I filtered it out, which didn&#x27;t leave much debris behind, I let it cool and cut it into soft squares. I use it in soaps, creams &amp; body butters</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It made my soap darker but it was definitely a great product. I have made three batches of soap and still have more than half of the Shea left.</li>
    <li> I must say I am more than pleasantly surprised at the quality of this shea. This is a dreamy, super creamy, sunny yellow shea. It is not dark yellow like the picture (at least my batch isn&#x27;t). Smells earthy but the scent is not overpowering. Easily spreads on your skin and melts. Love it!!! Packaged in a sealed bag to avoid any melting and/or leaks which was a plus!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product, and the customer service was wonderful!  The only thing I&#x27;m not sure of is whether or not this product is organic.  The packing slip said it was, but the description did not specify.  It would help if this were clearer in the description.</li>
    <li> it not yellow like the pic . it white</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering shea butter from this and one other vendor on Amazon for some time, only previously all my orders were small batches that were packed in 16-32 oz. containers. I lost a fair amount of product trying to scrape it all out of the containers. Because this 10 lb. batch comes in a sealed plastic bag, I can pick out chunks &#x27;til my kitchen scale shows the weight I want, and I don&#x27;t end up losing any product due to packaging. If you can go through it fast enough, I recommend buying the shea butter in the larger batches.</li>
    <li> soapers dream- how could you go wrong with a name brand product at an inexpensive price. I bough three more in other colors.. .. ..</li>
    <li> The shea butter arrived quickly. I love it. Quality product. Everyone in my house uses this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I really love this shea butter its quality and I make personal care products that are really good</li>
    <li> When i received it. my dad said what did you order that thing heavy. I&#x27;m in love with that shea buterrrrrrrrrr seriously so much of it that i don&#x27;t know what to do with it. i Thaught it will be just a little. everyone love it at home i had to share. love it. Very good quality too. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It was a mess when it got to me it was all melted and I just let it stay in the box, I though that it is supposed to be in chunks but this was a mess.  I took a little out.  Made some cream.  I like Shea butter and would order some more but not like this.  What is in it or what make like this messy itching?</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m did not know that unrefined actually meant totally unfiltered. There is a lot debris this as well as large pieces of what I am assuming is Shea nut. Smell is fine. It&#x27;s not grainy at all. But I wasted 12.5 pounds of oils for soap when I melted this and saw how much junk was on the bottom. I make soap to sell and I wasn&#x27;t going to chance it. Sorry to give a bad review but wanted to let others make an informed decision.</li>
    <li> I found a bug in the shea butter, kind of gross....</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.It is the best stuff for dry hands and feet.Makes great gifts for friends and family.Best natural product that we&#x27;ve ever used.Ordered it walked to the mailbox and their it was-super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> thank u use it everyday</li>
    <li> Has a yellow tint that gets on everything. Worse batch I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Bow down my head to this. Awesome product</li>
    <li> I have waited 12 days for this product and was so disappointed when it did not show up.. How let down I am. I contacted the company several times and they know about as much as I do. ..no tracking info. Well I won&#x27;t ever purchase anything from THIS company again. One bad experience is all I needed! Good luck to those who buy this product.</li>
    <li> Totally in love with this product and the seller. Always a loyal customer for life - I will be using this on my future children as well :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I just can&#x27;t say enough how impressed I am with this shea butter! I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be broken down into 5 chunks and it&#x27;s not all the same. Some is yellow and some is white.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy my freind just recently start selling Shea Butter to help with income. She could not afford to purchase in her hometown so I ordered off amazon and it was a cheap buy but quality substance. I will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product will be ordering more...Great price for the amount...</li>
    <li> The product arrived as described, and a lot of product for the price! I make my own lotions, hair products, facial products by working with raw, unrefined shea butter for about 6 months, and find it healthier to do so, than to buy products that are watered down or contain ingredients that are drying to the skin. This is a quality product that results in a great base foundation for any skincare items.</li>
    <li> If you have never handled raw shea butter be aware that it has a unique smell. Most people either love it or hate it! I am ok with the smell but the product is awesome! The raw shea butter works so well that you barely have to use any to cover your hands and arms.</li>
    <li> Ordered a few weeks ago 100 percent cant say ANYTHING wrong. Recommended to anyone looking.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter arrived on time and of good quality, we use it to apply to the hair of our two girls with wonderful results</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and I absolutely love it! It has a very distinct Shea butter aroma, which should be expected. The product feels great on your skin and I can&#x27;t wait to start making my creams with it. Don&#x27;t hesitate to order this product, the quality is wonderful and it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love it but will never order around the holidays again it took me 3 weeks to get it. I&#x27;m already out had to order more off ebay. Hope it is as good as this one.</li>
    <li> i use it&lt;br /&gt;its very good and very soft&lt;br /&gt;for my skine and hair&lt;br /&gt;shea butter nutural and new&lt;br /&gt;for my foot also</li>
    <li> A really nice High Quality shea butter.  It works great in all my products.</li>
    <li> She butter can be used for healing more than dry skin. I use it every day for my joints and it works. Thank you so much for this information.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase and I&#x27;m highly please with the quality of the Shea butter.</li>
    <li> This shea butter had a nice feel to it I was thick but I expected that from the product I bought it to make face cream but it was a tad thick and oily for that and I could only use it at night to give my skin time to absorb it. The smell was mild from what I have had before in my shea butter experience so I appreciated that</li>
    <li> I love the quality, texture and color. It is very smooth to the touch and very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> great price and quantity with excellent quality</li>
    <li> I do not believe for one minute that this is Raw Unrefined Shea Butter grade A Quality. This is my second order of Shea butter but first from this vendor. At first I was shocked by the bright yellow colour. It did smell like Shea butter so I decided not to return it. I am very disappointed! The butter was not smooth at all after whipping and it turned very hard. It was very wax-like and did not easily rub into the skin. It also stains. I&#x27;ve just made a second batch hoping for a different result and it is exactly the same as the first. What a waste of money! Be very careful who you buy from. I bought this from this seller because it was fulfilled by Amazon thinking there was some protection in ensuring the product would have been vetted. I&#x27;ve been ordering from amazon for over 10 years now and this is only the second product I&#x27;ve had an issue with so I had to leave this feedback to let others know - buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I would recommend anyone who use Shea butter on a daily basis to purchase it unrefined in a 10 LB bulk.  The reason why I prefer to buy Shea Butter in bulk, is because I use to buy an 8 oz. container for about 5 or 6 bucks and it didn&#x27;t last me very long. Since I swear by Shea Butter, I feel like this product offer is a great deal, because I only paid about 20-30 dollars with shipping included.  The Shea Butter came bagged in a box with plastic wrapped around it to ensure freshness.  The Shea is a bright yellow, it&#x27;s very soft, and has a very strong smell.  The strong smell and texture indicates just how fresh the Shea Butter is.  The delivery didn&#x27;t take long at all. I received the Shea Butter in maybe like 3 or 4 days after placing my order. If you want softer, smoother, and clearer skin then get this product. Shea Butter is great for fading discoloration, and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a timely manner.  This is a lot of shea butter for the price. Thr shea butter was broken up but that was perfect for me b.c it was easier to pull out the amount I wanted.  Over the Shea butter is great. Its natural and pure plus it comes with instructions on how to use it and what its used for. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I melt it down to filter out any impurities and use it in skin care creams and soaps. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Oh my, my, my!!!!  This stuff is the bomb diggity!!!  What! I have never, ever been more pleased with a purchase.  Stop it!?  I mean in a good way.  But, seriously don&#x27;t stop.  I will be/am ordering this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thing of beauty (tears)  :) of happiness!  Everyone in the worlds should have this stuff.  Once I showed it to my family everybody wanted their own box.  GET IT!  It is well worth it.  Looks just like the picture and smells heavenly, beautiful and soft just gorgeous!  I can&#x27;t say enough as you can see.</li>
    <li> I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW MUCH SHEA BUTTER I GOT FOR THE PRICE I PAID ...I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILLBE ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN THE QUAILTY OF THE SHEA IS TOP NOCH ..THANK YOU EXTREMELY HAPPY</li>
    <li> I have shea butter for years, I brought this just for me as I use shea butter on my skin hair, nails, and to mike with my essential oils. I love it fast shipping and little no debris :) I store it large beautiful glass jars until I&#x27;m ready to use it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, great Shea butter will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Fresh, good quality, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and consistency. We use it for our body butters! Try it today.</li>
    <li> Great product with a good consistency..not grainy at all..I will get feedback from customers shortly as I have purchased from other vendors in the past..I want to compare</li>
    <li> I got this product and it lasted a year. I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I purchased some Shea Butter in Ghana a few years ago.  This has the same quality.. EXCELLENT...</li>
    <li> As a soapmaker, I am always on the hunt for good shea butter!  And Smellgood hits it out of the park every time!  I always get the correct weight, or sometimes a tad more.&lt;br /&gt;Its always moist and free of debris.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!!! WILL BE ORDERING MORE</li>
    <li> Not  smooth. Very grainy.</li>
    <li> I loved it I have brought this about 3 times</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal-raw and unrefined.  Smells super strong and super nutty. Not so great if you&#x27;re used to the refined shea butter (it takes away the smell), but it&#x27;s super awesome for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I make a lot of all natural body products and spend a lot of time looking for the best price for my ingredients without compromising quality.  This Shea Butter is both an excellent price and excellent quality.  There is very little to no nut residue and it is very clean as well plus it has the beautiful natural scent of Shea Butter that I love.  I will buy from them again for sure!!</li>
    <li> If you like the raw smell of the shea butter then stuff is for you. If you are looking to scent it and use with other essential oils with it,  then you might want to try another product. The Shea butter has a very strong scent and is difficult to change.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality... soft, not grainy. My skin loves it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> 10 lbs. I really did not need it all, but the price was good. it is good product and works fine.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I got!  Shipping was a little off since I did it for two day shipping, but I&#x27;m very satisfied.  I also like how there is an instructional video to help process it.  Thanks so much.  My mom eyes were big when she saw how much I got.  Needless to say we are a shea butter people. lol. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used shea butter for the last 2 years and by far this is the best quality stuff. I&#x27;m not sharing this batch with anyone!!</li>
