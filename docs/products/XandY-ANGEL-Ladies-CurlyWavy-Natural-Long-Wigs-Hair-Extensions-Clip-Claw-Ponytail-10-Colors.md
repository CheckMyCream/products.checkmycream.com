<li> I ordered the dark brown and it is more of a dark auburn.</li>
<li> The only negative is that it is difficult to choose what color is closest to your own hair color on line.</li>
<li> Too little hair picture is not actual amount of hair sent</li>
<li> I am just sad I am going to have to cut a few layers in it to make it fit my hair :(&lt;br /&gt;It came early and is the exact color I ordered.</li>
<li> but I like mine will try on once I dye my hair dark brown</li>
<li> Not worth returning it</li>
<li> I ordered a dark brown because the color chart showed it as being almost black in color</li>
<li> Color chart not accurate</li>
<li> Arrived earlier than expected but received the Wrong Color!  </li>
<li> I found the clip was a little hard to open through the hair (because it made is slip a bit in my hand) and it was difficult to get all my hair to hide in the clip.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure anymore.</li>
<li> looked very fake on me and it is heavy.</li>
<li> I received this item with broken hair clip which is completely useless and waste of money :(</li>
<li> the bad reviews idk why maybe they didnt press to choose color</li>

    <li> looks great, gorgeous curls and matches my hair</li>
    <li> Was delivered on time and packaging was good. Quality is good. The only negative is that it is difficult to choose what color is closest to your own hair color on line. I ordered the dark brown and it is more of a dark auburn. Definitely a red hue.</li>
    <li> I. Received mine today I like it the syntectic hair is almost real very soft haven&#x27;t tried it on yet but its very nice  perfect color the bad reviews idk why maybe they didnt press to choose color but I like mine will try on once I dye my hair dark brown â˜º</li>
    <li> looked very fake on me and it is heavy. i think on the right person this would be ok</li>
    <li> I like that feel like real hair, my only issue was .that it was not the  clip claw on it, but I send a e-mail to the seller and they  are going to refund the money, i will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered one on here before and it was perfect, but I recently changed my hair color and order another one. The one that just came in is the right color but its short! Its not even 30cm. I thought these were good but I&#x27;m not sure anymore.</li>
    <li> came on time the color is nice. wears well.it is perfect for some one on the go, easy to fit.</li>
    <li> My friends think it&#x27;s real!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! I am just sad I am going to have to cut a few layers in it to make it fit my hair :(&lt;br /&gt;It came early and is the exact color I ordered. I am going to buy out all of them once I get paid Friday These are so much better than ones I bought from stores around town and even Sally&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I received this item with broken hair clip which is completely useless and waste of money :(</li>
    <li> It is what I expected and needed so I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> they look real and vary easy to apply</li>
    <li> Too little hair picture is not actual amount of hair sent</li>
    <li> Looks real but not as long or curly as picture shows.  Color chart not accurate so you need to contact the store to get information on the colors.  I ordered a dark brown because the color chart showed it as being almost black in color but when I got it, it was a medium red brown color.  The store was very good about it and is willing to send me another one in the color I wanted.</li>
    <li> Really loving this ponytail wig, easy to wear n handle, hair texture is very good, first time I have ordered ponytail wig, just I am completely satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected but received the Wrong Color!  Not worth returning it so I just donated it to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> The hair quality was great. I found the clip was a little hard to open through the hair (because it made is slip a bit in my hand) and it was difficult to get all my hair to hide in the clip. (I have medium length hair.)  Great seller and product arrived quicker than expected. Perhaps next time I&#x27;ll try a mesh with an adjustable elastic and comb grips instead of a clip. May work great for someone else though.</li>
    <li> My kids enjoy playing dress up</li>
