      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll leave it to others to swing their opinions on the quality of Williams&#x27; scent and lather like so many subjective bludgeons; for the record, my wife says I smell sexy, and I get awesome shaves.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Old School simplicity. If you are somebody who realized that the hype about multiple blades was rally just BS and you got an old school safety razor - you will love this stuff. I buy it by the case. I gave it to my grandson with a brush and razor and it will give it to the grandkids when they get beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good razor, a shaving mug,  a really good badger brush and a whole bunch of Williams soap and them just lather up and enjoy.</li>
    <li> Totally takes me back to my dad shaving in the early 60&#x27;s! its awesome! rich, lathery, even smells the same.</li>
    <li> My husband raves about this soap and says hands down it is the best shave soap he has used yet.  He had expensive soaps in the past but says this one lathers better, lasts longer and does not have a strong scent that interferes with his cologne.  Combine all that with the incredibly reasonable price and this product is an all-around winner!</li>
    <li> My Husband always wants this shave soap it does a great job with out breaking the bank, and that is important too.  He has no complaint..</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It lasts a long time, lathers well, the price is right, and it does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> This mug soap has been made for about 175 years. It does a great job of what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Great buy!  Smells wonderful while giving lots of fine lather.</li>
    <li> What can I say: it&#x27;s williams shave soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. It&#x27;s not the best shave soap in the world, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. It tends to be rather sensitive to hard water, but it will lather like crazy with soft water and a badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think it was walgreens that used to carry it in town...when they stopped stocking it, I was glad to see that amazon had it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a half dozen high end shaving soaps popular with badger and blade as well as r/wickededge, and this produces the best lather. It&#x27;s inexpensive, smells inoffensive, and is the last soap i&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the old way of shaving and don&#x27;t need to continue to buy expensive foam&lt;br /&gt;products to shave with. Williams Mug Shaving Soap is superb. I get great shaves, the soap&lt;br /&gt;lasts a lot longer than a can of foam or gel and in my opinion does as good or better a job!!&lt;br /&gt;I draw the line at a straight razor though as I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d cut myself doing so. I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;Williams Mug Soap.</li>
    <li> The best facial shaving soap I have used. I have used several and this is by far the best for me and even a good price for 6 soap cakes too.</li>
    <li> Nice soap, smells better than I expected. Not getting the lather I was hoping for, but maybe I am doing something wrong here. Will try with a shaving mug.  After using this for a while, I need to revise my initial opinion. This soap is not bad, but even after my techniques was getting better, I was still having trouble getting the lather I was hoping for. Then I tried some others (Bebelush, Proraso) and then my whole view changed. It wasn&#x27;t my technique, it was the soap... As I was putting this in rotation with the others, I not only noticed difference in the quality of the lather, but also the fact that I would get nicks using this soap, but not the others. All skins are different and your mileage may vary, but if you&#x27;re not getting the results you had hoped for, it might not just be you,,,, This is of course very cheap, and lasts forever, but if you want to spend a little more and want to see some better results, try some other soaps, specifically soft soaps and probably that will open a whole new world for you.</li>
    <li> Price great, will last for a very long time, good lather</li>
    <li> I used this twice with a double-edge safety razor, and both times, I had multiple nicks and cuts. When I use a quality shaving soap, I hardly have that problem. If you like writing all over your face with a styptic pencil after you shave, by all means, Williams shaving soap is the product for you. But if you want to save your face, you pay the good money for the good stuff. This is certainly NOT the good stuff.</li>
    <li> Much less finicky than my prior soaps, really easy to get full lather without having to have just the right amount of water on the brush</li>
    <li> Excellent soap I can no longer purchase locally.</li>
    <li> This product is not found in local stores around Memphis because most stores are pushing the higher priced shaving soaps.  I have been purchasing Williams&#x27; on line for a long time now, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Wishing my ring would come</li>
    <li> I love this shaving soap!  I&#x27;ve used several soaps and creams, but if I had to get by with just one, this would be my soap!  Lathers very easily and does a great job of protecting my face while shaving!</li>
    <li> Great lather, great price!</li>
    <li> Product produces a nice lather and the soap cake last longer than the previous brand I used.</li>
    <li> My Dad uses these and has for years. He likes the foam he can get from it and the soap seems to last.</li>
    <li> Purchased as an extra &amp;#34;stocking stuffer&amp;#34; for my husband.  This was on his Amazon &amp;#34;Wish-list&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is an OK shaving soap, but I feel &amp;#34;Arko&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Derby&amp;#34; are better. For me they lather quicker and seem to provide a better cushion while shaving. The biggest knock on soaps like these are the smell. They are shaving soaps. Not some kind of aftershave or cologne.</li>
    <li> good soap! works like it says for a straight razor.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap lathers up nicely. I&#x27;d give it five stars, but the smell is not entirely to my liking.</li>
    <li> Good value. Does the job. Have used this soap for years. Works in cold water.</li>
    <li> Used this for over 5o years. Love it. Prefer it over Colgate and others. Soap last longer and gives a superior shave.</li>
    <li> I recently got into wet-shaving and this was the first shaving lather product I purchased. If you have a nice quality badger-hair brush it makes a very nice shave. Love the smell and the lather really sticks to my face, not watery or thin at all! Mine came in a pack of 6 and it will definitely last me a while! I&#x27;m still on the first soap bar 2 months in and it&#x27;s barely half way done! Also it&#x27;s convenient to have the soap bar just sit in the bottom of my shaving mug rather than have another tube of shaving cream sitting around.</li>
    <li> been using it for years</li>
    <li> It is so inexpensive, i wondered if it would be good. Have been using now and it replaced the Italian shaving soap i was using. Since the price increase, I get 5 Williams soaps for the price of one of the Italian brands.  I purchased based on other reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dad. I had no idea how far one bar would go. Apparently there is enough in the bag for the rest of his lifetime and we may even be able to bury some with him:) He loves the scent and the price</li>
    <li> Great lather for such a small price. It does the job just a well as my other more expensive soap.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for many years. Can&#x27;t beat the price here!</li>
    <li> Best mug shaving soap I have used. Excellent lather with hot or cold water. No fancy scents-just high quality shaving soap. Getting hard to find so it&#x27;s great that Amazon offers it</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely, Is not too scented, and works quite well on a tough beard in sensitive skin.  Priced way better than wally world too.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shaving soap, and I can no longer find it locally.  Was thrilled to find it online.  It arrived undamaged and on time.  I know he&#x27;ll be thrilled to find this practical but much needed gift under the tree.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, but it&#x27;s a Christmas gift to my dad every year and he seems to love the stuff.</li>
    <li> It lathers well, smells good, is inexpensive, and lasts a while. My only issue is bringing it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> If you like soap and a brush for a clean shave, this is the soap for you.  Lots of lather, moistens bristles just perfect.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s the only shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used since I stopped using shaving cream last year, so I can&#x27;t compare it. It gives a nice lather the more you use the brush, depending on how much you want to work at it. It tends to gunk up the space between the blades much less than shaving cream, especially if I use a waterier mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the brush tends to dig a concave hole in the center of the soap, which is already slightly concave by design. As I get to the end of the bar, I can end up with an odd soap donut when I break through the middle. I try to work the brush around the outside edges of the soap to make it wear even, and I flip it over every so often. Regardless, at this price, it is SOOO much cheaper than shaving cream, and less waste in the landfill, so I don&#x27;t mind chucking the last 20% of the cake in the trash and breaking out a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old school, I love this stuff.  As good or better shave than shaving cream and a fraction of the cost.  You&#x27;re paying a lot of marketing cost when you buy shaving cream.  You don&#x27;t need it, a good shaving soap is better and cheaper.  Your lady will dig it too.  You&#x27;re a real renaissance man....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several methods of prepping the brush and soap puck prior to shaving, but I can&#x27;t seem to get a consistent, quality foam. Williams soap smells wonderful, but it just doesn&#x27;t to the trick for me.</li>
    <li> I prefer to shave with soap instead of foam or gel. This is a good product at a very good price. Getting a six pack of soap is a convenient and cheap way to stock up.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. Creates a very good lather when you get the soap/water ratio right. You can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> My son loves this soap to shave with.</li>
    <li> Gift for brother, his favorite</li>
    <li> Basic but good.  Fits perfectly into a shaving mug.</li>
    <li> I have been using old style shaving soap for a few years now and love it.  Williams&#x27; is one of the better that I have used and at the best price.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years. If you use gel or foam, your are missing out on the best shave of your life. I have a heavy beard, and I am a happy camper with this product.</li>
    <li> My dad couldn&#x27;t find his favorite shaving soap, so I ordered it online for him. He is now very happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only shaving mug soap to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with William&#x27;s Mug soap for about two years now.  I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen soaps and lotions, and this is easily my favorite soap.  It is probably tied with my favorite lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent.  The lather is great when you get the correct amount of water in your brush.  However, it will dry out (a bit) on your face if you lather it with too little water.  That is your cue that you need to adjust your preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how my face feels after shaving.  When I use this soap, I will usually forgo any aftershave or even alum.  It has a slight astringent feel: tightness across my cheeks and neck.  This, along with the scent, are personal preferences.  So you may totally disagree with me.  But a puck of this soap costs about a dollar and a half, so why not give it a try?</li>
    <li> This is good &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; soap. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Use williams in the decades old method of dipping soap in hot water for a minute with a stiff boar brush, the reward is a slick and lasting lather. One of my favorites amongst all more expensive and supposedly easier lathering hard triple milled soaps.</li>
    <li> Good soap at a great price and is scent free...</li>
    <li> This soap gives a good lather. I use it every shave.  I like it.  I would recommend it to any one looking for a good shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Used to by this locally and all the shops I&#x27;ve checked have stopped carrying it.  This will last me a while.</li>
    <li> These are very good quality and a economical way to shave. This is a cheaper alternative to the canned gel. At least with these bars you are not paying for the can. These will last a real long time too. The best part is that the lather is warm when applied to your face!</li>
    <li> Hard to find shaving soap, that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, at your favorite retailer these days. Cheap shaving is why I started using soap and a brush 30 something years ago.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good deal. At my age, I may never have to buy any more.</li>
    <li> A little slow  on  lather but  works  well</li>
    <li> I use traditional shaving brush, soap with old school straight razor for a long time. I have tried over 10 different shaving soaps as well as 20+ shaving modern creams. Soaps are definitely better than the shaving creams. This product would be better than what you would get  from a modern shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you compare this soap to other high end shaving soaps however, it is less creamy. Thus it will provide less slipperiness and would leave your skin less nourished after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to recommend another brand on this review, but if you search further, you will find better shaving soaps. If nothing else, this is a entry level soap for starting old traditional shaving.</li>
    <li> Shave soap is getting hard to find around the stores here. I just got a six pack so I should be good for awhile.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. Lather is very nice shaves is ok but the soap smells like bug repellent.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap ever.  It lathers up great, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and the bar lasts for months.  Great product and value.</li>
    <li> This (Williams Mug Shaving Soap) is simply fantastic and very affordable.  It leaves my face nice and smooth after each and every shave, and the price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with AMAZON for caring this product. I use this one and only product every time I shave. It is a hard item to find in any store. AMAZON saved me money and time in my search for this item. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Basic shave soap.  Very effective.  This one also slightly smaller diameter for fitting in my smallish mug, so I like it.  Can&#x27;t beat the pricing.  Pack of 6 is probably 3 years of shaving!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the lather, love the price! Don&#x27;t fall of for all those $3.00 to $10.00 per puck soaps! A fool and his money are soon parted! It&#x27;s soap folks!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband only likes this brand and for some reason we cannot find it in the stores in Michigan.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I tried it because it was an old shaving soap brand and the price was very good. It has a light and simple lemon scent and a nice old-style box. In terms of usage, lathering takes more time and effort than other shaving soaps, and the lather itself doesn&#x27;t hold up well. It&#x27;s an okay shaving soap: the box is nice, the smell is decent, and the price is cheap, but the lather experience is more work than others.</li>
    <li> My tried and true shaving soap for 45 years. Great price from a great seller. Concerning Williams Mug Shaving Soap, If it ain&#x27;t broke...don&#x27;t fix it !!! It&#x27;s been around for over 100 years...that tells you something.</li>
    <li> This 6 pack will last me years.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered it as a kid.  Real creamy just like the lather in the can but way cheaper!  One hundred times better then the Van Der Hagen Premium soap that came with my Van Der Hagen Premium mug and brush set!</li>
    <li> Williams is getting harder to find, and my local CVS has raised the price to nearly 2$ a puck. Not only is this package a nice way to stock up, but the price  comes to about 1.33 a puck! It&#x27;s basically like getting one free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave it to others to swing their opinions on the quality of Williams&#x27; scent and lather like so many subjective bludgeons; for the record, my wife says I smell sexy, and I get awesome shaves. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;What IS indisputable however, is that this package is an unbeatable deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used &amp;#34;canned&amp;#34; shaving cream until five or six years ago.  My wife gave me a mug, shaving brush, and soap kit as a stocking stuffer/semi-gag gift.  The joke was on her.  I loved it, gave her my old can for her legs and haven&#x27;t looked back - except at her legs ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first refill on the soap was the Williams shaving mug soap and although, due to availability locally, I&#x27;e tried others, nothing else compared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;  -  A little hot water and all the warm, thick, slick shaving &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; you could wish for&lt;br /&gt;  -  Smooth, close shave&lt;br /&gt;  -  Extremely affordable, much less expensive than canned shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;  -  A side benefit is that the shaving brush also helps scrub and exfoliate your face&lt;br /&gt;  -  You don&#x27;t smell like you fell into a flower bed and wallowed around in it when you finish shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;  -  Not as readily available locally as it used to be be but that&#x27;s what Amazon is for.</li>
    <li> Shaving soap is getting hard to find. This is a very good price for a reliable product.</li>
    <li> Hard to get, but a great soap. Little hot water in mug and you have a hot shave. lasts longer than canned shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s all quit paying way to much for our shaving cream. This works just as well or better, and you feel manly putting it on.</li>
    <li> Good lather.  Good product.</li>
    <li> m favorite soap and priced so well</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 40 years and would not use anything else.  It makes the perfect lather without all the heavy foam.</li>
    <li> He loves this product and it is so easy to order this way and the old fashion way of shaving.</li>
    <li> Not the best shave soap I have used but it indeed does the trick and is light on the wallet.</li>
    <li> I was worried that the scent would bother me, but honestly that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. What does bother me quite a bit is how poor this soap lathers. I recently got a new brush and was shocked at how much better it lathered with my old cheap-o soap so I was excited to get this is the mail. What a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can actually see the lather start to disappear before I&#x27;m even done applying it to my whole face. After about a minute it&#x27;s all but entirely gone. I&#x27;ve had to resort to creating ridiculous amounts of lather (which is great because then I&#x27;ll be done with this stuff sooner) and applying it to my face in stages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend you keep shopping. And don&#x27;t buy a 6-pack of anything until you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;ll like it. That part was my mistake.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap for the price. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Lather does not last.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap. My husband has used it for years but has been unable to find it anymore, so this was a good find.</li>
    <li> Great product arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND QUALITY SOAP. SHAVE IS EXCELLENT</li>
    <li> husband says it&#x27;s the best soap he ever used</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a cup and brush for the shaving soap. Instead I just lather up my face with it in the shower. Works like a charm and this brand lasts longer than others. There is nothing wrong with the smell (I&#x27;ve never noticed it), contrary to what some other posters have mentioned. Dave:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with soap and a brush for over 30 years. In the beginning, I used expensive soaps until I tried Williams a few years ago. I feel that it works just as well (although not as pretty, and no lavish scent) at a much lower price. When the supply in the local stores dried up, I decided to buy a dozen online. Since one of these cakes costs roughly $1 and lasts about eight months, I&#x27;m good for years.</li>
    <li> Williams soap is awesome. It takes a little bit of trial and error to figure what works best for you. I got this tip online and it works great. Do an initial pre-soak overnight to &#x27;prime&#x27; the soap. I do this in a mug. This will create a thin layer of slime on the soap. After the initial &#x27;prime&#x27;, with each use  soak the soap in water with the brush for 10 minutes or so while in the shower. I then take soap out of mug and put in a small metal bowl where I add enough water to come half-way up the puck. Then I work puck with a brush in circular and back and forth strokes. Work the brush until you can hold it in the air and none of the suds fall off and the lather is nice and think, this usually only takes a couple minutes.  This method works way better than trying to add little bit of water at a time going from a dry puck; that took forever and I did not get a think lather at all. With pre-soaking method Williams gives an awesome thick lather in only a few minutes time. The soap provides nice protection and I hardly get any nicks. I use an Omega Boar Hair brush with the Merkur 34C HD DE or a Dovo 5/8 straight razor.   Definitely recommend Williams. It is a highly underrated soap you should try for a great price and a  great product.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving soap I will ever use.  It smells great and leaves my face very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for my husband.  He has used this before and as it is hard to find in our area so he looked at Amazon.  I personally wish that the smell were not so strong as high scents give me sinus problems.</li>
    <li> mug shaving soap is getting hard to find in the bricks and sticks stores. so this is a great deal</li>
    <li> This soap is very good.  I used to shave with regular bar soap, and this is much better.  It seems to soften the hairs, and it provides for a much smoother shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Williams Shaving Soap for a long time.  It is a very good product and made in the USA.  The other high point is that unlike shaving creams, it doesn&#x27;t clog up the drain pipes.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used and I have used a lot.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it...glad to fine a 6 pack</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving cream, plus it really save money over the cans.</li>
    <li> No longer available at the local drug stores, have used for years and its the best out there</li>
    <li> These are a challenge to find as I think most men have switched to shaving soap in a can.  I still love using my mug and brush but finding shaving mug soap consistently is a challenge for me.  Getting this on Amazon is a major relief.  Reasonable price (all have gone up in price) and lather is very good and the clean up is simple.  Will get again.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because williams doesn&#x27;t offer multiple scents like other shaving soap companies do. However, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and is priced well. If you need shaving soap this will do the job.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff. A bar lasts maybe a month, and it makes the best lather I&#x27;ve ever shaved with. Makes me think of when I was little, watching my dad shave with this stuff. No wonder he used it! Maybe I can get him to switch back.</li>
    <li> Husband has used this brand of shaving soap for years, the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works great. It lathers more than sufficiently. I have tried shaving with conditioner and this works much better! Making the lather is also fun.</li>
    <li> After going back to straight razor shaving I wanted to treat myself to the best products to give me that fantastic shave.  This shaving soap is wonderful.  Better than the good old days...</li>
    <li> AAA+  Great product. I have been using this for many year.  It saves me a lot of money.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Williams for years and it has not let me down yet.  Still as reliable as ever.</li>
    <li> husband has always used this soap</li>
    <li> This lathering soap did an excellent job.  This is the first time I have ever shaved without any razor burn and it was awesome</li>
    <li> Takes a bit more water than the tutorials for lathering up most soaps will tell you, but with practice, this soap will lather up. Just keep adding water until it does. Great scent.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shaving soap! Call us old fashioned, but he just prefers using the soap and brush to get a good lather. He says he gets a better shave with less nicks and burns.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time getting this soap to foam up into a thick lather. Compared to [[ASIN:B00837YY18 Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation]] or [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]] which are super fast to whip up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried soaking the soap in hot water to soften it up and this was mildly helpful. I was just looking for something that&#x27;s not quite so much work.</li>
    <li> I suspect you would either love or hate this shaving soap. It lubricates your face so MUCH better than any canned shaving lather. You can get a good thick lather using a badger shaving brush with a liberal amount of hot water. It also requires a good rinse, but I personally think it works much better than the stuff in a can, and my skin has far less bumps and shaving nicks. I also prefer the clean masculine scent, and it does not dry on your face or dry out your skin as regular soap does.  You can find other scented specialty shaving soaps, but you will pay 4-5 times more than this brand. One round puck of this soap will last you for months. Why not give it a try? It is comparably cheap!</li>
    <li> good product nice size</li>
    <li> I love the citronella smell of this stuff, the old-time look of the packaging, and just about everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One main point to note about William&#x27;s though- It is NOT Arko, you will NOT get a giant fluffy lather within 30 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I do love Arko as well, by the way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yes, you really need t put it some elbow grease to get this stuff to lather, depending on how mineralized (hard) your water is. What works for me? I get my face wet, have a wet badger brush ready and literally take a wet bar of Williams&#x27;s with my bare hand and rub it on my face until a film forms, then enter the wet (not TOO wet, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it) brush. this might take a good two minutes to get a creamy lather, add water as needed. Always better too little water, as you can simply add a bit more. this extra work gone into making a good lather is the only reason I give this a 4 and not a 5, although some other folks&#x27; philosophy might be that the fun is IN the work to a lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy, and don&#x27;t get discouraged, with this soap, it definitely helps to have at least &amp;#34;intermediate lathering skills&amp;#34;, as tacky as that sounds.</li>
    <li> Williams Mug Shaving Soap is really good.  Priced right.  Excellent shaves.  I highly recommend.  I have tried other shaving soaps but always return to Williams.  I get about six weeks from one cake.</li>
    <li> A great classic shaving soap that smells great.  Store it in your underwear drawer to freshen undergarments while awaiting use!</li>
    <li> If judging by the frequency of use, this is the soap I pick most days.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up just fine, gives me a smooth shave, and can&#x27;t complain about the price, it cost a tiny fraction of most other products.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other soaps I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;Proraso, which is also OK, but prefer the Williams scent.&lt;br /&gt;Crabtree and Evelyn Sandalwood soap - cost a small fortune, and it gives me an itch, maybe too much soap in it. The lather is smooth enough, but the sensation on my skin is the same as you get when leaving regular soap on your face for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative with the Williams soap sold on amazon, is that the price is high. I can get Williams at my local grocer for $0.89</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about Williams Shaving Soap which suits me just fine.  Its inexpensive, it fits nicely in my shaving mug, and it lathers well. Combined with a good shaving brush, it works just as good if not better than any other overpriced modern shaving chemical out there.  This is as basic as it gets.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that after the bar wears down to about half its original size, the lather will start to thin out considerably... this is when I replace the bar - I never use it all the way to the bottom. Each bar still lasts me a good 2-3 months of daily use, and its cheap enough to replace whenever necessary.</li>
    <li> I like it. I think it is a good soap. I used other soaps most are slimy. This is not but it is still lets the razor slide on your face.</li>
    <li> Not as expected. As I remember Williams lathered up much better.</li>
    <li> This product would never have been on the market for such an incredibly long time if it didn&#x27;t deliver. With a passable brush and any decent DE razor there&#x27;s simply no reason to use anything else. Take it from someone who has paid the &amp;#34;big bucks&amp;#34; for the premium oils, creams, etc.</li>
    <li> Good lather. Nice scent. I use it every time I shave my head and face. As. Good as higher priced shave soap.</li>
    <li> It works great and keeps my shaving cost down! Smells good! Well worth the cost!! A big two thumbs up from me!!</li>
    <li> The classics never die!  Was using some canned foam crap, very disappointed....plus extra waste from the cans...Williams has been around forever, used to use it back in the 70&#x27;s and was delighted to see it here!  I&#x27;m never switching back to canned foam crap or electric shaving!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and found it to be a superior shaving soap for a very reasonable price. However, it has become almost impossible to find local retailers who still stock it. Finding the 6-pack on line for a very reasonable price was a pleasant surprise and it was delivered rapidly.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Lathering up with mug shaving soap is just more ecologicaly sound than using an aerosol can shaving soap and gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> The soap seems to work ok, it does lather well but the scent is brutal.....I can&#x27;t use the stuff. I bought a package of six bars, probably should have bought one to try before I bought in bulk.</li>
    <li> This is a hard disc of shaving soap, long-lasting, and with a mild scent to it.  I think it beats the britches off canned foams, gels, and especially the smellier soft mug soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Williams for years but lately have had an increasingly difficult time finding it in local stores.  So I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  PharmaFrag&#x27;s pricing was good and their service was prompt and accurate.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and the vendor.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Walmart.....works as good as the expensive stuff......</li>
    <li> Continues to be the best shaving soap at the best price.  Will not use anything else.  Arrived on time.  Excellent service.</li>
    <li> The soap lasts a long time, and makes great lather.  The lather give you a smooth shave,and it is also a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not particularly picky about shaving products, but I echo the positive reviews of this product and add that the main reason I adopted it is that it&#x27;s the only cup soap available in the pharmacies in my area.  However, I do like Boots shaving stick and Crabtree &amp; Evelyn dish soap when I find them.</li>
    <li> Used correctly (it&#x27;s cup soap, OK?) Williams works great, smells better.  Light lather, but that&#x27;s what I like, not the thick syrupy feel of the glycerin types or slimey feel of the creams.  And the price?  Old American original that is priced lower than my shower bar soap.  Smells good enough for that, too.</li>
    <li> Good old shaving soap tried and true. Good bargain compaired to other shaving soap.</li>
    <li> It has a nice lather and I like the scent. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The soap makes a thick smooth lather that works great. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> Other soaps, when placed in a microwave oven, will quickly melt, leaving a thick, wax residue, just like a candle.  Not so with this soap.  It is unmeltable so, I assume, it contains no paraffin.  Real soap at a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Williams shaving soap for years and really like it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fancy fragrance or leave any kind of residue behind.  The lather lasts a decent amount of time, especially if really whip it up with your brush and hot water before applying.  I&#x27;ve always bought it at Walmart, but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it.  I can only get it locally at a drugstore that is several miles out of my way, so I&#x27;m really glad to find it available on Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t beat Williams soap, not like some of the other crap company&#x27;s try to sell</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving soap. They last me quite a while and smell good. I&#x27;ve found these soaps seem to stay moist longer and others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Got these for my husband.  Couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else around here and what I did find was exorbitantly priced.  The 6 will last him a long time.</li>
    <li> Its alright. Please do not try to melt it in a microwave, it won&#x27;t melt and you will make a mess.</li>
    <li> Always works well. One of the classic shaving soaps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Williams shaving soap for more years than I can remember. Those who still use all other methods, aerosol cans, etc. must never have tried the original and still best way to shave. I agree with the reviewer who said &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fall of for all those $3.00 to $10.00 per puck soaps!&amp;#34; This is better by far, and much less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those reviewers who say Williams soap is difficult to lather, maybe your water is hard. I have mountain well water with plenty of minerals in it and I have no problem getting a good lather with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Williams mug shaving soap is almost impossible to find locally—the CVS stores in my area seem no longer to carry it—Amazon gets to sell me another product.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ve ever used so I really can&#x27;t compare it to,others.  It lasts a very long time and a 6 pack lasts me a couple years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shaving soap....</li>
    <li> The soap bars lather up nicely.</li>
    <li> ivory may work better.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great, old-time familiar product. I have been using William&#x27;s for years with &#x27;s&lt;br /&gt; pleasant scent and excellent foaming qualities. Wonderful find!</li>
    <li> The soap has a scented-candle smell that is a bit feminine for me. That may just be me, so if you&#x27;re open to a candle-smelling scent, I&#x27;d recommend buying a pack of 1 before a pack of 6.</li>
    <li> These pucks of soap last forever. They have a mild scent and give great cushion the shaving. I have around 20 creams and soaps, but this is my go-to for every day, comfortable, close shaving. I like how the scent doesn&#x27;t conflict with whatever aftershave I use. Gives plenty of slick lather to whack down a few days worth of thick beard growth with no resistance. Great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d ever need a \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that it easily rinses squeaky clean off face, doesn&#x27;t leave oily feeling some do.</li>
    <li> Works for me. Lots of lather and a good barrier against the blade.</li>
    <li> Bought for Husband. He loves it. I steal it from him and love it too. Kinda smells like citronella.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving soap so i am not an expert but it has a rather boring smell that is not unpleasant but just bland i guess. Not the best foaming either. But it&#x27;s cheap and does the trick so for a budget it is good.</li>
</ol>
