    <li> Love Arbonne products and this is a nice set.

Disappointed with that as it was a loss of product.  Will possibly consider other seller next time.</li>

    <li> My daughter loves this product and swears by the results to keep her youth. Instead of buying the 300.00 dollar package I bought 2 travel kits to cut cost. A little of this product goes a long way. The travel kit is 70 dollars.</li>

I highly recommend despite the price. It is worth every $$$!</li>
    <li> It was a gift, but I wish it was for me. I would buy full set if I could afford it</li>
