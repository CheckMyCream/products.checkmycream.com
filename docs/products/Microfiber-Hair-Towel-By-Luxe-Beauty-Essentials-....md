      <li>Love this towel.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for women with long hair like myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a prior happy customer, I was provided this item for review and have given you an honest opinion.  </li>
      <li>That would make it much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the towel and the size is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to wrap around my head like a turban and stays put.</li>
      <li>As a prior customer I was given this towel to use for an honest and fair opinion of which I have given.</li>
      <li>The material is so soft, it feels so nice and luxurious against your skin!  </li>
      <li>I already had the smaller towel and absolutely loved it so much, my mom ended up buying one because of how much I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While I loved the smaller one, I am SOOO happy that a larger size was introduced.</li>
      <li>I also use it to clean my glasses when I&#x27;m in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend used it to dry her hair and described it as &amp;#34;being hugged by a panda.&amp;#34; Suffice to say, it feels very nice on your skin.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>I was one of the lucky ones to test this towel.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly after you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal</li>
      <li>Its super absorbent and holds up well from being washed often with no pesky lint sticking to it.  </li>
      <li>Using this towel quickly gets most of the moisture out of his fur, leaving him dryer than using normal towels and the hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>It also air dries very quickly, which makes it easy to use frequently.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this hair towel, trust me, I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of them!!!</li>
      <li>I also have the smaller version and really liked it, until I got this one.</li>
      <li>I have long hair (and lots of girls with long hair) and this towel is the perfect size.  </li>
      <li>And it dries pretty quickly as well.</li>
      <li>As a previous customer, I was sent this larger size to review, which is perfect since I used to keep my hair bobbed</li>
      <li>We already had the original size towel, my wife loves it, she started using it as a bath towel for the kids, because of the size this one is even better for the job, and like the first one it&#x27;s soft and really absorbent, it even feels lighter than a normal towel of the same size which works out great when drying up our two year old.</li>
      <li>It dries her hair much faster than normal towels, which is always nice during busy mornings.</li>
      <li>so I usually just put my hair up until it dries, but with this wonderful towel it is not necessary.</li>
      <li>Even after many washes (I&#x27;ve had the smaller version for quite awhile), this towel does not lose it&#x27;s power!</li>
      <li>The larger size is great for long hair.</li>
      <li>I have used it only to dry my hair, but it works great.  </li>
      <li>This towel is INCREDIBLY soft!!!!  </li>
      <li>Also, it is extremely absorbent (as most microfiber towels are), but seems to be a good size for women&#x27;s hair so as not to weigh your head down.</li>
      <li>I did receive this towel as a promotion as I am a previous customer, and have recommended it to many friends!</li>
      <li>The first time we used this towel we were amazed at how much water it removed...</li>
      <li>You certainly won&#x27;t be using this to towel off after the pool or a shower, but on hair duty this towel performs very well.</li>
      <li>My husband got this towel for me and I absolutely love it and use it every single day!  </li>
      <li>I received this hair towel free as being a personal &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Since I don&#x27;t have much hair, I passed it onto my wife.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it is a very versatile towel.</li>
      <li>This towel was also much lighter in weight then the towel I used before</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
      <li>The 1st time I let this fabric touch my body, it felt like the same material one uses to clean their glasses without any scratches.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s VERY soft, and quite effective at wicking away moisture, so that after a few minutes in the towel (while I put on makeup and/or get dressed or whatever)</li>
      <li>I loved the smaller version of this towel, and was sent the larger to review as a prior customer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy a half dozen of these if they came in more colors.</li>
      <li>This towel is very absorbent and soft and highly absorbent!</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried a hair towel (and this one in particular), I suggest you do...</li>
      <li>I noticed right away that my hair was much dryer then when I used a regular towel</li>
      <li>Really soaks up the water from my medium length hair and is so soft and plush</li>
      <li>The towel is soft and lightweight and very absorbent.  </li>
      <li>I can use it quite a few more times than I coukd a normal</li>
      <li>The material is so quick absorbing, so it doesn&#x27;t retain a lot of moisture, therefore there is no mildew scent that sometimes comes from wet towels.</li>
      <li>The size is perfect for short, long, or short but thick hair.  </li>
      <li>It is so soft and luxurious!</li>
      <li>Simply put - You really must experience this towel; you&#x27;ll never regret it!</li>
      <li>With 2 young daughters who are really active, drying their long hair after the shower can be challenging but this mircofiber hair towel is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
      <li>I was a bit worried that with the extra size might come too much weight</li>
      <li>There are microfiber towels available specifically for drying dogs, but all I&#x27;ve found are very small and quite expensive, not something that&#x27;s good for a medium to large dog.  </li>
      <li>It saves so much time as the towel dries my hair much faster than the ordinary towels do.</li>
      <li>If I can use only one word to describe this product, it would be soft.</li>
      <li>you are looking to purchase one of the hair towels and don&#x27;t know which to choose, the smaller one was sufficient for my hair (about 2&amp;#34; past my shoulders) but the larger size definitely gives me more room to twist it up.</li>
      <li>My 10 year old even takes it out to the pool instead of a traditional towel.</li>
      <li>This particular one is so soft and absorbent, it really does cut down on my dry time and frizz-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with microfiber towels for other purposes, and I know how very absorbent they are.  </li>
      <li>It cuts down drying time in half and it dries very quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like these hair towels a lot. As a previous customer, I was sent this larger size to review, which is perfect since I used to keep my hair bobbed and I&#x27;ve been growing it out for about a year. This larger size doubles as a baby towel when my 6-month-old&#x27;s hoodie towel is in the laundry. It&#x27;s VERY soft, and quite effective at wicking away moisture, so that after a few minutes in the towel (while I put on makeup and/or get dressed or whatever) my hair feels half dry.</li>
    <li> I love the material, but it needs to have elastic around the sides so it will stay put on the head.  That would make it much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> This towel is very light weight and does wick the moisture out of my hair. I also use it to clean my glasses when I&#x27;m in the bathroom. I don&#x27;t care for it as a face or body drying towel. It is easy to wrap around my head like a turban and stays put. Do not use liquid fabric softener with this towel. All in all this is a great towel for absorbency for your hair or your dogs after a bath. As a prior customer I was given this towel to use for an honest and fair opinion of which I have given. I&#x27;ve also found that it cleans the water splashes off the mirror and other surfaces. I&#x27;ve found it is a very versatile towel.</li>
    <li> Love this hair towel! I also have the smaller version and really liked it, until I got this one. This one I love. My hair is a few inches past my shoulders and with the smaller hair towel it doesn&#x27;t cover all my hair and falls off. This one is big enough to stay up when wrapped. It cuts down drying time in half and it dries very quickly. I did receive this towel as a promotion as I am a previous customer, and have recommended it to many friends!</li>
    <li> This Microfiber Towel and the &amp;#34;Drying Brush&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve been using have both been awesome in drying my hair faster without using my blow dryer. I have very long hair that&#x27;s almost down to my waist. Needless to say, I need a little help as far as drying my hair goes. I use styling heat tools that can be very drying to my hair and lately, I feel like not even my heat protecting serums and sprays offer enough protection for my locks. That is why I prefer drying my hair without the use of a blow dryer. This towel is very absorbent and soft and highly absorbent! Perfect for women with long hair like myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a blogger, I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> We already had the original size towel, my wife loves it, she started using it as a bath towel for the kids, because of the size this one is even better for the job, and like the first one it&#x27;s soft and really absorbent, it even feels lighter than a normal towel of the same size which works out great when drying up our two year old. My 10 year old even takes it out to the pool instead of a traditional towel. Like all the products it comes nicely packed too. After buying some of their other products, they sent it to me at no cost to try and review. Very glad, we like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with microfiber towels for other purposes, and I know how very absorbent they are.  Using microfiber to create a hair towel makes a lot of sense to me.  I have to be honest and tell you that I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so a hair towel doesn&#x27;t help me a lot... but when I saw the product, I immediately thought about the problems we experience when giving our dogs a bath and the trials of drying their fur.  I was provided this towel by the manufacturer for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of our dogs has thick, medium length fur and it&#x27;s very difficult to get him dry.  Using regular towels and a blow dryer, which he tolerates to a degree, still leaves him damp.  There are microfiber towels available specifically for drying dogs, but all I&#x27;ve found are very small and quite expensive, not something that&#x27;s good for a medium to large dog.  At 23 x 40, this towel is large enough to use with a bigger dog, and it&#x27;s cost is comparable to the small counterparts I see in pet stores.  The first time we used this towel we were amazed at how much water it removed... it&#x27;s perfect for this purpose.  Using this towel quickly gets most of the moisture out of his fur, leaving him dryer than using normal towels and the hair dryer.  Our other dogs have short, thick fur, and using this towel leaves them dry.  While this may not be the intended use for the towel, it works perfectly for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:  When washing and drying the towel, MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT USE FABRIC SOFTENER.  Fabric softener, either added to the wash or via a dryer sheet, negatively impacts the absorbency of microfiber towels.</li>
    <li> With 2 young daughters who are really active, drying their long hair after the shower can be challenging but this mircofiber hair towel is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each has their own towel and it works wonders where we don&#x27;t even need a hairdryer, saving electricity too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided the towel as an unbiased tester.</li>
    <li> My Mother got this product and loved it so much that she bought me one as a gift, and this product is absolutely wonderful! It has cut my hair drying time by at least half, as I never use a hairdryer so I usually just put my hair up until it dries, but with this wonderful towel it is not necessary. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This towel is INCREDIBLY soft!!!!  I love the feel of the towel and the size is fabulous.  I have long hair (and lots of girls with long hair) and this towel is the perfect size.  I was a bit worried that with the extra size might come too much weight (I can&#x27;t stand when I feel like I have to hold my head up when I have towel on it) but there was no issue.  The towel is soft and lightweight and very absorbent.  If I could add any improvements it would be to add a little loop for hanging the towel to dry....not a big deal...it would just be a bonus.  While I received this towel for free, the opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.</li>
    <li> I loved the smaller version of this towel, and was sent the larger to review as a prior customer. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this towel! While I loved the smaller one, I am SOOO happy that a larger size was introduced. I have long, wavy hair and my ends were always hanging out of the smaller one just a little bit... no big deal, but this solves the problem! If you haven&#x27;t tried a hair towel (and this one in particular), I suggest you do...sooner than later!!! This particular one is so soft and absorbent, it really does cut down on my dry time and frizz- which is oh so crucial during these scorching summer months. Even after many washes (I&#x27;ve had the smaller version for quite awhile), this towel does not lose it&#x27;s power! I highly recommend this hair towel, trust me, I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of them!!!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and it usually takes about 2 hours for my hair to air dry after being wrapped in a regular towel.  I left this towel on for about 10-15 min..  I noticed right away that my hair was much dryer then when I used a regular towel and it cut my drying time way down.  I got the dish towels from this seller that were made of the same materiel and was very impressed how absorbent they were also. As a prior happy customer, I was provided this item for review and have given you an honest opinion.  This towel was also much lighter in weight then the towel I used before so it wasn&#x27;t as cumbersome.</li>
    <li> I was given this item to review as a prior customer. My wife loves this towel! It dries her hair much faster than normal towels, which is always nice during busy mornings. It also air dries very quickly, which makes it easy to use frequently. The larger size is great for long hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this towel for review purposes. The 1st time I let this fabric touch my body, it felt like the same material one uses to clean their glasses without any scratches. Initially I was reluctant that a towel with that fabric could absorb water after a bath, but I was wrong, it does that with grace. And it dries pretty quickly as well. Is there more one can ask for?</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled to get this towel. I already had the smaller towel and absolutely loved it so much, my mom ended up buying one because of how much I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel is perfect for those who have longish hair. The material is so quick absorbing, so it doesn&#x27;t retain a lot of moisture, therefore there is no mildew scent that sometimes comes from wet towels. The material is so soft, it feels so nice and luxurious against your skin!  It dries quickly after you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal towels take forever to dry after I use them on my hair, because my hair is long and I seem to get water everywhere. I just don&#x27;t have that issue when I use this. My hair drys loads faster than with a traditional towel. I can use it quite a few more times than I coukd a normal towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to purchase one of the hair towels and don&#x27;t know which to choose, the smaller one was sufficient for my hair (about 2&amp;#34; past my shoulders) but the larger size definitely gives me more room to twist it up. If you have ve king hair, I def recommend the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Sample Provided for Review</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;If you do not have a separate hair-towel ... Oh my, you are missing out!&amp;#34; That&#x27;s what my wife said about this remarkable hair towel by Luxe Beauty Essentials. Since I don&#x27;t have much hair, I passed it onto my wife. She is sooooooo pleased with this towel that she can not stop praising it&#x27;s virtues. NOTE: I received this hair towel free as being a personal &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34;. Rest assured that for the mere fact that I did not pay for this......DOES NOT alter this review. Simply put - You really must experience this towel; you&#x27;ll never regret it!</li>
    <li> I have the smaller towel and so I gave this to my wife to use. The longer towel is great with her hair, whisking away the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**As a previous customer, I received a sample for review.**</li>
    <li> Love this towel.  I have used it only to dry my hair, but it works great.  Really soaks up the water from my medium length hair and is so soft and plush it feels like I&#x27;m at an expensive spa.</li>
    <li> I was one of the lucky ones to test this towel. It is a great addition to my shower routine. It saves so much time as the towel dries my hair much faster than the ordinary towels do. By the time I dry off and put make up on my hair is almost dry. It is so soft and luxurious! I would definitely recommend this one!!!</li>
    <li> If I can use only one word to describe this product, it would be soft. My girlfriend used it to dry her hair and described it as &amp;#34;being hugged by a panda.&amp;#34; Suffice to say, it feels very nice on your skin. Also, it is extremely absorbent (as most microfiber towels are), but seems to be a good size for women&#x27;s hair so as not to weigh your head down. You certainly won&#x27;t be using this to towel off after the pool or a shower, but on hair duty this towel performs very well. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll get to experience it firsthand when I grow my hair out like Fabio, but only time will tell. I was provided this product to review, and my thoughts are my own.</li>
    <li> My husband got this towel for me and I absolutely love it and use it every single day!  The size is perfect for short, long, or short but thick hair.  Its super absorbent and holds up well from being washed often with no pesky lint sticking to it.  I&#x27;d like to see it be offered in other colors though.  I&#x27;d buy a half dozen of these if they came in more colors.</li>
