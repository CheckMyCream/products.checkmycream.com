<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I expected this jar of amazing smelling thick mask and it wasnt as I expected. The smell isnt as great as it describes. Its awkward. not terrible but not great either. I dont think It made my skin any different. its a thin clear layer that is applied to your face and it doesnt dry. Also the jar is really small! It wasnt bad but if I would have know these things about it before I bought it I would have just saved my money.</li>
    <li> I love this face mask! And it&#x27;s so much cheaper on amazon than in cvs drugstore. It does burn a little when I first put it on but it soon disappates and leaves my skin feeling fresh. Definitely heed the directions advice of only using a very thin layer of it, a little bit goes a long way. And it can be difficult to rinse off if you use too much!</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and always feels like my face is burning when I apply this mask. Didnt help improve my skin either&lt;br /&gt;Wont buy again</li>
    <li> Feels clean and is easy to rinse off.  Love this mask!</li>
    <li> Made my face feel amazing and with regular use, helped clear up the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Using it with steam (pot or shower) seems more helpful.</li>
    <li> For such high reviews I was expecting more. It made my skin burn when so used it. Product not for me unfortunately</li>
    <li> I use Retin A on a daily basis so my skin is very used to chemical exfoliation. Sometimes it can leave my skin a little flaky. I use this mask when I want my skin extra smooth. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all. My skin looks great afterward.</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty clear, except for the area across the bridge of my nose, and on the sides of my nose. For some reason, I get blackheads in that little area so thick that they are rough like sand paper. Gross! My regular cleanser doesn&#x27;t seem to take care of them, and I have pretty sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t like to use a scrub. Too rough. This enzyme mask worked immediately upon the first use. My nose area looked and felt tons smoother, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, make it peel, or turn it red. Win! Made my skin super soft, and noticeably clearer in appearance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking the sensation my skin gets from this... My skin felt and looked amazing after I used it.</li>
    <li> Love this mask!  It opens the pores, extracts the dirt, and leaves my face glowing.  It&#x27;s a definite must have.</li>
    <li> Every time i use it, it numbs my face, not sure if it is a normal reaction or not. Smells not very good, i dont use it very often......</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower for 5 mins while doing something else like shaving or what not. I can tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected - to suddenly look 27 instead of 57?  That&#x27;s really asking a lot.  A lot!  So no 5 stars and not even 4 stars.  This is a good quality product . . . no complaints . . . but it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> This is a clear gel so its hard to distinguish where your putting it, I wanted it as a mask. Even when you wash it off its tough, you have to go by feeling your skin, see if it all came off, but my skin felt fresh and rejuvenated after I applied it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but I love this product. It makes my skin so much smoother and softer and has certainly improved any break outs I was having.</li>
    <li> you cannot have this on skin more than 10 mins , else it stings. it refreshes your skin for a while</li>
    <li> I try to use primarily natural ingredients on my skin. This product fits in well with my regimen and has had a definite positive impact on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first put it on, it definitely tingles (which I don&#x27;t mind!). I leave it on for about 10 minutes and rinse with warm water, then follow with a moisturizer and eye cream. FYI, my regimen is oil cleansing with sweet almond oil, apply the mask while pores are still open, leave for 10 minutes and rinse, follow with lavender moisturizer and sweet almond oil to seal. My skin is combination and acne-prone.</li>
    <li> Love this mask!  I use this once a week and it gently, yet effectively exfoliates and keeps my skin clear.  Great all natural product.  (Plus it smells like pineapple.)</li>
    <li> More than meet expectation.I am very happy that I bought this product.although a little small in size.but ok for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using many other high end &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; natural brands - Tata Harper, Dr Alkaitis, May Lindstrom, etc - but am looking to save money and find some good masks that are non toxic and cost less. It&#x27;s hard to beat the Tata Harper exfoliating enzyme mask, that thing is like magic. But for inexpensive cost of this Alba Botanicals mask, it does a great job. The scent and color are nice and I felt a gentle tingling while it was on, but not too strong and no stinging. (I was expecting some pink/redness after, as I usually have for a short while after I wash these masks off, but that didn&#x27;t happen with this one.) It&#x27;s gentle yet effective. My skin was definitely a little smoother and softer afterwards, and my pores were less visible. I loved that my skin still felt cool and tingly up to an hour after, even after I&#x27;d slathered on my usually nightly homemade facial oil. If I needed bigger results - when my skin occasionally goes haywire - I would probably want something stronger. But for maintenance, gentle &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34;, and after long flights, this mask is a winner! I will purchase it again when I&#x27;m done this first jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I first tried this mask at night before bed. My skin was so soft and smooth when I woke up. Since this is a gel mask (doesn&#x27;t need to dry and its gel, so water won&#x27;t immediately dissolve it) - to amplify the effects you can put it on in the shower (for the steam effect to keep pores open) or use it as an actual steam mask (towel over head over hot bowl of water). I&#x27;ve done this with other gel masks and it makes a difference! Will do with this one next time.</li>
    <li> Spas use papaya enzyme and you can&#x27;t beat the price on this. I have sensitive skin and it slightly tingles but helps to clear away dead skin regularly.</li>
    <li> I really love Alba products and have many of them. I trust the brand and their products don&#x27;t irritate my skin and they always smell really good! I  don&#x27;t usually use facial masks but decided to treat myself. I loved it. It leaves my skin really soft and feeling firm and tight but not like dried out tight, really soft. I only use it about once or twice a week. You need to use more than if you were just putting on moisturizer but not too much and so its going to last awhile even though its a small jar. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has ever put a dent in my stubborn adult acne. I&#x27;ve literally tried everything - including two extra strong treatments of Isotretinoin which didn&#x27;t help for long - and this mask is the best thing I&#x27;ve found. My skin still isn&#x27;t perfect, but using it 10-15 minutes, 3-4 times a week certainly helps more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t just help my acne; it makes my skin glow and it seems to have helped my fine lines that I&#x27;ve been noticing since I turned 28 last year.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I love the feeling it gives my skin. Good pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and cleanse out.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing is alright.</li>
    <li> This mask didn&#x27;t do what I wanted. It wasn&#x27;t awful, it wasn&#x27;t spectacular. It just *was.* Pros: it smells nice, it goes on well, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. Cons: it&#x27;s just a mask and I didn&#x27;t notice any better of skin because of it.</li>
    <li> I read papaya is a nice natural mask so i purchased this, feels great not sure how well it works but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems to be improving but that could be to overall better care. I like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this mask for 3 simple reasons.  1. It helps to control my brake outs .  2. It evens out my skin.  3. Decreases appearance of my pores.    Additional comments  I first wash my face with a tea tree oil cleanser. Tea tree oil helps to remove oil and dirt from the pores and at the same time has antiseptic properties. For the wash I use a facial sponge to loosen the dead skin.  Then I apply the mask. The mask has a tingly sensation at first after application. I keep the mask on for 5 minutes then I wash it off with a facial sponge to make sure I get everything off. Finally I use a facial toner with chamomile extract to balance ph of my skin and I apply a cream with retinol  and Beta Hydroxy Acid.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! I use it with their pineapple enzyme face wash and my skin looks clear and healthy. It&#x27;s hard to find a product that effectively fights moderate adult acne but this combined with the face wash are doing a fine job!</li>
    <li> Not a bad product. Not too pricey. Got to buy this because recommended by a blog that I read. Recommended</li>
    <li> This is one of the best enzyme masks I&#x27;ve had. I highly recommend. It really helps exfoliate without irritation. It feels great on too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for years, and my aesthetician has commented that it&#x27;s a great choice for an affordable product for dry skin. I happen to be lucky to frequent someone tho doesn&#x27;t try to force products on me, rather, when I mention a product, she will inspect ingredients when she isn&#x27;t familiar with it, and then comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mask 1-2 weekly followed by a good night cream. Love it!</li>
    <li> Gentle but effective. I leave on for 15-30 minutes twice a week especially in winter and fall. Skin looks smooth after. I wish it had just a little moe glycolic but over all great product.</li>
    <li> I have used my jar allllll up! This is a great part of my weekly facial routine. I have sensitive skin and I use JoJoba oil as my moisturizer and Aloe Body Shop Cleanser. There is a mild burn in the beginning ( I usually steam and cleanse my skin prior) but it fades and after 5 minutes I wash it off to reveal smooth, clear skin. This is a once a week treatment for me, its too powerful everyday for my skin.</li>
    <li> Cheap and wonderful product. My skin looks better after using this than the $150 microdermabrasion appointments I have been using. Feels great and skin is improved after first use.</li>
    <li> My face has never been happier with an exfoliating product, and I&#x27;ve tried many (even very expensive ones). This one has been great at slowly helping to diminish the brown sun spots on my cheeks. I use 1 - 2 times per week and follow with Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum and moisturizer for the sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels cool going on (I use an application brush) and tingles slightly. Some areas of my face feel a slight burn like on the sides of my nose, not sure why. But the feeling is momentary. I leave it on about 10 minutes then rinse it off. It is tricky to get all the gel off your face, and if you don&#x27;t get it all off it can leave a tacky feelings. I&#x27;ve found that wiping if off with a wet bath towel then rinsing your face in the sink works best. It leaves my face looking bright and fresh.</li>
    <li> Love this! Use for light facial exfoliation. Works wonders. Now that I&#x27;m getting older love how it helps moisturizer absorb better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t dislike this peel but I don&#x27;t feel it really does much for me. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable or painful at all. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I put this on thinking I&#x27;d keep it on way longer than the 5 minutes that it recommends... Wrong. It immediately started burning my face and I doubted I could keep it on the full five minutes. But luckily my face went numb after a minute so I made it. And when I took it off my skin was radiant! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> It made my face so soft</li>
    <li> this stuff is great! makes my face all tingly &amp; stuff! i bought the other items in this range from alba botanica because of how much i like this stuff, but the other items weren&#x27;t as good as this.  they were fine, but this is better than fine.</li>
    <li> This mask is fantastic, the skin looks dewy, fresh, and completely renewed after a single use. Just like with all other masks, the results will not last you a lifetime, you have to repeat the process. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask will cause slight tingling of the skin when you apply it, but it will stop after a few minutes. I like the feeling because I know it&#x27;s working! After rinsing, use a toner and moisturizer, and you&#x27;re all set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very inexpensive way to make your skin look radiant. And much more affordable here on Amazon than it is at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> Seems like an okay mask... Feels good and leaves skin soft and a little brighter looking.. Left on for 20 minutes and never felt any &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; or tingling effects.  An okay mask for the money.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Well it arrived and I dug in. Wow!! I have alot of masks everything from pineapple enzyme pumpkin enzyme dead sea mud masks you name it. I also use lactic acid peels and glycolic acid peels. I love this mask!!  I actually felt the stingle!! I.can&#x27;t believe it!! It works!! It gave my skin a beautiful glow. I feel I can honestly say with on going use this is a product I will not be without in my beauty routine!! I love that this product is not tested on animals and is natural. This is my second product from Alba that I love. I love the Kukui nut oil by Alba as well. Great price point on here as well. Extremely satisfied customer</li>
    <li> I use this to replace my cleanser when I&#x27;ve had a day of a lot of sunscreen/makeup and need a deep clean. It does NOT have the wrinkle reducing effect that Zia&#x27;s origina formula had before the company that ought Zia ruined it. keep misting your face with water to keep the enzymes active.</li>
    <li> A lovely gentle way to brighten your skin without harsh chemicals.  A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t overuse.</li>
    <li> I found this product on clearance at my local drugstore and I am sooo glad I bought it.  I use it a couple times a week.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t get all dry and crackly on my skin and washes of easy. It definitely tingles and burns a bit, but not painful and I am not red after using.  Smells good and skin feels great after.</li>
    <li> I needed a quick pick-me-up for my exhausted mom skin and this did it. It softens my complexion and shrinks up my crater-sized pores. Plus, it only takes five minutes. This is not a mask you have to wear all night or even twenty minutes. I can put it on while I dry my hair, wipe it off, and finish my makeup.</li>
    <li> worth to buy......IT looks good. I am waiting to see how it works the bottle is in good condition .</li>
    <li> It burns so good! I have no idea if it&#x27;s working, but I love the tingling sensation.</li>
    <li> Good mask...no issues and I have very fair and sensitive skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a milder way of exfoliation than bead scrubs, I love it so far, it helps opening the pores and easier to extract the dirty stuff out of the pores! In first 1-2 minutes you can feel the face really &amp;#34;heated up&amp;#34;, I was abit worried because of my sensitive skin, it can sting a little bit as well. I&#x27;ve used this 2 months now and no irritations or flares up of my rosacea. The price is also cheaper than drugstores. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I love all Alba Botanica products!  Easy on my sensitive skin, not tested on animals, and they WORK</li>
    <li> Not as pore opening as I&#x27;d expected from a high-end enzyme mask. Was hoping to clean out those pores better, no better than cheaper masks.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this mask so I finally bought one. From my first use, I felt in love with the mask. It is very hydrating! My face feels tight and fresh after using this product. Excellent facial mask.</li>
    <li> I love this product (though the smell to me is quite pungent), it takes away that oily feeling my skin has, and has a wonderful tingly feeling when I use it. I also noticed my face looked more fresh when I used it, will recommend this product!</li>
