<li> Cracked dry lips, eye corners,</li>
<li> i literally can not live without it</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t retain my container to see if the ingredients had changed from my other bottle, and it does feel somewhat different, but it is extremely healing!  </li>
<li> may mix with other stuff and test...</li>
<li> Before I tested it for the 2 weeks, I washed our hair with a sulfate or clarifying shampoo to ensure hair strands were stripped of any previously used products.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
<li> Another review says it has some formaldehyde in it, but not sure about that.  </li>
<li> It does burn my eyes so stay away from lash area and slow around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Impossible to find in a local grocery or drug store.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog the pores and make summer heat feel worse.  </li>
<li> If so, that&#x27;s a disappointment.</li>
<li> It saved my forehead and nose from a potentially ugly scarring that I might have had from a very bad fall on a camping trip.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great on hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did wonders for my acne prone skin in the matter of 2 weeks. I replaced my moisturizer with this. I have to see if it works the same in the winter. It is sticky, bit view away in minutes. Yes, you can apply makeup after is it applied but I let the sticky feeling go away first (1 minute). I love applying after washing the face. Soothing and calming. It does burn my eyes so stay away from lash area and slow around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did wonders for me and my son&#x27;s African American 4c hair.  I use lots of products and used this daily even after washing the hair. If I use anything with it, I would apply oil to seal in moisture. Loved itBe patient. I saw results in about 2 weeks. Before I tested it for the 2 weeks, I washed our hair with a sulfate or clarifying shampoo to ensure hair strands were stripped of any previously used products.&lt;br /&gt;Works good as a regular gel, but doesn&#x27;t hold like others. Great shine too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may mix with other stuff and test...</li>
    <li> i was planning to buy this long time and finally i got them OMG this going to be my holy grill definitely going to buy this again i love it i use for everything it dries really fast on my skin and i can feel very refresh afterwards i use it also for my lashes i mix it with vitamin E and i apply it every night before bed i literally can not live without it</li>
    <li> Aloe Vera is a perfect body lotion and the world&#x27;s absolute best burn ointment.</li>
    <li> Nothing but the aloe.  No perfumes , no added ingredients. I have a lot of allergies.  Impossible to find in a local grocery or drug store. I used this brand before and plan to use it all my life. Cracked dry lips, eye corners,any skin irritation all respond quickly. Of course it is perfect for sunburn and kitchen burns. Apply immediately and keep reapplying as it soaks in. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy! I am a cancer patient getting radiation and this is all I can use on my skin.I bought my first tube in the hospital gift shop and they charge 15 dollars for 6 oz.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, got a deal this time-even better.  Purchase often to use in my homemade bath and beauty products</li>
    <li> Works great for lotion making etc.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> Works well, soaks in quickly</li>
    <li> VERY pleased with the price and quality of this product. I got it to use with a micro-current facial device I am using every day. the gel is a little goopy but washes off very easily once I have done my treatment and leaves to unwanted feeling or smell or anything. the price for the 2 very large bottles I got was very reasonable and I will be buying again when needed.</li>
    <li> Good product - used it before. Packing was great and delivery time excellent</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...Fast delivery...thank you</li>
    <li> A bare necessity in our house every summer.  Sunburn disappears overnight.</li>
    <li> I use the Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera for making lotions.  It&#x27;s the purest I have been able to find.  Another review says it has some formaldehyde in it, but not sure about that.  If so, that&#x27;s a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Used to see this Aloe everywhere now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere so Amazon to the rescue.  Good stuff that is not greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog the pores and make summer heat feel worse.  I&#x27;d buy from here again if I can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> Extremely excited to find these giant bottles of pure aloe vera gel. I use these very often in my business and at home. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My holy grill - i can never get enough of this product</li>
    <li> I use it for everything from bumps and scrapes to adding it to my water when I&#x27;m not feeling well.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it on my 5ft pet lizard to moisturize and help him shed properly.</li>
    <li> good quality and can be mixed with lotion to improve moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the pumps won&#x27;t pump out any more, I cut the plastic container in half and scoop out the rest with a finger.</li>
    <li> Arrived just as expected, a small dent on the bottom corner but otherwise ok.</li>
    <li> This is the only Aloe Vera Gel my husband will use.  I purchase this item monthly.  The price for the large bottles in much better than in the local big box stores.</li>
    <li> product as described.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product some 20 years ago or so.  I liked it then and I like it now.  That it is a gel is very helpful to me, as I use it on cuts, scrapes and to lubricate my skin so it helps it to adhere.  I didn&#x27;t retain my container to see if the ingredients had changed from my other bottle, and it does feel somewhat different, but it is extremely healing!  It saved my forehead and nose from a potentially ugly scarring that I might have had from a very bad fall on a camping trip.  I just kept covering the areas in the gel when it would begin to dry out.  It never infected and did not scar!  I am so grateful for this product.  As far as the &amp;#34;extra ingredients&amp;#34;, where there is fear there is manifestation of it....</li>
    <li> Product worked fine but every bottled arrived smashed in and leaking everywhere.</li>
    <li> As promised, cheaper than CVS or Walgreens. Going through ned radiation treatments. This stuff is a god-send.</li>
