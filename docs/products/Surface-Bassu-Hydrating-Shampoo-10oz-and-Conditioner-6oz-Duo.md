    <li> The shampoo inside the Surface bottle was NOT Bassu. I took it to my local salon and compared it to theirs and it was a totally different shampoo. Wish I could get a refund, but lesson learned.</li>
    <li> These products are winners! The shampoo and conditioner are well worth the price. Very satisfied with my purchase and will probably order it again.</li>
    <li> Wish I could say I loved it however it was just OK. I would not buy again</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My hair was shiny, silky and bouncing and behaving!  I also thought the cost was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This stuff really, really works, and I have tried a lot of other products.&lt;br /&gt;This made a huge difference in my abused hair.</li>
    <li> Your shampoo is a watered down soap.  I just used it and it is fake I am going to request a refund for the shampoo.  Conditioner was okay but wonder if it was also a fake.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use.  It smells wonderful and is great for my hair.  My hair is smoother and stronger</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I can see imorivement in my hair after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this and I fell in love with it.  The fragrance is clean and fresh and the product is very moisturizing.  I saved money by ordering it on Amazon.  This is a great price purchasing both at the same time.  I believe I saved over $12 from what the salon was charging.</li>
    <li> Good results and no poo ingredients</li>
