<ol>
      <li>This product is ideal for humid weather!</li>
      <li>but works best over face cream before applying makeup.</li>
      <li>I like the stuff that makes your skin look flawless and its really good</li>
      <li>a great buy.</li>
      <li>works great for the price.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>If you need skin smoothing or perfecting, I wasn&#x27;t really happy.  </li>
      <li>b/c I&#x27;m good with doing my make-up.</li>
      <li>This product is really good.</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I still use it just because I want to finish it, but it&#x27;s nothing amazing.</li>
      <li>so its powder like texture gives a nice smooth, matte finish!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so glad I tried this one sight unseen.</li>
      <li>I think it does a better job on pores than on wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and now I know it works better than this product.  </li>
      <li>I received many compliments saying my skin looked clearer and smooth!</li>
      <li>It went on smooth and effortlessly!</li>
      <li>and I am fully satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I love it....</li>
      <li>I highly recommended it and the price is great.</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken to using it on &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; days as well, since it makes my skin look so much nicer and more luminous, provides a great surface for translucent powder, and really sets my sunscreen and its oily tendencies.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the results and plan to purchase the full size.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Nothing&#x27;s going to fill the craters of the moon, but this cream does create a smooth surface for your makeup.</li>
      <li>However L&#x27;Oreal s true match or true color foundation is fantastic!</li>
      <li>when I swatched it on the back of my hand where I have many fine lines, it honestly looked like I had run an airbrush wand over them.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this primer.</li>
      <li>Your skin look smoother and soft, and also your make up will stay on longer for sure!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t always use one when wearing my make-up, but I find that when I do, my make-up stays on longer, specially if I&#x27;ve got it on all day till the night.</li>
      <li>no bad experiences with it.</li>
      <li>&amp; I just love the way it makes my skin feel smooth &amp; soft!</li>
      <li>that is very cool and super and thanks for such a good service and quality.</li>
      <li>i am very happy with it and would recommend to every girl who actually uses foundation on daily bases.</li>
      <li>and this is hands-down, no contest, by far the bet and most effective product out there for creating a completely shine-free face.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily and feels light and soft on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t work very well to prevent my undereye concealer from settling into fine lines</li>
      <li>Makes my skin smooth, even, and ready for foundation.</li>
      <li>This is a nice short cut.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using primer</li>
      <li>All positive feedback.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with that, because I usually don&#x27;t have time to put on full makeup, or I just don&#x27;t feel like going through the entire routine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with L&#x27;Oreal in the past and based on the reviews I gave the trial size a shot.</li>
      <li>The full-size dish (unlike the trial size) is easy to open</li>
      <li>I have used it without foundation with just a little powder for a nice MATTE finish and with foundation for a finished look...</li>
      <li>I think it works reasonably well and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I use this every day it really does the job, my daughter used it and wants some for her self.</li>
      <li>; Maybe I used too much, but I doubt it</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t really used makeup primers before trying out this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see that it improves the look of my pores.</li>
      <li>I have really oily skin and enlarged pores</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it .</li>
      <li>Although it does feel very smooth, I just think it&#x27;s a lil too heavy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>When I tried to put my foundation on top if it, it sort of made little balls.  </li>
      <li>but I am not positive it makes a huge difference...</li>
      <li>I saw this on a video online about make-up tricks &amp; techniques, just wanted to learn a couple new things</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t need much, and too much will dry looking flaky.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s newer product, Miracle Blur doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
      <li>Hopefully the full size will be a little easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product did exactly what it said and I expected.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try it again next time, I&#x27;ll use less &amp; see if that helps, but I&#x27;m not super excited about this product.</li>
      <li>I think I was used to using my old primer that I may have used too much, which is why it made it hard to finish/fill in my brows.</li>

<li> I think I was used to using my old primer that I may have used too much, which is why it made it hard to finish/fill in my brows.</li>
<li> I normally use a green hue concealed to balance the red and it works well</li>
<li> I was looking for a good makeup base...</li>
<li> Lessens the dark circles under my eyes, improves the overall look of my skin and helps my makeup stay put.</li>
<li> Living in the caribbean make up melt down is almost inevitable!</li>
<li> On my face it smooths out my skin texture both visually and literally -- pores are much less visible, and foundation applies over them without pooling.</li>
<li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this more expensive product and some of the other less expensive ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> So I just went back to my NYX HD green Concealed and L&#x27;Oreal foundation</li>
<li> Work a small dab briefly between your fingertips and then pat all over your face.</li>
<li> so I picked this small size to see if I would like it before buying bigger size.</li>
<li> it goes on really weird and white, barely covered my pores.</li>
<li> I am dark skinned and did not know how this would look on my skin under foundation.</li>
<li> I love the fact that this base helps prolong my make up wear.</li>
<li> You only need a small dab of it applied to the skin &amp; it creates a smooth base for applying your foundation &amp; makeup.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m using this as a concealer for undereye bag shadows and little wrinkles around my lips.  </li>
<li> This base alone provides just enough coverage to even out my skin tone without being obvious or looking like makeup.</li>
<li> The lid is a hard plastic, which is difficult to grip once you have the product on your fingers and the glass dish that holds the product is so short that it&#x27;s hard to hold just the jar while unscrewing the lid.</li>
<li> But for some reason, this primer kinda made it hard to &amp;#34;do my eyebrows&amp;#34</li>
<li> I got tired of experiencing &amp;#34;pooling&amp;#34; in my pores so while I work on skincare that will get to the root of the pore issue, I ditched the couple of primers I had and looked for one that would spackle those puppies over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of primers but the oily hypoallergenic sunscreen I have to use makes foundation difficult during the summer.</li>
<li> I also like the silky feel of this base.</li>
<li> terrible!</li>
<li> looked horrible and cake with my foundation applied over it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is ideal for humid weather! Living in the caribbean make up melt down is almost inevitable! I love the fact that this base helps prolong my make up wear. I have really oily skin and enlarged pores so its powder like texture gives a nice smooth, matte finish! What I find also helps prolong makeup wear is all nighter by urban decay! Hope this was of some help.</li>
    <li> I use this every day it really does the job, my daughter used it and wants some for her self. I will be buying more. Yes, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the stuff that makes your skin look flawless and its really good and you should buy it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a concealer for undereye bag shadows and little wrinkles around my lips.  I&#x27;m applying after applying foundation.  I think it works reasonably well and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> terrible! it goes on really weird and white, barely covered my pores. looked horrible and cake with my foundation applied over it. wouldn&#x27;t not recommend and definitely will never repurchase.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Super\\&quot;. This product is really good. i am very happy with it and would recommend to every girl who actually uses foundation on daily bases. that is very cool and super and thanks for such a good service and quality.</li>
    <li> A lot of hype over these products. I tried using it twice. It did not improve the looks of my pores, and left a white film (?).  When I tried to put my foundation on top if it, it sort of made little balls.  I am glad it was just a small size and involved small cost.  I threw the rest away.</li>
    <li> Nothing&#x27;s going to fill the craters of the moon, but this cream does create a smooth surface for your makeup. I think it does a better job on pores than on wrinkles. In fact, my makeup pools into the creases when I use this primer, something that doesn&#x27;t happen when using my tinted moisturizer alone. So, I use the cream in some places, but avoid the craters.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this but I am not positive it makes a huge difference...but I feel decadent!</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;ve got the type of skin that could virtually act as a beacon for boats asea, I&#x27;ve tried all of the mattifying products out there and this is hands-down, no contest, by far the bet and most effective product out there for creating a completely shine-free face.  L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s newer product, Miracle Blur doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> If you need skin smoothing or perfecting, I wasn&#x27;t really happy.  My face tends to be red like all the time. The description said this product would take care of that, it didn&#x27;t.  I normally use a green hue concealed to balance the red and it works well and now I know it works better than this product.  However L&#x27;Oreal s true match or true color foundation is fantastic! So I just went back to my NYX HD green Concealed and L&#x27;Oreal foundation and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth, even, and ready for foundation. Sometime I use it instead of my face cream if I&#x27;m rushed. but works best over face cream before applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time... I would highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> Recommend it. works great for the price. a great buy. no bad experiences with it. All positive feedback. Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product did exactly what it said and I expected.  I will not use anything else now.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good makeup base...and finally I found this one by L&#x27;Oreal. I&#x27;ve been using this primer since last June...and I love it! Your skin look smoother and soft, and also your make up will stay on longer for sure! I highly recommended it and the price is great. No doubts.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using primer so I picked this small size to see if I would like it before buying bigger size. It has lasted me awhile already. It goes on smooth. Lessens the dark circles under my eyes, improves the overall look of my skin and helps my makeup stay put. I love this stuff. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I never used a \\&quot;primer\\&quot;  before and found this here while looking for halloween makeup.  Well I read that it is a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; size....I dont think so, because I found the same size jar at walmart for over $10.  I think this is just the size it comes in.  I love it....my makeup actually stays fresher looking longer.  I have used it without foundation with just a little powder for a nice MATTE finish and with foundation for a finished look...I will never wear makeup without primer again!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this primer. I don&#x27;t always use one when wearing my make-up, but I find that when I do, my make-up stays on longer, specially if I&#x27;ve got it on all day till the night. But for some reason, this primer kinda made it hard to &amp;#34;do my eyebrows&amp;#34; Maybe I used too much, but I doubt it b/c I&#x27;m good with doing my make-up. I think I was used to using my old primer that I may have used too much, which is why it made it hard to finish/fill in my brows. Although it does feel very smooth, I just think it&#x27;s a lil too heavy. I&#x27;ll try it again next time, I&#x27;ll use less &amp; see if that helps, but I&#x27;m not super excited about this product. I saw this on a video online about make-up tricks &amp; techniques, just wanted to learn a couple new things &amp; it got rave reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. But like I said, I&#x27;ll try it again, but it&#x27;s just not what I was totally looking for.</li>
    <li> I found this on clearance at CVS for under $1. I loved it. I am dark skinned and did not know how this would look on my skin under foundation. Well, it worked wonders. It did not leave a white film on my skin and change the color of my foundation. It went on smooth and effortlessly! I received many compliments saying my skin looked clearer and smooth!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of primers but the oily hypoallergenic sunscreen I have to use makes foundation difficult during the summer. I got tired of experiencing &amp;#34;pooling&amp;#34; in my pores so while I work on skincare that will get to the root of the pore issue, I ditched the couple of primers I had and looked for one that would spackle those puppies over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I tried this one sight unseen. I was frankly gobsmacked at how it blurs the visibility of pores and imperfections -- when I swatched it on the back of my hand where I have many fine lines, it honestly looked like I had run an airbrush wand over them. On my face it smooths out my skin texture both visually and literally -- pores are much less visible, and foundation applies over them without pooling. I&#x27;ve taken to using it on &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; days as well, since it makes my skin look so much nicer and more luminous, provides a great surface for translucent powder, and really sets my sunscreen and its oily tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple notes: you don&#x27;t need much, and too much will dry looking flaky. Work a small dab briefly between your fingertips and then pat all over your face. Also, it doesn&#x27;t work very well to prevent my undereye concealer from settling into fine lines (for that I use NYX concealer in the wand tube).</li>
    <li> I love this product. You only need a small dab of it applied to the skin &amp; it creates a smooth base for applying your foundation &amp; makeup. This is an essential for any makeup bag &amp; I just love the way it makes my skin feel smooth &amp; soft!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t really used makeup primers before trying out this product. I&#x27;ve had good luck with L&#x27;Oreal in the past and based on the reviews I gave the trial size a shot. I am pleased with the results and plan to purchase the full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:  I often use this alone without foundation, or underneath bronzer. This base alone provides just enough coverage to even out my skin tone without being obvious or looking like makeup. I&#x27;m happy with that, because I usually don&#x27;t have time to put on full makeup, or I just don&#x27;t feel like going through the entire routine. This is a nice short cut. I also like the silky feel of this base. It goes on easily and feels light and soft on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con:  I don&#x27;t like the packaging of the trial size. The lid is a hard plastic, which is difficult to grip once you have the product on your fingers and the glass dish that holds the product is so short that it&#x27;s hard to hold just the jar while unscrewing the lid. Hopefully the full size will be a little easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have purchased the regular size version of this primer and I am fully satisfied with it. The full-size dish (unlike the trial size) is easy to open and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see that it improves the look of my pores. I still use it just because I want to finish it, but it&#x27;s nothing amazing.</li>
    <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this more expensive product and some of the other less expensive ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
