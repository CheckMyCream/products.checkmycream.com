      <li>Ok, ok something close to that, smile.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong smell</li>
      <li>I had no problem with it, and the butter arrived looking and smelling just fine.</li>
      <li>Although your skin may be fine with it...</li>
      <li>Good quality, and leaves your skin feeling soft!</li>
      <li>Shea butter has a distinct smell which can be quite pungent to most.</li>
      <li>, just plain shea butter is one of the best things you can use on your body.</li>
      <li>The price is great as always and I believe smellgood has found a customer for a long time to come!!</li>
      <li>My family loves it and it works great on my mom&#x27;s brown spots, my 8 year old&#x27;s skin issues, and even fades old scars.</li>
      <li>The Shea Butter came securely packaged (exactly as picture).  </li>
      <li>I have seen some bad reviws for this product but to be honest in this location this is about the best we can get our hansds on.  </li>
      <li>Mine was not dirty or stinky...</li>
      <li>smooth and high oil content</li>
      <li>Fresh out of a shower with moist skin, I smooth some of this on and my skin is so soft all day.</li>
      <li>great  product its the yellow not the pure white.</li>
      <li>Have bought this two more times since this initial purchase.</li>
      <li>This product is smooth and soft however, it is not consentant.  </li>
      <li>keeps my skin baby smooth and soft</li>
      <li>Shea butter is great for African American women with natural hair!</li>
      <li>you want to use something that is inexpensive and good for all your skin, this is the real deal, only thing it comes in huge bulk that you will need to melt down and put in smaller jars, while doing so you can add your favorite essential oils, well worth it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this without ever trying pure Shea Butter before.</li>
      <li>It has a strong nutty smell that I didn&#x27;t have much luck covering or combining with essential oils.</li>
      <li>And it does it really fast.</li>
      <li>it very goode item</li>
      <li>some of it was really gritty(the bottom part), but this product lasted me for years.</li>
      <li>You have to work with it and add oil to ensure it&#x27;s smooth enough to use.</li>
      <li>I know the real deal</li>
      <li>Thanks seller,and Salaamu Alaikum to all Muslims who may read this.</li>
      <li>and this is most certainly not it!ow the real deal</li>
      <li>and this is most certainly not it!</li>
      <li>I live in a dry area so this really helps to keep my skin moist and strong.</li>
      <li>Not only is African Shea superior to anything iv&#x27;e ever used,but it actually keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day.</li>
      <li>My shea butter arrived quickly and was double wrapped in plastic.</li>
      <li>I spent the first 15 years of my life in West Africa and used shea butter for many years back home.</li>
      <li>Will continue if their quality remains high.</li>
      <li>Even after combining it with other authentic natural products, my skin would still break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ve kept it in the fridge for a over year and it hasn&#x27;t gone bad, still smells nutty and works great on my skin!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s normal, research it.  </li>
      <li>others may argue that every skin is different and it worked for them but be aware still that you&#x27;re putting something else on your skin.</li>
      <li>Dry feet, use everynight and put on those rubber lined socks, in 15 to 20 minutes the butter will have been absorbed in your feet.  </li>
      <li>It was never ever well absorbed into my skin (I have dry skin).</li>
      <li>I forgot to add that the packaging was a little different, the lump of butter was in a thin plastic bag (like the kind you put produce in) and that was in another plastic bag, tied at the top.</li>
      <li>but it still keeps our hair and skin soft as baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
      <li>but I directly apply  it to my body.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s yellow and shea butter ranges from offwhite to golden yellow.</li>
      <li>This large amount of butter lasts a LONG time.</li>
      <li>I firmly believe as many other buyers do that it&#x27;s lard mixed with certain undesirables....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more ivory than it is yellow and the texture isn&#x27;t as hard as  </li>
      <li>and I shared it with family members too; I&#x27;m sure this will last for at least 3-6 months.</li>
      <li>I absolutely WILL NOT live without it.</li>
      <li>Yes the smell was strong, but I expected that from RAW shea butter.</li>

<li> Yes the smell was strong, but I expected that from RAW shea butter.</li>
<li> I am a very dark complexioned young African male and i approve of this Shea.</li>
<li> has clogged the pores on my scalp and my skin and left my skin extremely dry.</li>
<li> It melts in my hands and spreads very well, which mean the 7lbs I ordered will really last.</li>
<li> I use this for lotion for myself, my husband and children we all have different skin types, my husband is white, I&#x27;m Black and of course our children are mixed.</li>
<li> so I use my hand&#x27;s all day long.</li>
<li> A snail, amount goes a long way.</li>
<li> I kept thinking that when mixed with the other ingredients the scent would be weaker.</li>
<li> At first when I had gotten this shea I was skeptical because I was not used to the soft texture as opposed to the conventional that I was used to getting which was harder.</li>
<li> and this is definitely not real Shea butter.</li>
<li> After letting it sit for a few days at room temperature, I opened its packaging and it had softened enough to use.  </li>
<li> I usually mix several oils together when I use the product on my hair</li>
<li> The smell isn&#x27;t really a bad one though, just strong.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s funky and gave me black spots on my face and, didn&#x27;t help moisturizer my skin at all.</li>
<li> It lasted for about a year and a half.</li>
<li> as to previous review disregard.  </li>
<li> I add some other oils like coco butter and jojoba for myself, my husband uses it plain on elbows and feet.</li>
<li> It was all in a sturdy little box.</li>
<li> Because I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for almost a year, my blemishes and a few stretch marks are fading away.  </li>
<li> After a few years of dealing with skin and hair issues, I finally concluded that the poor appearance of my skin and hair was because of the so- called Shea butter</li>

    <li> I am a pipefitter and a  welder so I use my hand&#x27;s all day long. This is the best stuff I have ever used. My hands don&#x27;t crack, and if they do this helps to heal them. And it does it really fast. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This shea butter was everything I&#x27;d thought it would be and better!  I Love it and will be ordering MORE!!!</li>
    <li> I have seen some bad reviws for this product but to be honest in this location this is about the best we can get our hansds on.  This product is smooth and soft however, it is not consentant.  There are some more dense section but it still keeps our hair and skin soft as baby&#x27;s skin.  Ok, ok something close to that, smile.  Seriously you can&#x27;t beat this for the money and shea butter, just plain shea butter is one of the best things you can use on your body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Excellent quality! A snail, amount goes a long way. Can be used for body or hair products. This was an excellent buy! I will re order this again when I need more.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product! Shea butter is great for African American women with natural hair! My hair loves it! I usually mix several oils together when I use the product on my hair but I directly apply  it to my body. It&#x27;s a lot and I shared it with family members too; I&#x27;m sure this will last for at least 3-6 months. It has a strong smell but I don&#x27;t mind it. Great product!! Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I use this for lotion for myself, my husband and children we all have different skin types, my husband is white, I&#x27;m Black and of course our children are mixed. I add some other oils like coco butter and jojoba for myself, my husband uses it plain on elbows and feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from amazon.com several times over the years and this is definitely not real Shea butter. I spent the first 15 years of my life in West Africa and used shea butter for many years back home. Shea butter has a distinct smell which can be quite pungent to most. It&#x27;s more ivory than it is yellow and the texture isn&#x27;t as hard as  whatever it is most sellers sell here on Amazon.com. The Shea butter I used on my hair and skin in Africa worked wonders. It grew my hair and softened it and, made my skin glow while moisturizing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea butter I&#x27;ve used from this seller and others here at amazon.com has clogged the pores on my scalp and my skin and left my skin extremely dry. I firmly believe as many other buyers do that it&#x27;s lard mixed with certain undesirables.... It&#x27;s funky and gave me black spots on my face and, didn&#x27;t help moisturizer my skin at all. It was never ever well absorbed into my skin (I have dry skin). As a matter of fact, I had to combine it with regular lotion just so it would absorb into my skin. After a few years of dealing with skin and hair issues, I finally concluded that the poor appearance of my skin and hair was because of the so- called Shea butter I&#x27;ve been purchasing from sellers on this website. Some of them are halaleveryday, aspen naturals &amp; ZynMax distributors to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I used this product during the winter season, my skin would itch something terrible and I ended up staying away from this so called Shea butter from time to time. It was so bad that mixing it with other oils like jojoba oil and/ or Nutiva coconut oil didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. Imagine that! Even after combining it with other authentic natural products, my skin would still break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now others may argue that every skin is different and it worked for them but be aware still that you&#x27;re putting something else on your skin. Although your skin may be fine with it... MARK MY WORDS, THIS ISN&#x27;T AUTHENTIC SHEA BUTTER! I know the real deal and this is most certainly not it!ow the real deal and this is most certainly not it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the shea butter for a lotion. I cannot stand the smell and will end up throwing it all away. When melted, there is ?? ash, char, ?? pieces of something that needed to be strained out of the oils. I kept thinking that when mixed with the other ingredients the scent would be weaker. Not a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a deal, and thought I had found one. But... when you have to throw the product away, that is just throwing away your hard earned money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My house reeks of this stuff. Definitely not going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is wonderful quality &amp; has such a great moisturizing quality!  Melts at your bodies temperature &amp; spreads so nicely!</li>
    <li> The Shea Butter came securely packaged (exactly as picture).  After letting it sit for a few days at room temperature, I opened its packaging and it had softened enough to use.  Good quality, and leaves your skin feeling soft!</li>
    <li> great  product its the yellow not the pure white. smooth and high oil content the way i like ti. bulk deal here\</li>
    <li> It  has 3 different looks when I receive. It and  was very messy and didn&#x27;t look as it was 10 lb  but the price is good,</li>
    <li> I like this product. It lasted for about a year and a half.</li>
    <li> you want to use something that is inexpensive and good for all your skin, this is the real deal, only thing it comes in huge bulk that you will need to melt down and put in smaller jars, while doing so you can add your favorite essential oils, well worth it.  Dry feet, use everynight and put on those rubber lined socks, in 15 to 20 minutes the butter will have been absorbed in your feet.  The next day you will see the difference, but it&#x27;s like anything else persistance pays off with any product.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price</li>
    <li> The Shea Butter arrived very quick and it is wonderful without any fragrance added to it. You won&#x27;t believe how nice your skin feels after each use. I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I Will probably never have to buy store brand lotion again.Not only is African Shea superior to anything iv&#x27;e ever used,but it actually keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day.I am a very dark complexioned young African male and i approve of this Shea.Price is great for 7 pounds of this stuff as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled a old sugar container i had to the brim! Thanks seller,and Salaamu Alaikum to all Muslims who may read this.May this Shea work for you all as well InshaAllah.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much I love this ....keeps my skin baby smooth and soft</li>
    <li> i like it and it very goode item ---&lt;br /&gt;But&lt;br /&gt; I wish&lt;br /&gt;Be more quality packaging&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Got some leakage from the plastic&lt;br /&gt;Please be more strength plastic</li>
    <li> I made lotion bars with this product and it worked great for me! I will order again in the future,I know some reviews for this product say that it is not good quality but they should know they are buying RAW shea butter. I had no problems...it smell how shea butter smells and is a GREAT product for the money I will definatley buy this again. Mine was not dirty or stinky...lol..if you are considering ordering this product you won&#x27;t be dissapoionted</li>
    <li> At first when I had gotten this shea I was skeptical because I was not used to the soft texture as opposed to the conventional that I was used to getting which was harder. Now I like it just as well and I would not change a thing. The price is great as always and I believe smellgood has found a customer for a long time to come!!</li>
    <li> My shea butter arrived quickly and was double wrapped in plastic. Yes the smell was strong, but I expected that from RAW shea butter. Yes it&#x27;s yellow and shea butter ranges from offwhite to golden yellow. That&#x27;s normal, research it.  It melts in my hands and spreads very well, which mean the 7lbs I ordered will really last. I live in a dry area so this really helps to keep my skin moist and strong. Because I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for almost a year, my blemishes and a few stretch marks are fading away.  I hope this seller continues to sell at this price.... I hope some customers continue to dislike the stuff. More for me! ^_^</li>
    <li> I bought this without ever trying pure Shea Butter before. I love it! My family loves it and it works great on my mom&#x27;s brown spots, my 8 year old&#x27;s skin issues, and even fades old scars. You have to work with it and add oil to ensure it&#x27;s smooth enough to use. Have bought this two more times since this initial purchase. Will continue if their quality remains high.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t filtered, so I did have to strain debris (looked like shell or husk remnants) after melting it. It has a strong nutty smell that I didn&#x27;t have much luck covering or combining with essential oils. The smell isn&#x27;t really a bad one though, just strong. It works wonders on my skin though! Fresh out of a shower with moist skin, I smooth some of this on and my skin is so soft all day. Or I&#x27;ll wash my feet and then coat them with the shea butter, put on socks and go to sleep.. silky feet in the morning. This large amount of butter lasts a LONG time. But don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ve kept it in the fridge for a over year and it hasn&#x27;t gone bad, still smells nutty and works great on my skin! This is a great value.    Edit: I forgot to add that the packaging was a little different, the lump of butter was in a thin plastic bag (like the kind you put produce in) and that was in another plastic bag, tied at the top. It was all in a sturdy little box. I had no problem with it, and the butter arrived looking and smelling just fine.</li>
    <li> This product more than exceeds my expectations.  Am trying to convince everyone I know that this is the &amp;#34;fountain-of-youth product.  I absolutely WILL NOT live without it. Can u tell that I love, love, love it?!</li>
    <li> I misread the note in the package thought was a ingrediant lable but was not. as to previous review disregard.  would like to see there coupon in a bigger format if possible</li>
    <li> some of it was really gritty(the bottom part), but this product lasted me for years.Emollient and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great product, need to reorder real soon</li>
</ol>
