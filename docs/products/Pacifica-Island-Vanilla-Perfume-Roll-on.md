      <li>Came really fast, awesome product, would buy from this seller again for sure.</li>
      <li>Ok, this is the most glorious scent ever, but it arrived shattered in pieces!</li>
      <li>So far both are great!</li>
      <li>I sometimes mix this with the Pacifica Vanilla scent, it has a nice lingering effect that&#x27;s not too strong or overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I love gardenia</li>
      <li>I have used before an love it</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>This is perfect and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>Lovely floral scent.</li>
      <li>I do love that its a roll on too.</li>
      <li>I DO LOVE THE SCENT OF GARDENIA,  </li>
      <li>I bought this in March, well before my gardenias started blooming and enjoyed the scent.</li>
      <li>I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>I love Marc</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the Gardenias we have growing in the yard, but it&#x27;s pleasant and my husband loves smelling it on me.</li>
      <li>Nice fresh scent!  </li>
      <li>Great for those of us who suffer from migraines and are sensitive to synthetic smells!  </li>
      <li>So great for my daughter who has sensitive skin with eczema.</li>
      <li>Kudos for a great scent and being cruelty-free and all that, but unless you intend to keep applying this all day, don&#x27;t expect to smell nice for very long.</li>
      <li>Not everyone likes sweet-smelling perfumes so if the sweet floral scent isn&#x27;t your thing, you won&#x27;t like this one, but I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Light, sweet and animal friendly!</li>
      <li>I would say this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Bought the Vanilla because I liked the Gardenia so much.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell and the price</li>
      <li>I got it super quick too!</li>
      <li>You can imagine how excited I was when I came across this.</li>
      <li>Smells more like a car air freshener than a pretty perfume.</li>
      <li>Wonderful perfume ... have been using it for the last few years now and love it!  </li>
      <li>This roll on is very convenient and smells lovely.</li>
      <li>True gardenia scent.</li>
      <li>This is not bad.</li>
      <li>Plus no ill effects!  </li>
      <li>I really like the fragrance!  </li>
      <li>They are natural, free from parabens and 100% vegan.</li>
      <li>The first day I wore it, I put it on around 6AM, and when I got into work around 7:30, I couldn&#x27;t smell it on my wrists anymore.</li>
      <li>I JUST GOT THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND PUT IT ON</li>
      <li>Haha!</li>
      <li>But overall a nice buy if your going for natural.</li>
      <li>Perhaps a bit strong for daily use.</li>
      <li>I hope it lasts a few more hours!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>but it was really youthful.</li>
      <li>Smells just like real Gardenia.  </li>
      <li>After a few hours I can still smell it on my wrists and it seems to drydown nice.</li>
      <li>Fragrance smells real but doesn&#x27;t seem to work with my particular chemistry.</li>
      <li>When I wear it I receive many positive comments, soft and floral, last a long time too.</li>
      <li>I was really worried when I ordered it due to the fact that gardenia perfume can come across as really fake and strong but this was really light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Mostly floral with a hint of citrus, but not too heavy of a scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.. not strong which I like..</li>
      <li>Very natural yet not to hippie-smelling.</li>
      <li>I love gardenia and find it hard to find realistic gardenia perfumes.</li>
      <li>Compared directly with my now-blooming gardenias, it isn&#x27;t exactly the same, nor did I expect it to be, but the overtones are there.</li>
      <li>The roll-on works great and dries quickly, but unfortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of tropical islands far, far away.</li>
      <li>oh wow with every puff of it....</li>
      <li>I was also concerned with smelling like an old lady</li>
      <li>Which kind sucks because your constantly having to replenish the scents.</li>
      <li>as with most roll-on perfumes the scent only lasts about 3-4 hours before they need to be re-applied, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I was seriously hoping this would smell more &amp;#34;Gardenia&amp;#34; than it actually does.  </li>
      <li>I was just looking for something in a general Gardenia smell.</li>
      <li>I thought it was more of an oil, not a parfum, and the glass was so thin, the box (while not leaking) wreaked of gardenia.</li>
      <li>Although this isn&#x27;t pure gardenia and is mixed with other scents, I still like it!</li>
      <li>but the scent is not long lasting.</li>

<li> Smells a lot like the Kardashian and Lolita Lempicka perfumes which I like, but are not very pure.</li>
<li> Scent lasts quite a awhile and only takes a little.  </li>
<li> Absolutely no staying power.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;old ladyish&amp;#34; like other gardenia scents I have smelled in the passed.</li>
<li> Reminds me of Michael Kors, not as heavy or cloying as MK.</li>
<li> Of course, I&#x27;m a sucker for anything that smells like gardenias...</li>
<li> But this wears off within mere seconds.</li>
<li> terrible, just smells like bad alcohol.</li>

    <li> Smells more like a car air freshener than a pretty perfume.</li>
    <li> First I want to say that the scent is BEAUTIFUL! But this wears off within mere seconds. Absolutely no staying power. I have tried the spray version and it does last a bit longer. I will definitely be purchasing that soon!</li>
    <li> Smells great in the bottle but after a while it turns too sweet on my skin.  Fragrance smells real but doesn&#x27;t seem to work with my particular chemistry.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. It smells like hair grease....</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume ... have been using it for the last few years now and love it!  Nice fresh scent!  Carol</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND PUT IT ON AS SOON AS I OPENED THE PKG.  IT SMELLS WONDERFUL.  MY ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS WHEN I FOUND THE SCENT HAD COMPLETELY DISSIPATED WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR OF APPLICATION.  I DO LOVE THE SCENT OF GARDENIA,  SO I WILL JUST REAPPLY AS DESIRED.</li>
    <li> terrible, just smells like bad alcohol.</li>
    <li> The Gardenia is AWESOME!!  I can&#x27;t wait to buy more fragrances and lotions and everything else that smells this good!  HIGHly recommend; excellent customer service, too!  The BEST.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  Smelled in a store and bought here online. Very natural yet not to hippie-smelling. Perhaps a bit strong for daily use. Smells a lot like the Kardashian and Lolita Lempicka perfumes which I like, but are not very pure.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for something in a general Gardenia smell. I would say this fit the bill. It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the Gardenias we have growing in the yard, but it&#x27;s pleasant and my husband loves smelling it on me. So, &#x27;nuff said. Haha!</li>

    <li> I was looking for a new fragrance to replace my usual Marc Jacobs. I love Marc but it is pricey. After reading reviews, I decided to order this. Reminds me of Michael Kors, not as heavy or cloying as MK. After a few hours I can still smell it on my wrists and it seems to drydown nice. True gardenia scent. Very inexpensive alternative to my usual. I hope it lasts a few more hours!</li>

    <li> Ok, this is the most glorious scent ever, but it arrived shattered in pieces! I thought it was more of an oil, not a parfum, and the glass was so thin, the box (while not leaking) wreaked of gardenia. It was heartbreaking, so I&#x27;m turned off from ordering scent from Amazon now.</li>
    <li> My favorite along with the vanilla and lilac is great too</li>
    <li> Adore these Pacifica roll on scents. They are natural, free from parabens and 100% vegan. So great for my daughter who has sensitive skin with eczema. My only issue is that with every one the ball seems to not roll properly and the scents don&#x27;t rub out. Which kind sucks because your constantly having to replenish the scents. But overall a nice buy if your going for natural.</li>
    <li> Omg I have been searching everywhere for a perfume that smells like gardenias and this is definitely what I was looking for! It smells just like it and it&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;old ladyish&amp;#34; like other gardenia scents I have smelled in the passed. The Michael Kors perfume smells similar and I didn&#x27;t want to buy it because of the cost. Glad I didn&#x27;t! This is perfect and I will definitely purchase again. I got it super quick too! Thank you, seller!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was really worried when I ordered it due to the fact that gardenia perfume can come across as really fake and strong but this was really light and refreshing. I was also concerned with smelling like an old lady but it was really youthful. I must say I constantly get compliments from this perfume and it is now one of my favorites to wear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.. not strong which I like.. I do love that its a roll on too. Spray perfumes irritate me because it just goes everywhere..</li>
    <li> It is not the best, but not bad.  Compared to Yves Rocher gardenia, it is not that good.  They must have sold the rights to that perfume as they don&#x27;t carry it anymore and they nailed the scent with that one.  This is not bad.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smell and the price but the scent is not long lasting.</li>
    <li> I love gardenia and find it hard to find realistic gardenia perfumes. I bought this in March, well before my gardenias started blooming and enjoyed the scent. Compared directly with my now-blooming gardenias, it isn&#x27;t exactly the same, nor did I expect it to be, but the overtones are there. The roll-on works great and dries quickly, but unfortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. The first day I wore it, I put it on around 6AM, and when I got into work around 7:30, I couldn&#x27;t smell it on my wrists anymore. Hence the 2-star review. Kudos for a great scent and being cruelty-free and all that, but unless you intend to keep applying this all day, don&#x27;t expect to smell nice for very long.</li>
    <li> Everything I wanted in a fragrance! Light, sweet and animal friendly!</li>
    <li> Smells great and the roller ball style is nice.  Smells just like real Gardenia.  Scent lasts quite a awhile and only takes a little.  Bought the Vanilla because I liked the Gardenia so much.  So far both are great!</li>
