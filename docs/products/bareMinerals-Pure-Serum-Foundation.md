      <li>I am glad I tried this product.</li>

      <li>It helps blend better then your fingers can ever do.  </li>
      <li>Love the coverage, ease of application, and all day look.</li>
      <li>AND I JUST LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>ok need darker color..</li>

      <li>I absolutely love this foundation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m totally in love with it.  </li>
      <li>I love the foundation.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and settles nicely into my skin.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I bought the brush as well, which I love.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m totally in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if I had oily skin, it would work better for me.</li>
      <li>This brand has excellent sun protection and can be applied to the coverage needed, from sheer to covering scars.</li>
      <li>the brush suggest so I use my Sigma Flat Top Kabuki and application is flawless.</li>
      <li>still use this same kind now for years and it is great coverage.</li>
      <li>Incredible foundation, requires so little for great coverage and moisture,  reapply for full coverage.</li>
      <li>And although at 50 my skin is still oily, this foundation does not darken, which has been a huge problem for me for many years.  </li>
      <li>And although at 50 my skin is still oily, this foundation does not darken, which has been a huge problem for me for many years.  </li>

      <li>I love that I know I have a full coverage face</li>
      <li>and I love a full coverage face,</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have any problems with it in regards to &#x27;fine lines&#x27; or anything like that.</li>
      <li>The fact that this foundation is oil free was a selling point for me.</li>
      <li>I follow up with a dusting of light powder and it stays all day.</li>
      <li>So when I find a foundation that I love, I rarely change.</li>
      <li>The texture is so light that you would think that it wouldn&#x27;t cover well, but it does.</li>
      <li>The combination of primer, foundation and powder keeps me shine free throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels silky smooth.</li>
      <li>If you store it somewhere too warm, it will ooze out precious, amazing goop when you unscrew the cap - not fun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply too much.</li>
      <li>I ordered Bare Linen and it works well with my fair skin and neutral undertones...</li>
      <li>The texture is very light since it contains no water, oil, fragrance, silicone, or wax and is therefore  pure pigment.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t receive the dewy look that I have noticed on other YOUTUBERS, Which is so beautiful to have in summer months.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I can learn to apply it better and it will fall somewhere between the original powder formula and Ready.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>But Bare Linen is a perfect match and is the third lightest shade.  </li>
      <li>I tried it as soon as I got home and absolutely fell in love.</li>
      <li>You can read my full review at BeautyApocalypse dot com.</li>
      <li>It is just what it advertises..very thin...but full coverage.</li>
      <li>Because of the nature of this foundation, I think it would be equally suitable for someone with normal or even dry skin, provided a good moisturizer was used underneath.  </li>
      <li>I had red patches in several spots and this foundation covered them flawlessly.  </li>
      <li>I had red patches in several spots and this foundation covered them flawlessly.  </li>
      <li>My first bottle of Bare Linen serum foundation was from the store and was properly matched to my skin color (and is the best foundation match I&#x27;ve ever had).  </li>
      <li>And I was able to use it beautifully with all my other Bare Mineral products, powder included.</li>
      <li>My new favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>Received right on time; love this foundation since it gives full coverage and not heavy at all....will buy again!</li>
      <li>It was delivered within a week and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>However, I still love the original powdery Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>OTHERWISE, THIS MAKE UP BLENDS GREAT, COVERS ANY FLAWS AND EVENS OUT UNEVEN SKIN TONE WITH OUT</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  worth the price.</li>
      <li>well worth price...</li>
      <li>It has more of a natural shimmer than another stuff and does not look greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I naturally have pretty mild skin, but more on the dryer side.  </li>
      <li>The coverage is quite good and easily adjustable from sheer to heavy, depending on how many “drops” one uses.  </li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>and just the right coverage for my taste.</li>
      <li>I keep it quite sheer and can easily buff out any build-up in my fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to apply and last all day.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not like this product at all. No coverage.</li>
    <li> Based on Bare Minerals&#x27; description I was hoping for more of a BB or CC type product. What this feels like is Bare Minerals&#x27; powder foundation mixed with baby oil. It disappears on your skin with minimal coverage, but fails to deliver on the &amp;#34;tone-correcting&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; it promised. It left my skin feeling dry and looking dull. Maybe if I had oily skin, it would work better for me.</li>
    <li> I am glad I tried this product. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I have some mixed feelings about this foundation. I have very clear skin, but obviously I still sometimes like to wear foundation to even out natural unevenness. That said, I agree that this wouldn&#x27;t be a good product for someone with problematic skin. The biggest trick is using a TINY amount, because piling it on makes it look like you&#x27;re wearing foundation. LESS IS MORE! If you use a little and spread it, it looks like your skin but BETTER, SOFTER, BRIGHTER. I was looking for relatively matte foundation, and this is exactly what I wanted - not dewy OR powdery. CONS: I had to resort to storing this product in the coldest corner of my house, because it CANNOT handle the heat from my heater in the bathroom. If you store it somewhere too warm, it will ooze out precious, amazing goop when you unscrew the cap - not fun. I&#x27;m waiting to see how long this product lasts, but right now I would absolutely recommend it, as long as you don&#x27;t cake it up and store it somewhere cool!</li>
    <li> The container is not made very well. This is my second bottle, and the liquid will bubble up and leak out the top. I&#x27;m constantly washing and wiping off the top which is wasting the product. They should reconsider improving the bottle design.</li>
    <li> Good coverage using small amount make sure to shake it before each use to mix properly.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MAKE UP EVER MADE, JUST WISH YOU COULD MAKE A SWEAT PROOF MAKE UP. OTHERWISE, THIS MAKE UP BLENDS GREAT, COVERS ANY FLAWS AND EVENS OUT UNEVEN SKIN TONE WITH OUT LOOKING LIKE IT IS CAKED ON. THEY DO SELL A BRUSH TO PUT ON THIS FOUNDATION AND I JUST LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Something different for Bare Escentuals. I find it too dry. However, I still love the original powdery Bare Minerals. I have used it for years , 10 + and if I try another product out of curiosity,  I always go back. Why fix it if it&#x27;s not broken.</li>
    <li> Get the brush!! It helps blend better then your fingers can ever do.  Love this produce!  Helps hide wrinkles when properly blended.</li>
    <li> Product is AMAZING!!  Very easy to apply and last all day.  Love this foundation!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this foundation! It covers without giving a heavy loom. I don&#x27;t like the brush suggest so I use my Sigma Flat Top Kabuki and application is flawless. I recommend this to anyone who likes a natural looking foundation.</li>
    <li> still use this same kind now for years and it is great coverage.</li>
    <li> Covers well, but if you have slightly oily skin it will break you out. Not my favorite bare minerals purchase.  :/</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to buy make up on line and get the right color, this product is  lightweight and comes off easily if a powder is not used.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy again. Nothing special. Doesn&#x27;t stand up next to Bare Essentials other products.</li>
    <li> My new favorite foundation. I prefer using my fingers to apply. Goes on flawlessly and just the right coverage for my taste. My skin feels silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this product! I only need a few drops for my entire face. I have crummy adult acne and those three drops cover most of the acne scars and new red bumps. When I remove the product at the end of the day, my skin looks refreshed and new. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Bare Minerals powder foundation but I now use this serum foundation due to its &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; abilities. As others have mentioned, it does not make me break out anymore than I would without makeup. In fact, it appears to heal my acne faster by possibly soothing my skin. It does have a funky smell but smells like vitamins, which isn&#x27;t the worst smell in the world. It goes away once it has settled.</li>
    <li> Best Foundation ever.  I might touch up once during the day with just one drop very lightly applied.</li>
    <li> It looks good on but It is very thin and messy to apply.</li>
    <li> Messy, messy, messy.  A lot of product gets wasted in the cap.  I will never purchase again.  It looks like you have foundation on - I don&#x27;t like that.  I will stick with the mineral / powder base.</li>
    <li> nice, but it&#x27;s very watery.  If you want something without all of the junk ingredients, I guess you have to compromise.  Coverage is pretty good for it being so thin.</li>
    <li> I am 44 yr old F..very vain...very particular! This foundation is wonderful! It is just what it advertises..very thin...but full coverage. I ordered Bare Linen and it works well with my fair skin and neutral undertones...well worth price...Best foundation ever but without the caking and unnatural look and feel! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It goes on easier than any I have used</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and even with moisturizer on my skin this product still tends to look flaky.  The color is great though.</li>
    <li> Always loved this product!</li>
    <li> I use this color to lighten up my usual bareskin foundation as my summer color fades.  I blend them in a separate container.  This brand has excellent sun protection and can be applied to the coverage needed, from sheer to covering scars.</li>
    <li> Even in my mid 60&#x27;s I still have an oily T zone and I hate that shiney look.  My first bottle of Bare Linen serum foundation was from the store and was properly matched to my skin color (and is the best foundation match I&#x27;ve ever had).  I love the feel and the fact that it can be layered -- I keep it quite sheer and can easily buff out any build-up in my fine lines.  But what I love the best is the serum feel and the fact that it neither feels nor looks shiney.  A definite keeper in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> If not shaken properly, gets quite thick and can cause clogged pores</li>
    <li> Love the coverage, ease of application, and all day look. Works fantastically on my multi-zone facial areas, just very nice unified look of all over smooth complexion. I am really sold on this product, so different, glad I got to try a sample ; otherwise never would have realized that there was something new , different and terrific to be had!</li>
    <li> Very light. A tiny drop is all you need.  Feels like water when applying it. Nice coverage, but will settle into wrinkles.</li>
    <li> ok need darker color..</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t cover acne though. The color is perfect. The way it goes on people can be different for everyone. I suggest going to the mall to try a color and see how it feels before buying it on amazon.</li>
    <li> This foundation is truly amazing.  I am light skinned, but not fair, with neutral undertones.  There isn&#x27;t a color in the Bare Minerals powder foundation that works for me (they are all too yellow) so I was hesitant to try the liquid one.  But Bare Linen is a perfect match and is the third lightest shade.  The texture is very light since it contains no water, oil, fragrance, silicone, or wax and is therefore  pure pigment. It also contains vitamin C.  It goes on like a serum, with only a few drops to cover the entire face.  I use this with a goat hair brush I already had but I spread it with my fingers first. I think any natural bristle foundation brush would work.  This gives light to medium coverage and using only a few drops, the bottle will last a very long time. Even with heavier coverage, you can still see the skin through it.  I don&#x27;t know how this is possible, I&#x27;ve never used anything quite like it. This is not a matte finish foundation but something completely different.  I apply loose powder over it (Urban Decay, Naked powder in light, which adds a little color or ELF HD powder, which adds no color at all) to set it and the finish is amazing.  I have oily skin so the powder is crucial and I use a mattifying primer (Lorac) under the foundation as well.  The fact that this foundation is oil free was a selling point for me. The combination of primer, foundation and powder keeps me shine free throughout the day.  Because of the nature of this foundation, I think it would be equally suitable for someone with normal or even dry skin, provided a good moisturizer was used underneath.  The texture is so light that you would think that it wouldn&#x27;t cover well, but it does. It even covers a bit of redness I have.  For light coverage you only need 2 small drops, one for each side of the face and for medium coverage another drop or two. I suggest building the coverage using two coats instead of one heavy one.  The price, to me, is reasonable given that it will last quite a while.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this color or the foundation in general.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m totally in love with it.  I recently had some serious redness after using a retinol product that I had an allergic reaction to.  I had red patches in several spots and this foundation covered them flawlessly.  It also did not aggravate the situation and it actually seemed soothing, due in part I presume to the vitamin C it contains.  And although at 50 my skin is still oily, this foundation does not darken, which has been a huge problem for me for many years.  Either that, or foundation simply slides off after a few hours.  I have had no such problems with this foundation.  It&#x27;s a HG product for me.e a while.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this color or the foundation in general.

    <li> Love this product. Color is perfect and feels great on my skin. Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings about this product. First, it is difficult to select the correct shade (even in the store). It gives good coverage over scars, but it is hard to get it just right. It&#x27;s very easy to apply too much. I don&#x27;t feel like I have the control that I have with other bareMinerals products. Hopefully I can learn to apply it better and it will fall somewhere between the original powder formula and Ready.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and I love a full coverage face, So when I find a foundation that I love, I rarely change. I was worried where my skin is so dry if the foundation would seep under and around my dryness but it didn&#x27;t. I love the foundation. I didn&#x27;t receive the dewy look that I have noticed on other YOUTUBERS, Which is so beautiful to have in summer months. But I am a fan, It wears well in humitiy. I love that I know I have a full coverage face but you cannot even fill the foundation. I didn&#x27;t buy the brush but I am going to go back and get it. Here is a video of my application and more on the product review! . [...]</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Coverage without all the crappy chemicals!</li>
    <li> This is very thin, which I like. Never looks cakey, very natural. Doesn&#x27;t have a ton of coverage but if you need light coverage this is perfect. Matched my skin perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of concealers over the years, but this product is the only one that I&#x27;ll buy from now on. It goes on smoothly with a light finish, yet still covers red spots, flaws, etc. and blends perfectly. I also trust the ingredients as being a safer alternative to regular products.</li>
    <li> I usually use the  L&#x27;oreal Lumi because it has a nice shimmery look without looking greasy. I naturally have pretty mild skin, but more on the dryer side.  I decided to just take a chance on this because every store I looked was out of my usual stuff. I didn&#x27;t purchase the brush because I already had a sigma 80 which is for liquid foundation anyway. I tried it as soon as I got home and absolutely fell in love. It has more of a natural shimmer than another stuff and does not look greasy at all. I&#x27;m only 22 so I don&#x27;t have any problems with it in regards to &#x27;fine lines&#x27; or anything like that. And I was able to use it beautifully with all my other Bare Mineral products, powder included. New personal fav and won&#x27;t be looking for my Lumi anymore.</li>
    <li> It goes on with just a small amount and covers beautifly. I will try a different color next time as this was a little too yellow for me.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and tried the bare satin shade which worked great, but this linen shade shows my dry patches.</li>
    <li> U can buy this quality of foundation in your local pharmacy</li>
    <li> It is very watery and does not go on well. I use all the Bare Minerals powders and thought I would try this, but I was disappointed. Used it once and can&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Finally Bare minerals came out with a liquid!!! Incredible and easy on the skin just like the powder. I was afraid the liquid would make me break out like all other brands but it is just minerals like all their other products. Keep in mind for some reason they created new names for this line of foundation so you cannot rely on what you use for powder. You have to get to know your tone all over again. Painful I know and you might be lighter than picture seems so once I experimented my tone at a store then I got the best price online.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I used their original powder Bare Minerals,but that really was drying to my face.  I this is very light, but still had good coverage.  I was used to using tinted moisturizers or BB creams and I am preferring this more based on the coverage.  I bought the brush as well, which I love.</li>
    <li> Its kind of greasy after a couple hours</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation.  It is so easy to apply and it feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything, yet it gives a nice coverage.  I used a little extra on areas that need a little more hiding.  I follow up with a dusting of light powder and it stays all day.</li>
    <li> Received right on time; love this foundation since it gives full coverage and not heavy at all....will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this at all. Other reviews say that it works well with oily - combo skin and it doesn&#x27;t. It clumps on my face and it feels so oily and awful on my skin, I hate it. I really regret buying this.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d paid more attention to the negative reviews. This stuff is awful. It settles into you fine lines and pores and makes your face look chalky and old!  It also really irritated my sensitive skin. I will definitely be returning!</li>
    <li> Foundation did not live up to its expectations at all; very unsatisified with results.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This is the same product you can buy online or in stores, but at a discounted price. It was delivered within a week and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This is horrible makeup. It&#x27;s watery and makes your face very shiny once it&#x27;s on, so much so that you need to wear powder just to help dull it down. But the worst part was the breaking out I experienced on parts of my face that are not normal for me at all. I&#x27;ve worn expensive and cheap foundations and this has been the only time I&#x27;ve ever broken out. Not good!</li>
    <li> Received as date stated. Packing was as expected. This product is AMAZING! I didn&#x27;t purchase the brush but a little bit of this liquid goes a long way and is easy to apply with the fingers. It is light and silky, evens out the skintone and looks so natural. Feels like nothing on. The &amp;#34;Bare Linen&amp;#34; color I chose has a slight yellow tone which I thought would look off and not blend with my skintone but after it&#x27;s applied it looks Great. I&#x27;m not sure but I will check the bareMinerals website if this liquid may possibly be skintone &amp;#34;self adjusting&amp;#34;. Try it, You can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s  worth the price.</li>
    <li> The coverage is quite good and easily adjustable from sheer to heavy, depending on how many “drops” one uses.  I have grown to like the color, but it takes a lot of work to get it blended. The foundation is very liquid.  The bottle instructs you to shake well.  Do so.  After shaken well, the product comes out in drips or drops that go into the sponge or onto your fingers.  After applying the foundation, it kind of turns into a powder finish—like one of those liquid to powder foundations.  Which is cool, I guess, but I stopped using the powder foundation because it was settling into my wrinkles, I mean, my fine lines.  And so does this foundation after I apply it.  If I use a beauty blender sponge I can rub it out of the lines a bit and get it to look passable.  Using a finishing powder just adds to the powdery effect, so that’s a no-go.

    <li> A great, sheer all over coverage that isn&#x27;t a gloppy mess. Easy application with a make brush as well.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the Bare Minerals Bareskin product! It goes on so smoothly and settles nicely into my skin. I do find that I can&#x27;t immediately apply bronzer/blush because the product needs time to settle in first.</li>
    <li> The consistency of the foundation was odd; it certainly was not uniform. Sometimes, it would be oily-- and yes, I shook well for each use...</li>
    <li> Incredible foundation, requires so little for great coverage and moisture,  reapply for full coverage. Remember to shake well prior to use.</li>
