    <li> Really big bottle, only for $4.99! It&#x27;s unscented but there&#x27;s a subtle soapy fragrance, kind of floral. This is sooo soft and creamy. My skin gets so dry and itchy after showers during winters so I switched to Dove wash but it smelled awful! So I gave this a try and it&#x27;s great. Smells good and feels good. My skin felt moisturized afterwards and I don&#x27;t feel itchy or irritated. It&#x27;s really good stuff</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers so good. I&#x27;ve been switching to products that are healthier for my body without all this nasty harmful ingredients most all products have. While this is not organic and still from Proctor &amp; Gamble, it&#x27;s seems a safer bet than the norm when you compare what they have listed on the back. I don&#x27;t see any parabens listed. It&#x27;s just seems like it would be better for people with sensitive skin who need products with minimal or no dyes, scents, or soap. It doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. A better option if your looking for a milder soap and you like Olay.</li>
    <li> Love this, especially since I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
    <li> This makes my wife&#x27;s skin feel so soft. I purchased this for her because I was tired of Dove, I believe Olay makes my wife skin softer longer compared to Dove In addition, the Olay has a soft scent so it is not unscented</li>
    <li> I love this body wash! I hope they never quit selling it! This is the only kind I will use!</li>
    <li> Ok for some parts of my body.  sold as sensitive skin but it is heavily perfumed.  Would not buy again only because cannot use on whole body.</li>

    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Long time user.</li>
    <li> The product is very good, does wonders for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first wash that doesn&#x27;t make me itch and I use it for everything - hair, face and body - which eliminates having to take along separate bottle when traveling.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it.</li>

    <li> This product definitely makes your skin softer and more moisterized.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> How can this be unscented work PARFUM in the ingredients?</li>
    <li> Several of my family have sensitive skin issue ranging from allergic irritation to eczema.  This body wash is amazing.  Leaves your skin soft and supple with a pleasant clean scent and no rashes or irritation.  This is the only thing I use on myself and the kids.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great body wash, good price, big bottle. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Just okay. Not quite sure whether this product is legit. May be fake. Have used Olay body wash for years and this seems different. Would not recommend.</li>
