      <li>Performed as cheaply made Emory board.</li>
      <li>so light that using them has removed the etching.  </li>
      <li>These are lightly etched glass...</li>
      <li>my wife bought these thinking that they were similar to glass files we had bought IRL at a street fair.  </li>
      <li>They were larger and much coarser-grained, but still OK.</li>

<li> it is a waste of your hard earned time and money.</li>
<li> the roughness of the file went through to slick glass after 1st use, so was no good.  </li>
<li> Also alittle thick.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking to replace one of those never ending nail files, this will leave you disappointed!!</li>

    <li> these are Christmas gifts and I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> These work great.  Just as advertised.</li>
    <li> the roughness of the file went through to slick glass after 1st use, so was no good.  Also alittle thick.</li>
    <li> my wife bought these thinking that they were similar to glass files we had bought IRL at a street fair.  They were larger and much coarser-grained, but still OK.</li>
    <li> I had looked in every store around for these files, I owned one before and my dog chewed it,,,so I made it my mission to find another....I was so very pleased to find them on Amazon, and the package deal was wonderful, great price too.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Thought these would last for some time to come. Performed as cheaply made Emory board.</li>
    <li> The price of these are amazing and they get the job done. I love them, plus having a set of 6 I don&#x27;t have to worry about one breaking.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom.  She kept asking me if I had seen any around.  I did not think I would like them but I now have one in my purse so i am never without it.</li>
    <li> These sucked. A waste of money. They didn&#x27;t file well. If you&#x27;re looking to replace one of those never ending nail files, this will leave you disappointed!!</li>
    <li> IT NEVER ARRIVED please do not buy this it is a waste of your hard earned time and money. BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I used these as gifts for co-workers and they were a big hit.</li>
    <li> They work real good.  Iuse them all the time</li>
    <li> Just ok; don&#x27;t waste your money.  I will not buy again and don&#x27;t recommend.  These are lightly etched glass...so light that using them has removed the etching.  My sister bought the Rose stone nail file and it&#x27;s fantastic.  I&#x27;m buying that instead.</li>
    <li> Nice colors, but they don&#x27;t last very long one use only then you have to toss them in the garbage. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great quality, super impressed. Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> these are great, careful not to file to hard as these are goooood files</li>
