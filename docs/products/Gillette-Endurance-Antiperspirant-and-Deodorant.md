      <li>Has a nice light smell that isn&#x27;t over powering but does do a great job of covering up you when you need it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> idk this is the first gel based deodorant i have tried and it lasts far less than the bar kind also the smell gives me a headache and ur armpits feel wet for a while after applying... not a fan even tho it dose work but i wont be buying it again unfortunately back to degree for me</li>
    <li> I ended up buying this because of the reviews. I have profuse underarm wetness. People used to call me &amp;#34;Pits&amp;#34; behind my back, which was pretty embarrassing ! My doctor recommended Secret Clinical Strength but it didn&#x27;t even create a dent in preventing the wetness. So, at the time, I did some research on Amazon and found Certain Dri. I was keen on using Certain Dri over the long-term, and although it worked, it left my armpits feeling itchy all the time. Due to the itchiness, I threw out the Certain Dri and just began experimenting with different products. I tried Arrid Extra Extra Dry, Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant (which is about the same price as Gillette and doesn&#x27;t work quite as well), Old Spice, etc. Long story short, nothing worked, so I went back to doing some research on Amazon. I figured I would look under Best Sellers in the deodorant section. Immediately I saw great reviews for this Gillette product and was impressed by the price. So I ordered the twin pack and been using it for a few weeks now. All I can say is WOW. It smells so great, looks good, and best of all, is clearly CLEAR GEL.  --White marks on my clothes have ceased to exist ! --More confidence when around people ! --FANTASTIC SMELL LASTS ALL DAY ! --I HIGHLY recommend buying this product on Amazon because it is a few dollars cheaper than at the grocery store.  Special thanks to Alex Fiuk and his review. Like him, I don&#x27;t appreciate the white residue left on my clothes from solid sticks. This gel is refreshing and truly lasts ALL DAY. With other products, after applying the stick in the morning, I would discover in the afternoon that the odor is back and am still wet underneath. This is no longer the case. Thank you, Amazon !</li>
    <li> husband loves this product, and it is sometimes hard to find at local walmart</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  A bit pricy, but I have not been disappointed by this product in over a decade.</li>
    <li> Its a good deodorant- has a mild smell- and it works</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of Influenster VoxBox program.  After using for 3 days, I really like it.  Great feel, smell, and lasts all day in the worst of conditions (heat, sweat, etc--I live in Florida).  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other anti-antiperspirants but I always come back to Gillette. Clean feeling and works great. Twin pack was also a great deal.</li>
    <li> Received Gillette Clear Gel Deodorant about 2-3 days ago and started using it immediately.  I have nothing but positive reviews about the product. I do not have to apply a large amount of the deodorant to my under arms and it seems to last all day long. I have very sensitive skin, so I am selective with certain products, especially deodorant. But with the Gillette clear gel deodorant I have not had any skin irritation. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gillette Clear Gel deodorant is great.  It&#x27;s a clear gel so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting white marks on your clothes.  The Cool Wave scent has a nice manly smell that my wife enjoys.  You don&#x27;t have to use much for it to be effective and it will keep you feeling fresh all the way through the next day.  Also, some clear gels have make my armpits itch but I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one.  I&#x27;m so glad that I got to try Gillette Clear Gel for free so I could share my opinion!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Product as expected.</li>
    <li> Great product, great protection, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, great 2-pack pricing, I will re-order</li>
    <li> I like the gel deoderant and since it comes as a double package, it seemed like a good deal to me.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, lasts long. Smells great and very good price for the size. I think it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
    <li> I do, and don&#x27;t, like the clear gel deodorant. I&#x27;ve always been a roll-on solid deodorant man. I received this product to try for free through Influenster, but I just wasn&#x27;t impressed. It worked well, but seemed to take a long time to dry and just wasn&#x27;t convimcing enough for me to want to switch to this brand. Good product, but not for me.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the liquid personally.</li>
    <li> I normally use the other type of deodorant but want to use a gel, and I like it a lot more than the AXE I use. The AXE seems to irritate my skin, however the Gillette doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me for whatever reason. And did I mention it smells nice!</li>
    <li> A little wet after you apply but dries quickly and leaves no stains or residue.  Also lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;and is very economical.  Gets my full recommendation.</li>
    <li> good and i like the offer</li>
    <li> Has a nice light smell that isn&#x27;t over powering but does do a great job of covering up you when you need it. The 2 pack also makes it so you have to order less often.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery....Thank-you!!!</li>
    <li> My husband used to wear this deodorant when we were dating and I loved to smell it on him.  Trying to be frugal, I started purchasing different deodorant brands for him over the years.  We both still love this brand and scent and I was so excited when I recently saw that Amazon offered a twin pack for such a great price.  I guess you could say that I feel like we&#x27;re dating again when I smell it lol! He says that he appreciates the way it feels when he puts it on and the length of time that it provides protection...that along with the being able to order it from our favorite online store (Amazon) makes for a great deodorant shopping experience!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like shopping. This is a great way for me to buy a deodorant for me that I like, and not have shop at the local stores. And being able to buy 2 at time is great. Its not a real heavy scent. Which is why I buy it. And it works great. Would recommend it to anyone who needs deodorant</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this one for about 15 years. I wont wear anything else. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin red. Lasts all day and I sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> I smell bad. This stuff makes me smell good. Works every time. Nobody knows that I am a smelly person thanks to this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, seems to be the only one that works all day for me. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> Our favorite deodorant use it every day.</li>
    <li> No smell, keeps me dry all day. So far no white marks on my shirt.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Still wish it were cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product has air pockets or bubbles so it runs out fast. That is why it has a good price. It does work good however.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s clear, and there&#x27;s little to no residue if you accidentally get some other than where you intend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, application is extremely easy - it glides on, no effort, and it&#x27;s easy to dispense the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, and most importantly, it *works*. Very well, as both a deodorant and as an anti-perspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, each one lasts many weeks, so you&#x27;re not always needing to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this particular one for maybe 5 years now, and I don&#x27;t see an end to that usage. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I do not like the aluminum but it does help prevent sweating. Only use it for sports.</li>
    <li> I always forget to get my husband&#x27;s deodorant when I go to the store.  Putting this on subscribe and save has made it so he doesn&#x27;t use my deodorant in desperation.  This smells good too - like cologne.</li>
    <li> After using other brands and types(spray,roll-on,gel)of deodorant finally I found this Gillette Deodorant &amp; Antiperspirant(20 years ago) and since then I dont stopped using for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-This is a clear gel with soft odor,dont need apply too much,instantly i feel fresh whit a nice smell,is not too strong(I hate the strong scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-After a few hours the smell dies, but the protection is still there,and it seems to last longer than other brands.I dont need re-apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-The price-quality ratio is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-Dont melting or degrade when I carry with me for travels or go to the Gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-The most important thing is at the end of the day NO ITCHY ,BURNING , REDNESS ,OR SMALL BLISTERS(like other deodorants)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PD:IF YOU LOOKING FOR A DEODORANT THAT WORKS WELL AND HAS A GOOD PRICE THIS IS YOUR CHOICE !!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and years.  I really like the &amp;#34;Cool Wave&amp;#34; scent and I REALLY like the fact that I can get it on subscription.</li>
    <li> I get allergic reactions to the other brands but this one is great! It smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my arms get a res rash! I would highly recommend if you get a rash from other brands.</li>
    <li> The gel was broken and wouldn&#x27;t push deodorant out, so I had to throw away.  What good is a lower price if you have to toss and no one to replace it, which they would do if I had bought it locally.</li>
    <li> Good product. Dries quickly. Nice scent.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love this deodorant. No women&#x27;s deodorant compares to it, so I use it too. Over the years, when their have been sales on other brands I have tried them and instantly regretted it and have gone back to Gillette clear gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You don&#x27;t need much- it goes on wet but mostly dries on after a little while. It&#x27;s not sticky, it doesn&#x27;t leave flaky residue, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. You don&#x27;t have to use much of it for it to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) All day coverage- the one place where other deodorants fail is that they stop working mid day.This stuff leaves both me and my husband feeling dry and fresh all day. And you never get that sweaty feel in your pits at the end of the day with this stuff. It really is all day coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It has a pleasant, mild scent. It is quite mild but still pleasing. It doesn&#x27;t knock you over with some pungent after shave style, funky scent reminiscent of the 1970s disco era. It&#x27;s a mild, fresh and clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is just the best deodorant that I have come across and I am cheap as can be and usually not brand loyal to anything. It is reasonably priced but even if its not on sale, I happily pay more for this product.</li>
    <li> Gillete original discontinued my favorite brand that STATED what it did. This doesn&#x27;t last long as stated. You may have to reapply again.</li>
    <li> Best Deodorant on the Market... PERIOD!</li>
    <li> this is deodorant! It works! Cheaper than CVS!  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Everything about this anti-perspirant is awful. The smell is super strong and really unpleasant, and it is very difficult to regulate how much gel comes out of the packaging. Usually, a lot more than you need comes out so you end up getting your body and your shirty dirty. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Price isn&#x27;t too bad compared to retail stores. Neither is buying in bulk. Use it to pad out your subscribe and save to five items and it almost pays for itself depending on your other items.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Clear, specifically Cool Wave, for nearly a decade now I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, it lasts all day, it&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
    <li> shipped on time, good deal</li>
    <li> Taste great too at first I was just going to use on my armpits. however it smelled so good I decided to give it a try AND WOW taste great. Goes wonderful with Chicken and steak as well!&amp;#62; (eat at your own risk please don&#x27;t be stupid)</li>
    <li> If you use Gillette clear you can get better prices even though you have to buy 3 of them but they don&#x27;t go bad.  You have a choice of 4 of the scents.  A great price when you factor in the quantity.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for my husband for quite some time. He just loves it! It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave white a chalky mess. Stops odor and sweat. His favorite scents are Cool Wave and Wild Rain.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. It does not leave undesirable stains on your shirts. It works well. It&#x27;s gel and you don&#x27;t need to apply much.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to deodorant for years. Great smell, applies easily and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette, happy customer.</li>
    <li> works well. saves me a trip down that long aisle at the store trying to figure out what to buy.</li>
    <li> I must say that I was very skeptical at first about how this product would hold up throughout the day, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The gel deodorants that I have tried in the past have always left a sticky feeling and did not dry very well in a short period of time. However, this specific product does the exact opposite — it dries MUCH faster than other gel deodorants and it does not leave a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling — I would say that it takes under 5 minutes for it to completely dry — which is really what kept me using this specific product from Gillette. I used to use dry/stick deodorants just because there is no drying period and I could put my shirt on right away, however, dealing with the white residue/stains on dark shirts from stick deodorants really got annoying. This gel deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue on shirts or skin and goes on completely clear (unless you use too much, and at that point once it is dry you will see some white residue — this is what happened when I first started using the product because it takes a little bit of time to figure out how much you need…but it still wasn&#x27;t as much as the dry/stick deodorants even the ones that claim to be &amp;#34;clear stick&amp;#34;). The smell is also great… it is not overpowering at all and has a very fresh/clean scent to it which you notice shortly after applied and lasts throughout the day. The only downside about using gel deodorants/antiperspirants is that if you have a job that requires A LOT of movement all day….you will start to sweat….you might not smell bad….but you will sweat and might feel uncomfortable. That is really the only bad thing about gel deodorants but I found that to be the case with nearly every brand — they just don&#x27;t hold up as good as the stick deodorants when it comes to a lot of physical movement — even when the active ingredient is at 16% which is really good. But if you have a job at an office or one where you do notneed to move quickly all day….this deodorant will be great! Overall, I give it 5 / 5 stars….this is truly one of the BEST gel antiperspirants I have used and I will continue to use it, especially the &amp;#34;cool wave&amp;#34; scent…the sport scent is also nice!</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot so I decided to get antiperspirant instead of deodorant. This product is both in one so that is good. However, the antiperspirant did not work so well for me. It helped, but I still sweat after a hot day or workout. The deodorant covered up the smell though which is nice. The deodorant smells good, but is a bit strong so don&#x27;t apply too much. Overall, this is good for the price and I would recommend it to those who do not sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> Its size is excellent as it ensures durability, prompt delivery, recommended a soft, fresh 100% not hesitate to buy odor.</li>
    <li> When purchased in bulk, the price is good.  I have been using this deodorant for a few years now, and I prefer it.</li>
    <li> Finally no allergy, no rash</li>
    <li> It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as It’s required and I will give 5 stars, it’s just Wonderful, better impossible, I was checking many different and similar of this one and I couldn’t find someone like this.</li>
    <li> Applies nicely, feels good, and smells good, too.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Smells good and isn&#x27;t overpowering. Works. At least I assume it does. As no one has been brave enough to tell me I stink anyway. 4 stars because I prefer stick over gel.</li>
    <li> always use it, reordered it bunch of times.</li>
    <li> Is as listed. Good price</li>
    <li> Thank you! Everything is super!!!!</li>
    <li> I have stuck to Gillette clear gell because it simply works great and lasts forever. You hardly need a smudge of this stuff and it&#x27;ll protect for at least two days of no showering (however I&#x27;d rather you take my word for it.)</li>
    <li> Don t leave home without it</li>
    <li> It makes me not stinky. My wife likes the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always hot and find most anti-perspirants/deodorants don&#x27;t last a full day. I&#x27;m very pleased that this does and has a nice smell that&#x27;s not overpowering -- it smells like &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This item was a great deal! I will be sure to buy it again and recommend it to others!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this deodorant for 15 years.  Every time I purchase something else due to cost, we always come back to this one.  The smell is manly and it works great.</li>
    <li> Packaging varies, item exactly as described though</li>
    <li> I never leave home without this! The smell is nice, not too strong, keeps me dry and smelling cool!</li>
    <li> Clear is a must... I&#x27;m sure that must sound like a commercial... The white stuff seems to get everywhere...</li>
    <li> I like this and on Amazon.com it is extremely cheap. This deodorant is great for controlling the bad smell and last all day.</li>
    <li> Great price and works great.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Works well, smells great, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have to either wait around for a while after putting it on, or I risk getting my shirts all gross and sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m not a fan of gel deodorant.  It applies wet and doesn&#x27;t dry for a while.  I always end up getting wet spots on my shirt.  I&#x27;m going back to non-wet gel type deodorants.  But that&#x27;s a personal preference.  The price of this two pack with subscribe and save is about equivalent to sale price at drugstores.</li>
    <li> wet, gooey, smelly....not acceptable</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells great, and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Is not what I was expecting</li>
    <li> I switched to this after Mitchum changed their formula and their tubes. They added a ton more holes to the top and made the gel thinner, which resulted in a huge mess every time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swapped to this in hopes of finding something a bit less messy, and it&#x27;s on the mark for the most part. My only complaint is the number of holes again. It&#x27;s so easy to turn the dial a fraction of a degree too far and end up with may more product than needed. It seems to especially be an issue with a brand new tube since there&#x27;s usually a lot of airspace at the top, and transport can cause the gel to be uneven and want to gush out of one side or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the minor complaint, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted in great price.&lt;br /&gt;The pack is very good and the size is bigger than regular.&lt;br /&gt;I assume I will order the one again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> good protection - for men and women. :-)</li>
    <li> The combination of my husband&#x27;s skin and this smell is ambrosia for me. He smells delicious. He seems satisfied with the efficacy, as he&#x27;s not come home smelling like a teen locker room, and once it dries it doesn&#x27;t seem to smear on his clothes.</li>
    <li> I have been receiving this two-pack as part of a regular Amazon subscription delivery, and I could not be more pleased. The clear gel applies easily and dries quickly. The anti-perspirant is adequate and effective. I work out every morning and perspire profusely but have never had an odor problem thanks to this product.    Most importantly, unlike old-fashioned solid anti-perspirants, Gillette Clear Gel leaves no staining or visible residue on your clothes. My old anti-perspirant left white armpit stains in my dark colored shirts (even after washing). This is no longer a problem. Thanks Clear Gel!</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Clear Gell Endurance in the mail in a Voxbox to try out and I must say I love the product! It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on clothing. I&#x27;m one of those people who sweat more than the normal person and it can keep up with me which is a great thing. The product smells great and it only takes two clicks of the product to work. I normally have to reapply sometime during the day and with this product I one have to put it one once. It&#x27;s defiantly a product I would recommend to someone looking for a great deodorant that works and does what it says it will do! *I received the product complimentary to test and review and the opions are 100% my own*.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant! One of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried  , I received this deodorant free from influenster and was selected to try it and it was one of the best things that happened , I have a active lifestyle so I need a good deodorant and believe me Gillette endurance is great doesn&#x27;t leave white marks it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s long lasting and it smells good .</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Keeps me from smelling like onions</li>
    <li> Only kind my husband will use.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent. Very good quality</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 15 years, and that speaks for it self.</li>
    <li> I like the Gel deodorants and this one is my favorite so far.  Nice large size compared to most.  A good fresh smell, no stains.  I&#x27;d say give it a try.  IMO this scent could be used by both men and women.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.. Keeps me dry and smelling good.  This amazon subscription is the best deal around.</li>
    <li> gillette is the best......period</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used gel for the past 6-8 years now and this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Gillette&#x27;s gel deodorant. The problem with their gel is that it&#x27;s more on the liquid side than solid - might not make sense but hear me out. When pulling the cap off, it creates suction that extracts A LOT of gel out of the top, so when you apply it you are putting on way too much. This has caused stains to my shirts now, a problem I&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, but I find my self shaking off the excess gel into the sink each time I use it. If the gel was more viscous then it would be perfect! I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Good quality Thank you</li>
    <li> i like the smell and everything but its not as anti Perspirant as my other deodorants</li>
    <li> This stops you from sweating really well and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my school, we don&#x27;t have air conditioning, and during the summer, fall and spring it&#x27;s literally 80-90 degrees on a daily basis, and even in the winter it&#x27;s still probably 80 degrees, you sweat a lot.. also, my feet used to sweat for some reason, even when I was cold, my feet would just sweat, I don&#x27;t know why. I put this on my feet, put socks on and I probably sweat 90% less. It smells really good too.</li>
    <li> No issues here. It dries quick and does not leave marks on my t shirts.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and VERY powerful</li>
    <li> Works great, wish they sold in larger quantities.</li>
    <li> These are really good, I&#x27;ve been using Gillette deodorants for many years now, and I am happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;They used to have a pack of 6, which is not offered on Amazon anymore. the value was better on bigger packs. Also the size is reduced from 4oz to 3.8 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these to men who sweat a lot, like me. Helps reduce the sweating and removes the odor. It lasts for about 12 hours (full work day at the office). It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on the cloths (like those powdery ones).</li>
    <li> As described and would purchase for this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have never had deodorant shipped to me, but on a particular hot day, working outside, it occurred to me that I could calm my stinky pits while staying inside instead of traveling to the store and enduring further heat and scrutiny from other, cleaner, shoppers.  Ordered this up, doused my pits, and got back to work.  Thank you Gillette, for making me for palatable.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only deodorants my husband can use that does not make his skin break out</li>
    <li> The best price anywhere.</li>
    <li> Normally I do not like Gel deodorants but I have to say that this one actually may be the only one I buy in the future. It lasts long and smells great. I did receive this product for testing purposes through influenster but the review is my own and I do recommend it!</li>
    <li> It keeps my husband from stinking, and does a pretty good job considering how much he sweats when working outside. It doesn&#x27;t stain the armpits of his clothes, which makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant.  It smells great, lasts all day, and drys pretty fast.  The best part is it&#x27;s clear.  No having to worry about staining any clothing.</li>
    <li> Works fine for me; I like the product and the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on these so I picked it up.  I usually use a white stick, but thought I would give the gel a chance.  It does go on a little &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; for my taste, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have stained any clothes or anything.  I put it on after my morning shower and can still smell it on me when I go to bed at night.  I will give it another shot for sure!</li>
    <li> My husband is very satisfied with this product. Works very well as described. Highly recommend! Try it yourself! Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Quite pleasant feeling when applying, but I was quite horrified when I saw multiple yellow stains on my light blue t-shirt. Likewise, many other shirts had varying degrees of the yellow staining. As a result, I had to throw out the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your best bet would be using this only with dark colored t-shirts.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I&#x27;ve never been one to use the gel-type deodorant because I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling that takes forever to dry.  However, this deodorant is different.  You only need to turn the dial twice (which is not in the directions on the package, but I saw on a promotion on TV), and you have sufficient product that dries almost instantly.  I can say also it kept my armpits bone dry and almost completely odorless (my trainer planned me an insane cardio interval workout today, and although it kept my sleeves relatively dry I could notice a little odor developing).  One of my favorite things about this product is that you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing it.  I hate a deodorant that you can feel and/or smell all day.  I simply want to put it on, forget it&#x27;s there, and not stink.  I did not however test the 48-hour claim, so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s abilities to last for 2 whole days.  I would definitely buy this product, except I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s an antiperspirant.  Blocking up sweat glands just seems unhealthy to me.  I don&#x27;t sweat excessively, so standard deodorant does the trick for me.  If Gillette made this specific deodorant in a deodorant-only variety, I would definitely buy it.  Also, I did not buy this product.  I received it free from Influenster to try and review.  I&#x27;m not getting paid for posting this review; the opinions are my own, and based simply on using the product for 4 days.</li>
    <li> Great price and just what I was looking for. I bought a bunch.</li>
    <li> To bad it was only this small amount on sale, saved a little plus not driving to the store even more</li>
    <li> I prefer the gel type anti-perspirant / deodorant and the Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave applies easy and has a good deodorant effect.  Would  purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was a smart purchase for me.  It affords excellent protection, is not overpowering in scent, can be used by both myself and  my husband and its reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> What more can you ask for? It lasts as long as you need it to if not longer and it smells great. Arrived on time with no hassles. My go-to source for my deodorizing needs.</li>
    <li> Have used this deodorant for years and refuse to use anything else.  Good smell that lasts all day. I work outside as a tradesman and this stuff holds up</li>
    <li> Best deodorant in the world! Loved it!</li>
    <li> Love it will buy again!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this at all, for two reasons: First, it&#x27;s a gooey mess to put on. It leaves my underarms feeling wet and goopy. Second, there&#x27;s no good way to dispense the product. The &amp;#34;two turns&amp;#34; direction I&#x27;ve seen mentioned doesn&#x27;t make any product appear, even after waiting a few seconds. So you turn more, and sometimes end up with way too much product, and sometimes still nothing! Who needs this kind of annoying hassle in the morning when you can just use a clear stick?  I will say that it seems to be very effective, and the scent is pleasant, though very strong.  I received this product as a free trial through Influenster.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free sample of Gillette’s Endurance Cool Wave Clear Gel Antiperspirant/Deodorant from Gillette and Influencer. I was asked to test and provide feedback on my experience for no pay. I must point out I am not overly fond of stick deodorant/antiperspirants, as I tend to break out in red itchy rashes wherever the product touches my skin. Because of this, I have been using spray deodorants for the last 20 plus years and have had no problems with stickiness, overpowering scent, or rashes! Let&#x27;s start...I have been using this clear gel sample for a few days now and am pleased to note I have no rashes…yay! Unfortunately, there is an overpowering fragrance... I am not quite sure how strong the scent of &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; deodorant should be when applied, as I am used to a subtle to no scent from my personal choice of deodorant, but Gillette’s Endurance Cool Wave Clear Gel has a mighty strong fragrance; enough so that I get a mild headache from smelling the fragrance after the first couple of hours while it fades. Another issue with this product, even following the directions of “two twists” for 48 hours of protection, I can feel the gel on my underarms and it is not comfortable! I have tried letting my underarms dry for several minutes before doing anything, such as getting dressed!?, and it’s still there… and I am not sure why someone would want to wait around for this product to dry before finishing their daily routines!? I prefer to put my deodorant on and GO! There is also a problem with the &amp;#34;two-twist&amp;#34; mechanism, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. One time, you can get the right amount, other times you get nothing or WAY too much! (and with the times you get too much, there is a mess and just not enough time to deal with it!) The only thing this deodorant has going for it is the ability to not leave marks on my clothing. I appreciate the free sample, but this is not a product for me! I will stick with my Men’s Degree Sport spray… maybe next time Gillette…~CWursterSport spray… maybe next time Gillette…~CWurster</li>
    <li> Does the job and my wife likes the way it smells.</li>
    <li> One of the best, I subtract a star just because it&#x27;s harder to rinse off vs Axe products. Still, one of the freshest smells and it applies ALL day</li>
    <li> Would do 0 stars if could. Crank doesn&#x27;t work, hsve to squeeze to get gel up.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s antiperspirant!  Actually, it&#x27;s my favorite one and I&#x27;ve been using it for years (there had been some dalliances with cheaper products).  You can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
    <li> Been using the Gillette brand for years.  Got plenty good to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells good, not too strong&lt;br /&gt;2. Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;3. Not much gets stuck in package&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really the only downside, this can stain the armpits of your shirts.  If I&#x27;m not careful, I will get a buildup on my t-shirts, which is unpleasant.  You can help avoid this by letting it dry first...</li>
    <li> Saved money buying in bulk.  The packaging is different than shown in the image and what I was used to seeing in the store, however same protection.  The only difference in packaging is the color, and the lid is tighter and thinner than the retail product, which results in a vacuum effect when pulling the lid off.  It is easy to get used to some of the gel being already pushed out.  If you only use a very small (1-2 turns of the dispensing wheel) amount you may want to test buying one set then buy more after you are comfortable, however I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
    <li> Price is right , smells like a man, stays long. what more do you want. would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave anti-perspirant for quite a while.  It is available at Costco in my area in 5-packs for a much better price than buying them individually elsewhere.  It works well to keep you dry, it has a pleasant scent, and the clear gel doesn&#x27;t stain shirts.  It gets the job done so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I like the clear gel because it goes on a lot lighter than a solid, feels more comfortable, and it doesn&#x27;t damage clothes nearly as much. This performs every bit as well as a solid, maybe better.</li>
    <li> Husband smells good so we are all happy lol</li>
    <li> Good deal  will order again  +++++++++</li>
    <li> if this type Antiperspirant is for you, than it is good I must say, making its job killing smell very good...and u do not need to apply lot, small amount is enough</li>
    <li> Seems like everyone probably likes something different but so far this is exactly the same as the Gillette Clear I used to get at the store and it seems a bit cheaper here.  Plus I set it up as a subscription so a two pack arrives every couple months and I never have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap deodorant option and this came up. It works fine - but I&#x27;ve come to realizes the I prefer the stick deodorants over the gel variety. They make my armpits feel sticky after application...</li>
    <li> Good smell and long lasting. Love this anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> Really love the smell of this. Price was a little high than the other Gillette I used to buy. And it was only a twin pack. It goes on smoothly and stays on all day. Leaves no stain on my clothes</li>
    <li> I used to like this product more, it seems to work less than it has in the past, I feel a switch coming on.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 years and just recently I&#x27;ve decided that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should.  I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;ll change my mind again and think it works fine, or maybe I&#x27;ll switch, such a mission to switch though, gotta go through the trial and error process all over again, oh well</li>
    <li> The only anti-antiperspirant that I use.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I try other deodorants (mostly solids in gift boxes I&#x27;ve received) and I always end up coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on way easier than solids and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes like solids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally added it to my S&amp;S so I can always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> This product was first seen in Walmart.  It grabbed the purchaser&#x27;s attention.  Typically, Walmart has not been the place for purchasing an Anti-perspirant / deodorant, however on that particular day, it happened.  Now, here is that same product offered by Amazon.com.  The pricing is about the same and it is coming w/ other items.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works well on me right now. (My last brand stopped working for me, so I switched back to this one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it came pretty quickly. And the Twin Pack is great because you have back-up deodorant available when it&#x27;s time to hop back onto the computer and order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say? It&#x27;s deodorant-- and it works for me (for now).</li>
    <li> I will be loyal to this and keep using it</li>
    <li> This is the best deo I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t smell like normal deo. It smells like a cologne and last for 12 hours of working in a very hot steel shop. Each container last for around 10 months because it is a gel and it is very strong you only have to use a tiny little bit. I have very sensitive skin and even Degree make me rash but this stuff does not. Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years---ever since it was introduced on the market.  Works great with no irritation for me.</li>
    <li> just as expected.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I tried many brands over the years and this without a doubt is the best. No residue under arms, no staining of clothes or Tshirts and most importantly no &amp;#34;Lake Michigan&amp;#34; as they say. In fact, even in the most stressful situations at work (I have my share) I never break through this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Really you want some sort do review for A deodorant? ... The only concern is that the &amp;#34;dial&amp;#34; for extracting the deodorant is not &amp;#34;ridged&amp;#34; ... It slips easily in your fingers...</li>
    <li> Been a fan for more than a decade.  It works.</li>
    <li> Awesome deodorant with a long life. Only real issue is it will stain some white shirts...even a few dyed ones too. That is really the only complain I have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for maybe two years now since my SpeedStick stopped keeping me odor free. This Gillette product works fantastically for deodorizing purposes. I really does last 48 hours (though I usually reapply after every shower) and it leaves me scent free, which is how I prefer to be. My girlfriend likes the smell of it too, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad: It does nothing at all for me as an antiperspirant. I&#x27;ve literally sat in a chair in cold, air-conditioned rooms, and I had sweat in my armpits. It&#x27;s almost as if it doesn&#x27;t do any antiperspirizing at all. I&#x27;ve tried other antiperspirants that worked well, but anything but a gel gives me a rash after a week. So I&#x27;m gonna stick with this for now. But it definitely did not work as an antiperspirant for me. I&#x27;m looking for a new antiperspirant/deodorant right now because with the cold weather, my shirts don&#x27;t dry out, so my pits stay wet all day and my skin starts to get a rash. No can do. Gotta find something better.</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Gillette clear gel deodorant and I must admit that it was a bit different from the standard sticks I have used previously. The main difference is that you twist and a bit of gel comes out and you apply. The first couple times was a little awkward but seriously, this stuff felt light and was completely transparent. It also seemed to last the full day. I haven&#x27;t gone 48 hours using it but I&#x27;d imagine it would work fine. I did received a free product to test however, these opinions are my own through my actual experience.</li>
    <li> works well ... this is a pretty average deodorant and does not seem to have any side effects/issues</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, it must work because the hubby doesn&#x27;t stink!  (He didn&#x27;t stink before either.  ;)  )</li>
    <li> I usually pick this up at the store, but definitely a good deal on amazon. I like the two pack so I always have a back-up if needed. Never leaves any residue or usually lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I searched for years for an anti-perspirant product that did all I wanted. This was it for me. It is easy to use, smells great but not overpowering, doesn&#x27;t stain, can use sparingly, and lasts a long time. I combine this product with the habit of applying it right after stepping out of the shower and towling off. That way it settles into nice clean pores and works the best.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than it works. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Every time I get the urge to try something else I&#x27;m disappointed and always go back to this stuff. No matter how my day goes it seems to keep working.</li>
</ol>
