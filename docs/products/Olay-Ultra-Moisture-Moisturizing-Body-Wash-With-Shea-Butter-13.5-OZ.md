      <li>and you have to check out the in shower body lotion its amazing you rub it on right before you get out of the shower rinse and go its fast easy</li>
      <li>My wife has absolutely fallen in love with this product.</li>

      <li>My whole bathroom and bedrooms smells clean after taking a shower.</li>

      <li>I am about 1/3rd of my way through the bottle and my skin feels very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m in love with Olay products, I will never use another soap in this one&#x27;s place, and the smell is to die for.</li>
      <li>First of all the price is unbeatable ($3.5 with</li>
      <li>skin leaving it so soft &amp; clean.</li>

      <li>It smells ok and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
      <li>No one in the house liked the exfoliating seed-like things that were in the soap, and I actually thought the soap itself was a bit runny for a moisturizing soap, which probably caused us to use more than we needed as it was hard to control how much you got.</li>
      <li>This body wash lathers well and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate too much.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t feel like it really exfoliates that much for being labeled as exfoliating...</li>

      <li>I really like this body wash.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>

      <li>and it lingers mainly around the collarbone area.</li>
      <li>The scent has a decent staying time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I tend to change from normal body wash to something moisturizing</li>
      <li>We tried changing our bodywash twice but came right back to this product.</li>
      <li>my skin is very soft and no over powering perfume smell</li>
      <li>makes you feel young !</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>My skin to the touch is so creepily soft</li>
      <li>It does not have a heavy perfumed scent, it smells luxuriously clean.</li>
      <li>Not real harsh as some exfoliating washes can be.</li>
      <li>I use this daily when I shower &amp; my skin is soo soft.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and delivers the right amount of moisture.  </li>
      <li>To give you an idea of how long ago that was, I&#x27;m 21 years old now.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this is the ONLY moisturizing body wash I&#x27;ll buy, but if the price is right I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>

    <li> This is good to use a couple times a week. It keeps skin soft and with dry skin it helps it from drying and it puts moisture back into the dry skin</li>
    <li> Olay has great products and this is by far one of its greatest! It does exactly what it says its gonna do.....exfoliate!</li>
    <li> I really like this body wash.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and delivers the right amount of moisture.  It smells great, too.</li>
    <li> This keeps you clean and smelling great.  My wife and I have used many products but this one works better then anythingelse we have tried</li>
    <li> I love how smells. My whole bathroom and bedrooms smells clean after taking a shower. hehe. I order this all the time and I set it up in my monthly subscriptions. I buy it every 3 months though, is for my self only. It last a long time.</li>
    <li> nice smell, soothing, non abrasive to the skin and is cleansing.  I recommend this item and will purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> First of all the price is unbeatable ($3.5 with coupon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great and it cleans well. The only thing is that the sea salt hurts my skin,  I can only use it every other day.</li>
    <li> I have liked Olay&#x27;s products for a long time and started using this product an year ago. I have also used some products like St. Ives etc. However, I like the small granules in this product that are a bit rough and give a well scrubbed feeling without drying my skin too much. Some other products are either not foamy or are too foamy  but this product seems to have the right blend and a nice aroma too. My wife has absolutely fallen in love with this product. We tried changing our bodywash twice but came right back to this product. The deal from this seller is good too.

    <li> I have been using this stuff since eighth grade. To give you an idea of how long ago that was, I&#x27;m 21 years old now. I have used and repurchased this product more than anything in existence. I was shocked when I thought it wasn&#x27;t on the shelf when I noticed they changed the look a few years back, that&#x27;s how long it&#x27;s been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this wash really just transforms your skin. My skin to the touch is so creepily soft I can&#x27;t keep people away from me and it feels unreal to the touch. It feels like I&#x27;m properly hydrated and it even has a nice glow from being exfoliated lightly. Overall, I&#x27;m in love with Olay products, I will never use another soap in this one&#x27;s place, and the smell is to die for. It&#x27;s indescribable, but I can try by saying it&#x27;s the perfect mix of a wonderful oceany scent mixed with...ugh I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. You gotta go to your local drugstore and sniff this stuff. I get compliments on the scent well into the afternoon and it lingers mainly around the collarbone area. Boyfriend loves it hahah.</li>
    <li> Being from the northeast, our winters are pretty brutal and any exposure to skin will leave it dry and cracked.  I tend to change from normal body wash to something moisturizing come winter months.  I was drawn to this product during a slickdeals promotion and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Not sure if this is the ONLY moisturizing body wash I&#x27;ll buy, but if the price is right I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the smooth skin claim, but decided to try it out. it absolutely works!!! I am about 1/3rd of my way through the bottle and my skin feels very soft and smooth. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  The bottle is huge, and even Wal Mart doesn&#x27;t have it this cheap.  Also, the scent is pleasant, and the cream did not make my sensitive skin itch.  I&#x27;m surprised, but very happy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the exfoliating plastic balls as I have fount out that these balls wind up in the stomachs of fish.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes the skin feel wonderful. It cleans without leaving a film on your skin. It has fine micro beads for exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;your skin leaving it so soft &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> It smells great and feels so soft ... Fantastic price great value Olay Daily speaks for itself  makes you feel young !</li>
    <li> No one in the house liked the exfoliating seed-like things that were in the soap, and I actually thought the soap itself was a bit runny for a moisturizing soap, which probably caused us to use more than we needed as it was hard to control how much you got. We won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Great. It is very thick so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Smell great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year. It&#x27;s a staple in my bathroom now. It exfoliates well. And it does a good job moisturizing. I like the scent too. I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> This body wash lathers well and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate too much. I wish the scent was a tad stronger as it doesn&#x27;t last outside of the shower.</li>
    <li> its smooth and its nice on the skin it smells a little to soapy for me not much on the fragrance but thats also nice when you have sensative skin the little beads scrub atr the skin helping to pull away dead skin and you have to check out the in shower body lotion its amazing you rub it on right before you get out of the shower rinse and go its fast easy and it works on the intire body leaves everything feeling smooth</li>
    <li> this is just like dove&#x27;s exfoliating body wash at a slightly better price. Not bad for those who like to bathe with sodium laurel sulfate, this will definitely give you a nice boost on your estrogen levels.</li>
    <li> It gently exfoliates leaving my skin feeling so soft and smooth and it smells so good. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, skin smoother , healthy glow, fresh product, will order agin</li>
    <li> Nice aroma and leaves me feeling very fresh and clean afterwards</li>
    <li> OLAY Daily Exfoliating Body Wash is great for using in the shower.  During the winter months you need to exfoliate your body/skin, and the Olay body wash is so smooth feeling, after using it my skin is very soft and no over powering perfume smell I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Prompt service and great product.</li>
    <li> It takes more soap to lather compared to the original Olay body wash. This happens with other variations of the Olay body wash in my experience. Smells great though.</li>
    <li> wife loved it and such a good price to convenience ratio (I&#x27;m thrifty as well, so...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is great and texture/cleanliness/moisturizing qualites are as good as anything out there IMO!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart for $4.98. Same size bottle. I had been looking for the Dove exfoliating body wash, however, Walmart was sold out. I picked this up on a fluke. I am so glad I did. It is amazing. I have been using it for about two weeks. It smells divine. It does not have a heavy perfumed scent, it smells luxuriously clean. It lathers great. I only use a pea sized drop on my loofa each shower. I can see this body wash lasting a year. I absolutely love it. Probably one of the best items I have ever stumbled upon. It makes my skin feel so soft. The scent has a decent staying time. I can still catch whiff of it maybe 2 or 3 hours after my shower. Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> Great wash to use for an everyday light exfoliating washing experience. Olay has always been a trusted brand in my family, so I love the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Aveeno but it work very well</li>
    <li> I use this daily when I shower &amp; my skin is soo soft.  It feels really nice when you use it.  Not real harsh as some exfoliating washes can be. Plus you get a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Sea Salt&amp;#34; just feels like little plastic shavings... It smells ok and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but I don&#x27;t feel like it really exfoliates that much for being labeled as exfoliating...</li>
