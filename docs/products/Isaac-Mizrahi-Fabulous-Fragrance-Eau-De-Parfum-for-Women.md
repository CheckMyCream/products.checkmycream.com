      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>plus it just looks cute.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t stay more than a couple of hours.  </li>
      <li>and I just fell in love with the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy any because of the cost, but I kept the card (mostly to remember the name) and would sniff it every time I came across it.  </li>
      <li>I even go to bed after a 12 hour day and my arm still smells lovely...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and very soft.  </li>
      <li>It has a great soft smell.</li>

      <li>This smells absolutely FABULOUS ðŸ˜‰</li>
      <li>It has me captivated, it truly makes me feel fabulous.  </li>
      <li>This was as fabulous as the name.....</li>
      <li>It has staying power without being overly potent (unless you put too much on, and too much of a good thing is still too much).  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume right now, by far, and I am stunned that I was able to pick it up so inexpensively!  </li>
      <li>Unique sprayer on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s has a floral/fresh clean smell.</li>
      <li>Strong scent for work and feel like fresh confidence.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just not for those of us that really work better with organic,</li>
      <li>It was so cool</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>This is light and fresh, with distinct floral notes and a hint of citrus.  </li>
      <li>Great as a gift, compares well with other luxury brands!</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>Funny, Amazon had no problem selling it to me &amp; it sat on my porch in THE HEAT when it was delivered!</li>
      <li>but overall it is a nice perfume</li>
      <li>It is soft and feminine, and she has gotten many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>Enjoying the product very much so far.</li>
      <li>I know this fragrance works well with most, as it smells like most every other department store fragrance...</li>
      <li>I love the scent, one of my daily scents.</li>
      <li>It was a day or so later than what it said, but everything was beautifully packaged, and carefully wrapped.</li>
      <li>Mine smells exactly like the sample card from Kohls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the same even though it is pleasant and it does not last .</li>
      <li>I love Fabulous the first time I purchased it I used the pretty little pump</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I love its classic styling that is reminiscent of the &#x27;70s style of watches.</li>
      <li>very soft &amp; pretty!</li>
      <li>For me it was not young, crisp, clean, flowery or fresh.  </li>
      <li>I really like the price</li>

      <li>The scent stays on the whole afternoon, I will be purchasing the body lotion soon.  </li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is really a knock off or what , but I would not buy it again .â€‹</li>
      <li>My real problem is with the atomizer.  </li>
      <li>Classy and pretty bottle for any place you put your perfumes.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have the best staying power, but that&#x27;s normal for lighter fragrances such as this.</li>
      <li>less is more ingredients.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful, clean springy scent.</li>
    <li> very nice fragrance but it doesnt last long!  very soft &amp; pretty! it would be alot nicer if the smell lasted longer but it doesnt</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing - I&#x27;m not sure if the manufacturer tampered with the formula, if it&#x27;s watered down, etc. because I work at Kohl&#x27;s and I spray some on everyday! I absolutely love the scent and it lasts ALL DAY! I even go to bed after a 12 hour day and my arm still smells lovely...:)&lt;br /&gt;If you check QVC this is priced alot higher, as is in Kohl&#x27;s and other dept. stores. I would not recommend purchasing from here. The low price is very deceiving and sounds sketchy to me.</li>
    <li> It is not the same as in the picture</li>
    <li> If you are the gal who is very picky about what scent you wear, and only a few select fragrances seem to work with your body chemistry,then this fragrance is not for you.  If you walk through a department store smelling all the \\&quot;new\\&quot; fragrances hoping to find one that works for you and they all seem to have the same smell that doesn&#x27;t mix well with your body, then you are like me and please don&#x27;t go to the trouble of even trying this fragrance.  It smells like every other \\&quot;just not right on me\\&quot; perfume.  For me it was not young, crisp, clean, flowery or fresh.  It was musky and heavy and there was that lingering scent that you just can&#x27;t wait to wash off.  I know this fragrance works well with most, as it smells like most every other department store fragrance...it&#x27;s just not for those of us that really work better with organic, less is more ingredients.</li>
    <li> I wish the name was different for a womeb in her forties this just seems shallow.</li>
    <li> this product is worthless. The scent disappears one minute after you spray it. I would have returned it, but I had misplaced trust in the manufacturer and already discarded the packaging.</li>
    <li> Smells great but the atomizer isn&#x27;t really working for me. Is anyone else having this problem or is it just me</li>
    <li> Not at all like the original scent-very disappointing.  Would definitely not recommend this item and will not re-order.  I knew such a great price on such a great product was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> I was very delighted with how quickly I received my fragrance. I really like the price and my fragrance arrived in good condition also.i highly recommend this website anyone shopping for fragrance s.</li>
    <li> Smell very good and I love it</li>
    <li> Just to clarify..i didnt buy this on Amazon . .I got it from  Marshalls the scent is wonderful,  however ..like most have stated the atomizer is horrible and has broken , i cant even use it.</li>
    <li> I sampled this in a dept store and loved it, but it was quite expensive . So when I saw it here for less , I was all excited to get it , but it just isn&#x27;t the same . It doesn&#x27;t smell the same even though it is pleasant and it does not last . I don&#x27;t know if this is really a knock off or what , but I would not buy it again .â€‹</li>
    <li> This was as fabulous as the name.....in perfect condition, boxed beautifully, love the scent I recommend I buy another one for future use....yes  was we we........Fabulous!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the scent, one of my daily scents. However, the bottle design is terrible. The lid comes unglued and is difficult to work (you have to twist the lid to open or close it), and now mine is leaking, over half of my perfume bottle had leaked into my bathroom counter. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Super happy with this purchase and love the scent.  The quantity for the cost was also excellent.  Totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and very soft.  Great for wearing to the office.  I feel as if I stole this for the price and how good it smells.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> This perfume does not come with the atomizer, which many complained of having trouble using. The scent is delicious and long-lasting - highly recommend this seller!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Very light and elegant.  Unique sprayer on the bottle.  I wear it day or night.  Love the scent.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this for a gift and I am sure glad she did!  Great price and a great fragrence.  The size is large and will last a while.</li>
    <li> I am enchanted with this fragrance. It has me captivated, it truly makes me feel fabulous.  I have also received compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
    <li> It is broken. unusable, I want to send it back. I dont want to pay for something I cant use&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I get compliments every time I wear this cologne.  I love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> Atomizer is hard to understand and .Atomizer Instructions  [...]</li>
    <li> Love this! I got a sniff card sample of this over a year ago.  I didn&#x27;t buy any because of the cost, but I kept the card (mostly to remember the name) and would sniff it every time I came across it.  I finally decided to indulge myself for the holiday.  I was so happy to find this on amazon at twice as much for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to most perfumes, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I think you should smell a purfume before you buy it, if possible, and I&#x27;m not good at discribing scents, but this is a light delicate floral, very clean smelling.  It has staying power without being overly potent (unless you put too much on, and too much of a good thing is still too much).  Mine smells exactly like the sample card from Kohls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine did not come with the bulb spray, which is okay. I prefer it without.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells, very beautiful but not overpowering. It is soft, almost powdery. It does not give me a headache like some perfumes do</li>
    <li> This perfume was nothing less than I expected.  The fragrance is truly as the name implies, FABULOUS!  The scent stays on the whole afternoon, I will be purchasing the body lotion soon.  Thank you Amazon for the addition to my collection!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  It smells good.  So, I&#x27;m a good guy.  What more do you want?  Go ahead, get some for your honey too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume right now, by far, and I am stunned that I was able to pick it up so inexpensively!  I half expected it to be a knock off when it arrived or damaged in someway.  Nope.  Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased a small roll-on at Marshalls for $5 and I just fell in love with the fragrance.  So I went to my favorite place (Amazon) and ordered a larger size of the same fragrance.  Well, IMO this new purchase is not the same.  It has a high alcohol smell and the fragrance itself is weak and does not last very long.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as scheduled in a brand new, unopened box. Quality scent, not a knock-off. Very pleased with purchased.</li>
    <li> The scent of the perfume is really nice.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it is pleasant.  My real problem is with the atomizer.  It simply doesn&#x27;t work.  Mine is broken and and now perfume literally leaks out of the bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t mist properly and instead perfume shoots out of it like a water cannon, ruining a wall of mine. I have tried to contact the company numerous times but no one has bothered to get back to me.  I would give this 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t have the atomizer.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It has a great soft smell. In addition to that the price was awesome. I will be sure to buy more for my perfume collection.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is light and fresh, with distinct floral notes and a hint of citrus.  I love the old-school glam vaporizer bottle, too.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it after daily use for a couple months now.  It does take several squeezes to start spraying, but that&#x27;s no big deal.  I like how it comes out as a finer mist than traditional bottles.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have the best staying power, but that&#x27;s normal for lighter fragrances such as this.</li>
    <li> This fragance truly represents its name... it is Fabulous!!!!!  I got a sample in the store in New York but, silly me, did not get it.  Then I realized that I simply needed it...</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful company! It was a day or so later than what it said, but everything was beautifully packaged, and carefully wrapped. They sent 3 samples for other perfumes, coupons, coupon codes, and a little compact mirror! It was so cool seeing what all they sent! 10/10!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite fragrance. I received a sample and was addicted. I agree with other reviewers that it does not last all day but I carry a small pocket atomizer and that &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; does the trick. The atomizer on the bottle is fine and produces a light mist plus it just looks cute. Enjoying the product very much so far.</li>
    <li> I got the fake one.... Disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I smelled a sample of this fragrance and I love it. I ordered it!! Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a finite life  accessory.This watch is built like a tank. Many reviewers have attested to its durability, dependability, and aesthetics and after having owned mine for less than a month I too can attest to this. It&#x27;s even slipped off my wrist  fell to the tile floor only to be picked up and put back on without incidence. I love its classic styling that is reminiscent of the &#x27;70s style of watches. In fact, the first Seiko 5 was introduced in the &#x27;60s with little to no change in its design and looks. Since I got this watch it&#x27;s been the only jewelry I wear. And with its reputation as the most reliable battery-free watch I can rest assured I will wear this all my life. I&#x27;ve since put all my other watches in storage knowing this is the only one I will ever need.  I love it so much I ordered a second of this exact model just for keepsake. I feel so confident living life with this piece of mind  on my wrist. Finally, a finite accessory.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is a fan of Isaac Mizrahi and wanted to give this fragrance a try.  She loves it!  It is soft and feminine, and she has gotten many compliments on it.  It does have staying power.</li>
    <li> My Wife Loved It!  Will use it very often.</li>
    <li> I love Fabulous the first time I purchased it I used the pretty little pump and it fell apart so I left the regular pump on this time and am liking it much better</li>
    <li> The atomizer on my bottle of perfume IS NOT working! I got on Amazon to SEND BACK my DEFECTIVE product &amp; I am told that I cannot return it because it is FLAMMABLE!!!! Funny, Amazon had no problem selling it to me &amp; it sat on my porch in THE HEAT when it was delivered! Never buying perfume on Amazon EVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> i bought this expecting a classy look of the perfume bottle with atomizer . but got very disappointed when it came. there is no atomizer  it looks very ordinary rather odd with tilted bottle .its is nothing as it looks . we contacted them , and came to know  this don&#x27;t come with an atomizer anymore. so whats the point in keeping the old picture . its very misleading . very disappointed.........</li>
    <li> Subtle enough with one spray as it is a parfum. Strong scent for work and feel like fresh confidence. Classy and pretty bottle for any place you put your perfumes. Great as a gift, compares well with other luxury brands!</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! This smells absolutely FABULOUS ðŸ˜‰ and it is long lasting! It is not too heavy but has a significant scent at the same time. It&#x27;s has a floral/fresh clean smell. Great for any season!  I&#x27;m totally gonna buy it again</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE it and Amazon is as always the BEST, Thanks!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells really nice but the only thing I&#x27;m not happy with is the atomizer....makes it hard to spray at times.  Scent doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like but overall it is a nice perfume</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t stay more than a couple of hours.  However, I use the shower gel and love the fragrance of both so I am okay with the product.</li>
