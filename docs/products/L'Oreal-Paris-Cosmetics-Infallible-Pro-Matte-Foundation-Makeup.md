      <li>I applied the Shell Beige with my fingertips and it was a good match for me in an indoor environment.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;This is called a demo-matte finish, which means that it is perfect for day or night in that it is smooth with no shine, no sparkle, like some moist covers.</li>
      <li>I was eager to try this foundation since I&#x27;ve found that L&#x27;Oreal cosmetics are generally a good brand of drugstore makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She uses the True Match liquid makeup - shell beige C4, and finds the color perfect for her complexion.  </li>
      <li>She found that it looked great for a much longer period of time with no streaking or chalkiness, and as for the demi-matte finish, it was perfect.</li>

      <li>I love this makeup!  </li>

      <li>One of my favorite foundations, if not it is my favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick-dry time, natural look, and all-day &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; is wonderful.</li>
      <li>This makeup covered and smoothed those areas to provide a natural and almost flawless appearance without being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is by far the best foundation I have tried from a drugstore selection.</li>
      <li>Very light feeling on skin (almost like I am not wearing</li>
      <li>Very light feeling on skin (almost like I am not wearing</li>
      <li>It has good coverage, does not sink into fine lines, goes on smooth, dries immediately and invisible.</li>
      <li>What worked though was to just give that area a spot-treatment with a fingertip and a drop more of foundation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I was incredibly pleased with this foundation.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this foundation.</li>
      <li>I would say it&#x27;s medium coverage; you can layer it can get more coverage</li>
      <li>and I prefer a creamier, more moist foundation,</li>
      <li>so I took off one star for that, although for someone with skin that is oily this would be better than for us with drier skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ok with a medium coverage bc</li>
      <li>but many of my products do have sunscreen in them.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I was incredibly pleased with this foundation.  </li>
      <li>I think this had a lot better staying power than most foundations I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would like this product even better if it had some sunscreen</li>
      <li>I love this foundation.</li>
      <li>You can use a makeup sponge to apply this, but I think it works better with your fingers.  </li>
      <li>but I find it more matte than the description says.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m glad this line of foundation includes the word \\&quot;matte\\&quot; in it.</li>
      <li>Its okay as a concealer under my eyes and for the nose, and chin</li>
      <li>I love reviewing L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
      <li>I think I will purchase this in a color that matches better because I do like it.</li>
      <li>I think this had a lot better staying power than most foundations I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product lasts ALL DAY most days.</li>
      <li>, This color is more like an Ivory.  </li>
      <li>What I like most about this is the longevity of the coverage.</li>
      <li>It applies very lightly and easily.</li>
      <li>so it was a pretty good match.  </li>
      <li>For years I have used another product and been happy with it, so I was unwilling to try anything new.</li>
      <li>She was hesitant at first, she&#x27;s been happy with true match......</li>
      <li>There are also many face moisturizers and creams which do contain SPF products that you can use under this foundation, if that is important to you.)</li>
      <li>The color is very neutral and good for my skin tone, unlike some of the others I have tried that are all orange hued.</li>
      <li>Dries really nice, well worth the effort.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Application is a reason easy.</li>
      <li>It does have some oil-control properties, and it washed off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply but you have to apply it very quickly because it sets up almost immediately</li>
      <li>and this does not set in fine lines nor does it oxidize on my skin.</li>
      <li>It feels like skin rather than makeup sitting on top of the skin and it stays looking great ALL day long!</li>
      <li>It also minimized my large pores, kind of giving a blurred effect.</li>
      <li>It feels light on the skin &amp; has good but not heavy coverage.  </li>
      <li>Then I tried it over a silicon based sun screen; it worked just as smoothly and still stayed put</li>
      <li>I got this in Shell Beige, I do have fairly light skin</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s important to have a shade that matches.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and covers everything.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for a drugstore brand</li>
      <li>It runs Light in color</li>
      <li>Nice texture and stays very matte on the skin.</li>
      <li>I believe it is the second color in line, not the very lightest, and it was perfect for my light complexion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the finish of this, but it went on a lot darker than it appeared in the tube. Nice texture and stays very matte on the skin. Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or caked on but good coverage. I usual use Revlon colorstay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a different Maybelline roduct for years now, which I still like very much, but this is my new choice.  It&#x27;s quick-dry time, natural look, and all-day &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have used this foundation only once so far. I used it with the beauty blender sponge. To me, it doesn&#x27;t give you the full coverage look. Maybe a medium coverage. I&#x27;m ok with a medium coverage bc I hardly wear makeup and when I do, I do the &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; look!</li>
    <li> As others have commented, it can be difficult to select a color, as all the colors looks similar in the packaging. I normally wear Shell/Cool Bone in Estee Lauder Double Wear, or a NW 20 in MAC and I went with the color Shell Beige. I feel it&#x27;s a good match for my summer complexion, when I&#x27;m trying to match my face to my fake-tanned body. It is a bit too yellow for me.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product, it goes on smoothly, without settling into my fine lines. It doesn&#x27;t seem splotchy or streaky. It does an average job of making my pores appear smaller and evening out my skin tone. It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage at all for blemishes. I have very oily skin, and I get about 2 hours of wear from this before it begins to turn really oily. As it fades throughout the day it can be a little patchy, but a quick dusting of powder helps hold everything in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a super light foundation (similar in coverage to a tinted moisturizer or sheer BB cream) that works well for the summer when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup but need some evening out of my skintone. The color selection is geared towards darker, yellow skin tones.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite foundation! I have used many different foundations over the years ranging from drugstore to high end. I have always gravitated towards matte finishes since I do get oily in the t-zone and I live in an extremely humid area, south Louisiana. This foundation smoothes on so effortlessly and sets perfectly. It feels like skin rather than makeup sitting on top of the skin and it stays looking great ALL day long! I&#x27;m 40 and this does not set in fine lines nor does it oxidize on my skin. At the end of a long day, it is still looking great. I got this in 107 fresh beige.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation!  A little goes a long way and it lasts until I take it off at night.</li>
    <li> When it comes to makeup, I really need to be hit over the head. So, I&#x27;m glad this line of foundation includes the word \\&quot;matte\\&quot; in it. I always admired the matte finish makeup that young girls have been wearing, but didn&#x27;t know how to achieve it. This is a nice foundation that lasts all day and gives a matte finish. I do use a moisturizer with an SPF under it and finish it with [[ASIN:B00PFCTL3U L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Matte Powder]]. It&#x27;s a great combo that I hope will be available for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup!  Seriously, this is super easy to apply, and the coverage is medium to heavy.  It covers up imperfections evenly and with ease.  Not only that, but it feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing any foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makeup feels thin going on, and it dries quickly.  If you apply it in small sections, using a round motion, it will go on perfectly.  Even though the liquid is thin, it dries thick, but not so thick that it settles heavily into fine lines.  It dries well, without leaving an oily residue on your face.  You can use a makeup sponge to apply this, but I think it works better with your fingers.  The coverage is definitely a medium coverage, and bordering into heavy.  If you have redness or small imperfections in your skin, this will cover that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best drug store foundation I have used.  I usually use [[ASIN:B00DS5ZZUE Tarte Amazonian Clay 12-hour Full Coverage Foundation Broad Spectrum Spf 15 Sunscreen, Fair Beige, 1.7 Oz]] which is heavy coverage.  This stands up to the foundation, and can seriously give it a run for it&#x27;s money, literally.  This foundation is considerably less expensive then high end foundations, yet it works just as well, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if you are looking for a foundation that covers well, dries quickly and leaves you looking like you applied a high end foundation!</li>
    <li> Simply put- WE LOVE THIS FOUNDATION.  A little amount of this product will go very far which is surprising for a product in this price range.  Texture in applying feels perfect. neither too dry or too wet and really rubs in very well, even on the move in a subway.  The pro-matte version of the product has a perfect matte finish that dries a little powdery, but not too much.  The product lasts nearly the whole day and I only experience minor issues in extreme heat/sweat conditions; in my case, a little oily on nose and forehead.</li>
    <li> Nice foundation but I find it more matte than the description says. Good coverage without being too heavy. I am between 2 colors so a larger range would be nice but this is not surprising from a drugstore line. Good overall.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite foundations, if not it is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this foundation. Truly a demi matte finish. Doesn&#x27;t cling to my dry patches. I use moisturizer and exfoliate regularly.</li>
    <li> The wife loves L&#x27;OREAL products!  She uses the True Match liquid makeup - shell beige C4, and finds the color perfect for her complexion.  Now, along comes INFALLIBLE!  She was hesitant at first, she&#x27;s been happy with true match......but, she noticed that it also comes in shell beige, so... it might be interesting to check out any difference!  WELL, there actually is a difference, slight but it&#x27;s there: INFALLIBLE LASTS LONGER!  Both bottles are 1 oz.: TM-glass bottle, INF-plastic tube. INFALLIBLE glides on beautifully with a light silky feel, and coats the skin with a nice even texture.  She found that it looked great for a much longer period of time with no streaking or chalkiness, and as for the demi-matte finish, it was perfect. She is now totally sold on INFALLIBLE!  Her TM finish would get slightly shiny and needed to be refreshed during the day. One thing different - the TM has SPF17 sunscreen, and the INFALLIBLE has no sunscreen listed, but it was not a big concern.  INFALLIBLE will be her new go-to makeup!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. the color was darker than i thought so it good its coming up on summer and i will need to use darker make up. this does not cause my skin to break out, works well with the powder i use, stays on well, does not fill in little lines and make them more visible like some foundations.</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Matte finish. Goes on smoothly. True to color...</li>
    <li> I love reviewing L&#x27;Oreal.  Such good products, and this is no exception.  Infallible definitely applies here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moisturized a clean face with and old favorite L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer - never fails and has SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeeze bottle is very small.  What I found is that somehow, we don&#x27;t need very much to cover an entire area with a semi-matte color (in my case - shell beige) that covers all my age spots and under-eye dark circles.  I look younger immediately.  Airbrushed.  It is a wet substance that dries on the face. Not too dry. It blends, but doesn&#x27;t smear. It stays on all day. If I&#x27;m going to get photographed this is a must. Pro makeup from a drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I like the coverage, and I like my skin to have a youthful translucent glow as well, so I put on a bit of Elf glow powder, circles of blush, before eye make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this over Lancome for this purpose.  Lancome is moist, but covers less.  Lasts less. Smearier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often get makeup in lighter shade because, with the addition of the blush and the cover, I get a fresh look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t think I would think that.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> too light for me :( i want another one</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best drugstore foundations I have ever tried. It has good coverage, does not sink into fine lines, goes on smooth, dries immediately and invisible. It feels as if I am not wearing any foundation at all and looks like it, too. The only downside is that it is a very small tube for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I was a bit leery about trying this foundation because I have very sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t have any chemical sunscreen in it (which is one of the main things I have trouble with) so I thought I would give it a try.  Prior to this I was using Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox BB Cream (which is great for sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin which tends to get greasy in my t-zone (forehead, chin, nose) but gets dry on my cheek area.  I also tend to have some splotchy redness on my cheeks that I use foundation to cover up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation worked very well and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts for me (I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now).  It&#x27;s easy to apply but you have to apply it very quickly because it sets up almost immediately (seriously I have never had a foundation set up this fast for me).  I applied with my fingers in a circular motion; doing one cheek, then the other, then my chin area, nose area, and forehead.  You have to work area by area because it sets up so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was a bit darker once it set than when you applied it; it was also just slightly darker than I expected.  I got this in Shell Beige, I do have fairly light skin so it was a pretty good match.  However, if you have really really pale skin I think you are going to have trouble getting a good match in this foundation.  I have seen a couple users mention a bad odor with this product, I didn&#x27;t notice that.  I actually have allergies and sensitivity to fragrances and never noticed an odor from this foundation...it really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sets to a very matte finish and feels very light on your skin.  I would say it&#x27;s medium coverage; you can layer it can get more coverage but it starts to look a bit powdery if you do that.  I tried it with and without a powder to set it (I was using Revlon&#x27;s Color Stay Pressed Powder); however you really don&#x27;t need a powder at all.  After the first day I just used the foundation and then brushed over some of my Brush on Block Powder Sunscreen (since this foundation doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen in it) and was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays on very well.  For example yesterday I was working in a high humidity room at work for a few hours and then ran to sit in my son&#x27;s very high humidity swimming lessons.  I noticed my face looked a little more glowy by the end of the day, but I didn&#x27;t look greasy or anything.  The only place the makeup really rubbed off was around my nose (I have a bit of a cold and have been blowing my nose a lot).  I think this had a lot better staying power than most foundations I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was incredibly pleased with this foundation.  It&#x27;s probably the best drugstore foundation I have ever used.  I am going to keep using it.  I will probably use my Jart+ Black Label Detox BB Cream when I know I am going to be outside a lot, but I will keep this foundation for everyday use.  The true test for this foundation will be when I start biking outside again in the summer, we&#x27;ll see how it holds up under those conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Quick and easy to apply, sets fast&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;- Very light feeling on skin (almost like I am not wearing makeup)&lt;br /&gt;- Has a very matte, natural look to it&lt;br /&gt;- Very long lasting, holds up in high humidity and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t need to set it with a powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Sets up so fast that you have to work very quickly to blend it well.&lt;br /&gt;- No sunscreenat all.

    <li> I like the matte foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m of Indian origin, my skin is very sensitive, and normal (not oily, not dry).&lt;br /&gt;I have difficulty with most skin care products because I break out with an allergic reaction very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have an allergic reaction to this product. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;The shell beige 102 matches my skin tone. I&#x27;m on the lighter side of Indian, what is typically referred to in Indian matrimonial listings as &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this foundation is matte, and not shiny, it looks almost airbrushed when you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s a pretty professional finish. The look is very natural, just... polished. Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this product again, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> I am convinced that no matter what I buy, be it the 12 dollar or 90 dollar concealer....in the end they never last all day and they will never match my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal infallible, is fallible. Its okay as a concealer under my eyes and for the nose, and chin but as an all over your face one? it just does not stay all day, and the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; gets shiny after a few hours. It also needs to be reapplied after about 7 hours anyway. I found it cakes in the creases of my nose, and out in the sun its obvious I am wearing it.</li>
    <li> The shade I am using is SHELL BEIGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that it is 2nd from the lightest shade I expected this foundation to be close to the color of bone china.  It was in fact too dark for my teen daughter.  Granted it&#x27;s winter and she is blessed with a peaches and cream complexion but I expected the foundation to be a closer match and the Shell Beige made her look like she had a tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen not to have that gorgeous complexion and instead am graced with old-mom skin that is in the pinkish tones.  I applied the Shell Beige with my fingertips and it was a good match for me in an indoor environment.  Normally I apply a light moisturizer before putting on a matte foundation. In the first cases though I didn&#x27;t do that because I wanted to see what the makeup was like all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the best way for me to put it on is with a sponge and fingertips.  I also found that one layer was not enough to cover this one tiny broken capillary I&#x27;ve developed on my cheek this winter.  One layer basically just changed the shade of red of the capillary and didn&#x27;t hide it.  And oddly, two layers was too much.  I&#x27;m a make-up minimalist and two layers frightened me.  It was too cakey thick.  What worked though was to just give that area a spot-treatment with a fingertip and a drop more of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation lasted a long time.  But it&#x27;s winter so there&#x27;s no sweat and humidity to cope with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation is also semi-water proof.  Just using water and a washcloth did not remove it all, which is something I&#x27;ll need to remind my daughter of.  Since my skin is so dry I used Eucerin lotion, a particularly oily version, to remove the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY THOUGHTS&lt;br /&gt;If it were 20 years ago I would buy this foundation.  It goes on easily and lasts longer than any other foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried.  But it&#x27;s actually too matte for my age.  It does not creep into tiny lines or anything, but I feel I look better with more of a dewy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves how long it lasts but I won&#x27;t be buying her this particular L&#x27;Oreal foundation because there&#x27;s no sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**An Exception for both of us would be night time.  Going to a show/opera/concert this would be an excellent choice. The extra matte finish and more excessively made up look wouldn&#x27;t bother me in dimmer light.  And there&#x27;s be no need for SPF.buying her this particular L&#x27;Oreal foundation because there&#x27;s no sun protection.    **An Exception for both of us would be night time.

    <li> I have sensitive skin, rosacea and some sun damage. But in my late 40s, I am blessed with minimal wrinkles and no acne. Because of this, I don&#x27;t need extensive coverage and can use liquid without the foundation settling in deep wrinkles. I have used the Infallible Eyeliner and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is a reason easy. I put it in a sponge and it spread like butter. Coverage is great.  What I like most about this is the longevity of the coverage. I am a teacher and work in Georgia so I can sweat a gallon a day. But this stayed on I washed it off at bedtime. My regular cleanser is Shisiedo Gentle Cleanser and it took this off with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the color matching. It&#x27;s really off. Shell beige, on the picture, looks like a complete match but in reality is lighter. I darkened it with pressed powder.</li>
    <li> GREAT MAKEUP!!!!  Fantastic for a drugstore brand, I have beat up skin sun damage and acne scars.  This gives full coverage The Good news it looks good all day.  The Bad News it dries Really Quick and use less amount than other foundations.  It runs Light in color, This color is more like an Ivory.  I pull down the cover with my fav blush  L&#x27;oreal mineral blush.  Great stuff for combination skin or I am sure good for oily skin.  Dries really nice, well worth the effort.  I use a primer underneath so it really dries quick grabs a hold of skin and stays put all day.  I always finish with a loose powder.  Not really even necessary just my thing.</li>
    <li> This is a full coverage matte foundation which lasts until I remove it. I don&#x27;t feel like I have any makeup on. I would buy a shade or two darker than I usually buy because it went on very light.</li>
    <li> I was eager to try this foundation since I&#x27;ve found that L&#x27;Oreal cosmetics are generally a good brand of drugstore makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is lighter than I had hoped it would be in color.  I have pale neutral beige skin and this actually whitens it some over it&#x27;s usual pasty shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on smoothly with a foundation sponge and it dries very fast and sets into a firm layer that covers well.  It also does a good job of hiding my dark circles.  This is slightly drying and I prefer a creamier, more moist foundation, so I took off one star for that, although for someone with skin that is oily this would be better than for us with drier skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lasts all day and it looks ok, but since I live in a hot humid climate, I dislike wearing layers of moisturizer, then foundation, then concealer.&lt;br /&gt;And since this so so dry, it really does require an undercoat of something moist.  I put this on my bare skin and it seemed to emphasize flaws and even cracked a little when I  smiled,  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this for myself but foundation is such an individual thing, depending on your skin type and I can see that with very oily skin this would be excellent.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect, long-lasting foundation makeup that suits my skin colorning very well. I have in the past not typically used base make-up but decided to try it out for those rare events for which  it might come in handy. Lo and behold, this product met my needs extrmely well. It&#x27;s a perfect color, it is not obstrustive so long as one rubs it in well, and as already noted, it lasts a long while. Finally, I had no allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> This is quite good foundation.  It feels light on the skin &amp; has good but not heavy coverage.  I have an oily t-zone &amp; this lasts all day.  It does not make my skin break out.  This dries very quickly once you put it on, so use a little &amp; work fast. I would not recommend this for people with dry skin; this is for oily/normal skin.  It does run light in color when you first apply it.  But it seems to oxidize &amp; become the true color within 15 minutes or less.  Then it looks great.  Shell Beige has a slightly pink as opposed to yellow cast.  I usually choose an &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; color foundation but this one looks really good on my skin - once it settles in.</li>
    <li> I recently tried another new make-up by Loreal, Liquid Powder, which has a much more liquid consistency than this and is rather runny. The Infallible Matte make-up provides full coverage and just a little bit of product provides it.  It&#x27;s the opposite of the Liquid Powder line. I like this make-up for the coverage but I found the beige a little too light and I have to really blend it to match my skin tone. I think I will purchase this in a color that matches better because I do like it. It&#x27;s a rather heavy make-up that provides a great matte finish where no powder is needed to top it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this because it&#x27;s one of the first inexpensive lines that does provide ample coverage and a tiny bit goes a long way. The colors run light and it&#x27;s heavy so it&#x27;s important to have a shade that matches. This hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs or skin irritation and it provides long lasting results.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve never found a foundation I like, and in my opinion very few women I&#x27;ve met in my life actually look good in foundation.  I tried this foundation not expecting much, and I was right to think so.  It is very thick, and when you have it on it feels like you&#x27;re wearing a thick mask, which I really don&#x27;t like.  In fact, I washed it off a half hour after putting it on because of the mask like feeling.  Because it&#x27;s 24 hour foundation it was a little harder to remove than usual, but honestly it really wasn&#x27;t that bad.  I&#x27;m not sure who would wear makeup for 24 hours without taking it off and reapplying, though.  The dry areas on my face, my cheeks near my nose, chin, and forehead, looked cakey, and it was very obvious that I was wearing foundation, which I really didn&#x27;t care for.  However, I gave it three stars because I think it would be excellent body makeup to cover my scars and body blemishes.  That&#x27;s what I will be using it for.</li>
    <li> I didnt buy this on Amazon, I bought it at CVS in shade 106. This is by far the best foundation I have tried from a drugstore selection. It goes on smooth and covers everything. I have super oily skin, particularly in my Tzone- this foundation gives me the longest breaks between powdering. I hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> Wow...for the price this makeup is a bargain.  I have tried all kinds of expensive brands and this covers the best for me...and it is a bargain.  I use L&#x27;Oreal Magic base first then this makeup then a powder to set it.  I have very oily skin and my makeup can disappear though the day...or turn orangey...but this has real staying power.  I would like this product even better if it had some sunscreen but many of my products do have sunscreen in them.  I have this on a monthly order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite makeup/foundation! For years I have used another product and been happy with it, so I was unwilling to try anything new. Now that product is going off the market and is almost impossible to find, and when I do it is not as good as the original. So I had high hopes when trying this L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte makeup....and it is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is called a demo-matte finish, which means that it is perfect for day or night in that it is smooth with no shine, no sparkle, like some moist covers. This promises 24-hour cover and it does just that. It also says oil-free and it is - so there is no oily breakdown later requiring a clean face and new application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color for mine is 102-shell beige. I believe it is the second color in line, not the very lightest, and it was perfect for my light complexion. Also, the coverage is excellent. I have red cheeks and scars on my face from childhood illnesses and recent cancer preventative treatments, so my skin is blotchy. This makeup covered and smoothed those areas to provide a natural and almost flawless appearance without being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a busy day with application at 6:00 in the morning, and then ten hours later, my makeup looked great. Yep, L&#x27;Oreal Infallible is my new favorite product!</li>
    <li> This is really nice liquid foundation.  The fluidity is somewhere between a liquid and a cream. The color was great (a light beige) and matched my skin tone, perfectly. It provides a nice, even, matte finish. (L&#x27;Oreal states that it is a demi-matte finish, but it did not shine at all when applied and I did not need to apply powder over the foundation.) I would rate the coverage as medium/average (not too heavy and not too light--just right for daytime or nighttime use). I appreciate that there is virtually no scent to this make-up, as I am sensitive to perfumes in face products. The foundation lasted for a full day, I did not need to reapply it at any point. It does have some oil-control properties, and it washed off easily at the end of the day.  One thing to note is that this product does not contain any sunscreen. (And, I do not necessarily believe the lack of a sunscreen is a negative issue, as many people are sensitive/allergic to sun blocks. There are also many face moisturizers and creams which do contain SPF products that you can use under this foundation, if that is important to you.) All in all, I think this is a great foundation with good coverage, at a really great price.</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation so far. It applies very lightly and easily. Once it is on, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on at all.  Not shiny. The color is very neutral and good for my skin tone, unlike some of the others I have tried that are all orange hued. Now if only it made me look 20 years younger we&#x27;d have a real winner. :0)</li>
    <li> I am loving this foundation. I&#x27;ve been using silicon based foundations for years, but even they didn&#x27;t last all day. This product lasts ALL DAY most days. Not only that, but my eye liner, which normally migrates down under my eyes, stayed put- the foundation didn&#x27;t mix with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it first on bare skin. It smoothed out evenly. Then I tried it over a silicon based sun screen; it worked just as smoothly and still stayed put all day- even though I was working hard outside and worked up a sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product covers super well- I have red patches and dark spots and this covered them better than any other foundation I&#x27;ve tried. It still has a natural look, though, not mask like. It also minimized my large pores, kind of giving a blurred effect. It was kind of like taking Photo Shop to my face! The finish is neither matte nor shiny; pretty realistic and natural looking.</li>
    <li> Loreal Infallible Pro-Matte foundation is a great discovery. I have large pores and oily skin and usually need to touch up my foundation once or twice a day depending on what I&#x27;m doing. With the Pro-Matte foundation, I haven&#x27;t felt the need to do any touch ups. It looks good and controls shine all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation is creamy and glides over your skin. It blends well and coverage is excellent. It does not look cakey at all. This particular shade is good for fairer coloring with a pink or neutral undertone. I don&#x27;t believe it would work well for yellow undertones.</li>
