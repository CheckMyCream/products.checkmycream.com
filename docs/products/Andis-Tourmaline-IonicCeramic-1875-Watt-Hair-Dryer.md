<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Never heard of this brand before, but found it in a boutique hotel and was very pleased with so I ordered it from Amazon.  Really reduces drying time which results in smoother hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the hairdryer I needed. It is inexpensive and I think the features are just right. It is simple yet does the job perfectly. There are different heat settings and speeds. It also has a diffuser. For me this is what I needed. I don&#x27;t think spending more would have gotten me a better quality dryer.</li>
    <li> The Andis 75370 does everything it says it will, it is very simple to use and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! I think the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; light is a pretty cool feature too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer based on the reviews and my drugstore bought Conair was dying a slow death.  I have medium length, fine hair.  I basically need a dryer just to dry as I use velcro rollers for shaping and volume, so I&#x27;m not expecting much.  Based on the reviews, I expected a quieter volume; on medium it&#x27;s okay but no different than my drugstore one or others.  On high, it&#x27;s way to loud, annoyingly loud.  On warm temperature, it&#x27;s okay but could be a bit warmer.  On hot temperature, it&#x27;s better but gets a little too hot. (I know I sound like Goldilocks and the 3 Bears).  I like the size of the dryer and it does seem to make my hair smooth (not frizzy) but not sure if the conditioner I switched relates to that as well.  The one thing I&#x27;m clearly disappointed with is the concentrator attachment. It seems like it screws in rather just slips on and either mine does not fit properly or it takes some work to try and make this fit.  I gave up and never use it.  I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 months and will continue to use it until it breaks.  It&#x27;s okay and perhaps better than many but wonder if I could have just went to the drugstore and purchased a comparable one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this blow dryer for about a month now.  It is good for my hair because I have thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp on high.  If you have thick hair I would recommend another Andis hairdryer.  It does leave my hair nice and smooth.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer. I usually go for cheap or easy to travel with hair dryers, but decided to try a fair priced ionic hair dryer to protect my hair. I&#x27;m so glad I did!! This dryer dries my long hair in about 5-7 minutes and leaves it straight and smooth. I hardly have to use my flat irons; which saves my hair even more from heat damage. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Sometimes the smallest things make the biggest difference!</li>
    <li> I got this dryer recenty. The shipping was really fast. The dryer is lighter weight than I thought, I like the 3 heating choices &amp; the cool shot. It is the same size as a standard dryer. I got a good deal with this. I would recommend this dryer to you.</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this hairdryer for my daughter and after seeing the results had to get one for myself.  I have very curly hair that is always frizzy in summer so matter what products you use.  This is the only hairdryer that seems able to dry my hair (in hundred plus degree summer heat and humidity) and keep away the frizz.  Best investment every.</li>
    <li> Previously owned a T-3 which cost $ 200 and lasted 9 months.  This dryer works as well and what a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer now for about 3 - 4 weeks.  Just love the low heat setting - temperature remains comfortably low even when increasing the speed to high.  It is fairly light and quieter than others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I have had the hair dryer for approximately 4 months and it sparked and broke today!  The handle would get hot each time I used it...not sure if it was due to the Ion light, but it would get hot.  Today, the machine sparked and the plastic melted.  Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional comments:  When it worked, the machine wasn&#x27;t too loud; the flow of air was decent; the hot setting could have been hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an update, I wanted to let the readers know that I sent an email to Andis letting them know that the product I bought lasted just over three months. A few days after writing the email, I received a response which said they will be sending me a new dryer. I&#x27;m relieved to know that I do not need to spend additional money returning the broken product and that they are replacing the item without cost.  I&#x27;m hoping that the new dryer lasts for years and that I only experienced an isolated quality issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FURTHER UPDATE 8/23/12....I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THE REPLACEMENT HAIR DRYER FOR A YEAR AND IT&#x27;S WORKING LIKE A CHARM!  And another update  6/9/14...still working like a charm!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom because she needed a new hair dryer and was surprised how light and powerful it is. She said that it wasn&#x27;t as strong as her old one however it dried hair faster or at least the same speed. It has a good sleek design and color. I even found myself using it after a late night shower before bed nowadays. Before this hair dryer, I had no knowledge of the Ion function, did a quick wiki, and was impressed.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works pretty well, it is decent for the price, but not great.  Still leaves my hair fairly frizzy, regardless of what settings I choose.  That said it is not very expensive as far as hair dryers go, so it&#x27;s probably on par for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this hair dryer.  It has alot of power and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Overall the hair dryer is good. However, there are some cons.  The heating material in the hair dryer is not ceramic. It is still coil springs. I saw the description emphasizing it is ceramic, so I bought the hair dryer and expected that it would emit less radiation. But when I received the product and inspected inside of it, I found it is coil spring. So I don&#x27;t quite understand why the description say it is ceramic.  Another con is its concentrator. I think the design of concentrator is poor. It doesn&#x27;t concentrate the air flow.</li>
    <li> Purchased this dryer after reading several positive reviews.  I have thick, curly hair that I dry straight with a paddle brush.  My hair is definitely softer and smoother (I also use a leave in conditioner, glossing gel and heat protecting spray).  This dryer has cut the time it takes to dry my hair from 45 mins. to 25-30 mins. (depending on how damp my hair is when I start)  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because after the first two weeks of using the concentrator tool on a daily basis it no longer fits snug on the dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t come off during use but it does rotate around and I am constantly repositioning it which is a bit annoying.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s \\&quot;lifespan\\&quot;.  For the cost, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase another one if the need arises.</li>
    <li> I bought this relatively expensive model as a daily, \\&quot;workhorse\\&quot; hairdryer.  It worked great for 6 months, and then its GFI plug stopped working completely. During the same purchase, I bought the Andis folding hairdryer model with the retractable cord for travel purposes (at 1/2 the price).  Not only is this model still going strong, but it was a replacement for the same I used 4+ years on a daily basis.  I&#x27;m buying a third folding model for my daughter for Christmas so she stops stealing mine!  LSS, the more expensive model did not pan out in terms of quality in this case. Go for the folding model with the retractable cord.  Just be gentle and try to keep it from twisting when you retract it (slow and easy!), and it will serve you a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Needed a new hair dryer.  Used an Andis at a Ritz Carlton Hotel and was very impressed by drying speed and control.  Love this model - dries well without drying out my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great. I have long thin hair and I am quite happy with the performance of this dryer and its settings. The hot temperature is hot without being too burning, and the high blows just the right amount of air. I actually like using the hair dryer with the concentrator on it and that&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t been able to say about any of the last other models I&#x27;ve owned. I also feel like it dries my hair without leaving it frizzy, but there is only so much I can judge on that since my hair is long, thin, and straight. Overall, very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> This blowdryer dries my hair super quick!! Btw, it is NOT too heavy! I don&#x27;t know what people are saying it&#x27;s so light to me! I have no regrets!</li>
    <li> The drier is GREAT. I don&#x27;t usually review items but this drier is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. For the price ($23.66), it far exceeded my expectations. Although I had never heard of this brand before, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It has very easy to use speed and heat settings, the low setting is just right for my fine hair, but still gets hot at that speed (unlike the Conair I was using). It&#x27;s not heavy, the &#x27;ion&#x27; technology seems to be working.. My hair dries much faster, with less frizz, higher shine and so far with less damage to my hair. Results from this drier don&#x27;t even compare to my previous Conair 255R. Also WAY better than a Bed Head drier I bought a few years back. Buy this one.</li>
    <li> i love it, it gets the job done.  it was inexpensive and jsut as powerful as my other hair dryers.  i recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipment. This is more like a professional hair dryer...not like the hair dryers you find in the big box stores. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I received this hair dryer last week. I am amazed. I have very fine, wispy white hair in the front and on the sides (seems like a lot of new growth). When I&#x27;d leave the hairdressers, it was always \\&quot;tamed\\&quot;, but I could never get it that way at home. Now, it&#x27;s tamed at home, too, even in 100% humidity which we have a lot. It also dries my hair at least twice as fast (it&#x27;s very thick in the back with a lot of still coarse auburn hair). The finished product is a smooth, shiny head of mid-neck length hair that can last for days (at least the three I went last week). I never thought there could be a difference, but there is. In my opinion, this Andis 75370 product is an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I have super long fine hair and this didn&#x27;t do it for me. It actually made my hair feel sticky, for lack of a better word. It is much louder than any other dryer I&#x27;ve used and it didn&#x27;t come with the concentrator as advertised... I&#x27;ll be sending it back.</li>
    <li> I have owned this dryer for about 6 months, and it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  It makes my hair so soft, silky, and bouncy--just like when I get my hair done at the Dominican salons with a blow out.  I have very thick, course, Afro-American hair, and I&#x27;ve always hated blow drying my hair.  It always turned out very dry and brittle--until I used this dryer (or went to the salon).  I found it at Target for under $25, and it&#x27;s definitely one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.      I have even tried a few other ionic-tourmaline ceramic dryers, but this one did my hair so much nicer.</li>
    <li> This is a cadillac of a hair dryer. It handles more than your basic drying needs. It is reasonably priced and is made by a quality manufacturer.  It more than meets my needs by having multiple blower speeds, heat selections and a dryer adapter. The cord is flexible, long enough and doesn&#x27;t easily tangle (bind up while using it). All features work well. In addtion, it is realitively quiet and the unit feels sturdy in the hand. Further, I have yet to experience my hair getting inadvertantly pulled into the dryer (I have long, straight hair).</li>
    <li> Very good, love the ionic feature - it dries your hair fast and prevents frizziness. Also a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the handle can be difficult to grab without hitting the switches. There is one relatively small opening in between the two switches (temperature switch &amp; power switch) for one finger to grasp. Sometimes results in accidentally hitting the switches. But other than that it is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not any sort of hair &#x27;pro&#x27; but I&#x27;ve got pretty thick hair and have used hair dryers that suck in the past.  The one works great.</li>
    <li> I bought the dryer to dry my pets after washing them. It works well, dries quickly, has the ceramic heating element and and ion drying feature as the more expensive models. Durabilty is another variable that I can&#x27;t access.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair so drying my hair is always a pain.  My old dryer was dying, so I was on the lookout for a new one.  I purchased this one when it was on sale.  It is great! I noticed the difference right away! It dries my hair quickly.  There is an ion button that is supposed to make it shinier too.  It also came with quite a few attachments which are nice.  This was a pretty good hair dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> I am seriously impressed. Next to laundry, blow drying my hair is my least favorite thing to do.  I was looking for something that would blow dry my hair fast.  I have very fine hair, longer than shoulder length. The first day I used this blow dryer I had it on medium heat and it took 10 minutes. That is how long my old blow dryer took, but my hair looked much healthier than with other blow dryers. The next day I used it, I set it to hot and it took only 5 minutes!  It still looked great, just as healthy!  My hair is always breaking and when I blow dry, normally the damage is very apparent.  With this blow dryer my hair looks smooth and shiny!  I love this blow dryer.  I highly recommended it!!</li>
    <li> I happened to be on a business trip and stayed at a Ritz-Carlton in Venice, Florida.  They had an Andis Ionic/Ceramic hair dryer in our guest room, so I tried it out.  I liked the design, the heat settings, and the way I was able to style my hair with it.  I decided to see if I could find one when I got back home.  I looked at several stores and online.  I found Amazon had the best price, so I ordered one, and have been very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My hair is very long which usually takes a long time to dry, but with this dryer it has cut my time in half. The ionic light is a nice feature but when drying my bands I cover the light so it does not shine in my eyes which is the only negative thing I can say about this dryer. Andis is a great product and I would highly recommend buying this dryer. I have purchased Andis products in the past and they are very durable and the company stands by their product which is nice to see these days.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best dryers I have ever owned. Don&#x27;t really see the need for the blue light, but it is not a problem. Love the varying heat and speed settings. Dry hair quickly without getting too hot and I love that it is ionic, which helps smooth out my naturally curly hair. I can do my hair curly with the diffuser if wanted also. Love this product and the price was very affordable!</li>
    <li> I am so glad my other dryer bit the dust! This Dryer is the nicest one I have ever owned, It dries my hair quickly without blowing like a tornado and my hair is a whole lot less frizzy!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Powerful dryer.  Only used it two days so far, but seems to have cut my drying time.  Lighter weight than my old one.  Overall would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  It works great, gets nice and hot and it can be cooled down too, if needed.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for not even three months. The dryer starts and stops on its own when it&#x27;s on the low setting and smells like it&#x27;s going to catch on fire when I have it on high. I would really like to have it replaced because I do not want my hair to catch on fire.</li>
    <li> I love the hair dryer. Dries hair fast only thing I do not like is that the cord gets twisted and I have to fix it before I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair dryer. I was skeptical of it&#x27;s ability because it isn&#x27;t as strong as other ones that I have used. This works extremely well. It actually dries your hair in probably half the time as my last hair dryer. It has a great price also.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple - this is a great hair dryer.  I have my cosmetology license and have bought very expensive dryers in the past, with the same results as I&#x27;ve gotten with (this) Andis&#x27; moderately priced version.  I will seek out this brand without hesitation in the future.</li>
    <li> This dryer arrived very quickly and I am impressed with the results: indeed, drying is quicker and the frizz control is great.  Switches are easy to use and the dryer is reasonably light.  Great value!</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. It might have cost a little more but it was worth it. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and it&#x27;s great. Dry time is pretty fast, I have moderately thick hair past my shoulders, and I&#x27;m all dry and flat ironed in about half an hour. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is my second Andis hair dryer.  I had the first one over six years but it was starting to wear out.  I wanted to stay with this brand and this one is even better.  Lightweight and easy to hold.  I like the three heat settings which the older one did not have.  More important, styling is better and my hair really does feel silkier and looks shinier.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for about six months. I like the diffuser it comes with along with the different temperature options and high/medium. It does help my hair look and feel smooth and healthy. Cons: the blue light is SO annoying and bright. What is the point of it?? Also, the hair dryer is not quiet like other Andis I have owned; and about half the time when I turn the speed to \\&quot;Low\\&quot; it varies the whole time its on, switching from high to low, high to low, back and forth (not the switch, just the speed of the air). Very odd.</li>
    <li> I was really glad I bought this hair dryer (Andis 75370 Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic 1875 Watt Hair Dryer)&lt;br /&gt;I have actually changed my hair style with this and have only gotten compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People think I spent a fortune on my hair and had it colored and cut. No, I just bought a New hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;and it makes my hair so smooth with less flyways. I have natural curly hair and this is the first time I have gotten it to go Straight and look Great. I&#x27;m a HAPPY CAMPER :)</li>
    <li> There is a big difference in my hair using an ionic/ceramic dryer. I would give this one 5 stars except for 1 thing. A blue light goes on when using the ions. Shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal - however, it&#x27;s right in your eyes as you dry.</li>
    <li> i used this for the first time today and it definitely dried my hair faster than my old one. i have never owned a ceramic ionic hair dryer before and there does seem to be a difference. it didn&#x27;t get as hot as my old one...the old one used to feel like it was burning my scalp or neck or hands, this one dries the hair faster without getting as hot! it&#x27;s lightweight and did a solid job. the true test will be when i dry my daughters very long, very coarse hair!</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dryer. I bought this one because of the different temperature adjustments that are available and also because it comes with a comb attachment as well as a diffuser. I use the warm/high setting and it works perfect. I absolutely love it. It is not that loud either, my other blow dryer is louder and doesn&#x27;t have any temp settings like this one so my hair was getting scorched. I love this blow dryer and I am glad that I decided to purchase this one despite some people having issues with this. The comb attachment has not come off, it is on there pretty tight and you really have to pull hard for it to come off, a good thing. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife to use.  It has a lot of settings including something called &amp;#34;Ionic bombardment&amp;#34; or some such nonsense that she never uses.  Works fine so far.  The only complaint - the attachments that clamp on to it are cheap garbage, cannot withstand the heat, and will crack.  The hair dryer itself works great.  Not sure what that means when the attachments are useless, I guess for the money tere are worse hair dryers.  (I am a guy, I dont have long hair, so i don&#x27;t know anything about hair dryers except, buy a spare attachments for this one if you are going to get it.)</li>
    <li> excellent product we got as a gift. She loves it. It was just what she wanted. It works really well.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for a year now and I love how quickly it dries my hair.  It also gives my fine hair more volume.  When I travel and use a hotel hair dryer, I can really tell the difference and miss my hair dryer!  It has a 5 foot cord and several drying options.  My only minor negative is where the buttons are located, I sometimes hit them when I grab the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Mine malfunctions. A lot of times when I turn it on to low, it comes on on high and after a few seconds switches to low.</li>
    <li> I have more frizz than before and that was the point of buying the product.  Very unhappy. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Wow...I guess ceramic does make a difference.  I&#x27;m typically one to buy a cheaper dryer off the shelf at the local big box store.  This is a great buy!!!  It does dry my daughters hair faster AND a welcome surprise was the comb attachment.  Hooks right onto the end of dryer and let&#x27;s you lift the hair off the head while drying!  Perfect!  I want to order another for the lake house!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dry 2 years ago and it&#x27;s still holding up. I love the settings on it. I would absolutely buy another one if it ever plays out. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Andis. When I blow dry my hair in the winter months my hair doesn&#x27;t get the static as I had with other hair drivers I owned in the past.</li>
    <li> My sister loves it, works with no issue, been using it for 2 years</li>
    <li> Heats up really quickly. Not sure if the ionic thing actually works or not, but it dries my hair fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a guy, the black and gold design is nice. Not as embarassing as having a bright pink hair dryer.</li>
    <li> great blow dryer. I have very long hair, this does a great job without pulling any hairs.  I love the adjustable heat settings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for just over a year, and it finally started smoking and sparking so bad, I believe it would have caught on fire if I didn&#x27;t turn it off.  For the last 6months, if not longer,  I&#x27;ve noticed that when I 1st turn it on it smells really hot and the air flow is very low.  But after fiddling with the heat controls and the cool button it will gradually begin to blow at the normal flow.  I&#x27;ve used cheaper blow dryers in the past that I get a minimum of 3-5 yrs out of!!!!  I&#x27;ts the weekend and Andis is closed, but I&#x27;ll attempt to contact them to see if there is anything that they are willing to do, refund/repair or even replace this unit.  Please note that on their website over half of their blow dryers seem to be discontinued, hmm wonder why. I&#x27;ll update my review once I hear, or don&#x27;t hear back from this company.</li>
    <li> not too noisey, great handle with flip switches which make it easy to change settings from low to high or hot to warm.&lt;br /&gt;dries hair pretty fast, cuts time by 10mns. nozzle/barrel allows more air flow,</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer we&#x27;ve ever owned and dries my wife and daughters very thick hair in half the time. Price was very reasonable in my opinion. Have had ours for over a year and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This item works well, seems sturdy, is attractive, and was priced right.  Hopefully, it will last!</li>
    <li> I needed a hair dryer at my son&#x27;s home in California and since I had an earlier model that worked just fine - I ordered this to have while on vacation.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair dryer for about 7 years, and it finally pooped out after daily use. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune for a new dryer so I looked up reviews here on Amazon and the Andis Ionic popped up as one of the higher rated dryers and at a good price too. I have had it a little over 1 month and I love it. The cool, warm and hot settings are handy, and I especially love the cool blast setting. It is not a loud dryer. In fact, it is the quietest one I have owned. It doesn&#x27;t sound like a jet engine next to your head, which is nice! It has both low and high settings too. It is on the larger side, but not heavy and it has a removable air screen, so you can clean out any hair and lint build up.  All in all, I love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is wonderful!  I have super thin, long hair &amp; it gave my hair such life! So much volume, it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair and has multiple options for you to choose from.  A+</li>
    <li> My daughter got tourmaline hairdryer and I loved it so much I had to buy one for myself. Great dryer!!</li>
    <li> This is the nicest blow dryer I have ever had and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced. I am really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had never owned a blow drier before and this was one of the best purchases ever. The delivery was on time, the description both helpful and accurate, the quality of the product flawless, the price was fair. I&#x27;m enjoying the product a lot.</li>
    <li> Really good hair dryer. I have had many but this one is the best. I love how light weight it is and where the cool button is. The heating power is strong but it really works great. I would highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  It dries my hair quickly, leaves a smooth finish on my hair, and doesn&#x27;t do it with excessive heat.  I heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this hairdryer after my previous one started to sound like a dying cat and was extremely hot to touch after use.  After a week and a half I love this new one!!!  I greatly enjoy that I can dry my hair on cool and high, with the temperature choices of cool, med and hot, as well as low and high speed settings, and cool shot to set.  It&#x27;s light weight and efficient - I&#x27;d buy it again easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this item, based on the reviews, and the style of it, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. It dries my hair quickly, and easily. It&#x27;s not too heavy or noisy. I think it&#x27;s just the perfect hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I never give 5 star reviews. I just got this blow dryer but LOVE IT so far. It isn&#x27;t too heavy to use. The buttons are in an area where you won&#x27;t accidentally turn it off or turn it down. I have had other Ionic dyers in the past both professional and drug store versions. This dryer FAR exceeds those. Using my regular product and round brush with this dyrer my course, curly hair gets wonderfully straight and shiny. I almost don&#x27;t even need my straightener after. Thanks Andis for creating a great product and thanks Amazon for the excellent price.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair. This hair dryer is perfect for me, in 10 mins my hair is dry, it&#x27;s not very heavy and have long cord.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001BOFIRO Andis 75370 Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic 1875 Watt Hair Dryer with Concentrator] Dryer does not have enough power.  Can be used in a pinch, but really didn&#x27;t like it.  I&#x27;ll spend more and get a better one.</li>
    <li> I have thick and wavy hair type which frizz easily and takes a long time to blow dry using conventional non ionic hair dryers. When I first started using T3&#x27;s pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I&#x27;m thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros &amp; cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: feels heavy on hand &amp; noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it&#x27;s very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn&#x27;t impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great for those with thick/wavy &amp; coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry. If your hair type is normal &amp; fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.w dry. If your hair type is normal &amp; fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.</li>
    <li> Overall this hairdrier delivers. It dries quick, has different heat settings and a cold shot to set your style. My only complaint is the LED light that turns blue when ionic conditioning is at full strength. I find the light unessessary and annoyingly bright. My solution was to cover the light with electrical tape. I would recomend this drier. It&#x27;s a great brand at a great price just make sure you have electrical tape in the house.</li>
    <li> I am a professional and have tried many dryers. My personal one blew up so I got this one. It&#x27;s not that great. Be prepared to dry your hair for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I wish the fan output was stronger. I have very fine straight long hair and it just doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as my old hair dryer did. All this new stuff they say is better and faster for drying one&#x27;s hair is BS. Just give me strong fans on my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is fairly light weight but also powerful. It&#x27;s not the most powerful dryer out there but it works good for me. It feels durable and seems like it will last a long time. I&#x27;ve had it about a month now and have had no problems so far. I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair so blow drying has always been a tedious task for me. After my normal dryer croaked I bought this product after reading the seemingly good reviews on it. I must say - the dryer dried my hair a little faster than a normal dryer, but most importantly my hair looked GREAT afterwards! I have been a religious straightener.. and ALWAYS had to straighten my hair after drying, but not this time.. my hair was STRAIGHT, HEALTHIER LOOKING and SMOOTH. This will save my hair from a lot of damage now that I no longer will need to straighten it, Great product - great price!</li>
    <li> weight is good and the air preassure is great too!  One small thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the button location for the temp.  My fingers wrap around that part of the handle and they hit that button and change the temp.  I would buy again though....</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  Very reasonable price.  Love the ionic feature and the attachments, especially the combs are great for quick drying and volume.</li>
    <li> nothing special.. it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair faster or better. But it works fine-- Iand the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer dries fast and it is easy to use because it is lightweight. I carry the dryer in my gym bag, and even though it doesn&#x27;t fold down, the light weight makes it so i don&#x27;t mind. There are several settings, which are convenient too. I still have frizz after my hair is dry, but I use a flat iron to fix that.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this hair dryer to replace a very old hair dryer, which I&#x27;d had for a decade or two. What an improvement! My hair is rather long &amp; holds water like a sponge, but this dryer dries my hair fairly quickly. It also seems much more gentle to my hair, even on high heat (which doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my old dryer). After drying, my hair is nice and soft and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t feel dried-out or over-processed or splitty, as it usually did with my old dryer. My only (minor) complaint is that it is larger than my old dryer was--it barely fits in the space I have for it. Overall I am pleased with this dryer and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> nothing special here...it&#x27;s like any other blowdryer...doesn&#x27;t take me any less time than with say a revlon or conair, etc.</li>
    <li> Very fair price.. performs as described.. by comparison quiet.. &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34;  stops hair burning.  my wife would highly recommend to any woman that cares about her hair condition</li>
    <li> I noticed an immediate difference in the texture of my hair after purchasing this hair dryer.  It took less time to dry, and it was much smoother, which was great because I have very thick hair.  The size and weight are fine.  I agree with other reviewers that the blue light is weird, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal--you could cover it with electrical tape if it really drove you nuts.  I&#x27;ve had the hair dryer for a few months and have no complaints--it&#x27;s been a great addition to my hair care arsenal.</li>
    <li> When I got this hair dryer nine months ago, I thought it was wonderful.  It worked well and I liked the two fan speeds and the choice of heat settings.  Here it is just nine months later and it no longer works.  The switch is broken and the dryer speed stays on high even though the switch is set for the low speed.  In addition, the ionic setting does not work even though the blue light is on.  My hair was dry and fly away from static electricity- not suppose to happen with the ionic setting.  The hot was too hot and was drying out my hair.  I would not waste my money on this.  I have had better luck with a Conair hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair dryer - I never really thought there was much difference between the various kinds until now! My hair, which is thick, drys super quick and this dryer eliminates all the frizz - amazing :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything but good about this hair dryer from my daughter. I can&#x27;t rate it for all the specs or claims that the manufacturer makes, but, if she loves it, I love it!</li>
    <li> Good blow dryer. Does take longer to dry my hair, but I have less frizz with this blow dryer. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have had this blow dryer since Christmas and yesterday, it died for no reason. I really liked it until that happened and now I can&#x27;t even return the item, because the refund time period has expired. Very very poor business.....never again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife who has very thick and long hair.  Her old dryer took upwards of 10 minutes to dry her hair, this one takes about 5-6 minutes.  She claims she doesn&#x27;t have to use conditioner all the time either because the dryer actually makes her hair soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancee and she states it dries your hair as specified and it is speedy in doing it. But you need heat to style hair sometimes and it just doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
    <li> what can I say, it&#x27;s a freaking hair dryer. My daughter is happy with it and I liked the price so it&#x27;s a win, win</li>
    <li> I like the hair dryer over all, but there is a small bright blue light that shines in my eyes when i face the dryer to the front of my head.  it&#x27;s very annoying, but if i keep my finger over the light, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I have received this product today and used it. This blower makes my hair more manageable, and dried it faster too. I have a thick hair, and although my old blower is not really old (3-4 years old) but it makes my hair  frizzy after I use it. After reading the reviews, I said that I will give it a try, and I am happy that I did. I like this product and I recommended it.   p.s. I also read in some of the reviews that they died after several months so for now I am giving it 5 stars and I will update my review if it breaks since I just used it once.</li>
    <li> I got this dryer to replace my old one and wow does it make a difference.  My hair is so soft and shiny. I can even use this to dry my 1 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and I couldn&#x27;t to that with my old one because it would get too hot even on the lower setting. It dries fast without burning.  Definitely worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought a new hair dryer in years, so \\&quot;tourmaline,\\&quot; \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; really meant nothing to me. Once it arrived, I found that it really does dry hair more quickly &amp; leaves hair smoother &amp; softer, so I guess all of the technology makes a difference! It is not too heavy to hold for the length of time it takes to dry my shoulder length hair, &amp; the sound is pretty reasonable too - especially considering how quickly it gets the job done. 2 drying speeds &amp; 3 heat settings plus a cool button gives it as much versatility as I could ever need in a hair dryer. It also has a nice long cord with a safety plug (reset button so as not to overload a circuit). It came in it&#x27;s new original packaging &amp; arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> I find that this hair dryer is just what I needed. And I have used it for a few weeks now. (Daily) It has multiple settings that make it easy to use. It dries my hair much faster than other dryers I have used.</li>
    <li> What a huge difference this dryer has made on my hair with only using it one time!! My hair has no more frizz!! I&#x27;m so happy :-)</li>
    <li> Images representing the product clearly displayed the product features. Specifications and description provided en0ugh information to make a decision. Received the product in a perfect retail package as expected. As the result, I am very pleased with the dryer. I recommend it and the vendor..</li>
    <li> I love the fact thats its quite reasonably priced. Been using since the day I got it n it works great. The heat settings are perfect n dries my hair in 10min everyday. I shampoo my hair (short in length) everyday so I use this one everyday too but its quite gentle n never burnt me, not even once.</li>
    <li> Like many, this was purchased because of the experience I have had with Andis clippers.  They have lasted 7 years plus.  This was great, at first.  After a few months use the power started gradually getting lower and lower.  Now it barely produces enough air to blow a tissue.  It is less than a year old so I contacted Andis about sending it in for repair.  I have yet to hear back.  Their website points you to the repair facilities in your area.  One problem, they only service Andis clipper products.  It makes me doubt whether Andis even makes these or just slaps their name on it.  If I don&#x27;t get a response from Andis, I will take this apart and see if there is another manufacturers name inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-Still no response, so I called again.  I was told they do not service hair dryers, they simply replace them.  So I am returning it, at my cost, for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Update-Received my NEW replacement.  FYI, use a flat rate USPS bubble envelope and shipping will only cost $5.</li>
    <li> Like this as well as the one I had before.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer.  It&#x27;s pretty loud as far as hair dryers go and I like that it has three different heat levels but I find that warm isn&#x27;t warm enough but hot is pretty darn hot.  So hot I can&#x27;t use it when I dry my childrens&#x27; hair.  I use it myself but worry that much heat could be damaging my hair.  Cool shot works well and it&#x27;s a good weight for a dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER:  I have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years and I always noticed that the handle was warm.  Well, this morning, it sparked and caught fire.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m less than happy.  I&#x27;ve had plenty of other hair dryers that have lasted for many years and even when they ended up breaking, they just stopped working as opposed to almost causing a fire in my house!!!  This is a huge problem.  I have changed my rating.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRYER!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice and functional hair dryer.  One thing that&#x27;s bothersome, the switch for the blue light.  It turns off whenever I hold on to the dryer.  That means I have to adjust my hold on the dryer.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great blow dryer warranty  for 2 years  but turned out to be the worst burned out within 2 months but customer service was nice sending  a replacement  , hopefully  i will receive</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer! I was hesitant to spend more than $20, but so glad I did! I have naturally curly hair and I notice my hair is way less frizzy! I did not notice it being heavy at all. Seemed same weight as my old blow dryer. The noise is about average. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is quiet, but it&#x27;s not too loud either. About the same as any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This works great. We&#x27;ve had it a few years now and still going strong.</li>
    <li> Working very well for more than 2 years</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this hair dryer.  It is better than even I imagined.  Looked at several at the local beauty supply houses... all with huge price tags.  I am so happy with this one, I can&#x27;t begin to explain.  My hair is not fly-away like it is with my old dryer.  It has plenty of volume and is sleek and shiny.  I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to buy such a quality dryer.  I recommend this highly!</li>
    <li> The biggest problem I have with this dryer is that the blue light shines directly into your eyes while you&#x27;re drying your hair. It&#x27;s lite, does a good job to shine the&lt;br /&gt;hair, but I have to keep my finger over the blue light so it doesn&#x27;t blind me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for more than a year and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well-made and works well... what else can I say? Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She&#x27;s a stylist, so I took a chance that she wouldn&#x27;t like it, but she loved it and replaced her old hairdryer with this one.</li>
    <li> I am extremely finicky about my blowdryer... and I have spend a lot of money trying to get the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one.  Finally, I found it!!  Perfect size, perfect air speeds, perfect controls, LOVE the ionizer light...  I love everything about it.</li>
    <li> I just love my new hair dryer and gets my hair nice and straight without getting to hot. It comes with two attachments and is priced right for me.</li>
    <li> Nice quality feel. Smooth operating switches. Not too garish a color like those bright red Conairs. Unique. Nice. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> It gets nice and hot and doesn&#x27;t blow too hard so it doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair. Agree about the bright blue light, it&#x27;s blinding, but you can get used to looking away from it, not a problem.</li>
    <li> I used to hate drying my hair... I have thick long hair, it took forever.  I am also pretty frugal.  So when my cheap old hair drying stopped working, I bought this. What a difference! My hair dries faster! yeah!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is way too bulky,big, heavy. Makes so much noise that it almost sound like airplane propeller. This is going back.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister, and it was a great buy for the price. A very well made hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Got dryer pretty quick.  my daughter loves it and she has thick long hair.  Satisfied so far with this product</li>
    <li> I have thick and very long hair, and I have used so many different hair dryers in my life. But, none of the past hair dryers compare to this wonderful and efficient hair dryer. Now, I can blow dry my hair in half the time than before I had this hair dryer. I hope this hair dryer is never discontinued!</li>
    <li> I just received this dryer.  My friend who does hair suggested I get an ionic dryer.  I have been using a very cheap dryer for the last few months and could not take it anymore so I got this one (also inexpensive) but so much better!  It&#x27;s quiet and it leaves my hair full and soft.  So far, so good!  I was drawn to this dryer because one, the price, two, it is ionic, and three, I noticed in an earlier review that if it goes out the company will send a replacement.</li>
    <li> I used an Andis 1875 hair dryer in a hotel and loved it but when I ordered it online, I got a different product.  The product I got is an Andis 1875 but it isn&#x27;t the same.  I&#x27;m disappointed in the one I got because it&#x27;s not as powerful as the one at the hotel.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this model. My first one lasted four years and was in great condition right until the very end. Smooths hair without causing frizz; I would fully purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Two year old dryer quit. Exploded inside unit with a bright orange fireball. Cord was melted at handle. Returned to authorised service centre. Andis sent replacement free of charge. They make good on their five year warranty. Now there&#x27;s another warranty with this new one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I shan&#x27;t experience that type of inconvenience (or mind you) danger again. Noticed before dryer&#x27;s demise - cord was hot to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the [[ASIN:B0009XH6TG Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord]] whilst awaiting replacement. Noticed it didn&#x27;t have the heating capabilities as the 75370 has. Glad to have it back!</li>
    <li> Drys my hair quickly. My hair is thick this dryer cuts my time in half. I would recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> It couldn&#x27;t be used in China.:(</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dryer (dried very quickly and felt that my hair was healthier than with my old blow dryer) but broke after 4 months of use.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer solely because of the price and the reviews. It is pretty nice for the most part, but my comb attachment has become weak already. I want to say it became weak on maybe like the 5th use, I am not sure since I was sharing it with my little sister. I myself have only used the dryer about 4 times. I can say though that it was bound to happen because of the way the extensions attach. They could have came up with a a better way of doing that. Other than that I like it, I haven&#x27;t returned it because it still works for the most part. But i would rather attaching not be so weak so that this can be kept for a while.</li>
