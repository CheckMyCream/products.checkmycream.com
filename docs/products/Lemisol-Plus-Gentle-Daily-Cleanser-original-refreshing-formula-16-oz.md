    <li> I love this wash! I tried it for the first time in the Dominican Republic. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the country&#x27;s health regulations I did feel the one from DR was more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.

    <li> That cooling feeling is the best. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product. It does work immediately and you smell fresh. Do not put it inside of you it may cause a bacteria infection.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some years now. It was first suggested by a friend of mine who had be using it. I love it. It is like giving your va-jay-jay a breath mint.  It makes me feel even more confident and fresh. Very hard to find locally because of its popularity.  As soon as it hits the shelves it is sold out, but as long as I can order it from amazon I am a happy girl.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and has a tingling mouth wash feel. It&#x27;s like listening for your vajayjay lol. It&#x27;s cool and fresh. Nice minty fragrance.  Keeps me fresh longer then most feminine washes.  Great product! I recommended it to my sisters and friends already.</li>
