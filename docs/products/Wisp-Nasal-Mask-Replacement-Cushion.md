      <li>My first mask was terribly uncomfortable--when I got the Wisp Nasal Mask, it made a world of difference-this replacement cushion fits perfectly and is not uncomfortable at all.</li>

    <li> Found these for half the price I was paying. Works great!</li>
    <li> Every thing was great. Will order again soon.</li>
    <li> Replacement cushion for a great nasal mask.  This fits my smaller face perfect.  Allows for sleeping in any position.  Only have to switch to a full mask for colds and seasonal allergies.</li>
    <li> It would not fit in the head straps,  could use them.</li>
    <li> Great and cheaper that going to the drug store to purchase.</li>
    <li> Recommend to anyone needing the Wisp Nasal Mask Replacement Cushion!  Turns out I need the petite size (my mistake), but this also worked well.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and received very quickly.  Thanks.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I like these cushions better than any nose or face mask.  No allergic reaction on my skin and no were near my eyes.  Do not forget to purchase the head gear, clips and hose adapter if you do not have them.  I see that some customers do not read just look at the picture when they order.  The price is the lowest that I have found even with using my insurance at medical supply stores.</li>
    <li> The wisp is the best cpap mask &amp; cushions as nice too</li>
    <li> Perfect; just what I needed for my CPAP head gear.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Fits the Wisp and does what it should. I do wish they would add gel to them though.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like I am suffocating. I can wear my glasses with.it though. Still, if you can&#x27;t breathe. Ugh!</li>
    <li> Excellent price and product.</li>
    <li> This item fit my mask on my S9 and feels very comfortable</li>
    <li> I have a small face and nose.  This is the 4th mask I&#x27;ve tried.  Others all leaked because they were too big, or ended up hanging down into my mouth.  This one is perfect.  If you are petite, this is the mask for you!</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT AND A GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get. Product as described.</li>
    <li> The mask is comfortable and has lasted well. And I love the affordable price! I was able to purchase 4 masks for the price of one that I ordered from Respironics.  This mask is the most comfortable style of the four that I tried. The others either irritated my skin or were like wearing a catcher&#x27;s mask.</li>
    <li> Great concept and would be comfortable if it fit. There is no Medium. The middle size called sm/med is a Small. Period. I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t get that and think there are more people who need the petite that&#x27;s included than need a true medium. The petite should be special order like the extra large. The fit pack should be small, medium and large. Respironics seems short on meeting end user needs and comfort.</li>
    <li> This was smaller then what I was use to ,but I like this size better. Good quality Good price</li>
    <li> My first mask was terribly uncomfortable--when I got the Wisp Nasal Mask, it made a world of difference-this replacement cushion fits perfectly and is not uncomfortable at all.</li>
    <li> I appreciate being able to buy just the size I need verses an entire package with 3 sizes in it.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt delivery too.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same as the ones that came with the c-pap machine originally. Except these were a heck of a lot cheaper than anywhere else I looked.</li>
    <li> This get&#x27;s the job done and it&#x27;s way better buying them here than from some of the bigger and more expensive suppliers.</li>
    <li> Good price and service</li>
    <li> Good service.  Prompt delivery and up to date communication.  The mask is as expected and fits my head-gear correctly.</li>
    <li> Great product. Prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and great back up for the one i lost.</li>
