      <li>the difference is in a word amazing.  </li>
      <li>Loving Naturals is not making it at this time.  </li>

      <li>I love love the Loving Naturals Anti Aging Cream  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product --- no nasty chemicals, very pleasant feeling, not heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>And I love my skin...</li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the scent</li>
      <li>It is okay but not a miracle worker or anything.</li>
      <li>Using it for years love it...</li>
      <li>Wanted to prevent more of those from occurring so decided to try this product after reading the reviews.  </li>
      <li>This cream is JUST okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way better than all those perfumy/flowery smelling creams.</li>
      <li>&amp; Health to All! :)</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, yet seems effective.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found my winner. :-)</li>
      <li>I love that this cream doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients and it feels nice and rich on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Most anything natural doesn&#x27;t smell good anyway!</li>
      <li>Its more important</li>
      <li>- the carroty smell that has been referenced in some of the reviews is very mild and dissipates in minutes.  </li>
      <li>so I think it&#x27;s fine to use during the day as well.</li>
      <li>My face feels smooth</li>
      <li>The cream itself went on very well and felt nice, again I could not take the odor.</li>
      <li>Naturals: WELCOME BACK and Thank You SO much for such a fine product!!!!!  </li>
      <li>That being said, I like that it is free of chemicals and has anti-aging oils in it.</li>
      <li>And it provides such a natural, beautiful glow to the face!</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving any residue.</li>
      <li>The reason that I returned this Loving Naturals Anti Aging Cream with Alpha Lipoc and Carrot Seed Oil was, there is a very strong strange odor in this cream that I could not take very well at all.</li>
      <li>This product is very safe as determined by the Environmental Working Groups&#x27;s Skin Deep database.</li>
      <li>I love how natural it is!</li>
      <li>$20 for this quality cream is not expensive!</li>
      <li>I purchased Loving Naturals Anti-Aging Cream because I wanted a more natural daily face moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a cross between licorice and grapefruit.</li>
      <li>but if you have a powerful reaction to odors don&#x27;t buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>I will warn you that the stuff smells gross, like some kind of organic mud - but it is definatly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it does fade away pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>but it goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>This resulted in more fine lines rather that less.  </li>
      <li>This product is all natural and gluten free.</li>
      <li>I never buy any skincare products before first checking Cosmetics Database online, and this product passed.</li>
      <li>, this is the first that I have not had a problem with and in fact makes my skin feel/</li>
      <li>I wish they offered more products, but will definitely be reordering!</li>
      <li>LOVE that it is rated a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website!</li>
      <li>It just feels all around better than any other cream I&#x27;ve used, more natural.</li>
      <li>i have been using this cream on my face for about a month and a half now, and just last night i looked in the mirror real close and realized - my skin looks good!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to never again have to spend hours deciding on/researching a new facial night cream...</li>
      <li>It is very hard to find a good all natural gluten free product for skin that is aging.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of this cream and that it is well rated on the EWG however it does not moisturize my skin very well and leaves my face feeling very dry.  </li>
      <li>I really like this cream</li>
      <li>It also has a better price and availability than other items I checked out.</li>
      <li>This cream may be wonderful but it sure does have a horrible odor.</li>
      <li>The slight smell (no artificial fragrances) goes away quickly.  </li>
      <li>look nice, so I will keep using it, but will still look for something less stinky in the future.</li>
      <li>Found my new face</li>
      <li>This is the first ever face cream that has actually made a visible difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I like the all natural ingredients!</li>
      <li>There is the smell that I was not crazy about but on a positive note the smell does not last long.</li>
      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t get dried out easily at all</li>
      <li>But I can say it may have induced a little bit of acne in its initial use, but I can&#x27;t be sure it was attributable to this.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging or anti-wrinkle effects, as I&#x27;m young.</li>
      <li>Had been using Oil of Olay for years, with what I considered to be great results; but after reading up on commercial moisturizers, I&#x27;m not happy with the \\&quot;back story\\&quot; on Olay.  </li>
      <li>I am sensitive to smells so the smell bothers me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others that say they are all natural</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not heavy or oily</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was too expensive, but realize now that to get a natural product that isn&#x27;t tested on animals, it isn&#x27;t likely to be mass-produced, so will cost more.  </li>
      <li>The milia are slowly working their way out, and I am not developing more - a big plus!  </li>
      <li>I apply a little bit of this cream mixed with one full dropper of [[ASIN:B003MJ7Z0O</li>
      <li>Apparently carrot often makes people break out in rashes.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it&#x27;s actually a night cream.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or make it look shiny at all.</li>
      <li>At first the smell was odd</li>
      <li>Smells a little weird but works great...</li>
      <li>I like it more then a few other anti-aging creams i&#x27;ve tried, but It&#x27;s really not all that moisturizing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this face cream!  The EWG rates it as 0.  It feels silky when you put it on and absorbs nicely.  No waxy, heavy feel like some others I&#x27;ve tried. The slight smell (no artificial fragrances) goes away quickly.  I will continue buying this great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, the scent is natural and not strong at all. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving any residue. I was surprised that it&#x27;s actually a night cream. The directions say to apply at night after cleansing. However, it&#x27;s not heavy or oily so I think it&#x27;s fine to use during the day as well.</li>
    <li> I love love the Loving Naturals Anti Aging Cream  It is truly an amazing cream that does what it says it does,  it erasing time in  your face. It  takes away all the pesky little lines in your face that start showing up in your 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s.  This is my miracle cream and it will be yours when you  try it  This product is all natural and gluten free. It is very hard to find a good all natural gluten free product for skin that is aging.  This is the product to use , you will not be disappointed.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and I have started using this product a month ago the difference is in a word amazing.  the website is [...]</li>
    <li> Ok, so I do like this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t feel over all like a super moisturizer, but my skin looks great and I love that there is something that is anti-aging but isn&#x27;t horrible for me. My biggest complaint though is the smell. I hold my breath when I apply it, yes ... it really is that bad. I&#x27;ve tried others that say they are all natural and I break out (My skin breaks out for A LOT of products, and it&#x27;s not easy for me to find one that works), this is the first that I have not had a problem with and in fact makes my skin feel/look nice, so I will keep using it, but will still look for something less stinky in the future.</li>
    <li> This cream has a nice texture and goes on very smoothly on the skin. My only peeve is that its a little pricey for just 1 oz. That being said, I like that it is free of chemicals and has anti-aging oils in it. Even though it is a cream, my skin does not have a oily feeling after I apply it. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I love how natural it is! I never buy any skincare products before first checking Cosmetics Database online, and this product passed. So I just keep reordering it. However, I am deducting one star because I wish they made a different container with a pump. This would make this product ideal.</li>
    <li> I agree that this cream is stinky. It also caused red scaly patches on my skin. I would like to return it but the company will not respond to my request.</li>
    <li> This product, put on my face just once, gave me a terrible, terrible headache that lasted over 24 hours and is still lingering.&lt;br /&gt;I googled alpha lipoic acid and beta carotene and found that both of these ingredients can cause headaches.  Eighteen bucks down the drain!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on amazon and was drawn to the zero rating - i figured id give it a try.... And i am so glad i did!!! This is the first ever face cream that has actually made a visible difference in my skin. I have tried everything from expensive dept store $100 jars of cream, to drug store brands, to other organics, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Nothing has ever \\&quot;made a difference\\&quot; like this before -  i have been using this cream on my face for about a month and a half now, and just last night i looked in the mirror real close and realized - my skin looks good! i have never had that feeling before. I will warn you that the stuff smells gross, like some kind of organic mud - but it is definatly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints, i will continue to purchase this cream again and again!!!</li>
    <li> I have now ordered this cream about five times. And this is coming from the pickiest person in the world about what I put on my face, after having dealt with a lifetime of skin issues.  I LOVE this product --- no nasty chemicals, very pleasant feeling, not heavy or greasy.  I&#x27;m so glad to never again have to spend hours deciding on/researching a new facial night cream...I&#x27;ve found my winner. :-)</li>
    <li> I had a poor reaction to this and did some further research. Apparently carrot often makes people break out in rashes.</li>
    <li> At first the smell was odd and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would use it. It&#x27;s kind of a cross between licorice and grapefruit. But now I love it! Sometimes I put it on just to smell it. It&#x27;s way better than all those perfumy/flowery smelling creams. And I love my skin...in only a few weeks! It&#x27;s thick, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or make it look shiny at all. It just feels all around better than any other cream I&#x27;ve used, more natural. Found my new face cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do wish it had SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who think it&#x27;s expensive...the cream is so thick, you use very little of it. It will probably last me 6 months+ and I use it almost every day. $20 for this quality cream is not expensive!</li>
    <li> Using it for years love it... I&#x27;m 65 keeps my skin moist...</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace all my skin care and makeup products so they had a 0-2 rating from EWG.org, and found this company that had a 0 rating. I ordered the anti-aging cream, and 2 other products. This cream is excellent. Keeps my very dry skin well hydrated in this frigid WI weather, but is not greasy. I have noticed more of a decrease in fine lines around my eyes in 2 weeks, than in 2 years of using Olay(with nasty ingredients). I wish they offered more products, but will definitely be reordering!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It is getting increasingly difficult to find it.  Loving Naturals is not making it at this time.  Hope it is easier to obtain soon.  It really is great for your skin!</li>
    <li> This product works great! The only con about it is the smell. But it is tolerable and only lasts a few seconds. Most anything natural doesn&#x27;t smell good anyway!</li>
    <li> I purchased Loving Naturals Anti-Aging Cream because I wanted a more natural daily face moisturizer.  Had been using Oil of Olay for years, with what I considered to be great results; but after reading up on commercial moisturizers, I&#x27;m not happy with the \\&quot;back story\\&quot; on Olay.  Plus, I have developed those hard white bumps under the surface of the skin - they are called &#x27;milia&#x27; and seem to be a result of commercial moisturizer use.  Wanted to prevent more of those from occurring so decided to try this product after reading the reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now:  It does absorb well on the skin and isn&#x27;t oily - the carroty smell that has been referenced in some of the reviews is very mild and dissipates in minutes.  The milia are slowly working their way out, and I am not developing more - a big plus!  It does what it is supposed to do - moisturize, and doesn&#x27;t do what it cannot do - make me look younger than I am.  At first I thought it was too expensive, but realize now that to get a natural product that isn&#x27;t tested on animals, it isn&#x27;t likely to be mass-produced, so will cost more.  But it goes a long, long way for the price.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 is that it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> Hello!!!  :) I have sensitive skin and have broken out in pimples in the past from some other face creams.&lt;br /&gt;However, this face cream is is AMAZING!!!!! It has never caused any breakouts..ever!!! And it provides such a natural, beautiful glow to the face! I&#x27;m not in love with the scent but it does fade away pretty quickly. Their body lotion is awesome too!&lt;br /&gt;Loving Naturals: WELCOME BACK and Thank You SO much for such a fine product!!!!!  Will use it forever!&lt;br /&gt;Love &amp; Health to All! :)</li>
    <li> This cream is JUST okay. I like it more then a few other anti-aging creams i&#x27;ve tried, but It&#x27;s really not all that moisturizing. I have combination/oily skin and I have to layer another moisturizer over this one. My skin doesn&#x27;t get dried out easily at all but this stuff is just not all that moisturizing. I haven&#x27;t finished the container yet but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin whatsoever.</li>
    <li> The reason that I returned this Loving Naturals Anti Aging Cream with Alpha Lipoc and Carrot Seed Oil was, there is a very strong strange odor in this cream that I could not take very well at all. The cream itself went on very well and felt nice, again I could not take the odor.</li>
    <li> This product is very safe as determined by the Environmental Working Groups&#x27;s Skin Deep database. It also has a better price and availability than other items I checked out. The company that makes this, tends to keep that standard in all of its products which shows they are careful with what they use and know their stuff. I don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging or anti-wrinkle effects, as I&#x27;m young. But I can say it may have induced a little bit of acne in its initial use, but I can&#x27;t be sure it was attributable to this. It went away after 1-2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. It does not leave your face oily.&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION for USAGE: I usually use it once a day after showering. I apply a little bit of this cream mixed with one full dropper of [[ASIN:B003MJ7Z0O Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.]] and [[ASIN:B007KNAA2S Argan Oil 100% Pure 2 oz.]]. If used just with Hyaluronic Acid, it is not oily, but with Argan Oil, it shows the oiliness for about an hour.</li>
    <li> It is okay but not a miracle worker or anything. I am sensitive to smells so the smell bothers me. There is a lot of the product in the container.</li>
    <li> I love that this cream doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients and it feels nice and rich on my skin.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but it goes away pretty quickly.  Will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> This cream feels great putting it on.  It has a matte finish, so no greasy look!  A little goes a long way!  LOVE that it is rated a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this product a week, I am already a fan!  It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, yet seems effective.  I&#x27;m  not a huge fan of the smell, but I like that I&#x27;m not loading my skin with chemicals every night!</li>
    <li> This cream may be wonderful but it sure does have a horrible odor. My face feels smooth but if you have a powerful reaction to odors don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird but works great... I bought it because of it&#x27;s EWG rating which was zero or one.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this cream and that it is well rated on the EWG however it does not moisturize my skin very well and leaves my face feeling very dry.  This resulted in more fine lines rather that less.  Perhaps I have a sensitivity to one of the ingredients (the carrots?)</li>
    <li> I like the all natural ingredients! There is the smell that I was not crazy about but on a positive note the smell does not last long.</li>
    <li> I like the cream as it does not have a greasy, waxy texture on my face.  It absorbs in nicely.  Once on my skin I can&#x27;t tell I have it on.  The only drawback is the smell.  It has a funky smell when putting it on.  Once on though, I don&#x27;t notice the smell anymore.  That wouldn&#x27;t deter me from purchasing it again though.  Its more important my face doesn&#x27;t shine and have the cream wipe off.</li>
