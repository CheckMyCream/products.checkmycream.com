      <li>/&gt;Lastly, the shipping was amazing.</li>
      <li>Looked amazing with my Halloween costume.</li>
      <li>It definitely is more &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; than the aubergine that it looks more like in the pic, but it&#x27;s still a great wig for the price.</li>
      <li>The style is very easy to wear and I never have a problem with the cap showing.</li>
      <li>Its very easy to brush out and style.</li>
      <li>I just love the purple.</li>

      <li>Cute style for sure.</li>

      <li>Love it~</li>
      <li>I completely love these wigs and wear them out all the time.</li>
      <li>i would of put 99999999+ love it</li>
      <li>I have no doubt that this wig will quickly become one of my favorites! :-)</li>
      <li>Tangles easily and does not brush out well.</li>
      <li>but curly wigs aren&#x27;t my strong suit.</li>
      <li>The shade of dark purple is perfect, though it doesn&#x27;t look quite as bluish purple as it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a huge amount for a wig.</li>
      <li>The curls are lovely and exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>smooth curls, no frizz, and playfully bouncy and full.</li>
      <li>Awsome I love it, this is actually my first time buying a wig</li>
      <li>this one, that is my first one i love  </li>
      <li>The cap is comfortable and breathable, but perhaps most notable is the fact that despite the length being so long, this wig is surprisingly light!</li>
      <li>Every time I wear this out people stop me to say how much they love my hair.</li>
      <li>It is an amazing deep purple, JUST like the picture on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have ordered a few wigs from amazon and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>super fast shipping as well!</li>
      <li>Right out of the bag</li>
      <li>: became really matted quickly...</li>
      <li>Arrived super fast.</li>
      <li>The color is about the same purple as the photo, maybe a bit more so.</li>
      <li>This wig was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>The hair is silky soft, it is not heavy at all, and it feels very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It is long and lovely and curly.</li>
      <li>I have not tried heat styling it, but this was ready to wear straight out of the package and gave me exactly the look I was going for.</li>
      <li>Fast delievery.</li>
      <li>People really thought it was my hair</li>
      <li>After seeing some negative reviews about it being thin/stringy/etc, my expectations were low, but this is a really excellent, natural looking wig.</li>
      <li>This is a much longer wig than I would normally buy.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve got super short hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really rich, dark purple that will look good with almost anything without being too &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;, if you know what I mean.  </li>
      <li>They are heavy so make sure you have wig caps to help them stay on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that it is not a super thick wig, but the coverage is good - it is well made.</li>
      <li>Love the color, but super thin and stringy.</li>
      <li>Pro: flattering color, incredibly soft - people thought it was real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color (deep purple) is a nice dark purple shot through with some black strands, it looks very similar to when I died my real hair purple.</li>

<li> I have a small head so the bangs are quite long on me, but still manageable.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t \\&quot;thin\\&quot; just not full if that makes sense.</li>
<li> The first wig that I had purchased from a different vender was terrible.</li>
<li> For my taste it is a bit thin.</li>

    <li> Awsome I love it, this is actually my first time buying a wig and i love it, i tried my friends from her cosplays and all but i look horrid but this one, that is my first one i love  if this had 50 stars i would of put 99999999+ love it</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and wig. Looked amazing with my Halloween costume. If I need another wig, I will buy from them again. super fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> Awesome color, style, and quality</li>
    <li> Oh my how I love this wig. The color was perfect, the curls amazing and it fit wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It definitely is more &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; than the aubergine that it looks more like in the pic, but it&#x27;s still a great wig for the price.</li>
    <li> The color on this wig is absolutely gorgeous! For my taste it is a bit thin. It isn&#x27;t \\&quot;thin\\&quot; just not full if that makes sense. I think it is due to the length. I bought mainly due to the color. This is a much longer wig than I would normally buy. I have a small head so the bangs are quite long on me, but still manageable. Cute style for sure. Again, the color is amazing! I ordered it in the Deep Purple color.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a few wigs from amazon and this is by far the best. The color (deep purple) is a nice dark purple shot through with some black strands, it looks very similar to when I died my real hair purple. The style is very easy to wear and I never have a problem with the cap showing. Every time I wear this out people stop me to say how much they love my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to add some variety to my headcover choices now that chemo has made me bald, and I have to say that this wig is even nicer than I had hoped it would be! Right out of the bag it is perfect: smooth curls, no frizz, and playfully bouncy and full. The cap is comfortable and breathable, but perhaps most notable is the fact that despite the length being so long, this wig is surprisingly light! And the color is gorgeous! It&#x27;s a really rich, dark purple that will look good with almost anything without being too &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;, if you know what I mean.  I have no doubt that this wig will quickly become one of my favorites! :-)</li>
    <li> My favorite wig that I own! It&#x27;s just how it looks on the picture! People really thought it was my hair lol i love it!! Fast delievery. Comfy. The curls are beautiful. I just love the purple. My friend tells me I look like a anime princess lol i know she is joking but I love it!! 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Im really happy with this wig! I didn&#x27;t want to spend a huge amount for a wig. The first wig that I had purchased from a different vender was terrible. I decided to try one last time. This had exceeded my expectations of quality of a wig for the price range I was after. Its very easy to brush out and style.</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;m too scared of ruining this gorgeous wig to try using heat on it. The shade of dark purple is perfect, though it doesn&#x27;t look quite as bluish purple as it looks in the picture. The curls are lovely and exactly what I wanted. It is slightly longer than I needed, not too long by any means. I could not be more in love with this wig.</li>

    <li> This wig is BEAUTIFUL! It is an amazing deep purple, JUST like the picture on Amazon. It is long and lovely and curly. It is a bit shiny, but that can be fixed, and for the money, it should be expected. This is an absolutely gorgeous wig!</li>
    <li> The color is about the same purple as the photo, maybe a bit more so. It&#x27;s not quite as long, though. I think the model is probably very short; I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4. I have a little trouble keeping it on my head, and I know my head&#x27;s not that big and I&#x27;ve got super short hair. Also, in person it seems flatter/less hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the shipping was amazing. Arrived super fast.</li>
    <li> great wig, awesome color, fits well.</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price!</li>
    <li> I completely love these wigs and wear them out all the time. I have a collection. The purple, blue, red and a white one and I get tons of complements. They are heavy so make sure you have wig caps to help them stay on.</li>
    <li> Love the color, but super thin and stringy. Tangles easily and does not brush out well.</li>
    <li> Pro: flattering color, incredibly soft - people thought it was real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: became really matted quickly...but curly wigs aren&#x27;t my strong suit.</li>
    <li> Love it~ I&#x27;m transgender MTF and I love how this make me feel more feminine :)</li>
