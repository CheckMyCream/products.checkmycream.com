      <li>St. Ives is a better product.</li>
      <li>One of my all-time favorite facial scrubs I like this best of all.</li>
      <li>Many people don&#x27;t understand how to use the product.  </li>
      <li>Anything from this product line is really excellent and is all natural, which is great for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I love that it takes my makeup off as well as keeping my face moisturized while doing it.</li>
      <li>It perfectly exfoliates and cleans at the same time.  </li>
      <li>Most cleansers make me itchy.  </li>
      <li>I wish more stores carried it.</li>
      <li>I really love the scent of the Citrus Cleanser.</li>
      <li>, I love this scrub.</li>
      <li>First the good:  </li>
      <li>Been using this great product for years, and the price beats my local Target.  </li>
      <li>I use this scrub twice a week along with Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Cleanser &amp; the Rose Water Toner.</li>
      <li>It was as described,,,,but wasn&#x27;t excited about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that have done a better job (Lush&#x27;s Mask of Magnaminty is the best).</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t mind at all, since I like sweet smells.</li>
      <li>I facial scrub is amazing as a makeup remover.</li>
      <li>(I think it comes from all the natural oil content of the nuts/ cloves in it), but that makes my face feel healthy.</li>
      <li>This scrub is just okay as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>Also doesn&#x27;t really give you that nice, clean feeling but only time will tell if it works alright.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft afterwards &amp; it has helped with my blackheads tremendously!</li>
      <li>Will be back for more.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product when instead of mixing it with water, I mix it with Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial wash.  </li>
      <li>This used to be my favorite daily scrub until they changed the formula.</li>
      <li>Absolute Must Have Face Scrub!</li>
      <li>Well I had higher hopes for this scrub.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this, following the directions on the package, I wasn&#x27;t in love.  </li>
      <li>This product works really well and keeps your face clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>my skin felt soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I love sweet smells, but this smells mostly like that uncomfortable spice smell you sometimes find in mall stores.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday in the shower and it leaves my skin super smooth!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using, to see if I really notice any improvement.</li>
      <li>Its a very creamy scrub.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent product, but I can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s done much for my skin.  </li>
      <li>my face feels very soft like a baby&#x27;s skin and has a vibrant glow after using it!</li>
      <li>I have normal skin but have areas around the mouth that are somewhat prone to acne.  </li>
      <li>I am so disappointed because Burt&#x27;s Bees products were the best I&#x27;d ever tried on my skin.</li>
      <li>I wish they could reduce these to a micro bead level..then you could work it gently over you face and get a proper scrub....</li>
      <li>Not harsh on my skin at all, and leaves my skin feeling nourished.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and tend to be dry-normal.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of problems with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Even though it is considered a &#x27;scrub&#x27; -- it is gentle enough to be used daily.</li>
      <li>As a first impression, my main disappointment was that it didn&#x27;t smell like pumpkin pie, or sweet potato or basically like anything suggested.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensetive and gets dry quickly when I wash it with other facial scrubs but with Burt&#x27;s it didn&#x27;t ...</li>

<li> It&#x27;s a little too dry to get 5 stars.</li>
<li> The smell is a little sweet-spicy, like pumpkin pie.</li>
<li> I believe it tells you to mix the scrub with a little bit of water.  </li>
<li> Yes you need to add water and it will loosen up and be spreadable on your face..but its messy.  </li>
<li> You can also use the lettuce toner after using this, so it will feel less oily and feel even softer!  </li>
<li> you also have to water it down since it comes in a thick paste.</li>
<li> Scrub is very very thick.  </li>
<li> alas I will have to keep searching.</li>
<li> Really difficult to work with in the shower.  </li>
<li> Terrible and OVER PRICED.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a little too dry to get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I Love Burt&#x27;s Bees! This Citrus scrub works very good. My skin is sensetive and gets dry quickly when I wash it with other facial scrubs but with Burt&#x27;s it didn&#x27;t ...my skin felt soft and clean. another great product from Burt&#x27;s bees!</li>
    <li> I really love the scent of the Citrus Cleanser. It is almost as delicious as the Lemon Poppy Seed Facial Cleanser, also by Burts Bees. This product works really well and keeps your face clear and smooth. Anything from this product line is really excellent and is all natural, which is great for those with sensitive skin.  I recommend this or the Lemon Poppy Seed Cleanser. I also like the Garden Tomato facial soap and toner. That is the best for those of you with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Terrible and OVER PRICED.  Really difficult to work with in the shower.  Too rough.  Smells funky.  Looks funkier.  St. Ives is a better product.</li>
    <li> Its a very creamy scrub.  I have combination skin, and I don&#x27;t need a moisturiser after cleaning my face with the scrub.  It smells great too.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of problems with sensitive skin.  Most cleansers make me itchy.  I love this product!!  It cleans great with a fresh citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Before this amazing scrub, I loathed (and often skipped) washing my face. Now I look forward to it in the morning -- even if the cleanser I use already has exfoliating beads in it. It&#x27;s now a staple in my bathroom. Burt&#x27;s Bees has done it again; this facial scrub is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.  I have normal skin but have areas around the mouth that are somewhat prone to acne.  This scrub is wonderful for keeping skin pores unplugged and leaves skin feeling soft.      NOTE:  Many people don&#x27;t understand how to use the product.  You put a dab of it in the palm of your hand and drop a couple of drops of water on it.  Rub it in the palm of your hand until it thins out a bit, THEN use it on your face.  It&#x27;s wonderful and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and tend to be dry-normal. This scrub scrubs very good... my face feels very soft like a baby&#x27;s skin and has a vibrant glow after using it! The smell is a little sweet-spicy, like pumpkin pie. But I don&#x27;t mind at all, since I like sweet smells. After using it, it does leave some kind of oily feeling (moist) (I think it comes from all the natural oil content of the nuts/ cloves in it), but that makes my face feel healthy. You can also use the lettuce toner after using this, so it will feel less oily and feel even softer!  &lt;br /&gt;It is a little dry, and it does crumble, but I just mix it up with water. I think I will try mixing it with a little honey, or natural liquid soap sometime to make it easier to use.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this scrub.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, but I can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s done much for my skin.  Probably try something different next time.</li>
    <li> This scrub is just okay as far as I can tell. I bought it to cleanse/shrink my pores. I&#x27;ve used other products that have done a better job (Lush&#x27;s Mask of Magnaminty is the best). This scrub is a bit abrasive you also have to water it down since it comes in a thick paste. One time I used it on my foot. It smells nice. So does my foot.</li>
    <li> I facial scrub is amazing as a makeup remover. I love that it takes my makeup off as well as keeping my face moisturized while doing it. Not harsh on my skin at all, and leaves my skin feeling nourished.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite daily scrub until they changed the formula. I have no idea what they changed about it, but the consistency was suddenly way different and it wasn&#x27;t working as well. Then they discontinued it altogether. I am so disappointed because Burt&#x27;s Bees products were the best I&#x27;d ever tried on my skin.</li>
    <li> Well I had higher hopes for this scrub.  First the good:  Smells great.  Citrus and cloves is a great combo.  Now the not so great:  Scrub is very very thick.  Almost a dry paste consistency coming out of the jar.  Yes you need to add water and it will loosen up and be spreadable on your face..but its messy.  Then there is the apricot pieces...these are just too big and coarse.  It feels like your skin is just being scraped along...not exfoliated properly.  I wish they could reduce these to a micro bead level..then you could work it gently over you face and get a proper scrub....alas I will have to keep searching.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel great!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, following the directions on the package, I wasn&#x27;t in love.  I believe it tells you to mix the scrub with a little bit of water.  Eh.  I absolutely love this product when instead of mixing it with water, I mix it with Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial wash.  It perfectly exfoliates and cleans at the same time.

    <li> Absolute Must Have Face Scrub! My skin feels so soft afterwards &amp; it has helped with my blackheads tremendously! I use this scrub twice a week along with Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Cleanser &amp; the Rose Water Toner. Never been happier with my acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product ever for a fresh, glowing face!  Even though it is considered a &#x27;scrub&#x27; -- it is gentle enough to be used daily.</li>
