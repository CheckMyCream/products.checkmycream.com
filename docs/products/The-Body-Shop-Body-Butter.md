      <li>I love putting it on my feet</li>
      <li>So excited to use this product !</li>
      <li>but i dont see what the big deal is about these things... smells good and a nice lotion though</li>
      <li>Smells like super ripe peaches!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly greasy feeling and helps keep my skin feeling moisturized and smooth.</li>
      <li>It has a strong, sweet peachy scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
      <li>It really does smell like an authentic peach and The Body Shop</li>
      <li>I love the smell so much I purchased the Vineyard Peach Shower Gel and the cream body scrub to go along with the butter.</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth without being too dense and although  two of the first three ingredients are Cocoa Seed Butter and Shea Butter, it does not leave an oily film on my hands after use.</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth and absorbs into the skin pretty well.</li>
      <li>At times I wear my favorite scent, \\&quot;Happy,\\&quot; by Clinique, with my body butter and the scents complement each other nicely.</li>
      <li>Smells like a fresh picked peach.  </li>

      <li>The peach scent is one of my favorites from the body shop - VERY PEACHY!</li>
      <li>and i only ever use the body shop&#x27;s body butter and THIS one is my all time favorite.  </li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough to wear alone, but mild enough to wear a floral or citrus scented perfume with it.</li>
      <li>Keeps skin hydrated all day long leaves skin feeling smooth and soft</li>
      <li>Beautifully lush cream!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get many stretch marks bit not sure if this was the reason or no</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin silky soft and no flaking of your skin.</li>
      <li>Maybe an old product?</li>
      <li>This is a nice smelling peach scent, it&#x27;s not overly fake smelling, it smells like real peaches.</li>
      <li>The size of the jar is about the width of a bagel and stands about 1 ½\\&quot; high and contains quite a bit of butter that should last a while.</li>
      <li>(my local store was complete out of the body butter) and thinking it will come to my local store</li>
      <li>This tub is actually quite big and will last for over 6 months, less if you use it every day and have dry skin constantly, but this will leave my skin smooth and moisturized for days.</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit more subtle then the other body butters.</li>

<li> A bit thicker and harder than the other body butters.</li>
<li> and I have just about every other flavor from The Body Shop</li>
<li> so&lt;br /&gt;  if your hands are not clean product may get contaminated with bacteria etc.</li>
<li> and I use it a few times throughout the day as I work</li>
<li> but since it takes awhile to absorb I don&#x27;t recommend getting up for a few minutes</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
<li> The Peach line from The Body Shop is limited, which is to bad.</li>
<li> and it melts into the skin so well and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy residue behind.</li>
<li> This one smelled weird like plastic and peaches.</li>
<li> Too bad its seasonal :(</li>
<li> Packaging at times is a bit annoying because you have to dip your hand into the tub every time you use it  </li>

    <li> This one smelled weird like plastic and peaches. Maybe an old product?</li>
    <li> Nice lotion. I used during pregnancy to keep skin moisturized. Didn&#x27;t get many stretch marks bit not sure if this was the reason or no</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!! definitely keeping this in stock! It has a creamy texture, not to oily and smells wonderful!  Going to get more!</li>
    <li> I like it but i dont see what the big deal is about these things... smells good and a nice lotion though</li>
    <li> Smells really good. A bit thicker and harder than the other body butters. The smell is a bit more subtle then the other body butters.</li>
    <li> I love the Peach body butter.  Doesn&#x27;t over power your perfumes.  It leaves your skin silky soft and no flaking of your skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the body shop and i only ever use the body shop&#x27;s body butter and THIS one is my all time favorite.  Too bad its seasonal :(</li>
    <li> Great smell. Very smooth on skin. Good moisturizing effect.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Awesome! Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> A friend encouraged me to try this and if you&#x27;ll like peaches you&#x27;ll love this. The consistency is very nice and silky. Not cloying or sticky at all. It really does smell like an authentic peach and The Body Shop always has such quality products. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this. I&#x27;ve been enjoying it and using it a lot.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;  Smells just like peaches, scent lasts for a long time&lt;br /&gt;  Keeps skin hydrated all day long leaves skin feeling smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;  A bit oily however it is a body butter so this is to be expected&lt;br /&gt;  Packaging at times is a bit annoying because you have to dip your hand into the tub every time you use it  there is no pump. so&lt;br /&gt;  if your hands are not clean product may get contaminated with bacteria etc.</li>
    <li> The Peach line from The Body Shop is limited, which is to bad. I didn&#x27;t find this out until after trying to order it through The Body Shop&#x27;s website (my local store was complete out of the body butter) and thinking it will come to my local store soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I discovered it was limited, I had to find other avenues to order the peach body butter. A friend of mine had one and I have just about every other flavor from The Body Shop but that one.  I have been shopping at The Body Shop for years.  The peach smelled just like a container of peaches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An amazon 3rd party seller had about 9 left, so I ordered two.  The shipment came on time or earlier and even if I run out of peach scrub or shower gel before the body butter, I can always mix and match the peach body butter with say... papaya or mango.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> The Vineyard Peach Body Butter smells so good! It&#x27;s like candy for the body! It has a strong, sweet peachy scent but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. It&#x27;s powerful enough to wear alone, but mild enough to wear a floral or citrus scented perfume with it. At times I wear my favorite scent, \\&quot;Happy,\\&quot; by Clinique, with my body butter and the scents complement each other nicely. The texture is smooth without being too dense and although  two of the first three ingredients are Cocoa Seed Butter and Shea Butter, it does not leave an oily film on my hands after use. I write on my laptop a lot and keep the body butter next to it on my desk and I use it a few times throughout the day as I work and I still don&#x27;t have oily keys!It keeps my hands from getting dry and it melts into the skin so well and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy residue behind. The size of the jar is about the width of a bagel and stands about 1 ½\\&quot; high and contains quite a bit of butter that should last a while. I love the smell so much I purchased the Vineyard Peach Shower Gel and the cream body scrub to go along with the butter. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been discontinued so I was bummed and have been waiting for the 13.95 deal instead of the 24.95 price... So excited to use this product ! Smells like super ripe peaches! One of the best smells ever from body shop!! MUST BUY, you will not regret!</li>
    <li> Smells like a fresh picked peach.  Beautifully lush cream!</li>
    <li> The peach scent is one of my favorites from the body shop - VERY PEACHY! Strong scent but not overpowering and leaves your skin feeling nourished and soft. I love putting it on my feet but since it takes awhile to absorb I don&#x27;t recommend getting up for a few minutes so you don&#x27;t leave footprints all over your floor. It&#x27;s a great &#x27;sitting on the couch watching tv and putting on lotion and not getting up for awhile&#x27; activity .... if anyone else ever does that too...haha.</li>
    <li> This is one of my most favorite scents for body butter by The Body Shop. This is a nice smelling peach scent, it&#x27;s not overly fake smelling, it smells like real peaches. It glides on smooth and absorbs into the skin pretty well. It&#x27;s not overly greasy feeling and helps keep my skin feeling moisturized and smooth. This tub is actually quite big and will last for over 6 months, less if you use it every day and have dry skin constantly, but this will leave my skin smooth and moisturized for days.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! It was delivered on time, works well and attended our expectations.</li>
