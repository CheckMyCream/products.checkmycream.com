      <li>Outstanding delivery time.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Ive used their pure hyaluronic serum before and liked it</li>
      <li>Started using it because a free sample was enclosed with my Watts Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>So I immediately bought this and used the promote for a 1oz free bottle of their Argan gold.  </li>
      <li>Then my mom told me how much she liked it &amp; encouraged me to try it.  </li>
      <li>Need to follow use with a good moisturizer like argan oil or coconut oil and including a natural ACV toner.  </li>

      <li>This did exactly what I hoped it would do: brightened my skin and reduced blemishes.</li>
      <li>It does provide a unique softness and  does  smooth out minor wrinkles.</li>
      <li>and I love this serum, no more super flaky nose surounded by super oily skin</li>
      <li>I thought the arginine and vitamin c would certainly help, and it has.</li>
      <li>At least this product gives me peace of  mind that it is more natural and healthier for my skin than drugstore moisturizers which most contain harmful chemicals and ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Although not as much as you may hope, it does seem to offer some benefit for ageing skin.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>I had previously ordered a bottle of Hyaluronic Acid (different brand) and loved how it made my skin feel</li>
      <li>I switched back to a moisturizer without the beta Hydroxy and sure enough, my skin cleared up again.</li>
      <li>so when I saw this one, I thought it would yield the same results as my initial bottle or better since it has Vitamin C and L Arginine.  </li>
      <li>I am a redhead with sensitive skin, and I can put in on my whole face including my eyelids without any problem.</li>
      <li>It feels good but not sure if it actually works at all.</li>
      <li>, I also noticed that new pimples were much less severe and disappeared quickly.  </li>
      <li>I use it almost daily and the skin is very well moisturized.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money I found better at the local Walmart.</li>
      <li>This is the same ingredients as other high cost wrinkle removers that they charge high price for.  </li>
      <li>Not to mention the price point and this particular sellers constant promotions and sales, be sure to scroll slightly below the picture of the product to see different promotions (usually where they have the \\&quot;add these to cart too \\&quot; buttons)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get dry spots, and minor blemishes go away much faster.</li>
      <li>I do not think they have a high potency of the active ingredients, The fist one is aloe and that&#x27;s all it seems to be is just aloe and water.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin never looked better and I am 65 years old!</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered. Good price and product.</li>
    <li> Everythhing Was perfect thank you</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price. I use it almost daily and the skin is very well moisturized. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as I&#x27;m 29 and I&#x27;m starting to get a few wrinkles in my forehead. A retinol clream I was using was making me flake like crazy. So I immediately bought this and used the promote for a 1oz free bottle of their Argan gold.  So happy I did. I wash my face morning and night and put the serum on in the morning and use the Argan oil afterwards. My oily acne prone skin has been looking better and better. I never would have thought to use an oil to combat my usually oil slicked face. I am now a beleiver in their Argan oil and I love this serum, no more super flaky nose surounded by super oily skin (seriously how the heck does oily skin get flaky?)  Ive used their pure hyaluronic serum before and liked it but now that I&#x27;m showing signs of aging I thought the arginine and vitamin c would certainly help, and it has. I do not want to be without this stuff. Not to mention the price point and this particular sellers constant promotions and sales, be sure to scroll slightly below the picture of the product to see different promotions (usually where they have the \\&quot;add these to cart too \\&quot; buttons)</li>
    <li> I use it every night. Started using it because a free sample was enclosed with my Watts Argan Oil. Makes my skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> I think it is helping my skin. Softer and healthier looking. I will  try this product again. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Had heard about this product from an acquaitance who liked product. I have found that it is not for me, as wake with headaches each to I have used it.</li>
    <li> This is the same ingredients as other high cost wrinkle removers that they charge high price for.  I checked the ingredients I wanted and this one had them all: Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C and Arginine.  That&#x27;s all you need.  This has it, great product.  Works wonderfully and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I had originally received a sample of this serum &amp; gave it to my mom.  I was skeptical the ingredients might irritate my skin.  My skin has a difficult time tolerating most facial products.  Then my mom told me how much she liked it &amp; encouraged me to try it.  After a week, I hadn&#x27;t had any reaction to it &amp; my skin was softer.  I was most impressed with how well it moisturized the area under my eyes.  I have tried every product for the under eye area &amp; nothing ever worked.  This includes expensive creams from Kiehls &amp; Aveda.  I&#x27;ve also noticed my make-up goes on smoother.  I&#x27;ve gone through the 1st bottle of the 2 pack I bought &amp; I&#x27;m still very pleased with the quality of the serum.</li>
    <li> This did exactly what I hoped it would do: brightened my skin and reduced blemishes. I have fair skin and any blemish on my face leaves a mark for months, regardless of whether I touch it our not. I do NOT like to wear foundation, makes me feel like a clown and rubs off on clothes. I depend on concealer only. After using this for a few days, not only did scars I had for months fade, I also noticed that new pimples were much less severe and disappeared quickly.  Just a heads up, you cannot use this product at the same time you use a moisturizer with beta Hydroxy. I was wondering why this stuff quit working and I was really disappointed. Turns out, since I had switched to a moisturizer with beta Hydroxy during the day, it was preventing this product from working (I think it was counteracting the vitamin c). I switched back to a moisturizer without the beta Hydroxy and sure enough, my skin cleared up again. I use this in the morning before moisturizer and makeup, and I use my moisturizer with beta Hydroxy at night. 4 months ago my skin was dull and needed a serious pick–me–up. Now my husband compliments me on my radiance! I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple weeks it just doesn&#x27;t feel like a good moisturizer, It feels like I&#x27;m putting water on my face I have to use a separate moisturizer over it. I have tried ALOT of moisturizers and this is one of the worst. I do not think they have a high potency of the active ingredients, The fist one is aloe and that&#x27;s all it seems to be is just aloe and water. Don&#x27;t waste your money I found better at the local Walmart.</li>
    <li> Like this but not sure if I will order again. It feels good but not sure if it actually works at all.</li>
    <li> Although not as much as you may hope, it does seem to offer some benefit for ageing skin. It does provide a unique softness and  does  smooth out minor wrinkles. However, if your looking for the fountain of youth, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> great serum, it has corrected a swelling and pigment issue ive had for 3 years, more than anything Ive tried before.</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered a bottle of Hyaluronic Acid (different brand) and loved how it made my skin feel so when I saw this one, I thought it would yield the same results as my initial bottle or better since it has Vitamin C and L Arginine.  In terms of my skin texture, I noticed some small changes in the first two weeks and then nothing further.  My skin in those two weeks become slightly more supple and soft. I noticed that this stuff is runnier than the previous Hyaluronic Acid I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the additional ingredients. This is no miracle worker nor does it offer any significant changes that I noticed but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain much.  At least this product gives me peace of  mind that it is more natural and healthier for my skin than drugstore moisturizers which most contain harmful chemicals and ingredients.  I bought two bottles and gave one to a cousin. She also did not notice any changes.  I will pass on repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This is THE PRODUCT on my forever list.  Just a dab goes a very long way.  Watts HA is a MUST for good skin regimen.  Need to follow use with a good moisturizer like argan oil or coconut oil and including a natural ACV toner.  Outstanding delivery time.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using this serum I noticed a change under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve had dark circles as long as I can remember - I&#x27;m 60 now and under-eye darkness/puffiness have been an issue for a long time, even when I was a lot younger.  As soon as I started using Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid Serum I noticed that my under-eyes were brighter and less puffy.  I credit this serum for the improvement because I&#x27;m still working long hours and not getting enough sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum absorbs quickly and I use it in conjunction with InstaNatural Retinol Serum and Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair SPF 30.  I&#x27;m happy with the regimen.  Wrinkles seem to be decreasing and my face seems brighter overall, with dark spots and deep wrinkles lessening.  I want to fight mother nature with whatever weapons I can (that aren&#x27;t crazy expensive/invasive) and this serum is now a staple in my arsenal!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Have ordered several times.</li>
    <li> I use this serum twice a day. I am a redhead with sensitive skin, and I can put in on my whole face including my eyelids without any problem. My skin feels terrific. I get compliments all the time on my complexion, and no one believes I&#x27;m in my 50s. I use this combined with the Argon oil and phytoceramide supplements. After 2 months, my friends wanted to know what I was doing to make my skin look so good. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months now, and my skin feels and looks terrific. I don&#x27;t get dry spots, and minor blemishes go away much faster.</li>
