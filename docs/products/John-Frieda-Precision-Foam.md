      <li>Ok so I&#x27;m at the age where a few white hairs are sprouting here and there.</li>
      <li>but after trying it out for myself, there&#x27;s no other way Id rather color my hair!</li>
      <li>The color is nice and natural looking, hair does not feel dry and over processed, and color has lasted for a few weeks except on my asian white strands of hair which was why I dyed it to begin with...</li>
      <li>Oh well, I hope it stops soon, or else I&#x27;ll be bold in a few months....</li>
      <li>From the description, one would expect some red high lights in it shows as such on the package.</li>
      <li>This effect finally went away after a few days and left behind very damaged, straw-like ends in the place of the healthy strands I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I usually need two boxes of hair dye to cover my thick long hair, but there was more than enough foam for me in one box of the Precision Foam!</li>
<li> It may just be I was surprised by the dark quality...</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s mess free, and the smell is not so harsh like some of the other ammonia dyes out there.</li>
<li> What an incredible waste of money, time, and unnecessary damage to my poor hair.</li>
<li> What an incredible waste of money, time, and unnecessary damage to my poor hair.</li>
<li> but it covered my few strands of white hair (why do they call it gray hair when the hair is snow colored white?!)</li>
<li> The conditioner is thick, albeit with a foul odor, and my hair felt soft when rinsing out the dye.</li>
<li> I knew it would turn out dark, which is why I chose a medium brown shade instead of my usual dark brown, but wow - this was on the black-brown level.</li>
<li> I was not able to get enough foam to even start the process.  </li>
<li> It was also INCREDIBLY dark.</li>
<li> for less than two weeks.</li>
<li> I assume that it&#x27;s an individual reaction, considering that other reviewers never experienced anything like that....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the easiest color to use--the foam is less messy and easier to manage.</li>
<li> After about a month of washing my greys are still covered up (which usually show again with other colors/brands after about 1.5-2 weeks!</li>
<li> Made my hair a dull dark color, not the chestnut color that I was going for.  </li>
<li> I hadn&#x27;t dyed my hair at all, my hair was suddenly heavy and dull.</li>
<li> /&gt;To start with, it was patchy, which shocked me, because the whole &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; about foam hair dye is that isn&#x27;t supposed to be patchy.</li>
<li> My usual go-to hair dye is L&#x27;Oreal</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews that are this negative, but in this case I felt that I had to.</li>
<li> And so hard to find.</li>
<li> This time, however, my hair seems dull and it&#x27;s fading quicker.</li>
<li> It is impossible to review the hair dye when the foam barely comes out of the bottle.  </li>
<li> I have been dying my hair for years and have never used a worse hair dye than this foam.</li>
<li> and I was plain sick of looking at it.</li>
<li> Frustrated, I threw it out and used another companies hair dye.</li>
<li> It was a horrible sight to see.</li>
<li> BUT... I started loosing my hair horribly the moment I washed off the foam.</li>

    <li> i love this foam hair dye, because it&#x27;s almost a guarantee for even coloring; I don&#x27;t find un-dyed patches of hair afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color itself is a cool brown. True to the representation on the box.</li>
    <li> Did not color my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product once before (in a different color) and I really liked it. My hair was shiny and felt nice. This time, however, my hair seems dull and it&#x27;s fading quicker. It&#x27;s only been a month and I&#x27;m already see lighter strands near the roots. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this one again</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and the color is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this hair color.  Great color, coverage</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m at the age where a few white hairs are sprouting here and there. I liked the color and I so wanted to love it but it covered my few strands of white hair (why do they call it gray hair when the hair is snow colored white?!) for less than two weeks. I wash my hair every 3 days and applied it as stated. The color is nice and natural looking, hair does not feel dry and over processed, and color has lasted for a few weeks except on my asian white strands of hair which was why I dyed it to begin with...</li>

Its so easy to use, it&#x27;s mess free, and the smell is not so harsh like some of the other ammonia dyes out there. Before use, my hair was an ombre turned copper and I was plain sick of looking at it. I chose the medium brown red since my hair loves to turn coppery anyways, and I am very satisfied with the color and feel of my new do!</li>
    <li> And so hard to find. This color matches my natural color and one coloring lasts for weeks. It covers gray better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried them all. It&#x27;s so easy to apply. And its &#x27;s much more affordable than salon coloring.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews that are this negative, but in this case I felt that I had to. I have been dying my hair for years and have never used a worse hair dye than this foam. Had to do some touch-ups the other day in-between salon visits and decided to get rid of my highlights, so I decided I&#x27;d try the John Frieda foam again, since it has such good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s set the stage: I dyed my hair on day old, medium/light brown hair with balayage highlights that had no product in it. Perfect recipe for dying my hair a uniform color. I followed all directions, watched the John Frieda informative video, and foamed it up. After dying, I waited over 24 hours before taking my first shower. I&#x27;ll give the dye this - it was easy. Foam is very easy to apply to your head. The conditioner is thick, albeit with a foul odor, and my hair felt soft when rinsing out the dye. That&#x27;s about all of the good things I have to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, it was patchy, which shocked me, because the whole &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; about foam hair dye is that isn&#x27;t supposed to be patchy. It was also INCREDIBLY dark. I knew it would turn out dark, which is why I chose a medium brown shade instead of my usual dark brown, but wow - this was on the black-brown level. I shouldn&#x27;t have worried about how dark it was at first, though, because all of it washed out the very first wash. ALL of it. Even using color safe shampoo/conditioner. My hair looked like I had not dyed it at all. My friends and boyfriend couldn&#x27;t see a difference at all. My highlights didn&#x27;t even go away, and they should have been, if anything, darker. They were still bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to looking like I hadn&#x27;t dyed my hair at all, my hair was suddenly heavy and dull. It used to be very shiny, and this dye seemed to do nothing but strip the shine from my hair. It felt like I had used a bunch of gel in my hair and left it in, as though I had too much product in it and was wearing a hair-shaped helmet. This effect finally went away after a few days and left behind very damaged, straw-like ends in the place of the healthy strands I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst and most expensive hair dye I have ever used. My usual go-to hair dye is L&#x27;Oreal (after trying several different brands), and I should not have strayed. What an incredible waste of money, time, and unnecessary damage to my poor hair. Never again.elmet.

    <li> Was not crazy about it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will purchase again! Covers wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair. Makes your hair healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This is a really great color and I&#x27;ve tried many brands.  After about a month of washing my greys are still covered up (which usually show again with other colors/brands after about 1.5-2 weeks!</li>
    <li> This was my first time dying my own hair, and the foam was easy to use, the greys got covered nicely, and the color overall is beautiful and made my hair shiny, BUT... I started loosing my hair horribly the moment I washed off the foam. It was a horrible sight to see. And now every time i wash my head I keep pulling out more hair. My scalp also got very itchy - I had to change the shampoo twice in an effort to ease the itch... Oh well, I hope it stops soon, or else I&#x27;ll be bold in a few months.... :p I assume that it&#x27;s an individual reaction, considering that other reviewers never experienced anything like that.... I guess I&#x27;ll have to try another brand next time... so, 5 stars for the color and coverage, 1 star for the side effects.</li>
    <li> Have been using this brand for two years. I love the foam dye. The colour holds well and covers those pesky gray hairs.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would turn out after reading reviews about the color turning out darker than the box but I love it! It&#x27;s the easiest color to use--the foam is less messy and easier to manage. The color turned out like the box. I just hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it say it will do. If you read the details on the box you will not be misguided. Got a lot of compliments on the color itself!</li>
    <li> love the foam… easy to work with</li>
    <li> From the description, one would expect some red high lights in it shows as such on the package. But perhaps because the product was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; or running out of shelf life the actual color was more a dead brown. I would not purchase this color again although I like the John Frieda products. This time I chose a medium red brown (RB) and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to review the hair dye when the foam barely comes out of the bottle.  I was not able to get enough foam to even start the process.  Frustrated, I threw it out and used another companies hair dye.</li>
