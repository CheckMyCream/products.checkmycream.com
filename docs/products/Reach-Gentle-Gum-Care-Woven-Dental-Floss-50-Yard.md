### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This floss does an excellent job of getting it done.</li>
      <li>Favorite floss ever!!!!</li>
      <li>Great!  </li>
      <li>Great price, great delivery!!</li>
      <li>This acts as a very effective cleaner.  </li>
      <li>so I loved Reach Cleanpaste floss--but it seems that has been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>The best floss by far.</li>
      <li>You will be able to feel it doing the job.</li>
      <li>Cleans very well and great taste.</li>
      <li>I was no longer able to find this product in stores</li>
      <li>I feel this is because of the many strands in the floss.  </li>
      <li>had to tape the top to the container so it doesn&#x27;t fall apart.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I have been able to continue getting it online.  </li>
      <li>so I was pleased when I saw it on amazon.</li>
      <li>What more can I ask for?</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Makes the teeth feel very clean.</li>
      <li>great floss tastes great and fits in the hard to floss areas</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK but not as good as the old Cleanpaste non-woven, non-wax floss.</li>
      <li>The only one that will clean your teeth!!!</li>
      <li>Seems exactly like clean paste.</li>
      <li>The only kind my husband likes.</li>
      <li>My dentist visits have been very positive.  </li>
      <li>so I have to be careful that I don&#x27;t use the shredded part or it gets stuck in my teeth, but worth the risk! :)</li>
      <li>, the container doesn&#x27;t stay together: the spool of floss constantly falls out because the top (with the metal piece that cuts the floss) cannot withstand the tugging to pull the floss out of the container.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Scratchy in a good way, like a very very light velcro, not a bad way like painful.</li>
      <li>It works very well.  </li>
      <li>This is as opposed to the waxed flosses that just slide between teeth without doing too much.</li>
      <li>Really cleans off plaque.  </li>
      <li>This product is very close.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s more than I can say for any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done, my teeth actually feel as clean as they do leaving the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Product exceeded my expectations for replacing CleanPaste (my favorite for years which was discontinued).&lt;br /&gt;Seemed like same product with new name in different packaging.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is exactly the same as Reach Cleanpaste, as you can see from my photos that provide a side by side comparison of Cleanpaste floss and Deep Clean floss.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the clean paste anymore and decided to try the deep clean, due to someone else&#x27;s review.  </li>
      <li>I definitely pull more junk out of my teeth with this than any other floss.</li>
      <li>My teeth and gums don&#x27;t feel nearly as clean and freh if I use any other floss.</li>
      <li>It is much thicker than standard string or tape floss</li>
      <li>Thick woven floss grabs more stuff between teeth so as to get them cleaner.</li>
      <li>ordered this Reach Deep Clean floss after reading that it was exactly the same as the floss Reach previously sold under the Cleanpaste name.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I wanted and expected.  </li>
      <li>Shreds easy so be careful, however it cleans extremely well between teeth!</li>
      <li>I love this floss because it has a fluffy woven texture, slightly &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; to grab food.</li>
      <li>This the thickness and texture is exactly the same as Cleanpaste floss, and it&#x27;s infused with the same icy mint tasting toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I love this floss because it has a fluffy woven texture, slightly &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; to grab food. Scratchy in a good way, like a very very light velcro, not a bad way like painful. This is as opposed to the waxed flosses that just slide between teeth without doing too much. I definitely pull more junk out of my teeth with this than any other floss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but not as good as the old Cleanpaste non-woven, non-wax floss. I will try a different type next time.</li>
    <li> The best floss by far. My teeth and gums don&#x27;t feel nearly as clean and freh if I use any other floss.</li>
    <li> I like the floss: it does a decent job of removing stuck food from between my teeth, with some teeth that are difficult to get in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the container doesn&#x27;t stay together: the spool of floss constantly falls out because the top (with the metal piece that cuts the floss) cannot withstand the tugging to pull the floss out of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to tape the top to the container so it doesn&#x27;t fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my expectations for replacing CleanPaste (my favorite for years which was discontinued).&lt;br /&gt;Seemed like same product with new name in different packaging.&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of floss for 4 years.  My dentist visits have been very positive.  I have had almost no plaque of tartar on my teeth.  I feel this is because of the many strands in the floss.  This acts as a very effective cleaner.  They have discontinued this floss but I have been able to continue getting it online.  I buy several packs at a time dreading the day I can no longer find this specific floss.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted and expected.  What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> Makes the teeth feel very clean. I love it. It does tend to shred so I have to be careful that I don&#x27;t use the shredded part or it gets stuck in my teeth, but worth the risk! :)</li>
    <li> I used to use Reach Cleanpaste floss, which was discontinued a few years ago. Up until now I&#x27;ve been unable to find anything even remotely similar to my favorite Cleanpaste floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Reach Deep Clean floss after reading that it was exactly the same as the floss Reach previously sold under the Cleanpaste name. This is exactly the same as Reach Cleanpaste, as you can see from my photos that provide a side by side comparison of Cleanpaste floss and Deep Clean floss. This the thickness and texture is exactly the same as Cleanpaste floss, and it&#x27;s infused with the same icy mint tasting toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been lamenting over the decision to discontinue Reach Cleanpaste, then this is for you!</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews that said this was like the Reach Cleanpaste, so I bought it.  It is basically the same product.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I hate flossing. This floss does an excellent job of getting it done. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store. You will be able to feel it doing the job.</li>
    <li> Thick woven floss grabs more stuff between teeth so as to get them cleaner. Hard to find in stores so I stock up here.</li>
    <li> Shreds easy so be careful, however it cleans extremely well between teeth!</li>
    <li> Those of you who hate the chore of flossing (me!) and have tried every pick and stick out there to try to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; without the fuss, forget that. Just deal with the fuss and the mess, and floss with this stuff like you&#x27;ve never flossed before. When I&#x27;m done, my teeth actually feel as clean as they do leaving the dentist&#x27;s. That&#x27;s more than I can say for any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Cleans very well and great taste.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the clean paste anymore and decided to try the deep clean, due to someone else&#x27;s review.  It works very well.  Seems exactly like clean paste. Floss works well on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I have wide spaces between my teeth so I loved Reach Cleanpaste floss--but it seems that has been discontinued.  This product is very close.</li>
    <li> The only one I have found that feels like you are brushing between the teeth.  It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find, so stock up.</li>
    <li> Really cleans off plaque.  I like the solid blue color which help you to see that all the debris is gone.</li>
    <li> Favorite floss ever!!!! Great price, great delivery!!</li>
    <li> There shouldn&#x27;t be other floss but this one produced anymore. The only one that will clean your teeth!!!</li>
    <li> I was no longer able to find this product in stores so I was pleased when I saw it on amazon. It is much thicker than standard string or tape floss so if the spaces between teeth are tight the product may be difficult to use.</li>
    <li> The only kind my husband likes.</li>
    <li> Great!  I was looking to replace Cleanpaste and can no longer find it, this seems identical.</li>
    <li> great floss tastes great and fits in the hard to floss areas</li>
