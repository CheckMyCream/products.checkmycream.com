      <li>Love it there are no words.</li>
      <li>This is the product I fell in love with on vacation.  </li>
      <li>I get many comments on how great the smell is and how everyone wants to know where I purchased this.</li>
      <li>It is not HORRIBLE</li>
      <li>but it is far from ideal.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand of body butter</li>
      <li>and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Oh..and it leaves me feeling silky-soft from top to toe.</li>
      <li>I also have the chocolate and love love love it.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on it</li>
      <li>Its really a fabulous cream and the price is too.</li>
      <li>Works great and comes in several scents.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Thick, rich, creamy but not oily, melts into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Its a true chocolate scent and</li>
      <li>They have a consistancy that is creamy (not oily), and they absorb quickly into the skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful thick creamy body cream and the smell is really pretty and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>It was worth the price, I think.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started collecting body butters for some reason and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>works into your skin to leave it soft and added bonus that smells good enough to eat..thank you and enjoy</li>
      <li>very soft and smooth and hydrating.  </li>
      <li>The second was opened and most had fallen out.</li>
      <li>I gave this item four stars; I deducted a star because although this product seems great, I am a lotion fanatic and it doesn&#x27;t quite have the quality and aroma of a five star lotion.  </li>
      <li>When you put it on, you feel and smell like your are swimming in a hot tub of hot cocoa.  </li>
      <li>The first arrived opened</li>
      <li>I love the mango, Asian Lily and sweet almond fig so far!</li>
      <li>When I checked the site, I saw that the product prices had been significantly raised, so I could not re-order at the old price.</li>
      <li>My mother bought me a five-pack of these at Costco (where they were much cheaper), but she has since told me that they are no longer there (holiday merchandise, most likely).   </li>
      <li>It smells so good for so long, plus with my regular perfume on top it just all turns into one big yummy smelling lovefest all day.</li>
      <li>I loved coconut for a long time until I found white</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell fabulous</li>
      <li>Everyone wants to know what it is and where they can get some.  </li>
      <li>Really don&#x27;t like the way it smells.</li>
      <li>but it really does the job of softening skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very luxurious silky feel, not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>This product really did moisturize my skin.</li>
      <li>I LOVE how this body butter makes your skin soft, but the white chocolate scent leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
      <li>I think it definitely smells like white chocolate - VERY SWEET!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really even a sweet smell to it!</li>
      <li>it does NOT smell like chocolate to me, it smells like a cross between wax and a milkshake which I am not crazy about.  </li>
      <li>I in no way intended to fall in deep, deep, passionate love with this body butter -</li>
      <li>So I was a little nervous because I read both that this smelled delicious and that it smelled weird - like crayons.  </li>
      <li>I have tried using different body lotions and body butters throughout the years, but have never noticed that any of them significantly helped my dry skin in the winter.  </li>
      <li>Jus smells weird &amp; not in a good way.</li>
      <li>I particularly recommend the white chocolate scent because it lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>this is the only moisturizer i use all summer long, especially after day spent in the sun, just love it</li>
      <li>I expected a sweet white chocolate scent but it smells like a box of crayons with only a tiny hint of chocolate.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because of the great reviews, but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed by the smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Delon body butters over the years, and hit the jackpot with the white chocolate scent! For a confirmed chocoholic, this is an exercise in trying not to lick one&#x27;s own arm. Oh..and it leaves me feeling silky-soft from top to toe.</li>
    <li> So I was a little nervous because I read both that this smelled delicious and that it smelled weird - like crayons.  Here&#x27;s what I say:    It doesn&#x27;t smell quite like crayons, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate either BUT THEN AGAIN white chocolate doesn&#x27;t smell like regular chocolate does it?  I think it definitely smells like white chocolate - VERY SWEET!  And the lotion is great, very creamy.    I gave this item four stars; I deducted a star because although this product seems great, I am a lotion fanatic and it doesn&#x27;t quite have the quality and aroma of a five star lotion.  It&#x27;s yummy but it doesn&#x27;t make me think \\&quot;Oh my god, I&#x27;d pay 30 bucks for a bottle!\\&quot;  It was worth the price, I think.</li>
    <li> I in no way intended to fall in deep, deep, passionate love with this body butter - but I did. Alas, it is hard to find now so if you can get it BUY IT! It smells so good for so long, plus with my regular perfume on top it just all turns into one big yummy smelling lovefest all day. I have never enjoyed a body moisturizer like this. (I know I don&#x27;t usually sound this frickin&#x27; crazy.)</li>
    <li> I tried this delightful product when I was visiting in Maryland.  When I got home, I could not find it anywhere.  Also, it was hard to find online.  This is the product I fell in love with on vacation.  I was soooo happy when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews, but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed by the smell. I expected a sweet white chocolate scent but it smells like a box of crayons with only a tiny hint of chocolate. But it does moisturize quite well, and it&#x27;s not oily at all.</li>
    <li> The product was never despatched!  After a few weeks, I received an e-mail stating that the order is being cancelled and my money is being refunded!  When I checked the site, I saw that the product prices had been significantly raised, so I could not re-order at the old price. This order cancellation seemed to indicate an unwillingness to honour the earlier price! Hence we procured the item from another store.    How do I review this non-purchase?  The order experience was extremely unsatisfactory!</li>
    <li> I also have the chocolate and love love love it. Costco now has the spring collection out. I am on my way to get it.</li>
    <li> i love this creme! it smells uber-delicious! it makes me want to eat it! the greatest comment i ever got on it was from a guy friend \\&quot;you smell really good....it&#x27;s actually quite distracting.\\&quot; yup....</li>
    <li> Ok, I am sure this moisturizes well but let&#x27;s get down to brass tacks. Let&#x27;s just say this...there&#x27;s nothing that beats having your wife moisturize with this after her shower and just before bedtime. Enjoy a midnight chocolately snack in the comforts of your own bed with your betrothed.</li>
    <li> hese are absolutely my FAVORITE body butters now, great consistency, great smell, and they moisturize terrifically!</li>
    <li> Love it there are no words. It did wonders for my scares after my operation. I&#x27;m going to tell my friends. Thank you</li>
    <li> Regarding Moisture- This body butter does the trick! very soft and smooth and hydrating.  why the low stars? the smell! it does NOT smell like chocolate to me, it smells like a cross between wax and a milkshake which I am not crazy about.  It is not HORRIBLE but it is far from ideal.  If you were looking for a coco smell, keep looking!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Delon body butters for a long time and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thick, rich, creamy but not oily, melts into the skin.  I loved coconut for a long time until I found white chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells like white confection, yum.  I get so many compliments on it and yeah, the guys especially love it.  Everyone wants to know what it is and where they can get some.  Not only does it smell fabulous but it really does the job of softening skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stock up.</li>
    <li> I have tried using different body lotions and body butters throughout the years, but have never noticed that any of them significantly helped my dry skin in the winter.  The Delon body butters are different.  They have a consistancy that is creamy (not oily), and they absorb quickly into the skin.  My mother bought me a five-pack of these at Costco (where they were much cheaper), but she has since told me that they are no longer there (holiday merchandise, most likely).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have only tried two of the five scents, Olive and White Chocolate.  I particularly recommend the white chocolate scent because it lasts all day.  I am a middle school teacher, and my students are commenting all day that they smell the white chocolate scent.</li>
    <li> This product really did moisturize my skin. Plus it smells delicious! I definitely recommend this to anyone who has problems with dry skin. Plan to buy others</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful thick creamy body cream and the smell is really pretty and lasts all day. Its a true chocolate scent and I get many comments on how great the smell is and how everyone wants to know where I purchased this. Its really a fabulous cream and the price is too. I will buy again-thankyou!</li>
    <li> this is the only moisturizer i use all summer long, especially after day spent in the sun, just love it</li>
    <li> I LOVE how this body butter makes your skin soft, but the white chocolate scent leaves a lot to be desired. I love the mango, Asian Lily and sweet almond fig so far! I just ordered the white peony...Delon is great but I could only give the white chocolate 3 stars....sorry Delon..This scent needs tweaking.</li>
    <li> I love it. Was kind of sceptical about purchasing this item after reading the reviews. But, the smell is great and it stays on your skin all day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is to die for.  When you put it on, you feel and smell like your are swimming in a hot tub of hot cocoa.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love it the smell it is wonderful</li>
    <li> It smells nothing like chocolate or vanilla it&#x27;s more like a disaster !! Please save your money. It&#x27;s not really even a sweet smell to it!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. I&#x27;ve started collecting body butters for some reason and this one is my favorite so far. Not to mention how much it actually helps your skin.</li>
    <li> Our daughter-in-law is a chocaholic and loves body butter. This is just the thing for both as you get the scent without the calories and it softens your skin as well.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these. The first arrived opened but none had spilled out. The second was opened and most had fallen out. While the lotion itself is good, I won&#x27;t order it again. I think its packed terribly and won&#x27;t chance a spilled product again.</li>
    <li> works into your skin to leave it soft and added bonus that smells good enough to eat..thank you and enjoy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before with the vanilla scent &amp; absolutely loved it!! Smelled great &amp; worked better. So I decided to try the white chocolate scent. Really don&#x27;t like the way it smells. Jus smells weird &amp; not in a good way. My bf even commented on the offense of the smell. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Vanilla great tho.</li>
    <li> Just AMAZING!!!  I use nothing else but this Body Butter and I hope that Delon never stops production of this scent.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of body butter but this scent smells odd to me I prefer the coconut or mango.</li>
    <li> Very luxurious silky feel, not greasy at all. The smell is amazing and lasts for hours</li>
    <li> Delon body butter is the best have found.  Works great and comes in several scents.  Amazon has a good price on them.</li>
