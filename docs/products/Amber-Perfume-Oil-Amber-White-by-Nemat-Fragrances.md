      <li>This is a very light smelling oil and just gets better and better smelling on the skin as the day goes by.  </li>
      <li>and i got so many compliments all the time.</li>
      <li>There is an amber musk from this company, but it gives me a headache (as does most perfumes).</li>
      <li>I love a variety of fragrances and have a ton of perfumes</li>
      <li>Love it but after a couple days I have to take a day or so</li>
      <li>In fact, it seemed to me to get better as the day went on.</li>
      <li>First time I used it it smelled amazing!</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>I found another brand of perfume oil here on Amazon that has much better staying power.  </li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>i am allergic to most perfumes.</li>
      <li>I love this oil</li>
      <li>and she had just gotten out of the shower and put on her favorite perfume oil.</li>
      <li>While I find the scent just &#x27;okay&#x27;-my</li>
      <li>Amber is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>and I still love it.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>Although I love the oil</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>; The scent also seems to be binary; either people love it, or they can&#x27;t smell the scent at all.</li>
      <li>and I like that one a lot better.</li>
      <li>I Love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell..</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful scent- authentic too!</li>
      <li>Amber is more of a perfume, a lighter (yet strong and lingering) scent.</li>
      <li>It leave a very sweet fragrance on your skin.</li>
      <li>It smells like sweet, clean, warm skin.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect balance to each other.</li>
      <li>But other than that this smell is just wonderful!!!</li>
      <li>The deliver was very quick as well.</li>
      <li>It is not as strong as Egytian Musk, but does have a hint of musk.</li>
      <li>Everything everyone says below is true; it smells good the first day</li>
      <li>Hands down, my favorite perfume!!!</li>
      <li>It has such a nice light, warm scent.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I also received the Amber Musk and both of these scents are great for different purposes.</li>
      <li>Nemat is the best brand, and its cheaper on Amazon than it is at my local Whole Foods-</li>
      <li>Amber Musk is more masculine, but has a nice, spicy aroma to it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m NEVER disappointed.</li>
      <li>I was so excited I had to get it.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the soft scent and had to purchase more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been scammed before, but this was a full blown scam.</li>
      <li>Until I started keeping the oil in an opaque container, now it seems to be good to the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; and the ball doesn&#x27;t roll very well</li>
      <li>My daughter loved it so much that I ended up giving it to her, so now I need a new bottle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also mixed them together and found a nice scent of spice and sweet.</li>
      <li>I love how light and simple this scent is.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought a bottle from a different seller which did not have a roller on the top.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it it had a great fragrance and lasted a few hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. I love it! My daughter had some and after using hers I had to have my own. Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> My wife sure smells nice!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance just wish it came in bigger sizes</li>
    <li> This product is so watered down that you&#x27;d have to use half the container to get any scent out of it.  Spend a bit more money and get Amber White sold by Nimat  Itl.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful scent- authentic too!</li>
    <li> Loving this fragrance!</li>
    <li> I have never had a signature scent,...it was like this perfume is made for me! What a beautiful accessory to wear!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil scent for years.&lt;br /&gt;Cute new bottle, but I had to remove the roller b/c it wouldn&#x27;t go on.</li>
    <li> I had no idea these came in roller ball form! This is some of the best smelling oil there is. My boyfriend never made comments about my perfumes until I started wearing this. He loves it! I do find that roller ball has a fainter scent than the amber I have purchased in the little glass bottles so I prefer the bottle for that reason. The roller is nice to have in my bag though.</li>
    <li> I like it just don&#x27;t feel its worth as much money as its charge an it doesn&#x27;t stick to my body a fullday</li>
    <li> by far the best oil ever!!! well priced and last forever, there isnt a day, I dont get stopped by a stranger for this scent!!  smells more like musc to me which i love!!</li>
    <li> You can barely smell a thing. This is generic, watered down garbage. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!</li>
    <li> I had a friend give me a label-less roll on bottle of this scent and I fell in love with it. When it was done we could not find it anywhere until now. The scent is the same, however this one does not last so long. I roll it on and can smell it for about half hour and then it wears off. I&#x27;ve asked others to smell it as well and they can&#x27;t. any suggestions on where to find this scent in another form that lasts all day?</li>
    <li> I discovered this gem through my sister. I got a whiff of it on her and immediately had to know what is was and how I could obtain it. It&#x27;s a subtle yet lingering fragrance that lures you in for more. I love a variety of fragrances and have a ton of perfumes but I&#x27;d choose this one to be my signature fragrance. My husband is sensitive to smell and always complains when I wear perfume but he actually really likes this one so for me I hit the jackpot... a fragrance we can agree upon.</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume</li>
    <li> My order came so fast and I am very pleased with the product! It even came packaged very cute! I have the bottle in this fragrance and I love that this one is a roll on! fits great in my purse also! The ONLY negative thing I can say about AMBER OIL is that it does not last too long and in order to make the scent noticeable you have to use A LOT of product which obviously makes you run out faster. But other than that this smell is just wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> What more can I say? It&#x27;s one of the only smells I could tolerate while I was pregnant and I still love it. It has such a nice light, warm scent. It definitely has floral tops notes, but overall, the effect is very subtle and a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Don&#x27;t stay long</li>
    <li> I Love this fragrance. I was sort of skeptical about it being roll on form but it&#x27;s just as good as the littie bottle with the gold top.</li>
    <li> This is the freshest scent that lasts all day long. In fact, it seemed to me to get better as the day went on. My daughter loved it so much that I ended up giving it to her, so now I need a new bottle.  (I purchased the plain amber scent.) I have usually worn expensive perfumes, but now the prices are out of my reach and I was looking for something different , and this amber oil smells like it is an expensive fragrance.  I will definitely buy again!  Love it!</li>
    <li> MY very favorite scent. I am addicted and always get complements. My boyfriend loves it. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I buy it at my local health food store and it&#x27;s the only perfume I have ever work that I get complements for on a regular basis. It lasts on my mom all day, but for me it tends to wear off after several hours (or I just can&#x27;t smell it anymore?). I tend to dot a hidden spot on my shirt. There is an amber musk from this company, but it gives me a headache (as does most perfumes). This amber oil does not do that. Hands down, my favorite perfume!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful warm scent that never overpowers. Every time I wear it, people lean in a bit closer and tell me I smell good :-)</li>
    <li> First time I used it it smelled amazing! Then after that there was no smell when I reapplied. It was just oil. Incredibly disappointed. My friend has the same bottle and she had the same issue. Very inconsistent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been scammed before, but this was a full blown scam. Everything everyone says below is true; it smells good the first day and then you go to open it on day 2 or 3 and the smell is COMPLETELY gone. I&#x27;m writing Nemat International an email and you should, too. This is unacceptable. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Did not smell anything like the Amber smell. I have Amber scents from other companies and they are much better. I would not buy this brand again</li>
    <li> used amber oil going on 4 yrs. on my body and aromatherapy. brings about a sense of air freshener in glass.</li>
    <li> Have ditched all of my high end expensive scents and wear this exclusively. Nemat is the best brand, and its cheaper on Amazon than it is at my local Whole Foods- which is where I discovered it. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love this oil and I get a lot of compliments on how it smells. The white amber is different than the amber musk so don&#x27;t confuse them. the white amber is the softer smelling. I bought the roll on and seems to vary in smell a little from the regular bottle. There&#x27;s not much difference though.</li>
    <li> This has totally been my signature scent for the past two years... I always get compliments when wearing it and quite honestly the scent just makes me happy :). My one con to this item is its packaging..... Initially i thought &amp;#34;YAY! Roller ball!&amp;#34;,.. However, when i received this item and actually tried to use it i had to almost scrape it against my skin just to get some product out! I guess it&#x27;s a good thing that the product is so secure.. the problem I had with the original nemat packaging was that the perfume oil spilled out of the tightly closed container into my purse.. this happened with several different bottles. All in all great product though.... smell gets better with time.. and it wears really nicely in warm weather.</li>
    <li> I have this in &amp;#34;non&amp;#34; roller ball form too and I like that one a lot better. It seems more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; and the ball doesn&#x27;t roll very well, it never feels like it&#x27;s working. I will probably just take the ball out.</li>
    <li> This is a very light smelling oil and just gets better and better smelling on the skin as the day goes by.  It is not as strong as Egytian Musk, but does have a hint of musk. It smells like sweet, clean, warm skin. This would smell good on anyone, male or female.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t really smell the Amber, I&#x27;d like it to be stronger</li>
    <li> I had purchased this perfume oil previously from whole foods and absolutely loved it. I ordered three bottles online and gave one as a gift to a friend. I noticed that the scent was very faint after the first application. My friend, who received one of the bottles, had brought it to my attention initially but I was thinking the same before she had mentioned it. We both agreed that It seemed like it had been &#x27;watered&#x27; down. I didn&#x27;t bother to return the oil as I live in Ireland so it would have been too much trouble.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this item at Whole Foods, which was in a much smaller bottle...I fell in love with the soft scent and had to purchase more. I refused to purchase the mini $9 bottle from Whole Foods so I did some searching and came across Namat&#x27;s amazon store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two bottles from Nemat - and the postal service ended up losing my package. I contacted Nemat to advise that my package may be sent back to CA. Nemat was kind enough to send me another bottle at no charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and great customer service! I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Watered down this time</li>
    <li> I would give 0 if I could. The first time I used it it had a great fragrance and lasted a few hours. From the second time on there was nothing, just oil. Waste of money. NEVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Love it but after a couple days I have to take a day or so off so I can smell it again. But I&#x27;m absolutely addicted to the scent. Next time will buy from a U.S. Seller bc this took forever to arrive.</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic.  I stopped using my Hermes.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance.  Will certainly order it again.</li>
    <li> This is the true smelling white Amber !</li>
    <li> I love the amber oil roll-on perfume! I originally bought a bottle from a different seller which did not have a roller on the top. Although I love the oil I don&#x27;t want it all over my hands, and I found it was difficult to put on. The roller is perfect, the scent is strong and beautiful and I always get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you wear this and can&#x27;t smell it on yourself, thats how it&#x27;s supposed to be. I get horrible headaches from perfume and love that because it&#x27;s oil, it absorbs into your skin and you can&#x27;t smell it like alcohol-based perfume. I will wear this forever!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and wonderful service!</li>
    <li> love love love this fragrance! Love the seller too!  Fast ship awesome smell!</li>
    <li> Wow what a find ? This perfume is absolutely mystical! I like the fact that it is a natural organic extract. It leave a very sweet fragrance on your skin. I absolutely love it and wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without it. I don&#x27;t use any other perfume oil anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salam distributors were prompt on shipment and provided tracking number to track my shipment. Great service and great product!</li>
    <li> cannot brag about this smell enough. i am allergic to most perfumes. this oil, i dab twice and rub in and get complimented daily. so its effective/pleasant and cost effective. seals are sometimes questionable though. keep in upright position if possible to avoid leakage.</li>
    <li> I was kind of disappointed. I used to buy this product in San Antonio TX at Central Market if was fabulous. Where ever the bottle was it smelled up the whole room and i got so many compliments all the time. Well now i live in Cleveland, I always tried to find this oil or something that smelled similar, Well...I found it on amazon!!! I was so excited I had to get it. When it arrived i put it on right away,the smell was so light.....and it fades away super fast. same Scent just not as potent...not even close.</li>
    <li> Subtle fragrance. I received compliements.</li>
    <li> I just got my oil today! I LOVE the smell..so personal and just not like other scents. I did notice how at first I applied it...I couldn&#x27;t really smell it. As time passed it got stronger which is weird. The deliver was very quick as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this quite a few times now and I can&#x27;t live without it! Everyone loves the way I smell and it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s very strong yet subtle at the same time. I was getting tired of the body sprays and perfumes out there, especially because I kept having to reapply all the time. I can put a little bit on my hair line behind my ears and I smell the same alllll day. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Just a couple of tips/warnings: The Amber White Oil seems to be, for lack of a better term, light sensitive. If shipped in a clear bottle I would suggest switching the oil to an opaque container ASAP to &amp;#34;keep it fresh.&amp;#34; The scent also seems to be binary; either people love it, or they can&#x27;t smell the scent at all. So there is no risk of offending anyone&#x27;s olfactories. With that said just a little dab and you will be smelling great until you wash it off. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t smell it at all but whenever I wear it, everyone around me can&#x27;t stop telling me how good I smell. As far as how long the scent last&#x27;s per-bottle I can only go by the fact that the compliments seem to taper off and disappear by the time I&#x27;m only halfway through a new bottle. Until I started keeping the oil in an opaque container, now it seems to be good to the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping all that in mind Amber White has been my go to scent for years, I have even caught co-workers and even total strangers on the train/bus/grocery store sniffing me when they think I&#x27;m not looking. I even had one person, literally, sniff me out in a department store and made me write down the exact thing I was wearing so they could buy... I&#x27;m starting to think I should keep this a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Props to Rebel FM I thought it was all bull.</li>
    <li> I love how light and simple this scent is.  Wonderful for a weekend running around scent!  You will get asked what you are wearing......enjoy!</li>
    <li> Personally, I can&#x27;t say that I like this much-not that it&#x27;s bad. As someone who is new to the scent, I would liken this to a soapy aroma. On my body, the fragrance didn&#x27;t last very long. Although, I&#x27;m not one to put much on in the beginning. While I find the scent just &#x27;okay&#x27;-my 19 year old daughter loves it very much. Definitely a matter of preference. As for me, I find it neither bad or something I will turn to often. That being said, I intend to try another scent by this company.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, however, the roll on applicator is tedious and ineffective.  The scent is lovely but doesn&#x27;t seem to linger for long.</li>
    <li> I had a friend who I work with wearing Amber Oil and the second I smelt it I had to know what it was. I&#x27;ve purchased this product multiple times and I&#x27;m NEVER disappointed. Other reviewers say that the scent fades after the first use, but only because your nose grows immune to it. It continues to smell just as strong to other people. No matter how far along I am in the bottle people constantly compliment my scent. I absolutely love it and will continue to wear it! Buy it, NOW! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this I get compliments !!! It&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> I found this scent unsatisfying ... the oil does not hold it&#x27;s scent and is not the same as the one my friend has by the same name but with a completely different smell to it.</li>
    <li> Heard about it from the Rebel FM podcast a long time ago. Finally got around to buying it and I can&#x27;t stop smelling it. It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I found another brand of perfume oil here on Amazon that has much better staying power.  This is a wonderful smell so I&#x27;ll use it to add scent to my body lotions - too much trouble to return.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how often I&#x27;m asked what fragrance I&#x27;m  wearing...I just love it. It&#x27;s subtle yet feminine and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend as a gift. Smelled just like I was expecting. Good long lasting scent and shipped fast. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Bought this because  of rebel FM. Bought this from other sellers but just to strong or didn&#x27;t smell right this was perfect will buy again</li>
    <li> Amber is my favorite.  I am grateful I found Nemat fragrances on line.  So few carry this terrific line.</li>
    <li> I first smelled Amber by Nemat on a friend of mine. She invited me over to have a girl&#x27;s afternoon hang out and she had just gotten out of the shower and put on her favorite perfume oil. I could smell it on her from a couple feet away and I immediately needed to ask her what that intoxicating smell was. She showed me the bottle and name. I have hard of Nemat before, but I had never found a scent from that line that truly captured me until then. I also received the Amber Musk and both of these scents are great for different purposes. Amber is more of a perfume, a lighter (yet strong and lingering) scent. It is feminine and beautiful. Amber Musk is more masculine, but has a nice, spicy aroma to it. It is the perfect balance to each other. I&#x27;ve also mixed them together and found a nice scent of spice and sweet. Both of these scents will linger for a while and have people asking you what you have on! I love them.</li>
    <li> Got it on time and smell amazing will order again!</li>
    <li> I think mine has expired doesn&#x27;t smell that musky as i expected the moment i was smelling it😏,i applied it and try to pass someone thought maybe &#x27;ll be like wow!!, but they were busy doing their stuffs i asked if they smelled anything they were like nothing....</li>
    <li> I like the roller. Evey Nemat oil has been great! I keep coming back!</li>
