### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>The color is so perfect and it feels like velvet on your lips, it lasts forever it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear it doesn&#x27;t stain your cup or straw.</li>
      <li>All in all this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Great fixation, but color isn&#x27;t good</li>
      <li>I love this &amp;#34;greige&amp;#34; color!  </li>
      <li>It is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing like chocolate.-Dilara Miller</li>
      <li>The color was amazing.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>On top of that the color is amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a medium to tan skin tone with some olive under tons and it comes out looking more pinkish nude but still amazing</li>
      <li>As consumers we buy most products based on consistency having liked a color, scent, flavor etc.</li>
      <li>, the formula is very comfortable not too drying.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was fast too which I though was a great plus :)</li>
      <li>it seems the color will vary but overall wear, consistency of texture are wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the purest, most vile color imaginable.  </li>
      <li>It may be a cult favorite, but it isn&#x27;t flattering on anyone.  </li>
      <li>I think it would look much better on an olive skin with brunette hair.</li>
      <li>Still love lime crime tho.</li>
      <li>however my bottle is defiantly more brown.</li>
      <li>Amazing product , stays on very well !</li>
      <li>Honestly, I love it but not worth more than $20, if you can&#x27;t afford it a great dupe is l&#x27;oreal everlasting nutmeg</li>
      <li>Swatches below show indoor first two as it appears more brown.</li>
      <li>It stays on ALL day and the color is so rich.</li>
      <li>But true color seems to appear a couple hours after application both on lips, hand swatch</li>
      <li>I love this lip stain so much that I bought it in almost every color.</li>
      <li>Light vanilla (maybe just sweet) scent dissipated after first five minutes on lips.</li>
      <li>I do enjoy the superior wear time for this lipstick as it does better than all my long lasting lip products.</li>
      <li>This is the only lipstick i use it is amazing</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
      <li>It ran right out of the tube.</li>
      <li>Last photo taken four hours after application in natural light makes the color appear more true to company lip swatch.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with wear time and literally no transfer unless eating heavy oil item that you bite directly or very hot coffee sipped from a mug.</li>
      <li>The color was lovely and it delivered the same date they told meit will be deleverd</li>
      <li>Hope this info helps as really</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more line crime products in the near future .</li>
      <li>I had high expectations for this product.</li>
      <li>its great color it too expensive its 20$ on lime crime site.</li>
      <li>If the color would be consistent back to what is pictured it would be a nearly unbeatable liquid matte lipstick.</li>
      <li>The lipstick will wear off slightly if continued exposure to the hot coffee but doesn&#x27;t wear off on cup.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if this is how Lime Crime is as this is my first time purchasing this brand, but it seems really oily and strange when you apply but then drys matte.</li>
      <li>Each swatch produces a different finally dried down color that is more in the brown family.</li>
      <li>Color was what I expected but posting said it was new</li>

<li> Color was what I expected but posting said it was new</li>
<li> But when I mix it with a little of pink velvet it looks pretty.</li>
<li> it last soooo long</li>
<li> My 1st cashmere bought long ago was perfection as color shown from initial wear to taking it off.</li>
<li> Firmly in the brown family with little mauve for first couple hours especially.</li>
<li> It just looks grey.</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips at all.</li>
<li> but it does last quite a few hours.</li>
<li> I like it when i mex it with pink color</li>
<li> Not the color I expected.</li>
<li> The color is not good on my medium/tan skin with blue eyes and blonde hair.</li>
<li> Maybe it would work for Halloween or some other costume occasion when someone wanted to look like death warmed over.  </li>
<li> This was EXTREMELY liquefied.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what Limecrime was thinking, much less what those who&#x27;ve purchased it were up to.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s less than $12</li>
<li> Quite disappointing as it seems different batches from the company produce different colors that are not consistent.</li>
<li> This hasn&#x27;t cracked or caked or peeled off in little pieces  </li>
<li> Does have a little bit of a sticky feel</li>
<li> but I just put a little bit of translucent powder over it to fix this problem.</li>
<li> I wasted my money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen this color on many people, and it&#x27;s AWFUL!!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not pleased with color as  it is not representative of what is shown - shown purports to be mauveish greige</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a gray/beige that sucks all the life out my face and makes my skin look drawn and wan.</li>
<li> Needless to say, it fell short.</li>
<li> It makes me look DEAD!!</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t imagine any company thinking up such a fantastically ugly color.  </li>
<li> so I know that&#x27;s not true :(</li>
<li> ITS AMAZING.I usually have a bad habit of licking my lips while using lipsticks but this it won&#x27;t come off at all</li>
<li> but it is also FAKE.</li>
<li> I hate when you drink something</li>
<li> The color like very sick person or died (cashmere)</li>
<li> But for the woman in the street, Cashmere is a terrible choice.  </li>
<li> It looked terrible once it was on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had high expectations for this product. Needless to say, it fell short. The color was amazing. But it turned chalky on the lips. It looked terrible once it was on.</li>
    <li> Not the color I expected. It just looks grey. But when I mix it with a little of pink velvet it looks pretty. Still love lime crime tho.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I love it but not worth more than $20, if you can&#x27;t afford it a great dupe is l&#x27;oreal everlasting nutmeg it looks almost identical to cashmere and it&#x27;s less than $12 and it actually stays on longer</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is how Lime Crime is as this is my first time purchasing this brand, but it seems really oily and strange when you apply but then drys matte. The color is not good on my medium/tan skin with blue eyes and blonde hair. I think it would look much better on an olive skin with brunette hair. The color gets darker during the day and almost turns a grey/purple on my lips.</li>
    <li> Amazing product , stays on very well ! Will be ordering more line crime products in the near future . The shipping was fast too which I though was a great plus :)</li>
    <li> Not only was the item used but it is also FAKE.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply.  Never had a lip gloss turn into a matte finish but it does last quite a few hours. Does have a little bit of a sticky feel but I just put a little bit of translucent powder over it to fix this problem.</li>
    <li> its great color it too expensive its 20$ on lime crime site.</li>
    <li> I like it when i mex it with pink color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with color as  it is not representative of what is shown - shown purports to be mauveish greige however my bottle is defiantly more brown. I&#x27;ve worn on lips and swatched on hand in both one coat to two coats. Each swatch produces a different finally dried down color that is more in the brown family. Firmly in the brown family with little mauve for first couple hours especially. Quite disappointing as it seems different batches from the company produce different colors that are not consistent. My 1st cashmere bought long ago was perfection as color shown from initial wear to taking it off. As consumers we buy most products based on consistency having liked a color, scent, flavor etc. I do enjoy the superior wear time for this lipstick as it does better than all my long lasting lip products. Drying lip feel isn&#x27;t a big problem at all for me as I prep lips well every day and night. This hasn&#x27;t cracked or caked or peeled off in little pieces  Very pleased with wear time and literally no transfer unless eating heavy oil item that you bite directly or very hot coffee sipped from a mug. The lipstick will wear off slightly if continued exposure to the hot coffee but doesn&#x27;t wear off on cup. Just starts to flake on lips. If the color would be consistent back to what is pictured it would be a nearly unbeatable liquid matte lipstick. Swatches below show indoor first two as it appears more brown. Last photo taken four hours after application in natural light makes the color appear more true to company lip swatch. Of course lip color skin color can alter final color. But true color seems to appear a couple hours after application both on lips, hand swatch so maybe that&#x27;s the key to color differences? Hope this info helps as really it seems the color will vary but overall wear, consistency of texture are wonderful. Light vanilla (maybe just sweet) scent dissipated after first five minutes on lips.</li>
    <li> The color was lovely and it delivered the same date they told meit will be deleverd</li>
    <li> This was EXTREMELY liquefied. It ran right out of the tube.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! The color is so perfect and it feels like velvet on your lips, it lasts forever it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear it doesn&#x27;t stain your cup or straw. I hate when you drink something and there is a big lipstick print...gross! All in all this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Item looked like it was used.  Color was what I expected but posting said it was new and it was gushing out so I know that&#x27;s not true :(</li>
    <li> I love this lip stain so much that I bought it in almost every color. It is a stain. Not a creamy lipstick. It stays on ALL day and the color is so rich. It is an amazing product. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. If your looking for lip gloss or creamy lipstick, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Great fixation, but color isn&#x27;t good</li>
    <li> This is the only lipstick i use it is amazing it last soooo long ITS AMAZING.I usually have a bad habit of licking my lips while using lipsticks but this it won&#x27;t come off at all and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips at all.On top of that the color is amazing.But i would not buy it from amazon since its a rip off on here i would recommend buying it from Lime Crime which is only $20 there. PS. It smells amazing like chocolate.-Dilara Miller</li>
    <li> The color like very sick person or died (cashmere)</li>
    <li> I love this &amp;#34;greige&amp;#34; color!  I&#x27;m a medium to tan skin tone with some olive under tons and it comes out looking more pinkish nude but still amazing, the formula is very comfortable not too drying.  Shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> Cashmere is the UGLIEST color I have ever seen.  It may be a cult favorite, but it isn&#x27;t flattering on anyone.  It&#x27;s a gray/beige that sucks all the life out my face and makes my skin look drawn and wan. It makes me look DEAD!! I can&#x27;t imagine any company thinking up such a fantastically ugly color.  Maybe it would work for Halloween or some other costume occasion when someone wanted to look like death warmed over.  But for the woman in the street, Cashmere is a terrible choice.  If you&#x27;re 15 and just now into makeup, then maybe you could get away with it, but not anyone over that age.  It&#x27;s the purest, most vile color imaginable.  I don&#x27;t know what Limecrime was thinking, much less what those who&#x27;ve purchased it were up to.  I&#x27;ve seen this color on many people, and it&#x27;s AWFUL!!  Purchase another color.  Lipstick is supposed to flattering and this color simply isn&#x27;t.  On anyone.  It&#x27;s almost gross.  I wasted my money.</li>
