      <li>(Make sure it is packed securely,  mine arrived shattered</li>
      <li>Great range of colours, a little more shimmery than shown in the pictures and not hugely pigmented (although this is great to prevent over-application), a great inexpensive choice for people who like to have a range to choose from.  </li>
      <li>would recommend to girls that go through blushes quickly like me!</li>
      <li>The light Colors are so shimmered when you apply them on the skin they look like highlighters.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t cheap quality.i</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
      <li>The packaging was safe, no broken colors, the arrival came on time.</li>
      <li>I am very pale and these colors worked very good with my skintone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only getting two stars because I love the blushes!</li>
      <li>this is by far the most pigmented blush I have ever used</li>
      <li>I am a NC 35-37 in MAC and these brought out the red in my face except for the nice bronze blush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
      <li>Item looks exactly as its shown.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re not so pretty</li>
      <li>The colors don&#x27;t look exactly like how they are displayed here on amazon..</li>
      <li>So, so pretty.</li>
      <li>Needed multiple blushes, these are a little shimmery, but all so pretty and greatly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented and I can wear all the colors.</li>
      <li>They were very workable and blendable.</li>
      <li>Thanks BH cosmeticðŸ˜Š</li>

      <li>All the colors are really pigmented.</li>
      <li>mines was the real dealer with the bh cosmetic logo...</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>High pigments</li>
      <li>Bh blush palette is soft and very pigment.</li>
      <li>So I was pretty bummed that I didn&#x27;t get the coral color that I initially wanted from this palette..</li>
      <li>I have super dark skin and</li>
      <li>Very affordable, colors are pretty, very pigmented &amp; only need little product so it will last you a long time</li>
      <li>It is such a professional looking palette and cant wait to use it on my friends when they need theyre make up done.</li>
      <li>however I am pretty sure it&#x27;s a fake because it did NOT come with the BH cosmetics logo on the palette as pictured on the BH cosmetic website!</li>

<li> and when i open my bh cosmetic blush pallette ,, i was shocked to see that one of the blush cake is broken and fallen apart all over the box..</li>
<li> Mine came on time and it wasn&#x27;t broken!</li>
<li> arrived today and nothing was broken!</li>
<li> they make your skin looking dirty</li>
<li> frustrated with this product and seller.  </li>

    <li> The colors are extremely pigmented but not for me. I am a NC 35-37 in MAC and these brought out the red in my face except for the nice bronze blush. I will be using this to play dress up with my students and for plays!</li>
    <li> Bh blush palette is soft and very pigment. I would buy this over a high-end blush. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the bh eyeshadow palette again; they are chalky.</li>
    <li> Sadly my palette arrived broken and a mess, but I cleaned up and starting using them, after a couple of tries now they seem more pigmented after I used the first layer. It has good color pay off but not that great of a lasting power and you have to take your time to blend. They are a good value is 10 blushes for $7 and change.</li>
    <li> love love love all the colors in this palette mine arrived today and nothing was broken!</li>
    <li> I liked the colors it had it had a good variety colors. It wasn&#x27;t cheap quality.i completely loved it &amp; want to order another .</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m IN LOVE with this blush palette. Seriously if you can&#x27;t afford high end makeup like I can&#x27;t, get this palette. So many colors to choose from to match any look you want! Mine came on time and it wasn&#x27;t broken! It&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
    <li> I must begin by saying how intact the palette was when delivered. The wrapping was exceptional. As soon as I got them I treid them on. I am very pale and these colors worked very good with my skintone. They were very workable and blendable. It is such a professional looking palette and cant wait to use it on my friends when they need theyre make up done. I&#x27;ve always heard so many good things about BH Cosmetics, so I gave these a try and will definietly be coming back for more :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in love.</li>
    <li> Good product. High pigments</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price</li>
    <li> I do love this palette however I am pretty sure it&#x27;s a fake because it did NOT come with the BH cosmetics logo on the palette as pictured on the BH cosmetic website! it came in generic black packaging.Luckily, the blushes are beautiful but I will NOT be buying from this company again!! It&#x27;s only getting two stars because I love the blushes!</li>
    <li> The colors don&#x27;t look exactly like how they are displayed here on amazon.. So I was pretty bummed that I didn&#x27;t get the coral color that I initially wanted from this palette.. But nevertheless the colors are really nice. It was packaged well. And the colors are quite pigmented too .</li>
    <li> I received my order today,, when i open my parcel there was red color all over the box and when i open my bh cosmetic blush pallette ,, i was shocked to see that one of the blush cake is broken and fallen apart all over the box.. I am dissapointed , this has never happened before but i am loosing my trust in amazon products now..</li>
    <li> Love the product. But when it arrived two of the colors were all busted.</li>
    <li> The colors was beautiful but arrive broke</li>
    <li> Very affordable, colors are pretty, very pigmented &amp; only need little product so it will last you a long time</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing! Looking forward to trying more bh cosmetics</li>
    <li> The Palette has great colors &amp; they go on well with my new blush brush.</li>
    <li> this is by far the most pigmented blush I have ever used and I freaking love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Loveeeee it. So, so pretty.</li>
    <li> Lovely colors, pigmented and well packed... I simply loved it :)</li>
    <li> Love it. The colors are beautiful and gives a nice glow to the cheeks.</li>
    <li> Colors are very pigmented, however it did come with a few broken.</li>
    <li> Love the colors.  It&#x27;s very pigmented and I can wear all the colors.</li>
    <li> Great color selection and great color pay off. I love it!</li>
    <li> Needed multiple blushes, these are a little shimmery, but all so pretty and greatly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to girls that go through blushes quickly like me!</li>
    <li> It came a few days early, luv ya. Thanks</li>
    <li> The light Colors are so shimmered when you apply them on the skin they look like highlighters. they all look similar on the skin. they&#x27;re not so pretty they make your skin looking dirty</li>
    <li> This would be zero stars if that was possible. DO NOT BUY THIS! It is a lie, this is not a BH cosmetics item, it is not labeled bh, is not the same shades as neither pictured nor what&#x27;s in the actual bh cosmetics glamorous blush palette. The description, picture, everything is a lie. And it takes forever to ship, I&#x27;m so mad and utterly disappointed/frustrated with this product and seller.  Once again DO NOT BUY, scam and lie. I warned you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this blush palette!  It&#x27;s my go-to blush collection.</li>
    <li> Item looks exactly as its shown. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! All the colors are really pigmented. I have super dark skin and even the pink shows up on me. The lighter colors I can use as bronzers. The whole palette can be used by any shade.</li>
    <li> Great range of colours, a little more shimmery than shown in the pictures and not hugely pigmented (although this is great to prevent over-application), a great inexpensive choice for people who like to have a range to choose from.  (Make sure it is packed securely,  mine arrived shattered and I had to request a replacement)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase! It&#x27;s long-lasting and blends perfectly. We used it during a shoot this weekend and the models all looked glamorous!</li>
    <li> I just received  my blush palette  and I love it..mines was the real dealer with the bh cosmetic logo...the colors are what I wanted and expected. The packaging was safe, no broken colors, the arrival came on time. Thanks BH cosmeticðŸ˜Š</li>
