<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome deal for an excellent product. The she butter was so good I have already used most of it.</li>
    <li> I received the Shea butter very quickly. This is one of the best shea butter I have ever used. It smells very fresh. I am going to try the recipes that are in the e-book.  Please try the shea butter you will not regret it. I will buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is great. Its just as described and I use it on my hair (mixed with coconut oil) and skin. My boyfriend even uses it  I have 2 friends who ordered it after me</li>
    <li> I like the fragrant Shea aroma. I used this in a batch of body butter and it worked just fine!&lt;br /&gt;It was just a bit too hard to the touch but melted well in the boiler!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Shea butter was recommend as I have begun to start having a lot of dry skin issues. This was recommended to me because of the coupon and I am glad that I purchased this. Very impressed by this product and the accompanying e-book was a great help in showing the various ways this product can be used. Great product and great marketing. Hoping that customer service will be as good if every needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great shea butter. It has a wonderful texture and isn&#x27;t gritty at all! I tried a cheaper shea butter not too long ago and it was gritty and pretty much unusable. I will only be purchasing this product from now on!</li>
    <li> Received on time, packaged nicely. This Shea  Butter is the best value for the price. Been using it right out of the package for several weeks now, my skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> The packaging is very nice and less messy than other shea butters I have purchased in the past. Love that I can store it back in the package.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I have just used it right out the package and It is the best and fastest working moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. After only a couple of applications, it has healed my cracked and dry hands and feet. I love the fact that it is organic. And It is very nice to get the free recipe e-book with my purchase and I will be trying some of those soon.</li>
    <li> I looove this product so much i bought another in the same week. I use it for my hair, and the recipe book had amazing ideas that i altered to suit my hair needs. This will be a main stay in my regiment.  I&#x27;m going to try the body butter recipe now that the cold months have rolled in for the added moisture and skin protection against the harsh cold.&lt;br /&gt;This butter is not only organic but soft and easy to use.  It ships almost soon as you order on regular shipping. I&#x27;ve never waited over 3 days for delivery. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I did not expect this to be a brick of shea that I would need to process somehow to make a usable product. Now I&#x27;m not entirely sure what I am going to do with it. I guess I&#x27;ll have to go online and find some recipes for it and whip something up. There is a website address on the flyer included in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outer packaging is very nice! But once opened, the actual block of shea butter is in a common zip baggie. Unimpressive. It does have an &amp;#34;earthy aroma&amp;#34; as stated on the flyer. Not unpleasant, but a bit too strong for my nose. I&#x27;m one notch under neutral on the scent.</li>
    <li> Great product. Received it in a timely manner and it is exceptional. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I will definitely buy Nature&#x27;s Perfect Organic Shea Butter again. The consistency is great.</li>
    <li> I was very excited that I was able to get this product discounted for my honest review. I like the fact that this product comes in a resealable bag. As you get such a large chunk of shea butter, it is impossible to use all at once. Shea Butter is a great multi-purpose item. I use it to add moisture to my skin as well as my hair. If you are unsure how to use this product, it comes with a free ebook - and you can also check youtube for some great shea butter recipies. This is a great value and will last.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Shea Butter! I mix it with my lotion that I use everyday and it blended well. I use it all over my body, paying special attention to my arms and elbows and see a difference in my skin already after only 2 weeks of use. I will buy it again and has been recommending it to my family and friends</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and this was a great deal for 1.00</li>
    <li> great amount of product for the price.  I whipped for a hair treatment but also works great on body</li>
    <li> Better than expected!  Works perfectly in my body butter recipes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve made moisturizers in all kinds of incarnations over the years, mostly as gifts and selling to friends, and shea butter is the best. Great for skin and no huge mess (like beeswax) to clean up.  My Nature&#x27;s Perfect order of 3 pounds arrived in one day when I paid for two-day shipping!  What a deal!  And I  got all my holiday orders out on time!</li>
    <li> mix shea butter and cocoa butter to use on my body</li>
    <li> this stuff smells wonderful and fresh. I am new to DIY skin care and have made a body butter for use on myself and children. and so far it has made our skin super soft and silky. The item arrived as promised. although I missed the e book for other recipes.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter!  It is easy to apply, it smooths right into your skin.  My hands are extremely dry in the winter and nothing has worked as good as this to relieve that.  Highly recommended product.  Nice earthy shea butter smell.</li>
    <li> Love their Shea butter</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great.  I have very dry skin and this Shea butter keeps my skin soft and moisturize.</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer, I use it daily for my entire family. Perfect after a shower or bath, it locks in the hydration without leaving a residue. I love the way my skin stays moisturized throughout the day without having to use lotion several times a day. A definite must have especially in colder climates.</li>
    <li> Great quality and easy to work with!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great you can use it for everything ,the feeling when it melts in your hands is great it turns from hard to soft and luxurious, Its good for foot and it makes your nails shiny and healthy looking&lt;br /&gt;You can rub your body with it and it could be good for massage ,I just used it as it is ,part of it I melt in warm water and kept it in a small jar and kept in my bedside drawer ,I love the natural smell !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my shea butter - thank you for your fast delivery of a great product</li>
    <li> Not grainy always be there smooth!</li>
    <li> I use it to make my own hand cream.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It&#x27;s rich and nutty, like real shea butter is supposed to be. It&#x27;s unrefined so it has a little bit of a grainy texture, however it melts great and whips up perfectly.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter made it for my skin and hard my skin soft and hair very almost moisturize!!</li>
    <li> I use this in my lip balms and my deodorants and it works like a charm! Leaves my lips soft and removes all irritation on my sensitive skin caused by the baking soda in my deodorant. This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I used it in body butters. Wonderful product! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This butter just melts in the palm of your hands and seals in moisture all day. I used it on my feet after a pedicure and put on socks to really get those baby soft heels.</li>
    <li> love this and great prices</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product and I use it for everything. Will definitely purchase more!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  Good quality product.  Timely delivery.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Used this shea in cold process soap at 10%, came out very well. Very nice product</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shea butter.  I ordered this along with a much more expensive brand in order to compare the two products.  The quality of both products is very similar, this one is packaged nicely in a bag (as shown in the description), the more expensive brand is packaged in a plastic container.  I use this by itself and also for making body butter.    Bottom line:  I was so pleased with this product (quality and price), that I have reordered this shea butter twice from this seller since receiving my first shipment.  (Body butter makes a nice gift for family and friends!)</li>
    <li> Amazing, loved it. Made my own cream with it, and whoever I gave it to asked for more. Will buy the same when finished.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Good quality raw shea butter.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time.  It worked well for the recipe I was using.  I would recommend it and reorder as needed.  The hand cream i made was better than store bought products.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my Shea Butter! I made a moisturizer sample as Christmas presents and everyone loved the naturalness!</li>
    <li> Best quality organic Shea Butter! I use this product in the body butters that I make for my family and friends. It mixes well with other oils and holds a nice viscosity when melted.</li>
    <li> Used this to make all natural hand lotion bars and lip balm.  As far as I can tell it&#x27;s high quality, and worked perfectly for my needs.</li>
    <li> This product was purchase to use in an oil mixture for my hair.  It was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I used the shea butter to make a body butter from a recipe that I found on Pinterest. It worked beautifully. I also have enjoyed using it in its pure form. I would purchase from Nature&#x27;s Perfect Organics again if I needed more Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> Packaging was good &amp; enjoyed this product. Great for my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to use in skin care products. The body butter I made using this shea butter as the base is keeping my skin soft during the winter months.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> Great product for making homemade lotions. So glad I got to try it for review</li>
    <li> I love the product. Hate the package.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Easy to use. Melts in your hand. Didnt get an email to view the book😡</li>
    <li> Pure Shea butter! I love this product!</li>
    <li> Arrived packaged as promised. The Real Deal.</li>
    <li> I use raw shea for my homemade body butter. I ordered on Monday and got it on Thursday.  Opened it up right away and tried it out.  Love the consistencyand it left my skin feeling super soft. I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> No, I order Shea Butter but I got cocoa butter. It was returnable but I was out of town. Just get home.</li>
    <li> I have been sleeping on Shea Butter. I had bought some years ago from a local beauty supply store and did not know how to properly handle it. I ordered this and I must say it is so easy to work with. Living in OH where the cold is no joke and my skin has me looking like the female version of &amp;#34;Ashy Larry&amp;#34; from the Chappelle Show. I can&#x27;t have that! I love this stuff. I was able to mix in coconut oil and other oils straight from the package. This stuff is smooth and not hard like I had previously. I will be ordering the coco butter for sure next. The free e-book gives great ideas and recipes as well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  Just received it yesterday, but can already tell a HUGE difference in my skin condition.  Have never used raw unrefined Shea Butter before.  Very easy to apply and texture is easy to get used to, as it melts into skin simply and quickly. Certainly recommend this product!  I have ordered the cocoa butter as well.</li>
    <li> Ordered it and received it within 3 days.  I&#x27;ve never tried Shea butter before but I had heard about it from friends, so thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  So glad I did!  I chose this one because of the free recipe book, which was really cool and easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s real smooth and creamy right out of the package.  I just broke a chunk off and smoothed it on.  I liked the earthy smell, but I also noticed that there was absolutely no smell 5 minutes after I rubbed it on.  It only took a few minutes to soak into my skin and felt wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melting it was so easy.  I brought a small pot of water to a boil, turned off the heat, put a chunk of the Shea butter in a glass bowl and placed it over the pot of hot water (like a double boiler.)  Fifteen minutes later it was perfectly melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After melting, I let it sit overnight on the counter.  Next morning it was ready to be whipped and it whipped up perfectly!  I did not need to put it in the fridge like the book said to get it to set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added some stuff to it while I was whipping it up - a few ounces of olive oil... then I folded in some essential oil (I used tea tree oil).  Made it smell yummy!  I then put my concoction in a jar with a tight fitting lid... and it&#x27;s right on my bathroom counter so I can use it every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was so easy and fun to put together... and no chemicals or other unnecessary stuff on my skin!  Woo hoo!!!!</li>
    <li> After searching high and low for an all natural, no additives, Shea butter I finally found it on Amazon...Nature&#x27;s Perfect Organics 100% RAW unrefined Shea Butter is exactly what I was looking for.  This is a hard product to find because there are so many on the market that claim to be RAW but are not.  The price was also very affordable where as some of the high end Health food stores want an arm and a leg for it.  First of all I ordered it from Amazon and got it within two days and it was delivered even on a Sunday.  It came nicely packaged in a bag that I can store my extra until I am ready to use it.  What I like about this butter is that although it is raw many people do not like the rich buttery smell however being that it is the real deal it is quickly absorbed into the skin and the smell is no longer there just a nice smooth natural feel to the skin.  You can mix it with essential oils if you do not like the natural smell but I just mixed mine with Olive oil and it is amazing.  I work out in the hot California Sun everyday and I mix this with my sunscreen for both protection and intense moisture.  It is especially awesome on the heels of your feet..I have tried everything from expensive salon treatments and nothing gets rid of dry skin like this product.  I have only used half of my product and I have whipped up enough lotion to last me for weeks.  I feel when I use it that I am using a fresh, all natural product that also does not clog my pours.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever use store bought lotions again..you just can&#x27;t compare the two.  It also comes with a great recipe book to make hair conditioners and other lotions as well..I have been having alot of fun whipping up different scents as well.  Well definitely order this product again and again!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended that  I use raw Shea Butter on my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had a bit of difficulty finding it but I am thrilled I finally did. My skin since turning&lt;br /&gt;50 changed dramatically. Suddenly dry, scaly and prone to all over sweating and&lt;br /&gt;hot flashes. The regular unnatural highly scented body lotions, oils etc only made&lt;br /&gt;the sweating worse by making it impossible for my skin to breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Love this product and I have seen a dramatic improvement in the look , texture&lt;br /&gt;and comfort of my skin. I use it just as it arrived, I just rub it between my palms and&lt;br /&gt;smooth it on. I love it !</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used natural Shea Butter.  I made the recipe that calls for only olive oil as I did not have some of the ingredients to make the others.  The Shea butter melted quickly and easily, blended very well with the olive oil. I used it tonight and my skin feels great. Very soft but not oily, I&#x27;m anxious to get some scented oils to mix in and to try more recipes. You need only use a little of the product, it will last a long time so is very cost effective.  I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> The first thing I thought when I seen the packaging of this product is that it was simple, straight forward and if the Shea Butter is everything they advertised it to be, I appreciated the fact that the I wasn’t being charged for a fancy packaging container, but receiving a large portion of a high quality product at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy when I opened the package.  The color, texture and purity of the Shea Butter were everything I had hoped for.  It smelled nutty and the texture was firm and creamy and spread on my skin like butter; not clumpy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best Shea Butter I have tried and is of the highest quality.  I can’t wait to start making my own body creams and hair conditioners with it.  It is a nice touch that this company offers you a free recipe book along with the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from psoriasis and eczema for years.  In just 4 days, this product has offered relief and improvement more over than what my prescription lotions have done.  My skin feels soft and replenished and is not itching.  I feel confident of its purity as my skin is very sensitive to almost anything I put on it.</li>
    <li> Received my order yesterday. Last night I applied to my feet and elbows- both problem areas. I also applied to my face very lightly. I put socks on my feet and was overwhelmed with the results just after one application. Already can see a difference.. I love that it is natural and price rocks! I am going to recommend to my friend who suffers from MS and a lot of the people she knows with this disease as I think this natural product will help with their issues due to being confined to a wheelchair. Also- my husband who is diabetic and has dry skin issues due to his disease will now be using as well.. You have a forever customer!</li>
    <li> I just received my Organic Shea Butter order and I am really happy with it. I tried it out on my face and it feels very soothing. And it&#x27;s so great that there&#x27;s nothing in it except shea butter - none of the usual deadly chemicals found in beauty products. I was in an automoblie accident a few months ago and had a couple of little dings on my face that haven&#x27;t gone away. I was trying to figure out what to do with them. It&#x27;s exciting that I can mix this product with other products and possibly heal all my little dings. I am also happy  and surprised to see it can be used on my hair. I have used conditioners for years which I like for how they make my hair look ...but the ingredients give me cause to worry. And this product doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I love it! I boke it up put it in a blender with coconut oil, olive oil, and Jamaican castor oil mixed it til it was a fluffy creamy butter and use on my skin and naturally curlly hair daily.</li>
    <li> I love that the product is 100% RAW and Unrefined!  The first time I used it I had a sunburn so I used it straight from the bag by itself.  I love that it melted right into my skin and kept me moisturized ALL day!  I normally peel and this time I didn’t so that is a big plus in my book! The nutty smell went away very quickly.  After that, I mixed it with scented coconut oil.  I can’t wait to make lotion bars next.  I am definitely ordering more!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter was amazing.  My mom makes her own beauty products and she loved it.  According to her it is the best that she has used and for a great price.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Was a great addition to the homemade body butter I made. Easy to use, great texture, quality product. Will order again when I use up this batch.</li>
    <li> This is as natural as it gets. Only need a small amount to get silky skin. Arrived in a package that can reclose for convenience. Instructions and referral sites included for &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for more products.&lt;br /&gt;This was bought by my daughter so it is my review (Jennifer)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of Irish / German descent which means, genetically, I have the worst possible skin in the world.  I struggle with most products because of sensitive and horrible dry/scaly skin.  This is one of two products that I can consistently count on to keep my skin in fabulous shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it raw for the skin on my legs and it is the most effective &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found.  For the rest of my body, I fluff it up with some coconut oil and essential oils and it is so nice.  I use a rosemary oil for daytime and a lavender for nighttime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;mix your own&amp;#34; kind of person, but this stuff is worth it and I know exactly what is going on my skin, which is valuable.  And for the price, honestly, it is a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive and overly-dry skin.  It is a real skin-saver for me.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter, it works wonders for my cracked heels I can finally feel comfortable in sandals! It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin moisturized all day! I also use it on my stomach as I am 38 weeks pregnant, I am so grateful for this Miracle Butter I have no stretch marks! I will continue to order this Shea Butter, no other products can compare!</li>
    <li> Awesome service and product! Got to me within 2 days. Works of dry feet like magic! No more callous remover for me and harsh treatment from nail salon!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> I am so glad I returned to Facebook and saw the deal to get this. If a company can sell a product of this value for a dollar you know it&#x27;s good. I just discovered recently that a lot of the Shea butter used is not real. They are hard and are suppose to be of a buttery consistency. This is amazing. So soft and easy to use. It&#x27;s not hard and difficult to rub on skin. I might go through this too quickly just because I love using it so much. I keep wondering if it&#x27;s going to harden or if the quality is going to change in the future. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be of such high quality. This is the best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish there was some inexpensive way to identify the properties to make sure because I just can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so good. I will be ordering from them when this is done. I had to share the link on my FB page which I&#x27;ve never done and I order from Amazon too often.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shea butter great for making my body butters.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter. I was hesitant to start the &amp;#34;cooking&amp;#34; of this raw shea butter, but after I started, it was under 30 minutes and I has the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love it, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Oh my lord this smells so amazing!  My hair and skin love it!!</li>
    <li> Comes in easy to use form. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used raw shea butter and I was surprised at how greasy it can be so go easy! I made body scrubs with coconut oil, shea butter, and cocoa butter. This shea butter was great! Does not have the smoky smell that comes with refined shea butter which was awesome.</li>
    <li> I combine cocoa butter, shea butter, red palm oil and beeswax (in a double boiler) to make my own dry skin moisturizer.  It is the only cream I use anymore.</li>
    <li> What a great deal on some great shea butter!</li>
    <li> It was really creamy and buttery but when melted down left a bunch of almost gritty dirt like particles in the bottom of my bowl along w/ a chunk of something hard, almost like a piece of rock or something. I should have cleaned it before using. But that being said the actual shea was a lovely texture</li>
    <li> This is wonderful shea butter. Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my cold process soap!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for me to use in the cold processed soap that I make.</li>
    <li> The shea butter is great, creamy smooth and natural.  Not grainy or with excessive odor.  Just the natural smoky scent.  Perfect for rubbing right on your lips, hands or feet or all over after a bath</li>
    <li> Although I did not expect to have &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; to contend with and wanted to use the product &amp;#34;straight out of the box&amp;#34;, I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered the benefits of having a host of options with the versatility of this awesome smelling, pleasant feeling Shea Butter. I&#x27;ve found a multitude of uses for this product and love it as a daily body lotion.  I appreciate other reviewers leaving easy recipes &amp; have found many of them helpful. I personally like to whip my butter with tea tree oil for healing or lavender oil for calming applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Media Productions for an outstanding job in perfecting their 100% Pure RAW Unrefined Shea Butter for a variety of uses.  I have treated my problematic, neuropathic, &amp; extremely dry hands &amp; feet with numerous products but have never experienced results in a few short weeks with any other product as I have with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the packaging issues to be irrelevant with the results I am enjoying. In all truthfulness, I find the packaging to be beneficial because of the ease of breaking the Shea Butter into separate pieces to try in new recipes. I can then simply place the new recipe in another ziplock bag or any airtight container I wish. Simply label with a permanent marker until the recipe is perfected, then slap a printed label on the bag/container and voila&#x60; -  another winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discovering the healing benefits for my historically cracking, peeling, &amp; painful skin issues has been fun and much more than relieving,  it actually renders those problematic skin issues a thing of the past. Twenty years of searching for a resolution has finally arrived!  Best of all, my previously dry &amp; painfully cracking cuticles are the best beneficiaries from my purchasing this product. I am no longer self-conscious of the unsightly cuticles I&#x27;ve looked at for decades. I am still surprised to look down and see &#x27;normal&#x27; cuticles without redness and swelling. For that reason alone, I expect to be a repeat buyer of this excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Media Productions! You ROCK!</li>
    <li> I was prompted by a friend to try this for the over-stressed skin on my legs. What an effective product! It works great by itself (and I don&#x27;t find the odor at all objectionable) but the resource of the free downloadable e-book of recipes made it even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the simple body butter recipe, and I know what I&#x27;m going to be making for gifts this year! It works great, and feels ever so much better than any product I can get at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I know EXACTLY what I am putting on my skin when I use this. No chemicals that I can&#x27;t pronounce, no dyes, no fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>
    <li> shipping was SUPERMAN fast.  packaging was Saks Fifth Ave. quality.  product itself is divine.  my go to source for all things shea butter forever.  the ebook is awesome as well!  THANKS!</li>
    <li> Shea butter arrived in 2 days! It was in good condition and I love it! I was not expecting that much.That was the best $1.00 spent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week but so far I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  My elbows, cuticles and feet are loving the moisturizing nature oft his product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also feels great to be empowering women in other countries!</li>
    <li> Was very happy to receive this shea butter - it is fresh smelling, packaged very well - product is double bagged in sealed bag so no chance of leakage in case it got hot in shipping, no dye added. My favorite use to make a whipped body butter with shea butter, coconut oil and grapefruit essential oil. Great price, and great product. Glad to discover a new source for this that I feel like I can rely on.</li>
    <li> Butter arrived in perfect condition &amp; when melted it was clear &amp; pure.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the Shea Butter. So far after using the Shea Butter my skins feels very soft. I will continue to use it. I am a big fan of Shea and Coco Butter products. Thanks again for The  Shea Butter.I will look for other products that you may have containing Shea Butter</li>
    <li> This IS Real Shea Butter!!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Love the packaging and the product.  Would like to get more.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> The shea butter seems to be of good quality, but including a website address and an email address on the article included could be seen by Amazon as a policy violation.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter!! Great price, arrived fast and it was nice, clean and fresh. I showed it to my mother who gets Shea butter fresh from Ghana and she said that it was good quality. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I&#x27;m working to eliminate all chemical from my family&#x27;s lives. It is definitely raw but it handled my husband&#x27;s worker elbows and is helping my feet that need TLC being in heels mostly. All without chemicals. I&#x27;m sold. Good stuff</li>
    <li> I bought this a long time ago and never opened it because I was trying to use up the other thousand products I have purchased and have opened.  Disclaimer:  I am a product junkie.  I bought this for my super dry flaky hands and feet (including my peeling finger nails and toenails).  I have only used it a couple of days (at bedtime) but I absolutely love it and can see a big difference.  When first applied on hands and feet it turns oily (especially because my hands and feet are always warm (cold heart?) BUT it does soak in without an oily feel for me which is what has me ecstatic.  I hate &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; residue alot.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but there is no fragrance which works very well for my sensitive skin.  This amount may last me the rest of my life but I am one happy customer.  I had to find a container to put it in after I opened the plastic which is not an issue for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - alone or mixed with cocoa butter, coconut oil, and a little pure aloe and E. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Skin looks better after I started using for a week. Will definitely return.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. So easy to make body butter that is wholesome and organic. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is really nice! I have always used Shea Butter on my hair and skin and saw the promotion of Facebook but I thought it was fake at first but its real! It has a really nice texture to it and I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this is going to last me forever! It smells great, goes a long ways, and makes my skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> Love how pure this product is and the packaging. A grear product to use all over the body.</li>
    <li> Amazing I love this Shea! Great packaging nice and fresh smells wonderful...</li>
    <li> I had never used shea butter before I ordered this and am so happy I did. I love it and am excited to try making some different butters. Thanks for the great deal!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is great as an all over moisturizer from head to toe. It&#x27;s just a little stiff and has to be broken fown by rubbing down in pawn of hands. Wish it was a little more of a creamy texture.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the product. I will be using this to make some hair care and body butter.</li>
    <li> Great product,  very high quality.</li>
    <li> I like it, it could be packaged better though.</li>
    <li> Great Shea butter made a wonderful ingredient for my body butter recipe.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Shea Butter.  I absolutely love pure raw Shea Butter: I use it as-it on my face, feet and everything in between.  I haven&#x27;t tried any of the recipes from the e-book, yet</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! My husband is liking it just using it straight on his cracked hands. Would definitely recommend this shea butter.</li>
    <li> The best shea butter made some body butter with it used essential oil and coconut! Yummy!</li>
    <li> The product was more than expected, arrival time appropriate.  I would definitely become returning customer. Items arrived in great condition, no broken pieces</li>
    <li> I have been using Shea Butter for about 5 years and this shea butter lives up to my standards.  I haven&#x27;t made any whipped butter yet but I know based on the smell and texture that I won&#x27;t have any issues.  I purchased from this seller after seeing that it was being offered for $1.00!  That was definitely a deal and I will definitely order again even at full price.</li>
    <li> Perfection! Love the packaging and product.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this brand of ivory shea butter. I normally don&#x27;t like the scent of shea, but this one is light and tolerable. The texture was soft. When applying to skin, it was a good soft melt, not a greasy oily feel. Shea block looked fresh and in great condition. No grainy stuff. Packaging was secure. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other products of this kind but this is by far the best product I have ever used. I have a discoloration in my legs. They are chapped and cracked. After using this product for only a week there is no pain for the first time and all the cracked skin is gone. Amazing stuff. I would never buy another product.</li>
    <li> HUGE block of shea butter! Awesome quality.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product!  This is my second order and I ordered two and gave one to a friend.</li>
    <li> This shea butter was awesome.  Used it on my first attempt at making body butter.  Was really easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I melt shea butter in a glass container in the microwave with a couple tablespoons of coconut oil.  Once melted I pour it into containers and let it cool. I use this every day after my shower on my legs, feet, arms, elbows and neck  I  have very dry skin and shea butter really keeps my skin moist.  The cocoa butter gives it a lovely scent. This amount of shea butter should last you 3 - 4 months.</li>
    <li> Paid less than a dollar for this item. I love it! I plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> excellent butter, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The only reason for the 3 stars is the price.  A little pricey compared to other suppliers.  Product seems to be ok.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and intact. Perfect moisturizer for northern winters and frequent handwashing.</li>
    <li> Received the product within the what the manufacturer said.  I have already used product in receipts from free ebook.  I am excited to try more.</li>
    <li> excellant quality and very reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I like your product. It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m using for face, hair mask. It&#x27;s wonderfull !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d only bought a tiny expensive bag of shea butter at the craft store before purchasing this. Never again! This shea butter was exactly what I needed for my hand made soap. I loved the authenticity of it, it looked like someone had just carefully packed it by hand to be shipped. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Smells weird out of the packaging, but once you whip it up into a body butter along with other oils, it turns into a dreamy butter!  Their customer service is great too. They called me to check on how I was liking their product and they sent me an email with a discount coupon to use on my next Shea Butter purchase.</li>
    <li> The best! hands down!!</li>
    <li> Very good.&lt;br /&gt;Its the real Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;And I am in love with it.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! The soft smooth texture is perfect, especially when mixing oils. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fast service and great product</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Beautiful shea butter. It is blonde, which is nice, because I blend it with herbs to make beautiful body butters. Super smooth!  I love how silky it feels.</li>
    <li> We used this on our baby as moisturizer and it really helped through the harsh winter. Would definitely recommend it to others</li>
    <li> Good quality Shea butter!</li>
    <li> great stuff!! used it on a sunburn and it took the sting out and no peeling! great for dry skin in general too.</li>
    <li> Better than expected!!</li>
    <li> This unrefined organic shea butter varies in color and some of it is chunks while other parts are finely grained. Being unrefined it has that shea butter smell which is kind of a nutty scent. This is the original color which is a yellowish or tannish color. The chunks vary in coloration ranging to almost white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This performed well for me in lotion bars and in cold process soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a low scent shea butter you need to buy DEODORIZED. If you are looking for a whiter color you need to buy REFINED. We have different needs for different types of shea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that this is ORGANIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices range widely on the Internet for the different types of shea butter. It&#x27;s a constant challenge to find the best product at the lowest price for a specific usage need (deodorized vs. unrefined, natural vs. refined, organic vs. not organic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this 5 stars &#x3D; I Love It</li>
    <li> This product is very good, it kept my hands soft and smooth all day.  It keeps my hair moist.  The smell is good.  I highly recommend this product, love the packaging.</li>
    <li> this product is great. I do wish it came in smaller blocks. But I cut it and my entire family uses it!</li>
    <li> Texture is very soft, fluffy, and creamy.  Smells WONDERFUL! Blends PERFECT and effortlessly. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve always used Shea buyer for skin and hair. Awesome quality awesome price!</li>
    <li> Love it. Made my own butter mixture.</li>
    <li> Thanks for this product, it is a great price and I love that it had a download of recipes that comes with it!</li>
    <li> Ignore the basic packaging because with a product so divine it sells itself.  I love this product. It&#x27;s exactly as described 16oz of pure Ivory Shea Butter heaven. The consistency is so smooth and the natural smell is very light and comparable to that of Cocoa Butter.  It goes on very smoothly and absorb into the skin almost immediately, leaving your skin feeling very moisturized and soft.  It’s feels nothing like the Shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased in the past which really pleased me. I will definitely be purchasing this product again and recommending it to friends.  I would also recommend reading the ebook provided with your purchase  and trying some of the recipes which are very easy to follow and stellar as well. Definitely worth the five stars.</li>
    <li> What can I say...It&#x27;s great! My skin feels great! Noticeably softer . I will try to access the ebook so I can whip it up with other scents. I have to order some more.</li>
    <li> This has been the best shea butter that I have ever tried. It arrived promptly and the package was in great shape. I have experimented with some of the recipes that came with the ebook. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. What I expected from a natural product.  I use the Shea Butter either alone or mixed with other oils and butters.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it keeps my skin soft and supple and it is great for my hair.</li>
    <li> This shea butter smells and looks just like the shea i purchased when in Ghana. The packaging is great and a lot better than some others that I have received. I</li>
    <li> Nice quality product.  Delivered on time, exactly as stated.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter was a lot bigger than I thought.  It is raw, unrefined, the real deal! Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I received my butter, and I was very skeptical at first due to all the misinformation and confusion surrounding Shea butter also because it was hard as a brick when I got it. The Shea that I have been ordering and using for business is much softer than this butter. I decided to use it anyway for personal use, and I am very pleased with the way it turned out! It melted smoothly into my skin, and when I melted and whipped it, it created one of the most beautiful whipped Shea butters ever!! You can find the recipe on my blog http://prosperitylegacy.blogspot.com/2014/10/blessed-body-brand-whipped-shea-butter.html</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  It smells fresh, the packaging was good and it melts easily into the skin.</li>
    <li> I have always been a HUGE fan of Shea Butter and what it can do for your skin and hair. I received my package in the mail yesterday as promised. It was melted (but it was also 104 degrees in Arizona yesterday :-) so I wasn&#x27;t bothered by that at all. I knew once I put it in the frig it would bind right back together. Which it did. I opened and rubbed a bit between my finger, and IT MELTED LIKE BUTTER! Its the real deal, smells good and is everything I expected it to be. I will be using it on my skin and in my hair. I really want to see if it will help the sun spots on my face. Thank you for this deal..it was truly the best deal ever!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Shea Butter and I am so glad that I finally have tried it. I try to use more natural ingredients on my skin and hair, so this was perfect. Using the e-book that came with this, I made a shea butter, coconut oil, and olive oil concoction and used it on my hair for a deep conditioning mask and also on my skin after the shower. It made my hair so soft and my skin so smooth! I also put some shea butter on my feet and then put on some cotton socks. It really took away the rough spots left over from the summer. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Thanks for the opportunity to try it out.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this butter, I mixed it with other moisturizing oils and essential oil. It smells giid and feels good.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Creamy smooth,  all the things I want in my shea butter. Great alone or mixed with some oils!</li>
    <li> arrived quickly. very smooth, I use it on my hair everyday.</li>
    <li> Great product ! I mix it with a little coconut oil to make it &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; , then it&#x27;s easy to rub onto skin , stays on even in the pool ... very good moisturizer !</li>
    <li> This is a regular part of our health and beauty regimen. Superb quality and excellent in consistency, aroma etc. My husband loves this and loving it, and plan to give as gifts. Thanks for an exceptional product.</li>
    <li> Great Quality  and authentic!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and works great for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> This butter is awesome! Creamy ave easy to work with. It cave packaged attractively added securely. I will definitely be offering again!</li>
    <li> This is the purest Shea Butter I have ever used.  I have been a big Shea Butter fan for the last 5 years.  This is the softest, easy to apply to your body and melt quickly in your hands.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Delightful package, shea butter came very well protected and feels wonderfully rich and buttery on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fresh and pure and I am glad to find UNREFINED and RAW shea butter. Many products (like my personal favorite L&#x27;occitane lotions) are loaded with shea butter - but heat and processing may be destroying much of the healing properties and benefits of raw, unrefined shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am happy to have Nature&#x27;s Perfect shea butter to make my own lotions, salves and treatments.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Very moisturizing.  I had to get used to using it, as it isn&#x27;t liquid, more of a solid that you warm up in your hands and apply.</li>
    <li> This is one of the softest, nicest shea butters that i have used.  I have used quite a few different brands over the years and this is by far the softest and cleanest.</li>
    <li> Totally happy with the product and the price is good to.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I really goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I just got around to using this and I LOVE it! I made a small batch of body butter and it turned out perfect. This Shea Butter is the best I&#x27;ve used so far! Thank you for such a great product :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVED this Shea butter!!!  amazing buy!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Can&#x27;t wait to start making my own natural body butters.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality! Great product!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, very high quality product, and excellent customer service. I received a very large amount of unrefined shea butter that has no fragrance and works well to moisturize skin. I&#x27;ve also used it on a scar on my son&#x27;s face and it has done a great job lessening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a clear plastic zip-lock type of bag.  I placed the bag in a Tupperware-type container to help maintain the freshness and the softness of the product.  Despite being unrefined, the shea butter is very soft and easy to scoop out.  It very easily softens up once you smooth it in your hands and is easy to spread on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner has sent messages welcoming open communication with his customers. Will buy again. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this!  This is better than anything I have ever used on my skin!</li>
    <li> Wow! After all of these years buying Shea Butter lotions and potions -- I did not realize how different this 100% pure butter would be. First of all - it smells totally different than I thought it would, it is less like the commercial &amp;#34;shea scent&amp;#34; and much more smoky/nutty... the scent does disappear pretty rapidly though after it is absorbed.  It comes to you like a HUGE stick of butter and it is pretty solid.  I have been taking a small amount and melting it between my hands before applying, but I do plan on making a more spreadable lotion by whupping it up with some coconut oil.  So far it has surpassed my expections for everything that I have tried it on.  I have very dry/frizzy curly hair and it is very effective and taming the crazy without making my hair look greasy - I just use a very small amount after my shower - mostly concentrating on the ends.  I am a bookseller and that means that I am handing books all day everyday which really dries out my hands and cuticles - this Shea Butter has been the best thing that I have ever tried to stop and reverse what normally just gets worse as we head into winter.  My hands are so much better after just a couple of applications at night before bed.</li>
    <li> Lightening speed shipping. Whips nicely. Very smooth texture. A must have!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter.  I have ordered 3 of the shea butters from Nature&#x27;s Perfect Organics and it has been awesome!!  I have been making shea butter, coconut  oi; with grapeseed oil, and lavender oil.  It absorbs right into your skin and leaves your skin feeling soooo good!!  We gave a bunch out for Christmas and everyone is loving it!  Especially with the weather being so dry this time of year.</li>
    <li> Great product. Everything was exactly as described. Will order again.</li>
    <li> works your skin will be so smooth wow you can literally put it anywhere on your body great stuff</li>
    <li> I have made body butter and hair conditioner.  Product  works beautifully. Rich and creamy. Will be experimenting with adding essential oils</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen Shea this fresh before.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so soft and crumbles to bits when you poke it.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly easy to melt into other mixes.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with it.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;Its Raw, so you can take and make all sorts of fun beauty items.&lt;br /&gt;My Girls Scout troup  will be using the Shea Butter as a base for  body butter and then they plan to give out for Holiday gifts for their family.</li>
    <li> I was so EXCITED to get this Shea Butter.  Looking forward to trying some of the suggested recipes for beauty products.</li>
    <li> This product was GREAT nice feel, great smell&lt;br /&gt;True Shea Butter. Order came very timely as well</li>
    <li> The picture makes this bar of shea butter look like a block of hand soap. It is HUGE. The quality of the item for the price cannot be beat. It is packaged well and the bar is big enough to slice up and use alone or use to make additional beauty products.</li>
    <li> I love shea butter!!! I always can use some! And this came right when it was supposed to! I will use it for hair and body stuff! :D</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is amazing I use it from head to toe &amp; everything in between!!!! Now my husband want me to order some for him. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was very please with this product. I suffer from very dry skin and shea butter seems to be the only thing that can quench it. I was very satisfied with the amount as well as the price. I even came back and bought one for my mom.</li>
    <li> My dry and cracked heels have never been happier. For many years, I  have had painful problems with dry, cracked calloused feet.  I have been putting Nature&#x27;s Perfect Organic Shea Butter on my feet every night - the difference is amazing.  I have tried so many other products.  Nothing has worked until now.  My heels and I are very grateful.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product was very easy to mix and made a nice creamy lotion. It moisturized my hands and gave them a younger appearance. I love this stuff and will not need to buy expensive lotions again! I will be trying it for other uses as well, but so far GREAT product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter, I make my own hair product which can also be use for the whole body, this is great, awesome price</li>
    <li> My item arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I worried about the shea butter melting in the 110 degree heat here in Phoenix but it was packaged with product integrity in mind and it arrived still in the same brick form it was shipped in. The product is wonderful - extremely moisturizing and authentic. No fillers were added, it is indeed 100% unrefined shea butter. I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product in my soaps!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is wonderful it was very creamy and smooth no grittiness, I immediately started mixing it with fragrance oils I love it I will definitely order, more the amount received was more than I expected it should last for a while!</li>
    <li> Just received my order and the product was as advertised.  The product came quick.  Soft and fresh.  Will definately order more in the future</li>
    <li> This product is 100% raw and natural.  I was shocked by the amount that was in this bag.  I was able to make 5 jars of different scented body butters out of this one bag!  I am ordering more to start making some for a street sale now.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this Shea Butter! I am a hairdresser so I constantly have dry hands from always being in the water.  Over the years I have tried so many products to help with my cracked sore hands and I have finally found the one.  Not only are my hands no longer cracking, but the skin is now soft and moisturized.  I love that this product is organic and raw so I am comfortable knowing I am not putting any chemicals on my body.  At night I even use it on my face as a night cream and my skin is so much more moisturized.  I would highly recommend this product, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The smell has me hook :) feels like butter</li>
    <li> this is a great product ... I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever used shea butter; I&#x27;m new to the make it yourself body butter business. I have to say, it whipped up beautifully in the recipes I used. I&#x27;ve given out samples to my friends and asked for honest feedback. They love everything I&#x27;ve given them. It&#x27;s especially good to know that it&#x27;s nourishing, natural, and without nasty chemicals. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Great consistency, softens quickly and feels great! Can&#x27;t wait to use all the recipes for body butter and other good stuff that came as a bonus with the shea butter! Will definitely be reordering, and checking out Nature&#x27;s Perfect Organics other products. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> The product is amazing and it&#x27;s very easy to mix my essential oils. I will definitely be buying this product again</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter!  I use it to whip up my own DIY hair butters.  I add essential oils like lavender, ylang ylang, cedarwood, peppermint, etc.  Whipping makes for a smooth consistency which makes it easy to apply to my natural coils.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin looks and feel great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Shea Butter!  I whipped it with some Coconut Oil and used some essential oil (Lavender!) and made a fabulous home made, good-for-my-skin moisturizer!  I made some for my daughter using some peppermint and some coconut oil and she said her skin is super soft!  Love this shea butter!  It&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
    <li> I used the promo code and got my product promptly. I received n email that my item had shipped but when I checked my mail it was already here. I frequently use shea butter but this is the best shea butter I have used so far. I like that it is unscented and natural. I have used it on my lips and as a general moisturizer. I can&#x27;t wait to follow the ebook for more recipes. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Classy product, packaging and ebook. The shea butter came wrapped in plastic like a small brick of clay in a resealable foil-lined envelope. The color was light ivory and it smelled fresh and had a pleasant creamy consistency. I consulted the ebook since it&#x27;s the first time using raw shea butter.  I combined the shea butter with coconut oil and lavender essential oil. It was a lot of fun to play with, and I went to town on my frizzy hair, my dry skin, and my very-in-need-of-a-pedicure-but-I&#x27;ve-been-too-busy feet. For my feet: I rubbed shea butter on my calluses, covered my feet with plastic bags, then put on socks. This morning: dry rough spots, gone! I can&#x27;t wait to make recipes from the book for gifts.</li>
    <li> I love this product. One of the best Shea Butter&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever bought. I mixed some with Cocoa Butter (by the same company) and it feels so smooth on the skin. I haven&#x27;t done the recipes yet, but I&#x27;m excited to get started on them. I&#x27;ve had this product for three days and I can see a difference in my skin already.</li>
    <li> I really loved the recipe book that came with this product.  It sets this butter way above the other products. Before I read the book I had no idea I could do so many things with it.  This winter was really rough on my skin so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shea Butter on and off for years, but it&#x27;s hard finding it truly organic. If you like the real organic stuff, this is it! The scent and feel are awesome. This is the best year-round skin moisturizer. I recommend it to everyone. This is as real and organic as you will find.</li>
    <li> I live in a very hot, dry area of Southern California. We are constantly in the sun because there&#x27;s actually no way to avoid it. We have been using the Shea Butter for about 2 weeks now. We have used it for insect bites (specifically spiders and mosquitos), mild sunburn, burns from chemicals and of course as a daily moisturizer. The smell is a little stinky, so what we do when we use it as a daily moisturizer is soften it and mix it in with our store bought cocoa butter and shea butter lotion. The store bought lotion really does smell like cocoa so mixing it with the raw shea butter eliminates the shea odor. It actually allows the cocoa butter smell to overpower it. I feel and smell like a nice, soft milk chocolate bar after showering. A friend of mine had to crawl under a house full of mold, mildew, spiders, etc. Although he was fully covered in protective clothing and a gas mask, his arms were swollen, stinging and very painful when he came out. I gave him a chunk of the shea butter to rub all over this arms and hands and he felt instant relief from the stinging and pain. There are many uses for this shea butter and I&#x27;m sure most people will discover a use no one else had even thought of yet. Don&#x27;t be afraid to put it on any part of your skin that needs some relief from pain, no matter what the sourse was. It truly is like real butter, so use it plentifully and use a clean towel to remove any excess after most of it has absorbed into your skin. This is a big chunk of shea butter, but I think it will come in so handy it won&#x27;t be long before I need to order more. The price, shipping, packaging, etc can&#x27;t be beat either. I definately give it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Butters soft, however, the small rock objects hidden inside are not. Unsure what they are or why they are in there but they scratch your skin ouch!!!</li>
    <li> Its AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter!! I must give it 5 stars!! have ordered unrefined Shea Butter from other companies but this is by far the best one yet! It&#x27;s creamier and lasts longer. I also love the free recipe book that come&#x27;s with it! I have ordered one every time I see a special offer. My entire family uses it and it has been especially helpful during this bitter winter season on our skin. My granddaughter and I are looking forward to trying some of the recipies.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the best stuff. This is the natural form, no other stuff here unless you put it in yourself. Easy to use, melts with body heat.</li>
    <li> this product was well worth the money, very high quality Shea butter i have perched  in a while, i will definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> Still working. Have to put it on when its cool. This heat skews even your thinking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Shea Butter for over a month and I love it. I use it on my feet which gets really dry this time of year.  I have shared with my family and they love it too.</li>
    <li> Very good product, easy to use and fast shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> I received my Shea butter quickly, the product was packaged well, and seems to be high quality.  I also like that it came with a free download of recipes for using your Shea butter</li>
    <li> Very creamy.  Good product</li>
    <li> 1st time using unrefined Shea.&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel of this unrefined butter.&lt;br /&gt;Great in my lotions &amp; soap&lt;br /&gt;It does have that smokey smell of unrefined Shea, but I would rather have this than chemically refined butter</li>
    <li> Love the recipes that came with this Shea butter,  we have new products to make. I have been buying shea butter for years to make lotions with now i have made ways to use it. The price point is great also.</li>
    <li> Fabulous customer service&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous product&lt;br /&gt;Fresh product</li>
    <li> AWESOME product!  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants softer skin.  A little goes a long way.  I would order this product again and have let my friends know about it too!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is a pretty good product. You can tell that this is the real deal because it has that distinct smell that real shea butter always has. Great deal for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy/curly natural hair and have always used a shea butter pomade blend in it to keep it moisturized and healthy. I am a convert to the 100% shea butter! Forget the pomade. Now I just pinch a small amount from this GIGANTIC bar each morning, melt the nickel-sized amount in my hands and apply. The smell is so smoky and nutty. Very natural and attractive. Alot like cocoa butter as mentioned in another review. This 100% shea butter is great for skin too. Winter is here but that doesn&#x27;t have to mean the dry, cracked skin that can come with it. Use the e-book for some great recipes and you&#x27;ll be as taken with this stuff as I am! Thanks sooo much for bringing us the real deal!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, packaged nicely and easy to store.</li>
