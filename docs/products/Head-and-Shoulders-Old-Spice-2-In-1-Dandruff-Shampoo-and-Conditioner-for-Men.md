    <li> Nothing great, but it is just shampoo</li>
    <li> Head &amp; shoulder never had my eyes get red and irritated. This product leaves hair very rough. Something isn&#x27;t right about this particular lot.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works well for cleaning and conditioning hair. I have noticed a decrease in dandruff when I switched from a non-dandruff shampoo to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell makes me feel manly, it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works well. I can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo w/ the great scent of old spice.  Does not feel as refreshing/revitalizing as the original formula though.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot to write about this. Head and Shoulders has worked great for me over the years at keeping my mild dandruff in check, and if you like the Old Spice scent, then this is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle might be a little small for what you spend, but it&#x27;s well within the margins of reasonable.</li>
    <li> I love this. Smells great too. This is definitely my new favorite shampoo for the price.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many bottles of this.&lt;br /&gt;Smells really good and does what its suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect this to be a replacement for prescription&lt;br /&gt;and other very serious dandruff products.</li>
    <li> Great sahmpoo to remove the Dandruff s*** you get when you sweat too much or have a dry scalp. Be sure to use it 3X&#x27;s a week.</li>
    <li> Only brand of shampoo my father uses!</li>
    <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders for a while now and when I saw Old Spice team up with them I had to try it.  It is great - relieves dandruff as usual but smells awesome - not too strong but enough to get attention.  It&#x27;s always a good idea to have good smelling dandruff free hair.</li>
    <li> The best! Smells awesome but not for girls, the smell is a little to XY</li>
    <li> smells great and keeps the dandruff away.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of H&amp;S anti-dandruff shampoo. I had been using H&amp;S green apple and was satisfied. I wanted to give this a try because of old spice scent that I&#x27;ve always liked. No doubt, scent is really good, however, I did not notice any difference or improvements from green apple. Infact, I felt it was less effective in dandruff control. I would be switching back to green apple.</li>
    <li> bought for brother so don&#x27;t know how well the product it is. came quickly. smelled good when I opened the packaged.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used the &#x27;Old Spice&#x27; version. Not sure if it&#x27;s only me but I felt I need a bit more to lather up. The other types take a bit less. So I am thinking this type is somewhat thinner making it last not as long as the other H &amp; S shampoos. But the smell is good and works well. I have one more bottle after the current one but I will probably stop after that. The other types work better for me.</li>
    <li> it is awful smell,I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> When I saw that head and shoulders had made a product with old spice, I was excited to say the least. I love the scent, and most importantly, it makes  my scalp feel great and my hair feel soft. My scalp gets really dry in the winter and so this product was a lifesaver.</li>
