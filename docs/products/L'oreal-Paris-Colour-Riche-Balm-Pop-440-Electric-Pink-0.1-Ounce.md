      <li>GOOD!</li>
      <li>Great lipstick.</li>
      <li>The mauve, nude and rose, and the price is what&#x27;s best.</li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>This feels wonderful on my lips, which is fine.  </li>
      <li>The shade Tender Mauve is gorgeous but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Besides, the color is really good.</li>
      <li>This is a much better value and your lips will look and feel great.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, great consistency, very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>this is a nice balm with a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;lips</li>
      <li>feel nice and conditioned.&lt;br</li>
      <li>may be it is my own fault.</li>
      <li>Glides smoothly and smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>where as the heavenly berry is more like tinted lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like lipstick...</li>
      <li>If you want more color then this is not the correct one.</li>
      <li>Who knows all I received was the top of the balm.  </li>
      <li>Love the colour and love what it does to my lips.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Maybe a darker color would work better.</li>
      <li>Based on swatches I&#x27;ve seen online, I also think this one is the most pigmented in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>better&#x27; shade with a more pinky hue.</li>
      <li>Love the feel of the lip balm and the color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Nude color in the line, but feel this one looks better.</li>
      <li>Good color and stays on pretty well.</li>
      <li>Pretty color, nice lipstick</li>
      <li>Feels like a smooth Chapstick with a hint of color.  </li>
      <li>Nice color, long stay and perfect for a day long lip balm.</li>
      <li>The formula is super moisturizing and comfortable and makes my lips look shiny and a-mazing.</li>
      <li>I am an lip balm junky and love this particular color 518 Tender Mauve.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for color, Tender Mauve isn&#x27;t right for you.  </li>
      <li>Right pic was incorrect label</li>
      <li>and I had to use lip-stick first before balm.</li>
      <li>I have no problem reapplying - it just means that I have to stock up and make sure I always have a backup for when I inevitably run out of it.</li>
      <li>Love the sheer wash of color and hydration these balms give the lips.</li>
      <li>its good but doesnt last long.</li>
      <li>More on powder pink side.</li>
      <li>It is very silky.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommended this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t last long on your lips because all I wanted to do was wipe it off and reach for something more</li>
      <li>so i use for a natural look with mascara !</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t know why would they do this, but the product is now different, a lot more tint to it, and less of a balm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s considerably darker.</li>
      <li>So sad they changed a good thing for something that just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
      <li>I like color very much, but it does not stay on my lips as well as other L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
      <li>What a fool to spend so much they dry out your lips</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells like SPF, tastes like SPF, doesn&#x27;t last long and is very drying on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the color is bare.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the staying power isn&#x27;t great, but it is typical for a balm so not a big issue as long as you know that ahead of time.</li>

<li> have really crappy lips, thanks to my habit of peeling the dry skin which makes it worse.</li>
<li> /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t last too long on the lips (1-2 hours tops).</li>
<li> Im going to give it 3 stars because it took a ridiculously long time to arrive.</li>
<li> My lips are always dry</li>
<li> Seems like Loreal decided to change the product slightly, along with its packaging, but kept the same UPC code, color number and name.</li>
<li> At my work we build custom solid wood furniture and we can build a bed and ship it out faster than a little tube of lipstick already made.</li>
<li> Slightly lighter in colour than expected.</li>
<li> L&#x27;Oreal never lets me down.</li>
<li> But this balm, helps my lips stay moisturized with a little tint.</li>
<li> A little bit lighter than my lips</li>
<li> Wish it stayed on a little longer.</li>
<li> Not a great mauve shade!</li>
<li> Disappointed that it&#x27;s labeled incorrectly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great lipstick. Good color and stays on pretty well.</li>
    <li> Love the sheer wash of color and hydration these balms give the lips. I have almost every color now. My only complaint is that the staying power isn&#x27;t great, but it is typical for a balm so not a big issue as long as you know that ahead of time.</li>
    <li> Who knows all I received was the top of the balm.  Nothing else!!!</li>
    <li> Love the colour and love what it does to my lips.</li>
    <li> Not a great mauve shade! More on powder pink side. Plus it came smudged when it arrived, but its too inexpensive to go through the hassle of returning so kept it</li>
    <li> I bought the same brand/color (518, tender mauve) of this lip balm in a store about a year ago and this one is definitely not the same color. It&#x27;s considerably darker.</li>
    <li> I am an lip balm junky and love this particular color 518 Tender Mauve.  I have 3-4 of the correct 518&#x27;s around the house. The balm shade is about 1 shade darker, so I&#x27;m going to give it a chance. Disappointed that it&#x27;s labeled incorrectly. Right pic was incorrect label</li>
    <li> A little bit lighter than my lips so i use for a natural look with mascara ! Great</li>
    <li> Nice color, long stay and perfect for a day long lip balm. But color is very sheer. If you want more color then this is not the correct one. But overall I like it.</li>
    <li> The product that I received, twice, is different from the one on the photo. Seems like Loreal decided to change the product slightly, along with its packaging, but kept the same UPC code, color number and name. I just don&#x27;t know why would they do this, but the product is now different, a lot more tint to it, and less of a balm. So sad they changed a good thing for something that just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
    <li> Pretty color, nice lipstick</li>
    <li> I highly recommended this. My lips are always dry and I had to use lip-stick first before balm. While this one doesn&#x27;t have to. Besides, the color is really good.</li>
    <li> It is just what it says: a balm. Feels like a smooth Chapstick with a hint of color.  I like it!</li>
    <li> When I realized that my Colour Riche Lip Balm in Tender Mauve was almost gone, I literally panicked and had to order another ASAP. I&#x27;ve never been so worried going without a lip color than I am about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I think it&#x27;s a &#x27;my lips but better&#x27; shade with a more pinky hue. The formula is super moisturizing and comfortable and makes my lips look shiny and a-mazing. I&#x27;ve tried the Nude color in the line, but feel this one looks better. Based on swatches I&#x27;ve seen online, I also think this one is the most pigmented in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t last too long on the lips (1-2 hours tops). I have no problem reapplying - it just means that I have to stock up and make sure I always have a backup for when I inevitably run out of it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, great consistency, very moisturizing. L&#x27;Oreal never lets me down.</li>
    <li> I like color very much, but it does not stay on my lips as well as other L&#x27;Oreal products. may be it is my own fault.</li>
    <li> this is a nice balm with a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;lips feel nice and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;good for when you want  some color but not overpowering color.</li>
    <li> I got 3 of these. The mauve, nude and rose, and the price is what&#x27;s best. They are moist just a hint of color. If you go to some to the dept.stores you can spend up to $25.00 for a nude lipcolor or balm from a big name which I have. What a fool to spend so much they dry out your lips the color is bare. This is a much better value and your lips will look and feel great.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of the lip balm and the color.  Wish it stayed on a little longer.</li>
    <li> Love this.  It is very silky.  Slightly lighter in colour than expected.</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect color and texture.</li>
    <li> GOOD! MY FRIENDS LIKE IT!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet as it just arrived finally. Im going to give it 3 stars because it took a ridiculously long time to arrive. At my work we build custom solid wood furniture and we can build a bed and ship it out faster than a little tube of lipstick already made.</li>
    <li> The shade Tender Mauve is gorgeous but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like SPF, tastes like SPF, doesn&#x27;t last long and is very drying on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t last long on your lips because all I wanted to do was wipe it off and reach for something more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t moisturise as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am on the lookout for something in the same shade without all the yuck!</li>
    <li> its good but doesnt last long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more like lipstick...where as the heavenly berry is more like tinted lip gloss.  So it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful on my lips, which is fine.  If you&#x27;re looking for color, Tender Mauve isn&#x27;t right for you.  Maybe a darker color would work better.</li>
    <li> I got mine in  Muave shade. Definitely the one I was looking for, the color is almost the same shade as my lips. Glides smoothly and smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;I have really crappy lips, thanks to my habit of peeling the dry skin which makes it worse. But this balm, helps my lips stay moisturized with a little tint.</li>
