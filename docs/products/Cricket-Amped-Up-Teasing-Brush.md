      <li>Love this thing!</li>
      <li>I love this teasing brush!</li>
      <li>but It made it take a lot longer and wasn&#x27;t as effective as my brush because it didn&#x27;t create an even tease.</li>
      <li>The bottom of the brush is really nice to pick out sections of my hair though</li>
      <li>makes teasing your hair very easy</li>
      <li>glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I love the pointy end to part my hair into sections.</li>
      <li>I love this brush</li>

      <li>love the brush, works well.</li>
      <li>I use this before I put my clip in hair extensions in and it really works great.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this brush to those that know the right products to use in their hair to make it hold &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>it does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it does not tangle my hair, I love it, and I will probably get another, since the price is great on these, just to have an extra one.</li>
      <li>the point at the end of the brush helps to separate your hair into even sections and the bristles on the end make teasing super easy.</li>
      <li>but when I do this makes it super easy.</li>
      <li>I love the look of this brush but it doesn&#x27;t quite tease my hair very well.</li>
      <li>I was use to using a mini brush to do my clients and my own hair (teasing, or just adding volume) and this brush really seemed promising while first using it</li>

      <li>this arrived super super fast!</li>
      <li>showed up on time actually and was amazing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it does great on my thick hair.</li>
      <li>Wonderful for teasing, a little or a lot, or smoothing down the top layer of hair.</li>
      <li>This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s great for thick hair</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pink which is a bonus :)</li>
      <li>Teases my think hair very well.</li>
      <li>I much rather prefer my brush and recommend any sceptical buyers to find a mini brush and buy that instead</li>
      <li>love the other pointed end to part your hair to do layered teases.</li>
      <li>the thistles are super coarse</li>
      <li>This works nicely especially when I wake up and have to run out the door with no time to wash my hair - it helps to pick up flat areas and make it look fluffier and more even.  </li>

    <li> I use this before I put my clip in hair extensions in and it really works great. I love the pointy end to part my hair into sections. I also like how lightweight this brush is!</li>

    <li> I love the look of this brush but it doesn&#x27;t quite tease my hair very well. It could be just because of my type of hair or the products I use/don&#x27;t use. The bottom of the brush is really nice to pick out sections of my hair though and I do like the way the brush smooths my hair. I would recommend this brush to those that know the right products to use in their hair to make it hold &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> this arrived super super fast! it does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it does not tangle my hair, I love it, and I will probably get another, since the price is great on these, just to have an extra one. I can also use it to come out my daughters hair ect... very glad I got this, and recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> This works nicely especially when I wake up and have to run out the door with no time to wash my hair - it helps to pick up flat areas and make it look fluffier and more even.  It does have boar&#x27;s head bristles - so it&#x27;s not damaging to the hair.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Came the next day! the thistles are super coarse so it&#x27;s great for thick hair</li>
    <li> love the brush, works well. love the other pointed end to part your hair to do layered teases. and it was good for the price.</li>
    <li> If you want a tease brush that&#x27;s going to TEASE, order this! It&#x27;s cheap and it does great on my thick hair. I use this everyday on my natural hair, extensions and my wig. It&#x27;s a great product for the price and does what it&#x27;s suppose to!</li>

    <li> I like it. Don&#x27;t tease often but when I do this makes it super easy. Does what it is suppose to and I like the rat tail end.</li>
    <li> My favorite teasing brush! I have very thick unruly hair and sometimes reading brushes just don&#x27;t work well. This one is perfect!</li>
    <li> If you want the  teased ponytail, this is  the way to get it. great product for not much$.&lt;br /&gt;Much nicer than nylon bristles.</li>
    <li> Great little brush, perfect for that little lift you want in your hair!!!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> Firm and durable. Love it.</li>
