      <li>This was by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Nice cool flavor and a good price ($12.49).  </li>
      <li>Let me start by saying I don&#x27;t chew a lot of gum, however, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>No aspartame or other toxic chemicals, and the flavor is delicious and lasts a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>and that is just fine with me!  </li>

      <li>I love the flavor and consistency of this gum.</li>
      <li>The recommended daily amount of Calcium is 1,000 mg - it might  be an excellent source, but that is misleading, it doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to making a difference when chewing 2 pieces of gum doesn&#x27;t even give me a 1/2 mg!</li>
      <li>Love this gum and I love that it is free of aspartame!</li>
      <li>My kids love it, too.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this gum and I love that it is free of aspartame! Best ingredients I have found so far. This gum tastes great, freshens breath and lasts the normal amount of time for gum.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome, only complaint is the flavor doesn&#x27;t last long.  maybe 5 min tops.  cinnamon flavor is bomb though, and better ingredients than the trident s***, which undoubtedly has harmful s*** in it</li>
    <li> wonderful...flavor lasts long...not harmful to your teeth...</li>
    <li> Strong cinnamon taste which I like, but flavor does not last long and it loses its pliability for chewing.  I am happy with the ingredients.  Perhaps it is a trade off since it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical ingredients that make it pliable.</li>
    <li> great cinnamon taste; healthy xylitol (NOT poisonous aspartame);</li>
    <li> It took me a while to find an all-natural sugar-free gum I was satisfied with, but the B-Fresh gums have come through. The cinnamon flavor is my favorite (over spearmint &amp; bubble gum), as the flavor lasts the longest and covers up the slight taste of xylitol the best. This gum isn&#x27;t soft enough to blow bubbles with, but neither is it hard and overly waxy. The flavor, texture, healthfulness, and staying power are all first-rate.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the lemon flavor. This is great gum, great for after eating if you can&#x27;t brush. Don&#x27;t think of it like normal gum --- it&#x27;s more therapeutic and less recreational than regular gum. It doesn&#x27;t last &amp;#34;that long.&amp;#34; The cinnamon is honestly too spicy for my liking, but it subsides after 20-30 seconds. The lemon is great -- have purchased two bottles of lemon and one bottle of cinnamon.</li>
    <li> I love this gum. I have celiac disease and I can&#x27;t chew some gum as it has gluten in it. I also don&#x27;t like aspertime or all the crap they put in normal gum.  This is clean and wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is the best gum I have found for those of us with corn problems. The gum is hard to chew but there is a fix for that. I found that if I add a little bit of coconut oil when I start chewing the gum it softens right up. Careful you can easily add too much coconut oil. I did not try with other oils. Coconut oil is the best so far. Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, the coconut oil also helps the flavor stay a bit longer. This is also the only gum with this type of sweetener that does not have a bitter flavor once the cinnamon leaves.</li>
    <li> Gum was great had a good taste and freshens breath like no other. I would have liked the taste to last longer since the price is on the higher side compared to other natural gums. But overall I was pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> The absolute best sugar-free preservative free gum ... and cinnamon is the best flavor of all.</li>
    <li> The concept is good--not the B-12, tho that&#x27;s cool too--rendering an alkaline condition in the mouth, and thence, via saliva, the gut, which I find soothing on reflux. But the flavor has been inconsistent. My latest batch of cinnamon flavored B-Fresh gum is but distantly cinnamon, with a little fruit, and mint tinges, resulting overall in an incipid synergy of flavors. I suggest that the manufacturerer CLEAN the machinery better between batches.</li>
    <li> Yummy Gum - Great cinnamon flavor and all safe ingredients; no deadly toxic artificial sweeteners. Also chew the bubble gum and peppermint.</li>
    <li> I hated this gum when I first tried it, but now I&#x27;m addicted.  It has a strange taste (think it&#x27;s the b vitamins) but you get used to it and the cinnamon flavor is so potent that it gets drowned out quickly.  Wanted to give it 5 stars, but I really bought the gum for my kids so they wouldn&#x27;t have to chew the aspartame versions and they say it burns their mouths.</li>
    <li> I tried to endure the burning, but I had to spit out. It burns my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that this gum also gave me 3 painful canker sores in my mouth which caused mouth pains for several days.&lt;br /&gt;What the heck causes the burn? I know natural cinnamon burns a tad but this is crazy burning. Was my batch laced with sulphuric acid? How do I dilute it or should I throw it away? I should&#x27;ve just got spearmint :(</li>
    <li> check around, there are better choices.</li>
    <li> Tastes pretty good &amp; lasts a decent time,  but it&#x27;s not a lot of gum for the money.</li>
    <li> finding vegan gum is a challenge but this one is not only vegan but tastes great (sort of like Big Red but I don&#x27;t remember exactly what that tastes like anymore), also a relatively good price&lt;br /&gt;other people may disagree that there is no weird after-taste, I don&#x27;t notice one at all though&lt;br /&gt;the only negative is that if you chew it a long time (over an hour) it gets kind of hard and/or drys out my mouth</li>
    <li> The label hardly screams &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve found B-Fresh to last about as long as regular sugarless gum in terms of both taste as texture. I have yet to come across another Xylitol-based gum (and without titanium oxide, to boot!) that is nearly as good.</li>
    <li> The cinnamon flavor goes great with Xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gum isn&#x27;t as good as &#x27;normal&#x27; sugar free gum but it is good enough and I think it is much healthier.  The flavor lasts a lot longer than Spry gum&#x27;s does.  When the flavor is gone the gum doesn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
    <li> Love this gum. Nice to have a sugarless gum with flavor that won&#x27;t hurt my health.</li>
    <li> Great flavor &amp; taste. Doesn&#x27;t leave an after taste like some sugar free.</li>
    <li> To me this is the best-tasting \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; chewing gum, and I appreciate the added calcium and vitamin B12.  I can&#x27;t say they make B-Fresh more effective than other xylitol gums, but they don&#x27;t hurt either.  The taste is fresh with a good zing from the cinnamon but it&#x27;s not too biting or artificial-tasting, which seems to be a pitfall of other xylitol gums.  The only real problem I have with it is the quantity-- one serving (containing 1.775 grams of xylitol) is 2 pieces of gum, so the jar contains 50 servings.  It would be ideal if it contained 60 servings, since I tend to use it twice daily.  I now have one jar at work and one in my handbag.  At home I&#x27;ve started using a homemade xylitol rinse to save money and get my exposure up to 6.5 grams per day-- if I tried to do that with just the gum alone, I&#x27;d run out in less than 2 weeks!  Would love this item to be on Subscribe &amp; Save though :)</li>
    <li> I like this gum.  I was looking for a gum with Xylitol that did not have titanium oxide in it.  This gum also contains B12 and Calcium.  The label says:&lt;br /&gt;Calcium 0.486MG&lt;br /&gt;B12 - 125mcg&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol 1,775MG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial flavor is a smooth creamy like cinnamon.  I assume this is the calcium.  It then turns into a cinnamon flavor that stays quite a while.</li>
    <li> The Cinnamon is the best flavor..if of course you like cinnamon which I  and my husband do. Great gum for making your mouth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> Love the cinnamon.  Flavor last a long time and no aspertaime garbage!</li>
    <li> ONLY NATURAL GUM that Tastes Great, Maintains its flavor &amp; has regular chewing gum consistency!  LOVE IT!  I&#x27;ve tried a few &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; gums...I couldn&#x27;t even force myself to chew those others...I threw them out.  Oh and xylitol must really work for whitening teeth.  It is in My &#x27;Tom of Mains&#x27; toothpaste and mouthwash...now the gum...and someone told me the other day I had white teeth.... I&#x27;m stocking up on this gum.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for Xylitol gum, or even cinnamon gum for that matter, this is it. Tried the other brands and was disappointed with the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; cinnamon flavor or texture of the gum. Be cautioned, as all other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; chewing gums. Flavor doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I have tried several all-natural sugarless gums over the year.  Most are pretty bad.  They are often not very soft or chewy, and they all lose their flavor quickly.  B-Fresh gum is really soft and has a nice crunchy shell on it.  The cinnamon flavor is very powerful and lasts a reasonably long time.  The gum is good enough that I can chew it for several hours and it&#x27;s not too annoying, though of course it&#x27;s not nearly as flavorful after about half an hour.  I really like this product and will definitely try the other flavors and make this my sugarfree gum of choice.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s claims at first but it rids funky mouth and garlic breath better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Obviously not as sweet and sugary as regular brands but this definitely works!</li>
    <li> For anyone who&#x27;s trying to avoid sugar and don&#x27;t want any of those bad sweeteners, this is a great choice, it tastes great.</li>
    <li> This gum is very good, seems to be the most natural too, with a great texture to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not hard at all, it could really be most related to bubble gum, except with a crunchy shell of sorts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the flavor, it lasts longer than other reviewers would lead you to believe, but not as long as gum with aspartame or sucrose</li>
    <li> It tastes great but flavor does not last very long. Too expensive to continue to buy for such small pieces and short flavor</li>
    <li> nothing special but o.k.  was not as enjoyable as chewing regular gum but supposedly it&#x27;s better for you. so o.k.</li>
    <li> It is so hard to find a gluten free, natural gum, but this one is great. The flavor lasts a long time, and the price is better than the one health store that carries it in our area.</li>
    <li> This gum has a nice flavor. I got it to help with tooth decay prevention. I will see if it helps.</li>
    <li> Simply the best gum on the market!</li>
    <li> Is it more expensive than Trident?  Yeah.  But is it worth it?  Yeah.  It has a nice, clear cinnamon flavor and the pieces do last for awhile (though of course that initial punch of cinnamon will dissipate after about 5 or so minutes of chewing).  I like that it&#x27;s natural and the whole B vitamin thing...maybe it&#x27;s a marketing thing, but you got me, lol.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but the flavor doesn&#x27;t last, it is also not very good for chewing, the batch I got was very soft and even using 2 pieces I have to toss it out after 5 mins.  Back to dentyne for me.  :(</li>
    <li> I love this gum!  I tried it because it is free of aspartame, but now I make sure I never run out because I love it so much.  The flavor is great, and it does not fade quickly.  It travels well because of the hard shell, so I can bring it with me everywhere.  I got two of my coworkers hooked on it too.  Great gum!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this gum! I obnoxiously chew it all day long but I don&#x27;t feel bad because it&#x27;s good for my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;The ships in record time!!!</li>
    <li> Would definitely buy again, and have.  found that vitamin shoppe has for same price and I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;longest lasting flavor for xylitol gum on market</li>
    <li> Delicious and long lasting flavor...stays soft...loaded with vitamin B...you just can&#x27;t go wrong ! ! ! ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> At my 6-month dental cleaning, the Hygienist commented that for the first time ever, I had almost no plaque on my teeth.  This was weird, I thought, as I floss twice per day, rinse with Listerine for plaque removal, and brush my teeth at least twice per day with a really good toothpaste, but I still always have plaque buildup (they say it is because of your saliva ~ some people are lucky and their saliva breaks down plague ~ apparently, mine does not).  SO, I thought, what am I doing differently?  After I left, I realized that I have been chewing B Fresh gum over the past several months, and that was the only difference.  Could it be that the advertising for the product might be true??  That the Zylitol, and maybe the B12 and Calcium actually change the ph of my saliva, and break down plaque??  I cannot wait to see if this trend continues....I will let you know....  Oh ~ the gum tastes better than other brands (Spry) that I have tried, during which I did not get better checkups ~</li>
    <li> Love this gum, taste is a little strong but thats how I like it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Taste doesn&#x27;t last for too long but chew-able for long time which is probably the main purpose&lt;br /&gt;of chewing gum. freshens breath pretty good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to find a natural gum these days, I did a lot of research then I was able to find this brand.</li>
    <li> Love this gum. Best long lasting flavor than many i have tried. I have purchased before and i will again. Wish they sold in bags.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this gum, but it really tastes horrible!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I don&#x27;t chew a lot of gum, however, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to aspartame although I&#x27;m still on the fence with Xylitol. It didn&#x27;t seem overly hard and the flavor lasted a good amount of time. Note, I won&#x27;t chew a piece of gum for more than 20 to 30 min at time. Don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference to some people. All and all good gum as far as I can tell!</li>
    <li> Great taste and excellent texture! This is a great buy. This my second purchase of this gum and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This gum is really good. I tried it because I prefer a sugarless gum without Aspartame. I&#x27;ve also tried the brand PUR and I prefer this one. This gum is a little bit hard, but that&#x27;s the only negative. Another reviewer recommended adding some coconut oil to it and that does seem to help keep it a bit softer.  I love the cinnamon taste and find that it holds it flavor for quite some time. Also, it doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach the way the PUR does. If you want a natural gum without aspartame that does not cause gas, try this. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This gum taste great and I feel good chewing it too. I will not buy any gum in the stores because every one of the brands has&lt;br /&gt;aspatame in them UGH! This gum is great and when I get close to running out I will purchase more :)</li>
    <li> I have a soy allergy so I can&#x27;t have commercial gums. This one is safe for me. It has good flavor and good consistency. If the price was better I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m heartbroken that Amazon no longer directly carries this stuff, it&#x27;s the best cinnamon gum I&#x27;ve ever had.  The B12 just makes it that much niftier.</li>
    <li> Gum was great tasty and held its flavor.  Just do not need vitamins added to my gum</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item several times! I love that this vegan! Flavor lasts and gum is very healthy!  Good price, too!</li>
    <li> Best gum ever! Great ingrediants- taste- lasting power :)</li>
    <li> Very weak cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> Kinda pricey. Good flavor. Grandkids like it, that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> strong tasting, not bad, but strong hit. does not last long. not my favorite taste.</li>
    <li> As a diabetic I need more vitamin b in my diet so this fills the bill</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it works on my breath or how much energy it offers. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as Stride or Dentyne but it&#x27;s the best natural gum I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> You really need to love cinnamon! Good choice for people sensitive to artificial sweeteners.</li>
    <li> Nice cool flavor and a good price ($12.49).  Totally vegan and gluten free.  The product boasts that it naturally alters the pH levels in your mouth so that bacteria that cause tooth decay, plaque and bad breath are eliminated - I have no reason to doubt that.  It certainly seems to do the trick for me.  I chew it for ten minutes or so before going into a meeting and also after lunch.  It helps. B-FRESH also contains no sugar, salt or preservatives.</li>
    <li> Was looking for an alternative to unhealthy gum.  Saw this one and thought I would give it a try.  Flavor isn&#x27;t bad but does not last very long.</li>
    <li> long lasting taste on Cinnamon flavor…not so much for bubble gum…must chew two pieces at a time just to get it to your average stick of gum size though...</li>
    <li> Loved the taste but had to quit using them as they burned my tongue creating little blisters.</li>
    <li> FInally a gum without all the nasty chemicals. I feel good about chewing it. I&#x27;m not a huge gum chewer, and mainly use it for a quick breath freshner. It lasts about 10 minutes for me, but I get tired of having gum in my mouth fairly quickly. If you are looking for a gum that lasts a long time you may not like this. Otherwise I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Used to be a loyal Spry fan, but wanted to try something new.  Spry Cinnamon is very good, but I like the texture of B Gum better.  It is much more expensive, but worth it in quality.  My kids love it, too.  :)</li>
    <li> This gum is really good.  It chews like gum should, and the flavor lasts as long as other gum flavors do.  It does not contain the chemicals and artificial sweeteners that cause digestive problems for me.  Xylitol is something I tolerate well, and this is the first real gum I have found that is sweetened only with xylitol.  Great product.  Pricey, but I will buy again, because I like to chew gum once in a while.  Thank you &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; for a great product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the flavor did not last long or freshen my mouth for a long length of time.</li>
    <li> I try to not put any chemicals and unnecessary ingredients into my body and these fit the bill.  They taste great and fill that sweet craving every now and then.</li>
    <li> This gum has fantastic flavor for being all natural.  I have been looking for Aspartame free gum as well as some other ingredients I would prefer not let my children have.  The reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is that this gum is SO expensive.  No gum should be this much money and it is not just this seller... it is expensive everywhere and I just can&#x27;t understand the reason for it.  but... the flavor lasts longer than other natural gums... a good 10-15 minutes and the gum does not get hard or rubbery after that.  I have not tried the other flavors but other reviewers that had tried other flavors said the cinnamon lasted the longest so I went with that.  I will try the bubble gum flavor eventually.</li>
    <li> This gum is pretty good.  The cinnamon flavor is really great, but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  After 15-20 minutes, the flavor and texture are done and it&#x27;s time to throw out.  But, overall, it&#x27;s good, especially because it has no artificial sweeteners (I mean poison).  The price is a little high.</li>
    <li> I love this gum.  I started with this flavor, because I like cinnamon.  It is soft when you put it in your mouth, juicy, and flavorful.  The flavor lasts for half an hour to an hour.  I also appreciate the fact that, sweetened with xylitol, I am actually doing something healthy for my teeth when I chew it.</li>
    <li> excellent flavor, lasts a long time. I prefer this over mint.</li>
    <li> I cam across B Fresh cinnamon gum as I was researched healthier gum options.  I purchased a bottle of this gum to try, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The flavor is a little different, but I really enjoy it.  I have had no issues with it being too strong or uncomfortable for my mouth.  My wife and two young daughters like it too.  As with any gum, the flavor is strongest at the beginning.  Although I haven&#x27;t really kept track, I think I chew B Fresh gum longer than I ever chew ordinary cinnamon gums  (big red, orbit, dentyne fire).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 weeks, my 100 piece bottle is gone.  I will be buying more, but not from Amazon this time.  The price has gone up 25% in the past month!</li>
    <li> Love this gum...great taste and nutritional value. Always arrives promptly...great customer service...I will continue to order from this store!!</li>
    <li> The best Xylitol gum on the market, and the only flavor that lasts for more than a minute. I give it 5-stars because, at this point, I don&#x27;t expect the flavors of natural gum to last long at all.</li>
    <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T LAST LONG BUT I CAN DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE IT ISN&#x27;T TOXIC TO MY SYSTEM! AND BEST OF ALL SOY FREE!!!!</li>
    <li> The cinnamon is a little strong for me. I guess I am not used to real cinnamon as I am recently Vegan. I am used to the sweet sugary fake stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw people saying the flavor doesn&#x27;t last long. I find I am done with it before the flavor runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it is good for your teeth and your breath does stay fresh for awhile. I also bought it because it helps with digestion. I have severe acid reflux and gum helps. I also bought it because of the vitamin B in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it, I think it&#x27;s just a matter of me getting used to the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped very fast. I recommend this setter.</li>
    <li> Love this product and company!! :)</li>
    <li> Great flavor, good source of Vit-B, consistency is good but the flavor does not last very long.</li>
    <li> Best gum I&#x27;ve ever had! Can&#x27;t wait to order more!</li>
    <li> My teeth are usually very sensitive and hurt after chewing regular gum.  This is the only gum that I can chew and it actually feels like it strengthens my teeth.  It also feels like plaque is removed from my teeth because they feel smooth again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the cinnamon. I ordered the Spearmint flavor and the flavor only lasted about 15 seconds. I called B-Fresh and they said they had a truck that had a shipment that stayed out in the sun too long and she replaced it! She said to let her know if I ever come across any like that again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this gum.  I think the flavor lasts long enough for me.  I like to chew gum all the time.  But normally 30 mins is the max.  This gum had no problems making the grade.  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> What can one say.  It is cinnamon gum.</li>
    <li> Great tasting all natural gum that doesn&#x27;t stick to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend buying it.  Found it at Whole Foods and loved it.</li>
    <li> All natural caplet gum.</li>
    <li> I love this gum and the fact that it&#x27;s not sweetened with aspartame.  Very good taste and lasts just as long as the trident gum I used to chew.</li>
    <li> I bought a few different gums with Xylitol.  This was by far the best.  It is better tasting than Spry and Xyloblast and the flavor lasts much longer.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Taste good, but flavor doesn&#x27;t last long. :(</li>
    <li> Gum is wonderful! Long-lasting chew and flavor. Both the peppermint and cinnamon flavors are excellent. Plus there are some B Vitamins added. Highly recommend! Shipping was fast, too.</li>
    <li> Love these little babies! All natural (at least it tastes that way) and perfect after a big meal. GET EM HERE, NOW!!! lol</li>
    <li> B-Fresh gum is excellent if you know what you&#x27;re getting into. It is a suitable alternative to any competing brands if you prioritize health and the best healthy gum money can buy. In terms of texture, the gum is just as chewy as any gum you&#x27;ll find. The flavor doesn&#x27;t last long, but it is a powerful burst of cinnamon which leaves your mouth feeling fresher than other sugar free gum. As far as the taste, while the initially burst of cinnamon is great, I will often get an odd taste of standard &amp;#34;bubble gum&amp;#34; flavor lingering faintly along with the cinnamon. This isn&#x27;t really a bad thing, just unexpected and something to be aware of. Though ultimately I wouldn&#x27;t say it tastes as good as Dentyne Fire or Big Red, it makes your mouth feel fresher, is good for your teeth, and is good for your body.</li>
    <li> This is great gum; my wife and I have ordered several bottles.</li>
    <li> This gum is fantastic. No aspartame or other toxic chemicals, and the flavor is delicious and lasts a good amount of time. Would highly recommend this to gum lovers that want to avoid the harmful artificial sweeteners!</li>
    <li> excellent product, fast shipping and very satisfying on long trips.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter who loved the bubble gum was pleasently surprise to learn she also love the cinnamon whenI gave it to her for christmas</li>
    <li> This gum is a healthy substitute for trident cinnamon gum, it has a very good cinnamon taste to it. Sadly it does not last very long, the average is about 20 seconds of flavor before it just tastes like sweet flavored gum. I still enjoy this gum because even though its flavor blast is short, it does what its meant to do, Give your fresh breath and help protect your teeth with Xylitol.</li>
    <li> These have a sweet taste, very cinnamon-like... I just wish there were more pieces.</li>
    <li> If you are looking at this gum, then you want a sugar-free, aspartame-free gum, and this gum fits the bill. The cinnamon flavor is sharp. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as aspartame gums, but it is better than other aspartame-free gums.</li>
    <li> This gum is very soft. It&#x27;s made with Xylitol, which is the safe, sugar-free sweetener, which even has been proven to reduce cavities. It tastes really good, the problem for me is the flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long. My son loves it, but he&#x27;s wanting a new piece every five minutes, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome gum for those who require healthier choices. Wish the flavor lasted longer but it&#x27;s better than most!</li>
    <li> A very nice gum. The ingredient listing contains no hazards. Xylitol (the sweetener) is natural and has many nutritional advantages over &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sugar. The intense flavor lasts 2-3 minutes (I chew 4 pieces at a time... I have a big mouth) and the residual flavor lasts a solid 10 minutes. This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and I am very pleased with this product.  The flavor lasts much longer than other similar products.  The cinnamon flavor leaves a refreshing sensation in my mouth.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the best of the xylitol-sweetened cinnamon gums I tried. It has a good texture - not too stiff - and the cinnamon taste is very nice. The taste disappears fairly quickly, but not as fast as other gums I&#x27;ve tried. When I re-ordered, I ordered this one again.</li>
    <li> A bit on the pricey side but does have good taste (lasts a decent amount of time). My kids seem to like it and if it helps keep their teeth cleaner its a win win.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick delivery. Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love this gum! It has a fresh cinnamon taste that lasts. I like that is sweetened with xylitol and that it does not have titanium dioxide in it. Once I found out how harmful titanium dioxide is, I made sure to eliminate it from my diet. This has become my new favorite gum! And note, the spearmint is also very delicious</li>
    <li> Great tasting long lasting sugar free gum with no aspartame!  I think the  cinnamon flavor is the best of all the flavor B-Fresh has available.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The whole family loves this gum.  It&#x27;s the only type of gum that we allow the kids to chew because everything else really isn&#x27;t gum anymore - just sugar and some gum like chewy stuff.</li>
    <li> The cinnamon gum that I ordered online is delicious and since it is sugar free I don&#x27;t hesitate to chew it whenever I want to.  I am enjoying it immensely and sharing it with my friends.</li>
    <li> I love the flavor and consistency of this gum. I bought this gum, because it doesn&#x27;t have sugar or aspartame in it; I was pleasantly surprised to find out it has Vitamin B12 in it! The flavor is a little strong at first, but the flavor lessens.</li>
    <li> This has been the best xylitol gum I&#x27;ve tried from 6 different brands.  This is also the flavor that seems to last the longest, although that&#x27;s not a very long time.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful gum. I find it delicious and like that it&#x27;s free of sugar and artificial sugars. The delivery was fast &amp; accurate.</li>
    <li> This has a sweeter and stronger cinnamon flavor than other alternatives I&#x27;ve tried, and the flavor lasts longer also. They flavor fades sooner than aspartame/sorbitol gum, but for the health aspects I prefer this kind. The b vitamin added is nice too.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few all natural xylitol gums I could find that had sufficient xylitol and not other sugar substitutes or other unhealthy ingredients.  Just wish I could find it at a lower price since I go through these rather fast (3 pieces at once seems like right amount to me).</li>
    <li> None of my family or friends likes it...and that is just fine with me!  Flavor lasts, i chew 2 pieces together while long distance driving, keeps me from getting drowsy and my breath is fresh when i reach my destination</li>
    <li> Ordered cinnamon flavor. Excellent  and it lasts long</li>
    <li> I love this product! My son has several food allergies that include dairy, gluten, corn and soy. It has been impossible to find a chewing gum for him...until now!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to have found an all-natural gum with Vitamin B12!  PLUS it has dentist recommended Xylitol for my teeth&#x27;s health.  This gum tastes good, and the flavor lasts a good, long time.  The gum stays plenty soft for me the entire time I chew it (I&#x27;m not the kind who chews the same piece all day).  It is Vegan, gluten free, soy free and GMO free.  It has 5 calories per piece.  I recommend B-Fresh Gum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  OK, I have noticed that after a fairly good long time, this gum does become harder to chewâ€¦it isn&#x27;t as soft as it was.  However, I am still thrilled to have all the benefits from the B-Fresh gum with only this one drawback.</li>
    <li> Very expensive and looses flavor quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s increasingly difficult to find gum that isn&#x27;t loaded with aspartame or some other incredibly unhealthy artificial sweetener. I can confirm that this gum tastes great and lasts a long time, as far as the flavor goes. Easily one of the best alternatives to using brand name gums from your local store.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, wish the price was a little cheaper, but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> The flavor last longer in the cinnamon gum than the spearmint gum.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried lots of xylitol gums and this is by far the best.  It tastes great and the flavor actually lasts longer than 5 minutes (unlike the others).</li>
    <li> Tastes a lot like Big Red.  Delicious without all the artificial ingredients and has vitamin B to boot.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Good flavor that lasts</li>
    <li> This is the first time I spent so much on gum but after reading a lot of reviews, this one sounded like one of the best. The flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long but that seems to be the case with all xylitol sweetened gums. I like to use it after a meal when I can&#x27;t brush my teeth and will order lemon and fruit flavored ones to give to my kids who don&#x27;t like the spiciness of cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I was very disappointed after an initial excitement to read on the bottle that is an &amp;#34;excellent source of water soluble calcium&#x27; - there is 0.486 mg of Calcium in 2 pieces of gum. The recommended daily amount of Calcium is 1,000 mg - it might  be an excellent source, but that is misleading, it doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to making a difference when chewing 2 pieces of gum doesn&#x27;t even give me a 1/2 mg! If my math is correct, I would have chew 1000 pieces of gum to come close to half the daily recommendation of Calcium intake?!</li>
    <li> Great gum for coffee breath without all of the junk they put in normal gum.</li>
    <li> Love this gum. Gives your mouth a clean feeling. I cannot chew most sugar free gums as they give me the cramps but these do not .i keep coming back for more .  I just wanted to add that I bought another brand called Simple Gum  also and it was terrible. Paid 18.00 plus shipping and handling for it and could not chew at all. So take my advice and buy this gum if you want a good cleansing gum that freshens your mouth does not stick to dentures and tastes good</li>
    <li> Yuck! Waste of money. Buy spry!!</li>
    <li> RED HOT AS CINNAMON CANDY!!! Oh I hope for such s hursty flavor to return to my mouth. - RED HOT AS CINNAMON CANDY!!!</li>
    <li> flavor lasted as long as any other gum I chew and didn&#x60;t get hard like dentyne. The only problem is something in the gum makes it feel like I&#x60;m going to get canker sores so have stopped chewing it. Did try it 2 or 3 times just to make sure it was the gum.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Xylitol is a dental product that supports dental health. This gum freshens breath, satisfies sweet tooth and provided B12 at same ttime. It may not be sweet for a long time, but the good news? This gum is not toxic like most other gums, which are sweetened with GMO sugar made from GMO beets that have been sprayed with carcinogenic, endocrine disrupting glyphosates...</li>
    <li> good tasting cinnamon gum. Really expensive though. But worth it.</li>
    <li> Great idea but something in the flavor makes me naseous</li>
    <li> Delightfully tasty with long lasting flavor. I was pleasantly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw away the gum while it still maintained flavor.</li>
    <li> I believe that I received a very old batch of gum.  It&#x27;s very hard to chew and doesn&#x27;t have the consistency of past bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
    <li> Nice natural alternative to the chemical crap gum out there.  As a bonus, you get your B-vitamins.  No need for coffee!!</li>
</ol>
