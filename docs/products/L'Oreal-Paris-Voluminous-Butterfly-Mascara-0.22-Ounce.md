      <li>I really love the way this mascara goes on, and how it separates and gives the lashes volume</li>

      <li>And I love that I can get it as a subscription product, so I don&#x27;t have to remember when 3 months are up</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used many mascaras over the years, so I keep eye removed and Q-Tips close at hand --</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Lengths Mascara is now my all-time favorite.</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>This one is perfect, actually.</li>
      <li>One of the best mascaras I have tried in a long time.....</li>
      <li>This new mascara is great.  </li>
      <li>have very sensitive eyes and skin, and experienced no burning or stinging with this product.</li>
      <li>strength lies in its special wand, which is perfectly shaped to the human eye.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal shows why they&#x27;re a top beauty brand with this fabulous mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately, you really can get good coverage with this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the first kind I&#x27;ve tried in some time that fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara, but it dries out too quick.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use &amp; got here fast!</li>
      <li>This mascara does exactly what it says it will (and how many products can you say that about?).  </li>
      <li>The product is okay, similar to most mascara.</li>
      <li>Like a freshly opened bag of chocolate-flavored coffee.  </li>
      <li>I just hope this doesn&#x27;t get discontinued like so many other brands I have grown to love.</li>
      <li>This mascara is comparable with any other and is a good value for the price.</li>
      <li>If you REALLY want &amp;#34;Butterfly Lashes&amp;#34;- get some falsies and learn how to put them on!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve reacted to a mascara.</li>
      <li>I usually use two layers of this on my top layers and use a thicker product on top to finish and lengthen my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear, even while wearing all day, yet is easy to remove with regular makeup wipes.</li>
      <li>Washes off fairly easily, but I still use a tiny bit of eye makeup remover to help w/ that.</li>
      <li>I really like L&#x27;Oreal Paris</li>
      <li>This stuff really gets the outer lashes to flare out.</li>
      <li>but I like the mascara so much that I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>so you can really get it into the lash line.</li>
      <li>but it works very well.  </li>
      <li>really pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback</li>
      <li>My lashes aren&#x27;t very long to begin with and are light in color so they need a bit of help to stand out.</li>
      <li>I use several different mascaras, and thought Cover Girl&#x27;s Clump Crusher was on top until I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Mascara this week.</li>
      <li>the older the formula gets.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 50 s and wear strong under eye cream and other mascaras smudge.  </li>
      <li>At first it was very liquidity and now its finally settling up a bit and is thicker to the consistency that I prefer.</li>
      <li>The brush and formula do tend to curl the lashes up more than many mascaras, so with my eyes, I definitely need a thin swipe of eyeliner to fill in.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the new mascara for about&lt;</li>
      <li>Voluminous is easy to remove  with less irritation and contaminantst.  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised that this mascara went on as well as it did.  </li>
      <li>Every lash curls into its natural shape</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m learning how far I can push this.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it dries quickly, completely....</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s always a challenge to find one that works for me and still looks natural.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable and you won&#x27;t find a higher-quality mascara, or experience better results, with the expensive department-store brands.</li>
      <li>brush takes some getting used to, particularly for the &#x27;opposite&#x27; eye.  </li>
      <li>I have stubby old-lady lashes, and while any mascara helps, this one takes me back to the days when I had long lush</li>

<li> I have stubby old-lady lashes, and while any mascara helps, this one takes me back to the days when I had long lush</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and have problems applying mascara due to hooded eyes, and this mascara has eliminated the problem.  </li>
<li> but this mascara certainly does flare, lengthen, and to a small degree, volumize lashes.  </li>
<li> - only darkened to its maximum so that you appear to have incredibly long eyelashes.</li>
<li> No idea why anyone would decrease stars for such limited odor.</li>
<li> You do have to be careful because of the brush--there is potential for clumps until you learn how to use it.  </li>
<li> Seems old and dried.  </li>
<li> It has different types of edges to allow me to get to all the tiny little lashes as well as the longer ones.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;d actually give this a 4.5, a half star removed because I think the volume is minimal.</li>
<li> If you are not veeery careful with the thickness of the application, you will get a lot of flaking during the day.  </li>
<li> to the other mascara.  </li>
<li> You may have a slight problem with it running under the eyes if you wear oily concealer or foundation under your eyes.</li>
<li> I bought the brown/black color, and will be adding the Blackest Black to my cosmetic</li>
<li> My eyes itched like crazy the first time I used it.</li>
<li> the brush takes some getting used to but makes my eyelashes thick and long.</li>
<li> The shape of the wand allows the mascara to coat every little lash and gives it a feminine, graceful curve without clumps.</li>
<li> Not sure if I would recommend it until they fix they odor.</li>
<li> I really need something that builds thickness at the base of my lashes while extending them a little also.  </li>
<li> It goes on thick without clumping, just as advertised.  </li>
<li> I like to use this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly (black brown) as a base coat of mascara, so to speak.</li>
<li> I was skeptical...</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>
<li> /&gt;It does smell horrible though!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not what it has been advertised to be. If you REALLY want &amp;#34;Butterfly Lashes&amp;#34;- get some falsies and learn how to put them on! Definitely NOT Luminous- Way, Way overrated!!!!</li>
    <li> Seems old and dried.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> One of the best mascaras I have tried in a long time..... I received it ahead of time</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara, but it dries out too quick. I am replacing it every two weeks or else it starts to clump and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> like this stuff.  may not be the best mascara out there but it works very well.  very easy to apply without clumping and like the look of my lashes when I&#x27;m done.  will buy again</li>
    <li> Not the biggest fan of this. It was recommended to me but don&#x27;t think I will buy again. Color ok.</li>
    <li> The product is okay, similar to most mascara. It has a very strong odor, which I&#x27;m hoping will go away with each use. (It doesn&#x27;t stink on your eye, just on the wand and tube.) Not sure if I would recommend it until they fix they odor.</li>
    <li> I have been a mascara enthusiast adrift for several years now since L&#x27;Oreal discontinued their Lashout mascara that I&#x27;d been using for some 20 years.  My eyelashes are short, light and thin.  I really need something that builds thickness at the base of my lashes while extending them a little also.  This is the first kind I&#x27;ve tried in some time that fits the bill.  It wears all day and doesn&#x27;t flake or run.  Washes off fairly easily, but I still use a tiny bit of eye makeup remover to help w/ that.</li>
    <li> I like to use this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly (black brown) as a base coat of mascara, so to speak. The brush is perfect for separating lashes and applying a really even coat before adding a thicker mascara on top. I usually use two layers of this on my top layers and use a thicker product on top to finish and lengthen my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that after using this mascara for about 2 weeks I like it better the older the formula gets. At first it was very liquidity and now its finally settling up a bit and is thicker to the consistency that I prefer.</li>
    <li> Great mascara for thinner lashes! I love that it doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge during the day too.</li>
    <li> My eyes itched like crazy the first time I used it. This is the first time I&#x27;ve reacted to a mascara. I was disappointed. It&#x27;s going to my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> This mascara does exactly what it says it will (and how many products can you say that about?).  It extends lashes and makes them fuller without any clumping.  You may have a slight problem with it running under the eyes if you wear oily concealer or foundation under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  It doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
    <li> Love this product made my lashes look gorgeous for a party!! Very easy to use &amp; got here fast! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> love this product. makes my lashes look great.</li>
    <li> Makes your eyelashes look great. And I love that I can get it as a subscription product, so I don&#x27;t have to remember when 3 months are up and I should buy another.</li>
    <li> This stuff really gets the outer lashes to flare out. Plus, it dries quickly, completely.... I don&#x27;t get marks on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> Great price, Great product!  L&#x27;Oreal has (in my estimation) always made a great product.  I have had great lash conditioning when using this product.  Voluminous is easy to remove  with less irritation and contaminantst.  Glad to see my favorite mascara offered on Amazon.......</li>
    <li> Be sure to wash it off every evening and you will love it</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara. My lashes aren&#x27;t very long to begin with and are light in color so they need a bit of help to stand out. I also abhor that &#x27;clumpy&#x27; look that some &#x27;thickening&#x27; mascaras give lashes so it&#x27;s always a challenge to find one that works for me and still looks natural. This one is perfect, actually. The shape of the wand allows the mascara to coat every little lash and gives it a feminine, graceful curve without clumps. One coat is all I use (or need), though I know some people like to use more. It doesn&#x27;t smear, even while wearing all day, yet is easy to remove with regular makeup wipes. The price on Amazon (especially with Prime shipping) is the lowest I&#x27;ve seen anywhere here in town and I can always find the brown/black color I need. I just hope this doesn&#x27;t get discontinued like so many other brands I have grown to love.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  I&#x27;m 65 years old and have problems applying mascara due to hooded eyes, and this mascara has eliminated the problem.  I&#x27;ve used many mascaras over the years, so I keep eye removed and Q-Tips close at hand -- but with this mascara -- NO NEED!  Yahoo!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical...but this mascara certainly does flare, lengthen, and to a small degree, volumize lashes.  I have stubby old-lady lashes, and while any mascara helps, this one takes me back to the days when I had long lush lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush takes some getting used to, particularly for the &#x27;opposite&#x27; eye.  The brush and formula do tend to curl the lashes up more than many mascaras, so with my eyes, I definitely need a thin swipe of eyeliner to fill in.  As for lower lashes, I don&#x27;t think this works for me, either the formula or the brush, so I&#x27;ll stick to a cheaper mascara for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this should probably be in every woman&#x27;s mascara arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d actually give this a 4.5, a half star removed because I think the volume is minimal.</li>
    <li> Mascara is clumpy in texture and brush is not helpful or does what is advertised.  Understand why cannot be found in store.</li>
    <li> The wand is a plasticky comb not a brush.  It does a great job.  I&#x27;m in my 50 s and wear strong under eye cream and other mascaras smudge.  This one does not.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised that this mascara went on as well as it did.  You do have to be careful because of the brush--there is potential for clumps until you learn how to use it.  Once applied, my eyes really pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback I noticed...  If you are not veeery careful with the thickness of the application, you will get a lot of flaking during the day.  I&#x27;m learning how far I can push this.  Fortunately, you really can get good coverage with this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell horrible though!  Like a freshly opened bag of chocolate-flavored coffee.  Yuck!</li>
    <li> This new mascara is great.  It goes on thick without clumping, just as advertised.  As for the smell...brief when applying, but goes away almost instantly.  No idea why anyone would decrease stars for such limited odor.</li>
    <li> the brush takes some getting used to but makes my eyelashes thick and long.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. Easy to use, looks great.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Lengths Mascara is now my all-time favorite. I use several different mascaras, and thought Cover Girl&#x27;s Clump Crusher was on top until I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Mascara this week. It lengthens and highlights your eyelashes so well that several people asked me if I&#x27;d gotten extensions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butterfly&#x27;s strength lies in its special wand, which is perfectly shaped to the human eye. Every lash curls into its natural shape - only darkened to its maximum so that you appear to have incredibly long eyelashes. I bought the brown/black color, and will be adding the Blackest Black to my cosmetic collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive eyes and skin, and experienced no burning or stinging with this product. It doesn&#x27;t flake off or smear. The price is very reasonable and you won&#x27;t find a higher-quality mascara, or experience better results, with the expensive department-store brands. L&#x27;Oreal shows why they&#x27;re a top beauty brand with this fabulous mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this mascara goes on, and how it separates and gives the lashes volume --BUT it flakes off and all over.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of hours I can see mascara flakes all around and under my eyes. I have tried 3 different tubes - same thing. Otherwise it would be perfect. I have yet to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake off!</li>
    <li> I like the formula of the mascara quite a lot. It&#x27;s a bit liquidy so you can really get it into the lash line. I don&#x27;t think that the shape of the wand makes a difference but I like the mascara so much that I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Simply love the wand on this mascara. It has different types of edges to allow me to get to all the tiny little lashes as well as the longer ones. it keeps clumping out of the equation. This mascara is comparable with any other and is a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly Mascara, I have been using another mascara for so many&lt;br /&gt;years and saw L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly Mascara on the internet and tried it and will not be going&lt;br /&gt;back to the other mascara.  It does every thing that it claims. I have been using the new mascara for about&lt;br /&gt;a month now. Great product.</li>
