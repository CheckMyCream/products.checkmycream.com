      <li>Also I still have to floss after I bush because it doesn&#x27;t do a good job getting in between teeth.</li>
      <li>It was good until the end, but I think it had a pressure-sensitive feature that started malfunctioning.  </li>

      <li>It seems like good quality.  </li>

      <li>it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>so I read a review that basically said the cheaper ones were  just as good but didn&#x27;t have unneeded features.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with it, works good for me.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and it has been great for my teeth!</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>my aunt is very satisfied with this one</li>
      <li>GREAT TOOTHBRUSH LOVE</li>
      <li>Wish it came with more brushes though!  </li>
      <li>Love this toothbrush!</li>
      <li>Works well and battery life is amazing.</li>
      <li>It looks nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like getting my teeth professionally clean at the dentist!!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the new one.</li>
      <li>like this one by far the best.</li>
      <li>and it is by far the best electric toothbrush I have had.</li>
      <li>this is by far the best toothbrush i have purchased.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and good products !</li>
      <li>Works great, easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Great item and very well priced!</li>
      <li>Very cheap for a sonicare.</li>
      <li>It is very light, so it tends to fall over if you touch it while it is sitting in the charger.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly, gets my teach super clean and leave my mouth feeling fresh!</li>
      <li>the more I use it.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I like the vibrating head of this better.</li>
      <li>have used one for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Love the auto turn off after 2 minutes</li>
      <li>and I love the results.</li>
      <li>I love my sonic care tooth brush, however I don&#x27;t like their longevity.  </li>
      <li>Sonicare Essence is much more stable.</li>
      <li>none of the others have lasted more than 2.</li>
      <li>These vibrations are like shaking - the handle shakes more than the bristle, and since plastic hits plastic</li>
      <li>I think you guys should do better.</li>
      <li>Does everything my dentist asks and more.</li>
      <li>I bought many styles of Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not paying $200+ for their top of the line brush to get the speed i had for $30</li>
      <li>a better note</li>
      <li>Advanced version of the proposed purchase!</li>
      <li>I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>I will buy some more heads and see if they work.</li>
      <li>It did a better job than I could do with a manual toothbrush, but the sonic movements of the Sonicare make my teeth even cleaner.  </li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re better off brushing by hand.  </li>
      <li>i just wanted a toothbrush that would work and didn&#x27;t want too many buttons to deal with or complexities that could break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very excited</li>
      <li>So far, so good!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect size, works great.  Great price.</li>
    <li> My first and only electric brush.  It seems like good quality.  My next checkup will be the litmus test to determine the benefits of using it.</li>
    <li> Very loud.&lt;br /&gt;I have had Sonicare brushes over the years. Mine always die when the metal stem that holds the brush head gets loose. The vibration gets very loud until the stem finally breaks. This unit was like that out of the box new.  I see others here seem to have had the same problem. I&#x27;m going to get one of the more expensive models. I am disappointed in Sonicare, though.</li>
    <li> This sucker is LOUD. I&#x27;ve returned two of them because of this. I have owned Sonicares for many years, but this one is virtually unusable if other people are sleeping in a nearby room. I would avoid this model.</li>
    <li> This budget Sonicare buzzed so badly when I first turned it on that I immediately boxed it back up and sent it back.  It was ridiculously loud.  I&#x27;d intended it to replace a 9 year old Elite model that wasn&#x27;t holding its charge.  I&#x27;m still using the Elite, which works smoothly and without any of the rattling on this new model.</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation for my friend who is a dental hygienist. I did not rate it five stars due to it&#x27;s power. Sounds strange I know but the power is so forceful that toothpaste shoots out of my mouth while brushing! Unless you can completely close your mouth while brushing, you might experience the same thing. That said my teeth feel very clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> Coming from a regular toothbrush this thing seems powerful.  Flash forward a few weeks and I regret not switching to a powered toothbrush earlier.  My wife has an OralB which has a rotating head.  I like the vibrating head of this better.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare HX6211/04 2 Series Plaque Control Rechargeable Toothbrush</li>
    <li> What a waste of a two minute timer, because that is all it is. You have to buy the more expense model to get the quad timer that tells you to move on to the next quarter of your mouth. Otherwise it is great. It is very light, so it tends to fall over if you touch it while it is sitting in the charger.</li>
    <li> Awkward to hold with its boxy shape and poorly chosen plastic (feels slippery even when its dry) and is very loud. The last one I had lasted 8 years and was comfortable to use, with 5 different settings.&lt;br /&gt;Philips has lost another customer.</li>
    <li> Very cheap for a sonicare. When putting it up to my teeth it would slow up a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the $. Best to get one more expensive.</li>
    <li> Satisfaction, but may be I chose the wrong model. Is not I want that money.</li>
    <li> A noisy beast! I have a previous Sonicare &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothbrush and the connector to the brush heads corroded over time causing me to need a new one. This particular model is about 5 times louder than my previous whitening model it also has a cheaper plastic feel to it. Other than that the only feature missing is the whitening feature which I found questionable what it was really doing anyway.</li>
    <li> Gift for my 60+ father and he loves it! A must have for anyone wanting to have great dental health and lower dental bills!</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted. Lacks the 30sec timer and the unit intermediately switches on and off. I missed the window to return. I would not purchase it again</li>
    <li> Missing part(the brush)</li>
    <li> It &#x27;s good quality , but the effect is not good !</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush takes a little getting used to, but once that period is over my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works very well, as have all Phillips Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned.  When used as directed, they do clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They tend to have a lifespan of about two years before they break.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!!!! Great product!</li>
    <li> It is the cheaper version without reminder timers for when to move the brush, so look at a clock, set a timer on your phone or count to 30. The pulsations are the same as the higher priced models. This was a fine deal that replaced the diamond clean model that lasted 6 years. Register online and the warranty is extended for 6 months longer. ..so 2 1/2 years. Would not use any other type of brush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; of some more expensive Sonic Cares, but it gets the job done. There is everything I need here. It has an auto 2 min timer built in. I previously had a E-series Sonic care. It cleaned good, but I hated it. If you didn&#x27;t thoroughly dry the brush, it would get the nastiest gunk under the head and on the base. This toothbrush stays looking clean, because the heads don&#x27;t have the large base that the E-series does. The base is nice a small (especially compared to the bulky E-series ones). The toothbrush itself cleans really good, too. My dental health has noticeably improved since I started using Sonic Care brushes. The heads are a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do. For the money it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Have been using Sonicare products for several years.  They are the best.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;I have used one for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;My 14 year old grandson wanted one so I got it for him, he now brushes twice a day without me telling him.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone that wants to care of their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Additional heads may be purchased so more than one person can use the same charger.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Replaced my $200+ Sonicare that crapped out.  Doesn&#x27;t have the 5 or 6 setting that I never ever used even once.  If you&#x27;re are in the same boat, then you are a fool to buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Like others the vibration of the unit on my teeth was different at first. It reminded me of a certain tool they use in my dental office. It was not bad but different from anything I had used before. My teeth felt cleaner than they had ever felt before. I have had the unit only a few weeks before my last dental checkup, and was told my gums and teeth looked better than any checkup before. Love this unit and look forward to my next dental checkup.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush turned out to be perfect for me. the slim design of the brush-head allows easy brushing around big molars in the back and little nooks and crannies inside my teeth. it has a 2-minute timer but only one speed which is not bothersome to me. The handle part is slim as well, with easy on/off button. It&#x27;s a bit noisy but again not a problem as I like the design so much...</li>
    <li> This is a great basic Sonicare.  I prefer it to the others which have multiple settings since I only use the one basic setting.  For anyone who has not tried a Sonicare, I highly recommend it.  Your teeth will feel like you just came from the dentist!</li>
    <li> I am happy with my new electric toothbrush, it is not as powerful as my previous one, but it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Awesome electric toothbrush for the price.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older Sonicare with this new model. Working fine.</li>
    <li> Nice brush at a reasonable price. Does everything my dentist asks and more.</li>
    <li> Cheap flimsy returned.</li>
    <li> If youbdidnt use this tooth brush then you haven&#x27;t brushed youbteeth befor.&lt;br /&gt;Same feeling you have after a profisional cleaning sestion.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush so far is great. My teeth feel cleaner than using a conventional toothbrush. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is when pictured it was shown with a travel case, however when it got here there was no case in the box. My wife purchased the same toothbrush and hers came with a case, that is why i thought one would be in the box, Amazon does not carry the case for my toothbrush so i had to purchase the one they carry and compared to the case my wife got and with a well place dremil tool i was able to make it so my toothbrush would fit perfactly.</li>
    <li> Rattles like crazy, I&#x27;d definitely recommend the higher end models.</li>
    <li> This is a plaque control brush, and It is a bit louder than less effective electric brushes; however, it really seems to do the job of removing plaque. It took a day or two to get accustomed to the noise compared with my previous Sonicare, but this one clearly has more power.</li>
    <li> I owned this Sonicare and a higher end model that I purchased from the dentist.  This one functions the same as the higher end model just with less functions.  It doesn&#x27;t have the multiple settings the higher price one has.  Also this is very noisy from the motor of the toothbrush.  The higher end version is much better but you can&#x27;t really complained much since this one is so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend this if you are looking for a basic electric toothbrush.  My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush as manual ones are harsh on the gums.</li>
    <li> Purchased at an affordable price. Yes it is noisy but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I like the toothbrush and the price was right. However, I&#x27;m giving it three stars because battery life seems to be an issue. I need to charge every 4-5 days. Otherwise it is a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Easy to reach hard to brush areas assured of proper cleaning.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush for the price!</li>
    <li> Cheap light plastic material. Feels like a disposable/battery operated toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use my new Philips Sonicare toothbrush when I unboxed it. I didn&#x27;t get to do that though because the head does not stay on the handle. It just loosely sits on there and vibrates right off. I will buy some more heads and see if they work. I am not happy at all with this product so far.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. One of the best electric brushes for the price! recharges quickly, battery lasts a long time. Love the auto turn off after 2 minutes</li>
    <li> Great sonic toothbrush for the price</li>
    <li> Cheap cost and cheaply made.</li>
    <li> The brush head didn&#x27;t fit down properly, so the whole thing vibrated with a high-pitched whine, like an angry mosquito.</li>
    <li> The noise is too big, can&#x27;t stand. Typical Chinese manufacturing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a temporary replacement for one of the more expensive Sonicare toothbrushes that was being replaced under warranty.  This brush is on the low end of the product line and I can see why it was so inexpensive.  It is not much like the higher priced sonicare brushes at all.  The brush movement is very different and doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much.  I will be glad to get back to my usual brush which was a Sonicare Healthy White that was twice the price of this model.</li>
    <li> I like the product. But quite weird that when I opened the package, there seemed some space missing something.</li>
    <li> The motor on this squeals so loud it wakes up everyone in my house. I thought it was broken but discovered others have the same complaint. My wife&#x27;s Oral B has a normal buzz. Nothing like the obnoxious, high-pitched sound this model makes. So disappointed I threw away money on this product I can&#x27;t even use.</li>
    <li> bought for little brother, hope it will be good for his teeth</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to clean. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s loud.</li>
    <li> I got 2 and right away i noticed that my wifes didnt last more than a day the battery, now after 3 weeks im seeing mine also failing, probably thats why was on discount :/ would give 5 stars if just the battery last as should.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, the disadvantage is that the battery charge takes a long time! Advanced version of the proposed purchase!</li>
    <li> as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> This thing is really loud.  One foot away the sound meter says 72db.  For the previous model Essence those were 56db.  Normal conversations are 60-65db.  Normal piano practice is 60-70db.  There is no way this thing is going to not bother someone else in an adjoining room.  And if you are in a hotel room without a separate bathroom,  ahhhh!!!!!  Pillows over your head will not save you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent it back to Amazon as defective.  If you live alone then this might be ok.  But if you wake up before others this will be a nuisance.  Phillips needs to get their act together on this one.</li>
    <li> Works great so far! Has a built in 2 minute timer that is very convenient. Only con is the brush head is small size.</li>
    <li> I have had several sonic toothbrushes  and have used them for many years this model is poor in comparison . it seems like it is going to shut off for the first thirty seconds or so, has a raised mark on side that feels like it will grab your lip. I am disappointed .</li>
    <li> My old version felt better. My mouth felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> Much more noisy than my previous sonicare (healthywhite model). Might just be the way this model works, however it&#x27;s hard to live with this level of noise after getting used to previous models. Ordered easyclean model instead, which is much quieter.</li>
    <li> I bought many styles of Sonicare.  There is no need to buy one with all the features.  You&#x27;re only going to use the single speed anyway.  At least I do.  So yeah, just save the bux and get this one.  It&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> why miss toothbrush?so disapointed</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this model does not pause every 30 seconds to remind you to change position in the mouth. That is a very helpful feature to have.</li>
    <li> I still am not sure about which of the replacement brush head is compatible with this model.....Can anybody give me any suggestion?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes for 20+ years now and this is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare 1&lt;br /&gt;Design flaw, kept getting mold in between the unit and the brush heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral B&lt;br /&gt;Teeth not as clean as Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare 2 (this unit)&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous.  Teeth feel like you just went to the dentist.  Once you start using this you will not be able to go back to manual brushing.  The differences between this unit and the more expensive 2 Series are the additional brush options and number of buttons on the handle.  Keep it simple, stupid.  Get this one.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no comparison between a manual and electric toothbrush -- the manual just can&#x27;t get your teeth nearly as clean. Our ortho is adamant that his patients use electric brushes, so once my son got braces I went out to buy him a Philips. Two years later, that one broke when it fell two stories off the windowsill. (Long story.) There was no question about replacing it with another Philips immediately -- they just work that well. I love that the timer tells him how long to brush, he loves that the Philips does all the work for him, and our ortho loves how clean his teeth and brackets stay. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> works great. but i dont understand that the brush head is not connect perfectly with the body.</li>
    <li> Gets your teeth nice and clean but I wish the brush head was a little bigger. Also I still have to floss after I bush because it doesn&#x27;t do a good job getting in between teeth.</li>
    <li> it is good. I had the old sonicare and switched to this one and found it quite loud. but you get used to it</li>
    <li> No more cavities. Works well and battery life is amazing.</li>
    <li> The noisiest toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever heard. The head is designed so it does not connect to the base/grip well and so the whole thing feels like it rattles my teeth. That said, it does a decent job at cleaning and the 2-minute timer works well. I also appreciate the minimal charging base. But if I could do it again, I would&#x27;ve bought a more expensive model. This cheaper toothbrush isn&#x27;t worth the daily annoyance.</li>
    <li> I had my original for a long time &amp; finally had to replace it.  I am very happy with the new one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she likes using it. Her brushing has improved dramatically.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a present for someone else. It looks nice.</li>
    <li> I read negative reviews about low power and too much buzz. Just had my last year&#x27;s &amp;#34;cheapest&amp;#34; model sonicare Easy Clean replaced with 3-speed similar model HX6631/02. I don&#x27;t need 3-speed so i wanted to get this model from amazon and return the 3-speed, because single speed is not available locally. Opened the box to try it. The brush head is smaller compared to proresults i used with my previous brush. This model is compatible with proresults so at least i could use my brush heads. My new brush makes annoying loud buzzing noise and vibrates in the hand too much - the reason why i had to get rid of my Easy Clean. It started making loud buzzing noise and the metal stem felt lose, causing the handle to vibrate stronger in my hand. However, it did not lose power. I just hated the vibration and the handle and buzzing noise. It was quiet originally. So i take my new 3-speed brush for a spin. The handle is slippery and thicker, compared to the slimmer Easy Clean. I do like the battery cover. Seems like its easier to clean. My old brush would get moldy yellow in the bottom and i had to clean it with bleach. The battery was impossible to remove. On highest speed setting the new brush is a fraction of the power of my old brush. WTF Sonicare???!!! I&#x27;m not paying $200+ for their top of the line brush to get the speed i had for $30+ i paid for single speed Easy Clean. No massage, no different speed settings, no stupid useless gimmickry. My new brush is manual. I&#x27;m done with Sonicare until they make a cheap usable brush. I don&#x27;t recommend this model or the similar and more expensive 3-speed.</li>
    <li> my dentist office recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;one of the best electric tooth brushes i have owned.&lt;br /&gt;timer is a key feature.&lt;br /&gt;large battery life.&lt;br /&gt;works very well.</li>
    <li> Bought for our 12 yr old son.  Head is smaller than other sonicare, works better for younger ones.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, gets my teach super clean and leave my mouth feeling fresh! Came as pictured and packaged in original packaging. Shipped and arrived fast.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush! After using this i will never be able to use a regular toothbrush again!</li>
    <li> The design is very nice but it is extremely loud. Sonicare Essence is much more stable.</li>
    <li> GREAT TOOTHBRUSH LOVE IT.GOOD PURCHASE.BUY ONE GUYS</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare and I am very disappointed with this one compared to my last. It does not have the 30 second increment buzz and the charge does not hold very long. I also do not like that is has a much wider handle than my previous one. I will be getting a 3rd one.</li>
    <li> Very good price and I love the results.</li>
    <li> The tooth brush makes a lot of noise. Sounds like a fast rattle.</li>
    <li> This is an old model and maybe we got a dud but it does not brush anything like the newer models.  Spend a little more money and get a better one with at least two settings so you feel like it is really brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel really clean.  The vibration does take some getting use to.</li>
    <li> Love this. For the price you cannot beat it.</li>
    <li> my aunt is very satisfied with this one</li>
    <li> I used Braun Oral B for years.  This toothbrush out preforms the Braun in my opinion.  I will be sticking with the Phillips from here on out!</li>
    <li> I bought this tooth brush bc regular ones just weren&#x27;t cutting it anymore. I&#x27;ve been using it for a bout a week or 2 now. It&#x27;s a good took brush but just like anything there are some pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;After the first brush you can notice the difference in how clean your teeth feel.&lt;br /&gt;The tooth brush is long, for hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is rechargeable. This makes it nice considering the old one I had when I had braces way back when it needed batteries but I got that one from like walmart.&lt;br /&gt;2min timer to let you know you got your 2 min in&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The vibration is loud. With your first brush you&#x27;re going to be like,&amp;#34; Holy cow that&#x27;s loud and vibrated my head like nuts!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration will hurt your hand at first.&lt;br /&gt;If your teeth and gums aren&#x27;t used to it they will bleed. I was scared there was something wrong with my gums at first bc I never had that happen, but they finally stopped after my teeth got used to it. So if this happens don&#x27;t worry it happened to me too and mine no longer do it. I feel as though they should&#x27;ve put that on the label somewhere about that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had fancy Sonicare models and Oral-B brushes and I like this one by far the best. I HATE the &amp;#34;quadpacer&amp;#34; thing that makes the brush jump around in my poor mouth every 30 seconds. The fancy ones also don&#x27;t seem as well sealed. The battery charging icon tends to look like some water got inside very quickly. That is not a problem with this one. Also, some of the older fancier ones have a rubberized coating on part of the handle that tends to degrade and get sticky and gross after a while. This one hasn&#x27;t had that problem yet.</li>
    <li> Had a higher-end Sonicare that lasted about four years before recently dying.  Bought this lower priced one in hope it would operate like my old one did when it was new.  Sadly, it&#x27;s not as good.  This unit is very noisy and produces significantly more vibration.  Regardless, it uses the newer, slim heads and it fits on my original charging/UV base.  For those reasons, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> There is a space between the brush and handle, no explanation, the company seems to avoid the question altogether. .. so odd.&lt;br /&gt;Once i got over it,  this is by far the best toothbrush i have purchased.After brushing I felt like the actress in the 1970&#x27;s pearl drop toothpaste commercial. Mmmm What a great feeling!</li>
    <li> Great product but the bristles are a little to soft for me. E-series actually does a better job.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was used to a healthy white sonicare so this was a disappointment. It made more noise and just didn&#x27;t have the same power. So I never felt that nice sonicare clean.</li>
    <li> Does not have a 30-second intervel marker.</li>
    <li> It was a great second buy. It really removes plaque and keeps it away.</li>
    <li> Takes long to charge. Works well.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and undamaged. I thought it came with a carrying case but this set only includes the toothbrush, charger and one brush head. When I first put the brush head on I thought the gap between the two pieces seemed abnormally large. It seemed to work fine and from pics and videos I saw online it does seem that this is just the way the design is. I decided to keep it and everything has been working with no issues. It is much louder than I expected but unlike other reviewers, I wouldn&#x27;t say that everyone in the house would be disturbed by the noise. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and it has been great for my teeth! I had been using a normal toothbrush and didn&#x27;t feel like I was able to get my teeth really clean but since using this toothbrush my teeth feel extremely clean and my gums are not red anymore.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to use with no frills. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare products before and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint, although a travel case of some sort would have been welcome.</li>
    <li> Feel great on my body</li>
    <li> Cheapest version of the brush but so far as worked for me like a champ - the Spinbrush didn&#x27;t do the job and I was having both stained teeth and receding gums with it.  The Sonicare is the complete opposite - after 3 months of use my teeth still look just as good as the last time I got a polishing at the dentist.  It&#x27;s an expensive brush but totally worth it in helping me cut down on dentist visits and cleanings.</li>
    <li> bought for my husband he likes it a lot</li>
    <li> I previously had a Sonicare Flexcare that just started acting up after a few year&#x27;s use.  It was good until the end, but I think it had a pressure-sensitive feature that started malfunctioning.  Anyway, comparing this one to that slightly higher-end unit, this only has one setting (on and off).  However, I only used the regular setting on that one, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m missing anything there.  This one costs less and it does look and feel cheaper than the other one, but it still works fine.  My teeth feel dentist-clean and that&#x27;s all I really care about.  For anyone that&#x27;s never tried one of these, before my Sonicare brushes, I had another electric toothbrush.  It did a better job than I could do with a manual toothbrush, but the sonic movements of the Sonicare make my teeth even cleaner.  My only real complaint about Sonicare is the cost of the brush heads.  They&#x27;re still cheaper than a cavity, but they&#x27;re more expensive than they should be.</li>
    <li> Purchase for my wife. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as my old Sonicare Flexcare at a fraction of the price. I haven&#x27;t compared brands but it seems noisy if you&#x27;re sharing a space with someone that might be bothered.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. It is a breeze to set up and operate, and it takes up minimal space on our counter. It charges fully in 48 hours according to the manual but it was usable long before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does give your teeth that fresh from the dentist look and feel. I could immediately see a difference between when my husband used his regular spin brush toothbrush and when he used the Sonicare. His teeth looked whiter, brighter, and super clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush, really good cleaning!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s LOUD!  Very noisy.  Unlike the E series toothbrush, it has no quadrant count, just 2 minutes of continuous vibration.  However, with that said, the toothbrush is great quality and works well.  It gets the job done... well.</li>
    <li> On the whole it&#x27;s good, except it&#x27;s too noisy</li>
    <li> i spent a lot of time looking at reviews for the philips sonicare products.  i had an oral b electric toothbrush that i was very happy with, but my dentist recommended the sonicare so i decided to give it a try.  this is the simplest (and cheapest) of the sonicare line.  many of the review suggested that the gadgets on the more expensive sonicare products (3 series, healthy white, diamond care, flexcare, etc) were not really helpful (timers, pressure sensors, variable settings, etc.) and i agree.  i just wanted a toothbrush that would work and didn&#x27;t want too many buttons to deal with or complexities that could break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have had the sonicare 2 series for a month now and i&#x27;m very happy with it.  some reviewers complained about the noise--it is not any louder than my oral b electric toothbrush and the noise doesn&#x27;t bother me.  it is noticeable, but even my guests don&#x27;t find it annoying.  some reviewers also mention that the stand isn&#x27;t very stable.  this is true, but the charge lasts 2-3 weeks so i only put it on the stand when the battery is dead.  the rest of the time the toothbrush can stand on the counter alone and it is very stable by itself since the bottom is very flat.  overall, a great toothbrush and a great value at this price (the same brush at target was almost double the price).</li>
    <li> Why did not a good combination toothbrush I bought it two parts</li>
    <li> Doest remove as much plaque as advertised</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I don&#x27;t think I will every go to a manual toothbrush again. I love how it has a 2 minute timer with a 30 second interval vibration so I can separate my brushing into 4 quadrants.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with it, works good for me.</li>
    <li> I love my new sonicare, I&#x27;ve always owned one and I&#x27;m very excited</li>
    <li> I did not like this toothbrush. It is not nearly as strong as my old model with the larger head. Yes this one is not supposed to get all the goop inside of the brush head that has to be cleaned out but it didn&#x27;t brush nearly as hard and so therefore I didn&#x27;t like it. Now I do think it would be perfect for a child or someone who is just starting to use an electric toothbrush since the initial swap from a regular toothbrush to the Sonicare can be tough. That being said, the Sonicare is responsible for ending my receding gum problems. I do highly recommend the product, I was just disappointed for myself since I was hoping to swap to the brush that didn&#x27;t have the goop problem with the brusher head. I went back to my old brush and will give this one away to someone with a child. That is the reason I gave it three stars.</li>
    <li> Okay, so after asking question to other users above I decided to return my Oral-b 7000 black. It was a hard decision because it also a good toothbrush. (espcially I bought it with a super deal. 133-30+tax)&lt;br /&gt;but this philips sonicare really not disppinted me. The sonicare tech really strong. I mean really STROOOOOOOOOONG. ( watch my mouth :O) I even feel so tickle while using it due to its super high speed shock...</li>
    <li> I can feel the difference of cleaner teeth w/power of Sonicare compared to manual brushing...get this!</li>
    <li> The box comes with only one brush</li>
    <li> I had a sonic care toothbrush 10 years ago and loved it...I bought this one and they have improved by leaps and bounds....my mouth has never felt so clean</li>
    <li> Very good tooth brush.  It is a little loud, and it does not have the four section time to change vibration notice, but that is OK with me.</li>
    <li> I wish they would let you control the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; at about 10 settings. Other than that it is great. Nice small head. Takes a while to fully charge.</li>
    <li> Get your teeth clean with some vibrating magic. It feels like my teeth were just polished every time.</li>
    <li> I have had Sonicares before. I do not like this one. I would return it if I could.</li>
    <li> Great item and very well priced!</li>
    <li> Bummer, It just broke after 2 months of minimal use ( I use a regular tooth brush too)</li>
    <li> Super ! Fast shipping and good products !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t let you know every 30 seconds to switch which part of your mouth your supposed to brush</li>
    <li> Great product and great price range for quality electric toothbrush.  Never been one to buy into these things but significantly changes the feeling of cleanliness and super easy to use.  Only complaint is that it is quite loud. Otherwise clean teeth like fresh from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Beginning with not too habit</li>
    <li> Really made my teeth feel clean compared to a manual toothbrush. Like it a lot</li>
    <li> I should have bought this sooner, wonderful item.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve been to the hygienist for a cleaning</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product. After having this for less than 4 months, bristles from the toothbrush head have started to fall out while brushing my teeth and its gradually getting worse the more I use it. I had 6 bristles at once fall out while brushing most recently. Extremely disappointed due to the high recommendation Philips Sonicare comes with. Hope Amazon or Philips can do something about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a better note, I do feel like my teeth are cleaner and it&#x27;s much more gentle on sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush! My teeth have never been this clean! Bye bye hand brushing!</li>
    <li> Bought this lower end version of the Sonicare hoping to save some money. It rattles and buzzes horribly compared to other Sonicares I&#x27;ve used. It feels like cheap chinese knock off. It also does not have the quad pacer timer. I think Philipps makes this basic version annoying so customers pay $70 for the expensive versions. I wish there were other vendors with same technology.</li>
    <li> These vibrations are like shaking - the handle shakes more than the bristle, and since plastic hits plastic it&#x27;s extremely loud. All that for nothing as the vibrations don&#x27;t reach the bristle much. That little is not resulting in an effective cleaning</li>
    <li> Works great!  Does the job!</li>
    <li> The sonicare makes my teeth so much cleaner</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t kown.maybe it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Compare to another Sonicare brush HX6921 that I have, this one&#x27;s noise is much bigger when brush head is working.</li>
    <li> Hey Did you send me a defective product? The brush doesn&#x27;t go all the way down and the noise is super loud.</li>
    <li> You have not brushed your teeth until you have one of these.</li>
    <li> Hurt my gums and teeth - afraid to use it again. It has taken well over a week to be out of pain.  I have had my e series for a long time and love it.  I didn&#x27;t expect this.  I don&#x27;t know if the toothbrush is defective or just operates like that.  I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that say the same but then so many say they love it then others that say it&#x27;s not strong enough and they&#x27;re better off brushing by hand.  Such great variations in peoples experiences sound like performance may vary from unit to unit.&lt;br /&gt;It also does not have the quad pacer which I am used to and like.  It is also very loud and tinny sounding.  Overall I do not like it and am returning it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I  had a nicer model that died after a few years so I read a review that basically said the cheaper ones were  just as good but didn&#x27;t have unneeded features. Not true. Go for the nicer models. This one is loud, and bulky and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; sound to let you know to go from one quadrant to the next, which is very useful.</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush! I have been using it for a month and it is by far the best electric toothbrush I have had.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully clean teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought a sonic toothbrush about 15 years ago.  Slowly over the years the battery has been getting weaker, and the spinning bristles seemed like they weren&#x27;t that effective.  I bought a cheapy $9 throw-away electric toothbrush, and although it was a little better, the AA batteries lasted maybe 3-4 brushes before they wore out.  Then I saw this pop up for sale and it had good reviews so I decided to buy it.  Testing it out dry made me worry, the VERY high vibration tingled to the point where it wasn&#x27;t comfortable.  Once you add toothpaste, and realize you can adjust the vibration by changing pressure against your teeth, it&#x27;s actually quite enjoyable.  It&#x27;s the first toothbrush that almost makes you feel like you just had a dental cleaning, but every morning.</li>
    <li> price good. but feeling itchy while I&#x27;m using it for my first use.</li>
    <li> Very compact  for travel, does the same thing as a fancier one I had earlier.  Happy for the lower price on this one.</li>
    <li> it is not the package i wanted.&lt;br /&gt;so just so so.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied. very good</li>
    <li> Our dentist suggested the sonic.  My husband seemed to be getting chipped teeth.  When the dentist heard he was using a spin brush, he told him to stop immediately and use a &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; brush or buy a Sonic.  He explained that the spin of those brushes verses the vibration of a Sonic actuals damages teeth.  Now that we are using this, my teeth actually feel cleaner.  Wish it came with more brushes though!  THe replacement brushese are expensive.</li>
    <li> It works well, and is a great deal considering its discount. But the noise is very loud, I wonder if that is typical.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I have gone so long without owning one!! It&#x27;s like getting my teeth professionally clean at the dentist!!</li>
    <li> Really loud and feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> cheap and loud compared to other models</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Easy to carry in bathroom bag.  Charger is just the right size.  It should be offered with a carrying pouch.</li>
    <li> As the previous comments mentioned, a little noisy, but still can bear the sound. Worth it&#x27;s price. But I didn&#x27;t find the brush heads fit for this model . Is the head a general one? Can somebody help me?</li>
    <li> It works great just doesn&#x27;t give you the 30second beep like the higher end ones do.</li>
    <li> Perfect Sonicare.  I previously had one of the $100+ Sonicare toothbrushes but after 6 years it broke.  This one is not as powerful as the previous one I had, but I like it just as much.</li>
    <li> IT HAS MET OUR EXPECTATIONS.</li>
    <li> Excellent but I can&#x27;t find head brush replacement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to repurchase if the price I bought it last time available again, haha</li>
    <li> The charger/stand is too small and unstable to support the toothbrush. It won&#x27;t stay where you put it, it will be dragged by the weight of the cord. If you can manage to make it stay in one spot, you can still expect it to fall over CONSTANTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this product is just as amazing as every other Sonicare toothbrush. Have loved them for years.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts at a great price! So far, so good!  Charge lasts a long time, much better than the Oral B I had previously</li>
    <li> Works great for a basic ultrasonic toothbrush</li>
    <li> I love my sonic care tooth brush, however I don&#x27;t like their longevity.  My first one lasted 5 years none of the others have lasted more than 2. I think you guys should do better.</li>
    <li> This is the one I always liked - replace only the toothbrush attachment. I like consistence....</li>
    <li> Relatively good , but really big shock</li>
    <li> I love the sonicate but the new wand that I purchased does no have the pulsing timer that my old wand did.  It also does not have the different pressure levels that my old one had.  I was disappointed that these two things were missing.  It is a wonderful toothbrush and I cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing feeling when you get done. This is not like anything I remember about electric toothbrushes from when I was a kid.</li>
