### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Mint Ion color is amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Great product, will buy again.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good buy</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve tried this color twice and both times, a good 2-3 inches of my roots that I bleached and toned will NOT take the color.</li>
      <li>I usually love ion colors but some aren&#x27;t to great.</li>
      <li>The color came out bright and vibrant and looks awesome!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>The rose color went on brighter than it looked.</li>
      <li>Lovely, lovely color!</li>
      <li>I has happy with this product at first...</li>
      <li>Really pleased with my results</li>
      <li>so I was pleased w that.</li>
      <li>More pastel than obnoxiously bright, which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>and it dries very quickly so the hair around the selected streaked pieces doesn&#x27;t get accidentally stained with product.</li>
      <li>is fine</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Way too light and doesnt sink into the hair.</li>
      <li>To great dissapointment when I finally saw my hair there was NO change.</li>
      <li>have fun and do what you want!</li>
      <li>So I left it on my hair for a good 2-2&amp;1/2 hours and then rinsed off the pieces, rubbed some leave-in conditioner on them, then sprayed with Ion keratin repair spray.</li>
      <li>The directions state: \\&quot;for the most vibrant result apply to prelightened hair...</li>
      <li>It washes out quickly depending on your aftercare process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product did exactly what I wanted and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>It fades easily but this product stayed on really well..</li>
      <li>The aqua went on electric blue and won&#x27;t fade to the nice pastel color on the box.</li>
      <li>I have fun with this.  </li>
      <li>If only I could give the Ion Color Brilliance Brings in Rose a 0 star rating.</li>
      <li>you havent&#x27;t been able to get it down to platinum (like after henna), this will still work to make it pink, but the tone will be more salmon than the cooler rose.</li>
      <li>The minimum level for Rose, which is what I used is a level 7, but for most of the colors, prelightening to a LEVEL 10 is recommended (Fuschia, Sky Blue, Aqua, Titanium, Azure, Lavender,Shark Blue, and Mint) to achieve intense color.</li>

      <li>And again started to work the color through especially at the top where the hair band was.  </li>
      <li>I used the colour lavender and its a pretty colour</li>
      <li>This initially dyes to a cool toned hot pink (not as bright as magenta), not quite rose, and gradually washes to a softer pastel pink.</li>
      <li>The rose went on a beautiful pink but faded to strawberry blonde within a few days.</li>
      <li>So if you really want intense color from this product BE SURE TO PRELIGHTEN to at least a level 7-8 and leave the color on for one hour MINIMUM, preferably TWO OR MORE hours, if not you&#x27;ll basically just be applying a color wash over your existing hair color.</li>

      <li>For $5.00 It certainly did it&#x27;s job</li>
      <li>The color started to fade after about two week but was still very visible.  </li>
      <li>I gave it a five even though it isn&#x27;t very semi permanent.  </li>
      <li>Most of the pink comes out.  </li>
      <li>I also tried the magenta color WHICH IS SO MUCH BRIGHTER AND DARKER and messier.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I have it two stars is that it stayed a nice color, but only on the ends of my hair.</li>
      <li>And then there&#x27;s a table indicating how light your hair needs to be for \\&quot;vibrant, pure color\\&quot; results which are all between level 7 and 10 (10 being palest blonde).</li>

      <li>it is important to note that the degree of lift achieved with prelightening will directly affect the vibrancy and intensity of the final result...to achieve a boldly intense *brights* color, prelighten to the level indicated in the table</li>
      <li>Went from blonde to pastel pink with rose.</li>
      <li>But I had used the magenta from ion and it was a beautiful pink ish color and it lasted at least 4 washes before fading (4 washes is a month to me</li>
      <li>The final result is a VERY vivid pink that I am quite pleased with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: It faded to a fantastic grey but quickly went to green.</li>

      <li>Really work it through especially around the hair band...</li>
      <li>For my thick, curly shoulder length hair I used 3 tubes , but afterwards I think 4 might have been a better call.</li>
      <li>Recently I&#x27;ve been trying to find something to replace Special Effects Cupcake Pink as they are all out.</li>
      <li>the pink really upset the old ladies at the club..get over yourself, it&#x27;s just hair!</li>
      <li>I used Ion Color Brilliance Brights in Rose to put a few pink streaks in my bleached white hair.</li>
      <li>I was so excited but was only let down.</li>
      <li>Using gloves and a large old towel over the sink, I started working the neon pink color into the end section of hair on one side.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick but still easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It will fade and disappear within a few weeks, but it&#x27;s fun to play around with color without the commitment.</li>
      <li>The staying power, I suspect will be similar to that of all non-peroxide hair colors which is not very long at all-a month or so tops.</li>

<li> But this does what I want, and actually, I don&#x27;t mind, because I can do something with pink hair one day and the next my regular gray with a tiny bit of pink might be left.  </li>
<li> /&gt;After having various pink dyes turn orange, this is the only one what even looked pink on orange-level lightened hair.</li>
<li> Yes, it is a thick, creamy formula which in my case made it a whole lot easier to keep the product isolated on the pieces I was coloring within my hair</li>
<li> I think they make it thick on purpose for this very reason.</li>
<li> I did the same on the other side.</li>
<li> I wash my hair, which is usually in less than 24 hours later.  </li>
<li> BUT Its gonna take MANY months to fade completely...and damaged my hair (badly) too.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the pink manic panic for years-A friend recommended this</li>
<li> I just put some pink in my hair and go.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used hottie pink recently and the color that it came out was more of a purple base witch</li>
<li> When applying it was a neon pink</li>
<li> w the two people was from the magenta after 2 washes and the other is from the hottie pink before and after</li>
<li> I have bleached hair, and it barely showed up (whereas the pink lasted at least 2 weeks).</li>
<li> It is neon pink on my hair!  </li>
<li> After reading the reviews here, I just have to mention the fact that I noticed several of the commenters who gave this product poor reviews did not follow the directions which recommend PRELIGHTENING TO AT LEAST A LEVEL 7 blonde prior to applying the Brights color.</li>
<li> My hair is super processed and porous so crazy color dyes like this typically fade out in about a month.</li>
<li> Abstaining from frequent shampooing and rinsing with cold water only can help prolong the color</li>
<li> Washed out within a few days</li>
<li> So seeing that I walk EVERYWHERE in the dead heat of the summer that could be the problem.</li>
<li> I was shocked at how pretty the color was.  </li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> A thick product can always be thinned out but I for one would have no clue how to make a product thicker.</li>
<li> (I have thin hair)</li>
<li> if you want to test out a baby pink shade, not good if you were looking for something shocking.</li>
<li> I washed the color dye out with cold water without using shampoo.</li>
<li> A thinner formula would have made this process very difficult, in fact.</li>
<li> but I hate it. .</li>
<li> This dye is absolutely miserable to apply so you might want to dilute it.</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

    <li> Unless your hair is white do not  buy did nothing.</li>
    <li> Went from blonde to pastel pink with rose. I tried pravana and manic panic, and they didn&#x27;t take as well as ion did. Really pleased with my results</li>
    <li> bought and rebought! the pink really upset the old ladies at the club..get over yourself, it&#x27;s just hair! have fun and do what you want! i will probably try all the colors!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. The color came out bright and vibrant and looks awesome!</li>
    <li> If only I could give the Ion Color Brilliance Brings in Rose a 0 star rating. I bleached my hair before using this color. When applying it was a neon pink so I was a bit worried it would be darker than I was going for. I left the color on for 45 mins (longer than recommended). I washed the color dye out with cold water without using shampoo. To great dissapointment when I finally saw my hair there was NO change. Not even a tint of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve died my hair 100&#x27;s of times and have almost every color you can imagine. I&#x27;ve never had a dye not work in my hair. I will not be buying this ever again. I was so excited but was only let down.</li>
    <li> I usually love ion colors but some aren&#x27;t to great. I&#x27;ve used hottie pink recently and the color that it came out was more of a purple base witch is fine I didn&#x27;t want a salmon out come. But I have washed my hair 1 since dyeing it and it&#x27;s already almost all gone. I did some research and comes to find out the sun will fad out colors as well not just washing it. So seeing that I walk EVERYWHERE in the dead heat of the summer that could be the problem. But I had used the magenta from ion and it was a beautiful pink ish color and it lasted at least 4 washes before fading (4 washes is a month to me I only was hair once a week) so I was pleased w that. So I don&#x27;t recommend the hottie pink.the photo w the two people was from the magenta after 2 washes and the other is from the hottie pink before and after</li>
    <li> I has happy with this product at first...My hair does not hold color well. It fades easily but this product stayed on really well.. The first time I tried Rose on my dark blonde hair. I got an idea from a video to only dye the bottom portion.  I put my hair into two ponytails.  I put the hair bands six inches from the bottom of my medium length hair ..Using gloves and a large old towel over the sink, I started working the neon pink color into the end section of hair on one side.  Really work it through especially around the hair band...The rose color went on brighter than it looked. It is neon pink on my hair!  I used about an 8th of the tube for each side (I have thin hair) I kept working it through the hair. I did the same on the other side. I CHANGED GLOVES.  And again started to work the color through especially at the top where the hair band was.  I put tin foil over the ponytail. I held a blow dryer to the tin foil to heat the foil up.  I left it in my hair for an hour. I Rinsed the bottom of my hair out in the sink.  I was shocked at how pretty the color was.  I also tried the magenta color WHICH IS SO MUCH BRIGHTER AND DARKER and messier.  The color started to fade after about two week but was still very visible.  For $5.00 It certainly did it&#x27;s job BUT Its gonna take MANY months to fade completely...and damaged my hair (badly) too.</li>
    <li> Left it in for 60 min over bleached hair. The rose went on a beautiful pink but faded to strawberry blonde within a few days. The aqua went on electric blue and won&#x27;t fade to the nice pastel color on the box. :/</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used Ion Color Brilliance Brights in Rose to put a few pink streaks in my bleached white hair. For me there was no problem whatsoever with the consistency or the color intensity. The product did exactly what I wanted and so far I&#x27;m very pleased. Yes, it is a thick, creamy formula which in my case made it a whole lot easier to keep the product isolated on the pieces I was coloring within my hair and it dries very quickly so the hair around the selected streaked pieces doesn&#x27;t get accidentally stained with product. A thinner formula would have made this process very difficult, in fact. I think they make it thick on purpose for this very reason. A thick product can always be thinned out but I for one would have no clue how to make a product thicker. So I left it on my hair for a good 2-2&amp;1/2 hours and then rinsed off the pieces, rubbed some leave-in conditioner on them, then sprayed with Ion keratin repair spray. The final result is a VERY vivid pink that I am quite pleased with. The staying power, I suspect will be similar to that of all non-peroxide hair colors which is not very long at all-a month or so tops. Without peroxide in the formula, the cuticle doesn&#x27;t open up and accept the color molecules into the hair so you&#x27;re basically just temporarily staining it for a bit, depending on how damaged and porous your hair is. My hair is super processed and porous so crazy color dyes like this typically fade out in about a month. Abstaining from frequent shampooing and rinsing with cold water only can help prolong the color but it&#x27;s always going to be the type of dye that fades out vs grows out. After reading the reviews here, I just have to mention the fact that I noticed several of the commenters who gave this product poor reviews did not follow the directions which recommend PRELIGHTENING TO AT LEAST A LEVEL 7 blonde prior to applying the Brights color. The directions state: \\&quot;for the most vibrant result apply to prelightened hair...it is important to note that the degree of lift achieved with prelightening will directly affect the vibrancy and intensity of the final result...to achieve a boldly intense *brights* color, prelighten to the level indicated in the table below\\&quot;..And then there&#x27;s a table indicating how light your hair needs to be for \\&quot;vibrant, pure color\\&quot; results which are all between level 7 and 10 (10 being palest blonde). The minimum level for Rose, which is what I used is a level 7, but for most of the colors, prelightening to a LEVEL 10 is recommended (Fuschia, Sky Blue, Aqua, Titanium, Azure, Lavender,Shark Blue, and Mint) to achieve intense color. The bleaching also increases the hair porosity which to an extent enhances the ability to absorb product. In my experience, processed hair with a roughed up outer cuticle sucks up color better than untreated virgin hair with a smooth, soft cuticle. So if you really want intense color from this product BE SURE TO PRELIGHTEN to at least a level 7-8 and leave the color on for one hour MINIMUM, preferably TWO OR MORE hours, if not you&#x27;ll basically just be applying a color wash over your existing hair color.

    <li> It&#x27;s an incredibly soft pink. It will fade and disappear within a few weeks, but it&#x27;s fun to play around with color without the commitment. Definitely a good buy if you want to test out a baby pink shade, not good if you were looking for something shocking.</li>
    <li> I have dyed my hair for almost 10 years. Recently I&#x27;ve been trying to find something to replace Special Effects Cupcake Pink as they are all out. The only reason I have it two stars is that it stayed a nice color, but only on the ends of my hair. The Mint Ion color is amazing!!! But I&#x27;ve tried this color twice and both times, a good 2-3 inches of my roots that I bleached and toned will NOT take the color. Trying something different until Special Effects makes more Cupcake Pink</li>
    <li> this color fades after one wash!</li>
    <li> Lovely, lovely color! More pastel than obnoxiously bright, which was exactly what I was looking for. Consistency is definitely thicker and a bit harder to work with, so I&#x27;d recommend ordering an extra tube just to make sure coverage meets your expectations. For my thick, curly shoulder length hair I used 3 tubes , but afterwards I think 4 might have been a better call.</li>
    <li> Ugh. I&#x27;ve been using the pink manic panic for years-A friend recommended this but I hate it. . Way too light and doesnt sink into the hair. I have bleached hair, and it barely showed up (whereas the pink lasted at least 2 weeks). Washed out within a few days</li>
    <li> This dye is absolutely miserable to apply so you might want to dilute it. Also it doesn&#x27;t come out so hopefully you like the colour. I used the colour lavender and its a pretty colour but you need platinum hair for it to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It faded to a fantastic grey but quickly went to green.</li>
    <li> I have fun with this.  I gave it a five even though it isn&#x27;t very semi permanent.  I just put some pink in my hair and go.  My hair doesn&#x27;t grab the color well, and I&#x27;m not of a mind to bleach my hair so it will.  But this does what I want, and actually, I don&#x27;t mind, because I can do something with pink hair one day and the next my regular gray with a tiny bit of pink might be left.  Then I don&#x27;t put it in again until some occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and don&#x27;t rinse it out.  I wash my hair, which is usually in less than 24 hours later.  Most of the pink comes out.  That&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick but still easy to apply. I wouldn&#x27;t mix it with conditioner as some brands take away from the color deposit. This initially dyes to a cool toned hot pink (not as bright as magenta), not quite rose, and gradually washes to a softer pastel pink. If your hair has yellow tones, and you havent&#x27;t been able to get it down to platinum (like after henna), this will still work to make it pink, but the tone will be more salmon than the cooler rose. It washes out quickly depending on your aftercare process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having various pink dyes turn orange, this is the only one what even looked pink on orange-level lightened hair.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Color washed out instantly.</li>
