    <li> car diffuser doesn&#x27;t work at all.  One of my room diffusers works, the other doesn&#x27;t :(</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping.  This diffuser is amazing.  No more plug ins for me, cleansing the air with pure scents that keep my family healthy.</li>
    <li> Only came with one of the two car diffusers</li>
    <li> Excellent! Works great in my son&#x27;s room!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my children&#x27;s rooms to diffuse oils in the air at night time. Worked perfectly. I have not yet had a chance to plug in the car diffuser. I am eager to use my oils instead of the chemical air fresheners.</li>
    <li> Diffuser works great, the car diffuser is so so.</li>
    <li> Water diffuser works great with my Young Living oils. Car diffusers not so much.</li>
    <li> Love these diffusers! They work great &amp; my kids like the colors. Great for diffusing my DoTERRA essential oils ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    <li> Excellent diffuser...I have 4 now so I don&#x27;t have to relocate throughout the house.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t meet expectations</li>
    <li> Bought these as gifts and they were really pleased with the diffuser.  They haven&#x27;t tried the car one yet.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this cool little Diffuser. I had a small problem with the order but I contacted the vendor and they were great!!&lt;br /&gt;They were friendly and sent me the extra item over right away. I&#x27;ve been enjoying my diffuser just make sure not to put any citrus oils in there.</li>
    <li> Love having safe oils to diffuse in our cars! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have 3 Greenair Spa Vapor Diffusers in my home, one on my desk at work and one in my car. I love them! Greenair is my recommended &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; place for anyone who is looking for a dependable, long lasting diffuser.</li>
    <li> Both of my spa vapor diffusers broke and just stopped working within two weeks. I tried to send a message about replacement but have yet to be contacted. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I love the diffusor, i have several of these and they are very nice. They were each suppose to have a car diffusor in them but I only recieved one.</li>
    <li> Love the mist, works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Got here 10 days earlier than expected! I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
