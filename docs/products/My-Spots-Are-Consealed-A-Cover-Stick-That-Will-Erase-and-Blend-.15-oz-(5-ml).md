    <li> I purchased this product since I was looking to try something to cover my hyperpigmentation. I was already happy with a different product but I was trying to save a few dollars and at the same time give something else a try. I was not happy with the outcome. First of all, the product comes in a \\&quot;chapstick\\&quot; type of container and size so for my age spots, I have to use quite a lot of product. I used it before I applied my foundation and it just didn&#x27;t give me the coverage my previous concealer did. I agree with the saying, \\&quot;cheaper isn&#x27;t always better\\&quot; and will be going back to my previous concealer.</li>
    <li> i bought this but prefer my avon color stick</li>
    <li> I have used it for years...Covers great &amp; usually heals overnight</li>
    <li> Did not cover my blemishes all that well in my opinion nor do what I really wanted it to do cover scars and spots I could still see them after putting this on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer since I discovered it in a beauty supply in LA twelve years ago.  It makes your skin appear perfectly smooth and healthy.  I usually cover it with a powder foundation, but I wouldn&#x27;t need it.  There isn&#x27;t a blemish I&#x27;ve had that this won&#x27;t conceal beautifully.</li>
    <li> I think you could conceal a Dalmatian with My Spots are Concealed. It covers and hides scars and anything you don&#x27;t like on your face and even your hands. Great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this consealer! Infact, I love it so much that I use it as my foundation. It does it all. It&#x27;s getting hard to find though. When it was discontinued at my Walgreens I panicked! Thank God for Amazon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I think this stuff might be a dud...It does not even cover some of the faintest of blemishes! It also leaves my skin with a chalky appearance. I&#x27;m going to buy another one in a darker shade and see if that helps...</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before several years ago and now that tube has lasted me that long and worked so well...I had to find a replacement.  I consider myself lucky that the same company makes this and they have not changed the ingredients and formula that makes this so effective.  This time I purchased 2 tubes and I hope they are still manufacturing this when I run out.  I recommend this to anyone as long as you know what shade you need.</li>
    <li> Okay, so this is the best.  I have a spot of white on my cheek where the skin doctor froze something off long ago. This product is the only one that I have ever found that makes it look like it&#x27;s not there. I use it everyday. It&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>
    <li> I find this concealer useful for the age spots on my face,  specifically the side of my face near the window when I drive in the sun.  It may be a bit heavy/waxy for under eye use,  but it&#x27;s great for spots under mineral makeup!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product. I found it a little thick and personally prefer a lighter concealer, although I do realize that in some cases thicker is better. The price and delivery was all to my satisfaction. I will keep this and I&#x27;m sure use it from time to time.</li>
    <li> I do have to use a makeup brush to get coverage.  It&#x27;s a bit better than other cover up sticks.</li>
    <li> So i was really excited when i got this because all the reviews were positive But when i tried it on it didnt really cover my my undereye circles,it made them more noticable because the stick is oily (in my opinion) I have already oily skin so it made it worse. I used it twice beacause i thought maybe i just didnt apply it right but it didnt matter it just didnt look natural.  I probably wont use it again but its just my skin that didnt work with it maybe it does for other people but not me. ill probabaly go back to the Mary Kay concealer which works muchbetter on me and actually blends in with myskin tone.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t been too impressed. it&#x27;s too waxy for my face, and the color is WAY too pink. i won&#x27;t repurchase...</li>
    <li> Could have been a hair darker but okay.</li>
    <li> the color is a perfect match for my skin, the texture is smooth, for once i can&#x27;t tell im wearing concealer under my eye ;)</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and have been very satisfied.  I previously had order more in a different shade and was not pleased.  This is right shade; however, was not as creamy and was harder to apply than same product I previously had ordered.</li>
    <li> I have a medium to fair complexion so I bought the &#x27;medium&#x27; shade. When applied on the fairer areas of my face the product shade resembles silly putty (it matches better in the darker areas). It blends easily and stays put nicely. I would have rated it higher but unlike other users, I find the coverage to be only average; I am using it on sun spots and under eye circles.</li>
