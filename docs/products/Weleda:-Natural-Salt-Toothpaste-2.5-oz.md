      <li>On paper this should be a very good toothpaste - natural ingredients, metal tube, made in germany, etc..</li>
      <li>I wish I would have listened to my Mom or Dad or Nanny from childhood days and did take care of my teeth since, but for many of us</li>

      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Ok, so you know it&#x27;s a salt toothpaste</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice for your health then go with this toothpaste, but I&#x27;m warning you it tastes like salt water :P</li>

      <li>It is okay will not reorder</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I have tried folks many things, I am from India and I went to every Ayurvedic clinic and Vicco pastes, did salt water gargles like 4 times a day</li>
      <li>Taste was ok.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>If most others can do it correctly, why not .</li>
      <li>Weleda products were one of my 3-4 brands I love best for natural, healthy and environment-friendly ingredients, free of toxic</li>
      <li>Even the kids love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Now my teeth and gums feel better than ever.</li>
      <li>Love Weleda products, this is one of my favorite toothpastes.</li>

      <li>Good price here at Amazon--much cheaper than an online vitamin retailer where she got her first tube of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It kind of reminds me of eating grapefruit - the unusual squirt of flavor comes at a shock, but as it sits in your mouth, it&#x27;s kind of refreshing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for cleaning your teeth though and feels very natural.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive gums and have found that this toothpaste works great and with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It worked like a charm in a pinch and felt clean and cooling!  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean after brushing with this!</li>

      <li>Amazing smell and fresh mouth.</li>
      <li>I like the idea of natural toothpaste and wasn&#x27;t happy</li>
      <li>Very good, if only the tube material would allow easy use of the rest of the contents.</li>
      <li>Most unnatural toothpastes leave a residue - this just leaves your mouth so so clean.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Went with this as wanted a toothpaste that was natural without flouride and other chemicals. Like the taste and seems to be doing a good job with my teeth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use toothpaste, but prefer baking soda. But my wife loves this stuff, so we bought a whole bunch of it. Good price here at Amazon--much cheaper than an online vitamin retailer where she got her first tube of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Someone liked my review and said it helped him/her. That&#x27;s generous because I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t write much of a review other than saying my wife liked it. A better review would say that she appreciates the minty flavor which is NOT sweet and thinks the slightly abrasive nature of it helps to make her teeth cleaner. She likes how her mouth feels afterwards. Because it&#x27;s not sweet, she thinks that she won&#x27;t tire of it after the second tube. Based on her views, I&#x27;ll stick with the 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember that 45 years ago a retired dental hygienist whom I knew socially, told me that I was just wasting money on toothpaste. According to her, baking soda mixed with a little salt was all I needed. Somewhere between then and now, I got into a big argument with my dentist&#x27;s hygienist (at that time) over the salt. She berated me for using it and I told her to mind her own business because I would use whatever I wanted on my teeth, including garage floor cleaner if it appealed to me. So now we&#x27;ve come full circle to where you can waste your money on toothpaste with baking soda and salt in it or you can waste your money on toothpaste with garage floor cleaner in it (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). If you care about your health, I think the former is a much better choice.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much ! Have a good time !  (:</li>
    <li> Best weleda toothpaste so far</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t like or dislike this toothpaste as I am still researching it. Shortly after trying it I got terrible mouth sores that lasted two weeks. My dentist was quite concerned as the ingredients in this toothpaste were not listed on the tube, so she could not evaluate if this was the cause. She felt my sores were an allergic reaction.  Has anyone else had this problem, and is there anything in this toothpaste that could cause such an allergic reaction?  I think the ingredients should be listed right on the tube.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> GREAT TOOTHPASTE!!! MAKES MY MOUTH FEEL SUPER CLEAN!!!!</li>
    <li> Very salty, and I have no idea what is in it, but this is the closest thing to mint-free I have found that tastes clean afterward. It is a brown color (surprised me) and has a gel consistency that does not lather like traditional toothpaste. However, I find I am using it more than any other thing I have bought in the quest for mint-free paste.</li>
    <li> Love it. My teeth tend to be sensitive, and I have used sensitive style tooth paste for a long time, but have found it difficult to get that stuff without fluoride and other things I don&#x27;t want in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that since using this salt toothpaste, my teeth have never bothered me with sensitivity since.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste hands down. No fluoride, no sls, and no glycerine. Make my mouth feel so refreshed.</li>
    <li> This salt toothpaste is expensive but very good for the gums.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Even though it doesn&#x27;t foam when you brush, it leaves the mouth very fresh. Amazing smell and fresh mouth. I will never use any other tooth paste! Ever!</li>
    <li> Now  I understand why they recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I feel refreshed&lt;br /&gt;I think That&#x27;s enough.  very Good !!! ~  ^,^</li>
    <li> I especially like to use this toothpaste after I have spent 20-minutes oil-pulling with coconut oil. Salty and gritty it gets the job done of making your mouth feel clean after use. The tube is not very big and I am already on my third tube; it is for this reason I have given it a four-star rating.</li>
    <li> I love how this product doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals and is completely natural, however it definitely has an acquired taste.     If you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice for your health then go with this toothpaste, but I&#x27;m warning you it tastes like salt water :P</li>
    <li> I bought this for my little boy, and he only has 6 teeth for the moment.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t wait to let him use this</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about this toothpaste, but the reviews and the Weleda reputation for fine products (many of which I have used) led me to give this a try.  Knowing that salt kills bacteria helped.  The first time I used it, it did taste a little too salty, but since that first use I do not find it objectionable.  I use it every other day, alternating with Prevident (I&#x27;ve had periodontal disease).  It&#x27;s only been about a month, so I will have to wait to find out if this product is beneficial, but I can say that my teeth, even my whole mouth, feels very clean and refreshed.  It is expensive, but if it improves my dental health, it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost to me.</li>
    <li> Good  for pregnant women</li>
    <li> I expected to not like this as I have never tried a &amp;#34;natural&#x27; toothpaste. I drink a ton of coffee and my teeth seem whiter after one week of use. It also feels like I just came from the dentist after every time I use it. I like the taste of it - no weird sickly sweet aftertaste.</li>
    <li> Ok, so you know it&#x27;s a salt toothpaste but really, this is very salty.  I hated it.  Imagine something salty and intensify it by 10 and you may be somewhere close.  I switched to a licorice toothpaste instead.</li>
    <li> I like it. But the taste is a little bit strange.</li>
    <li> I liked it, easy to use.</li>
    <li> On paper this should be a very good toothpaste - natural ingredients, metal tube, made in germany, etc.. I expected this to be a very gentle and neutral paste from the ingredients list, but it&#x27;s far from it. The relatively large particles of polishers they put in it seem to mar your teeth which lets plague build more easily. You can even feel the large salt crystal... Also, my gums did not feel the greatest while using it. After I switch to a different paste, all problems went away within a week. No safety seal. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> i  like it very much good&lt;br /&gt;buy it again!</li>
    <li> Not much effect on me.</li>
    <li> I only gave this a 4 because it&#x27;s VERY salty and that&#x27;s a little off-putting and it&#x27;s so thick and gritty that towards the end, the foil tube is all kinked with grit and I have to really work to get any of it out.  It&#x27;s great for cleaning your teeth though and feels very natural.  I have since purchased Weleda&#x27;s herbal toothpaste in the green and white tube and that stuff is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Very good, if only the tube material would allow easy use of the rest of the contents. The tube material is too inflexible for the application. If most others can do it correctly, why not .</li>
    <li> Healthy and good toothpaste. It is gentle on the teeth and cleans them extremely well. The taste took a while to get used to, but now I have come to like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Love the product but hate the metal tube.</li>
    <li> I am NOT allergic to this toothpaste!!!!!!!!!!! It tends to fall off of the brush.. that&#x27;s the downside but hey, if it doesn&#x27;t make my lips crack or gums bleed I am happy with it!!</li>
    <li> I think your response to this will vary depending upon what you are used to and what your diet is like. I brush with baking soda, salt and a pinch of cinnamon. My diet is very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making your own costs about 10% of what this cost, but is not as uniform and convenient. This is a LOT milder tasting than mixing your own. I don&#x27;t notice a salt taste at all (comparatively speaking) nor does the taste of the essential oils pop out. I like it a lot, but am giving it only 3 stars for the price. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again for that reason.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great after brushing, feel much better than other toothpaste,</li>
    <li> I have searched and found at last, an ALL NATURAL toothpaste.  After adjusting to the color of the paste, I am enjoying the simple formulation cleaning my teeth and breath, I am a very satisfied customer. Trudy</li>
    <li> This toothpaste will leave your teeth feeling super clean and your mouth very refreshed. You can eat something right after using it, too.</li>
    <li> I love brushing my teeth and pretending I&#x27;m at the ocean...this is an excellent toothpaste.  No foaming or frothing, nice and gritty.  It takes a bit to get used to the taste, but now, I won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste.  Savory instead of sweet, and no toxic chemicals.  Leaves breath fresh. I enjoy the texture, which is a little grainy but not abrasive.</li>
    <li> very good toothpaste without any bad chemicals, does the job cleans nice, tastes good (salty) yum</li>
    <li> I despise mint toothpaste so I was thrilled to find this. I use other Weleda products and have been very pleased, so I thought, why not? It&#x27;s amazing. My teeth are whiter and feel cleaner and my overall oral health has improved. My orthodontist even noticed. Don&#x27;t be put off by the salt taste. Yes, it tastes like salt, but it&#x27;s not bad at all. The BF who swears by all things minty even tried it and will now use nothing else.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is not very good.  It has a weird texture, doesn&#x27;t foam or hold to the brush, and no nice minty taste.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste, but nothing special. For its price you can buy something better.</li>
    <li> After I tasted salt toothpaste. I do not want to use the other. She brushing his teeth very well and has natural ingredients. The flavor and color in the beginning of extraordinary but my family quickly got used.</li>
    <li> Salt and peppermint...sounds strange, but tastes good.  I like this quite a bit better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best toothpastes I&#x27;ve ever used. I have extremely sensitive teeth (even brushing hurts sometimes!) but this one is fine. Tastes surprisingly refreshing, and a nice salty flavor.</li>
    <li> The moment you get used to this paste, you don&#x27;t want to use anything else. Tastes good, gives teeth a good polish and it&#x27;s delicate enough on sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Seemed to do a decent cleansing job, but could not overcome the taste!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference....</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I wish I could find it at a store near me but Amazon has great prices. Makes my teeth feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Weleda products are excellent on every level but this toothpaste is my all time favorite toothpaste.  It is salt based and is so refreshing!  No chemical after taste like commercial toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste. It is quite salty and it may take a few brushes to get used to it but don&#x27;t give up on it. The first week that I used it, it had my gums bleeding like crazy. The salt really gets in there and does some miraculous healing. Now my teeth and gums feel better than ever. I can&#x27;t imagine using a toothpaste with a fake mint flavor, or having that weird super slick feeling, or any other chemical nastiest. My teeth feel healthy, clean, and natural. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough, my friends are tired of hearing me talking about it. : )</li>
    <li> I have been  using this tooth paste for years.  It has no flavor or color and the salt really cleans your teeth. It is hard to find in the US so I am really pleased that Amazon carries it.  Even my dentist compliments me on my clean teeth.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> I made the switch to this and can&#x27;t go back! My teeth feel so clean after brushing with this! I have very sensitive gums and have found that this toothpaste works great and with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saltiness might take a little while to get used to, but I love it!</li>
    <li> wow.  I am so glad I found this toothpaste.  My teeth have never felt so clean and it whitens without anything harsh.  After using this for a few weeks, I got lazy and picked up some crest and it was the most disgusting feeling in the world!  Most unnatural toothpastes leave a residue - this just leaves your mouth so so clean.  Salty taste does not bother me - I try to keep it off my tongue though until the end.</li>
    <li> Cleanest feel without abrasive powder .Feel the nature ;) After this paste, I think to try over the other Weleda German products .if they all like this toothpaste ; than they hooked me 4 life ;)</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff. Used Weleda for years and then tried Toms brand, which was awful. Went back to Weleda and will never try anything else.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is awesome.  It tastes great and makes my mouth feel exceptionally clean.  I am always recommending it to others looking for flouride free pastes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide the foamy clean feeling of old toothpastes but gets teeth clean and helps decrease sensitivity to hot and cold.</li>
    <li> I do not know how to use it.</li>
    <li> Yes, this tastes very different. If you can get past the initial taste of salt, it is worth it. The taste grew on me and I now prefer it to the taste of conventional toothpaste which is sweet and leaves my mouth feeling like it needs &amp;#34;something&amp;#34;. The Weleda salt toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh without any residue.</li>
    <li> Gross taste.  Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Works great...my mouth feels very clean after using it plus all the natural ingredients...I&#x27;m going to buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and I like it.   Same this time as last. Company did a good job.</li>
    <li> The best tooth cream ever, polishes your teeth.</li>
    <li> Even the kids love this toothpaste. Makes your mouth feel clean and healthy without an overwhelming chemical mint flavor like the commercial toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I use three different flavors of Weleda toothpaste - this (Salt,) Ratanhia, and Calendula which tastes like licorice, my favorite.  All do a good job, and I tried them on the basis of being flouride free and carrageenan free.  But when I badly needed a grainy facial scrub, was at a hotel, didn&#x27;t pack a scrub but had packed my Salt toothpaste...&lt;br /&gt;Best facial I ever gave myself!  Yikes!  It worked like a charm in a pinch and felt clean and cooling!  Who knew?!</li>
    <li> ...Both salty and minty with Fennel taste.. A new experience for our family...No SLS or added junk.. So. Very Veggie with a gel paste....</li>
    <li> I always hear about how brushing your teeth with mint toothpaste before bed will keep you awake too long, so I only use this before going to bed and I fall asleep a LOT faster now. I also use it when I know I&#x27;m about to eat very soon (before a restaurant, etc.) and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all when eating food or drinking... I mean, it&#x27;s salt. I think it&#x27;s wonderful, but you will have to get yourself past the brown color and salty taste at first. It cleans very thoroughly and removes bad breath.</li>
    <li> Taste was ok. Wasn&#x27;t gross. I had an issue with one of my teeth, and was trying to reverse the infection or decay or whatever was going on. This did not help. Xylitol toothpaste helps a lot. Plus my breath would stink after I used this and that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d expect from a toothpaste. I really wanted to love this product. I was hoping to make it my number 1 toothpaste choice but that didn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;m still on the search.</li>
    <li> Although I absolutely love Weleda&#x27;s natural salt tootpaste, my dentist strongly urged me when I got veneers on my front teeth to stop using this and switch to another kind which would not be as abrasive. I am now using Weleda&#x27;s plant gel toothpaste which I also like because it doesn&#x27;t foam up too much. My husband is now using the salt toothpaste and likes it a lot. Will keep on buying this for him.</li>
    <li> This is sure salty but i love the way it makes my mouth feel. I can&#x27;t hardly use another tooth paste now becasue tnothing makes my teeth so white and mouth so squeaky clean--no fluoride!</li>
    <li> buy it for my friends as gifts, love all their products. Worth the money!  Salt and baking soda, clean feeling after.</li>
    <li> Good quality but not a great taste.  It is quite salty and a little minty.  Has a nice consistency.  Still trying out chemical free toothpaste and so far I liked the Neem Therape better than this one but it was very thick, like clay, and extremely difficult to get out of the tube.</li>
    <li> Love Weleda products, this is one of my favorite toothpastes. I am confused at any 1 star review. Of course its going to be salty. ITS A SALT TOOTHPASTE.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste because my dermatologist advised me to get a plain tooth paste.  I hate it.  I doesn&#x27;t keep its body while I brush and the taste is not pleasant.</li>
    <li> Not useful! I got tooth ache after using it. I guess it does not kill the bacterial as effective as other toothpaste!</li>
    <li> We have tried numerous toothpaste and this finally ended up being our favorite. Our grand kids will use it as well. My only con on this product is, I wish it came in a bigger tube, but I usually order two at a time. Try it you will love it!</li>
    <li> Not gross at all... Just don&#x27;t expect crest and you&#x27;ll be ok ;-)</li>
    <li> Really like this product, have been using it for years now.</li>
    <li> I got this toothpaste because I wanted something without flouride and SLS-free. That&#x27;s a surprisingly hard combo to find, so I was willing to try something normally out of my comfort zone: a salt toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did it taste? Strange, yet pleasant. It kind of reminds me of eating grapefruit - the unusual squirt of flavor comes at a shock, but as it sits in your mouth, it&#x27;s kind of refreshing. I can totally see this being one of those things that people either love or hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you might guess, I&#x27;m on the side that loves it. The salt is salty, but not as much as I expected. I was anticipating something really gross, but the flavor was much milder than I imagined. And maybe because I was pleasantly surprised, my experience felt better than someone who had high hopes and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the key is: don&#x27;t expect too much. Try it out. You might just enjoy yourself.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 4 months ago due to a recommendation from a friend.  I like the idea of natural toothpaste and wasn&#x27;t happy Tom&#x27;s of Maine is owned by Colgate.  The taste gets some getting used to.  My friend loves the taste, but I haven&#x27;t quite gotten there yet.  Tolerable but not great.  The real results was today when I went to get my 6 month cleaning.  My hygienist said that I had NO plague!!  This is the first time I have ever had that happen to me.  I use the toothpaste without water, so the abrasive effect of the salt can be maximized.  I use several of Weleda&#x27;s products.  I highly recommend their Everon lipbalm since it is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> After making my own toothpaste for several months, I decided to give this a try. The taste isn&#x27;t the greatest which is why I only gave it 3 stars, but it works great! I have had a couple of people even say my teeth are whiter. I&#x27;ll be looking for something more flavorful next time, but will not discount this product altogether!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural toothpaste, so I tried Weleda salt toothpaste as well as the plant gel toothpaste. They both work great in terms of performance, but the salt toothpaste is a bit of a shocker. The taste is not great, extremely salty, as the name would imply. I guess it was just too much salt for me, so I stuck with the plant gel toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I found the taste in the beginning to be really gross. But after a week or so, you get used to the taste completely and don&#x27;t even notice it. This gets the job done but doesn&#x27;t leave you with the fake aftertaste of mint, instead leaving your mouth feeling naturally clean. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Awesome toothpaste. The mint with the salt makes your teeth feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is great also.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to. I was curious about how a natural toothpaste would perform and decided on this one since I&#x27;ve used Weleda products before. I normally use the Listerine toothpaste and absolutely love everything about it. It might not be fair to compare the two because they perform and taste differently. This toothpaste is salty as the name indicates. It doesn&#x27;t produce a white foam. I was startled at first use when I spat it out and saw all that pink. I thought my gums were bleeding but it was just the pink of the paste. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and haven&#x27;t yet decided if I will repurchase. I went out and bought another tube of the Listerine toothpaste to use when I wake up and before I go to bed and will continue to use the Weleda after meals.</li>
    <li> Oho &amp; Behold the miracle toothpaste for souring paining gums and painful teeths, this is the ULTIMATE problem solver if you don&#x27;t want to visit your dentist and save some grands for your retirement funds.......BUY THIS TOOTHPASTE NOW, till stocks lasts.  If I have $10,000 credits I will buy the whole production of these guys who make this wonderful stuff. What an amazing 5 star results, either this is a gift from God, or it is by chance the formula of this toothpaste came out to be ultra powerful.  By the way those guys who are looking for foamy and creamy fluoride or minty tastes, please don&#x27;t look for this toothpaste. This is The sacred Holy grail toothpaste, whom only those can appreciate whose tooths or teeths (my englias very poor) are souring painful and they are about to get root canal or demolish or eliminate the tooth or on a urgent kind of situation.  Not only so, if I say for emergency, I would be blatantly a liar, because I found that after solving my gum and tooth pains, this slimy salty and runny paste went on to clean all of my teeths, which I could never before by using any organic or toxic pastes. I have tried folks many things, I am from India and I went to every Ayurvedic clinic and Vicco pastes, did salt water gargles like 4 times a day and YES, this is all good, I don&#x27;t say that my tooth came out.  All I am saying that with all of the organic Nanny stories and household kitchen stuff that we try to prevent ourselves for loosing our million dollar tooth, it just could barely prolong my timing of not visiting dentist. At one point, I was so desperate that I brushed with YL Thieves paste 4 times and gargled after few mins of brushing and this was all good which kept me going &amp; smiling and eating on one side.......you know what I am saying. But with this Made in Germany Weleda, aha, aha, thank God for the scientist and more thankful for the guys (or gals) who mixed ingredients and made this into perfect outcome, that at first I had to brush 4 times (after every meal or even after tea / coffee / cold drinks) a day and must before bedtime and early mornings. Use a soft brush (buy new) and throw the brush every 2 months, this I did not understand why doctors advised to throw every month (I thought they are getting paid by toothbrush companies) but thank God that now I do, and I apologise for my wrong thinking. In India, there are many people who use the Bark of tree, I don&#x27;t have English name but it is called Datun, and this is little bitter in taste but works wonders for teeth or tooths, the problem is, if anyone want to start using this stuff, they have to have healthy teeth to start with, otherwise it&#x27;s going to pain like hell, if you already have painful teeth. Why am I saying this, because I tried this too and all the dental manjans (easily available in India) and abroad, and I definitely don&#x27;t want to discount this 1000 year old time tested stuff, folks it&#x27;s all good and as long as you keep dental hygiene under control. I wish I would have listened to my Mom or Dad or Nanny from childhood days and did take care of my teeth since, but for many of us it&#x27;s just too late waking up.  In anycase I salute this wonderful toothpaste and would recommend for anyone who is looking to get healthy teeths. I have one recommendation too here, as I have many good friends who happens to be dentists, they tell me to change the toothpastes every month or so, or keep rotating 5-6 types of toothpastes and not continue the same over and over, the reason, bacteria in our teeths get used to it and then the fight stops (and decay starts), so I would ask the good company (made in Germany) to think in this line and come up with 5-6 different combinations so that we keep using Mr. Weleda for ever and ever........thank you all for reading this and hope it helps because it certainly helped me.(after every meal or even after tea / coffee / cold drinks) a day and must before bedtime and early mornings. Use a soft brush (buy new) and throw the brush every 2 months, this I did not understand why doctors advised to throw every month (I thought they are getting paid by toothbrush companies) but thank God that now I do, and I apologise for my wrong thinking.

    <li> Favorite toothpaste of all time!!</li>
    <li> Fewer canker sores inside mouth with this.  Rolls off brush like a piece of candy, very dehydrated.  Smash into brush with spoon.</li>
    <li> Ingredients are good, but my gums bleed.</li>
    <li> great smell and taste, use it with my philips toothbrush. i think might help to get teeth white.</li>
    <li> I know this toothpaste is expensive, but I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Came to it to avoid SLS and found it cleans FAR more and more thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;than any other toothpaste. None of the people at the dentists&lt;br /&gt;office had heard of it, but after looking at my teeth and leaving pretty much nothing&lt;br /&gt;for his assistant to clean, he said &amp;#34;whatever you&#x27;re doing,&lt;br /&gt;your teeth are really clean. Keep it up. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing makes my mouth feel fresher and as deeply clean. Salty, pepperminty taste.</li>
    <li> I order these for my husband since he won&#x27;t switch to anything else.  However, the bulk deal to get them cheaper is getting me annoyed.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several Natural Salt toothpaste over the years and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I did not see it whitens my teeth. But it does refresh my breath. I still like it. Maybe for a long time use, I will see the whitening.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without my toothpaste, without any of the sugary cloying taste of American toothpastes.  This is slightly salty but very refreshing, my mouth and teeth feel very clean and fresh after use, and my dental hugienist has commented on fact my gums look better since I discovered this product.  Unconditional fan.</li>
    <li> It works like the polish when I go to my dentist for cleaning, it cleanses very well, and leaves a fresh breath.  I don&#x27;t mind the salty taste at all.</li>
    <li> Really gets your teeth clean, I use it with an electric toothbrush, pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Mouth feels fresh. Great tasting. Some of the best, if not the best toothpaste I have used. I have been using this for years now!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used</li>
    <li> Thank you for the wonderful product, has arrived on time, and as described  have a great weekend</li>
    <li> I really think this toothpaste is preserving my teeth.</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth really clean</li>
    <li> Weleda products were one of my 3-4 brands I love best for natural, healthy and environment-friendly ingredients, free of toxic rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;The Weleda salt toothpaste is a great toothpaste that leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean, no poisonous Fluoride, no fake promises of whitening that never happens, just clean healthy gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could find in Amazon USA the Weleda sunscreens and other products we purchased in Europe.</li>
    <li> Love it! After one week of using this,  my teeth feel like i just had them cleaned!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste obviously has a slight salty after taste to it, but I barely notice it and in fact kind of enjoy it (reminds me of when I got my lip pierced and used sea salt to clean it).  Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried other salt-based toothpastes and this by far gives me the freshest feeling afterward.  My mouth feels refreshed, my gums are smooth, and it makes you wanna lick your teeth they feel so good.  Pair this up with some floss and you&#x27;re really going to feel like a team of excavators went in your mouth and dug up all that grime.  Although a metal tube means you have to put a little more thought on how you squeeze your toothpaste;  I enjoy using metal/glass in place of plastic for storing things because It gives me piece of mind that the contains wont get contaminated from chemicals used in plastics.  I recommend this product and will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste in the world. Worth the price! It always leaves my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the rave amazon reviews. It&#x27;s good. Won&#x27;t hurt sensitive teeth and is gritty enough to clean well. Teeth feel smooth and shiny. It&#x27;s not advertized as a whitener, so now and then you might want to use something else to brighten your pearly whites (a common issue with natural toothpaste) but I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Cleans and whitens naturally and more effective than regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My teeth felt really clean and the taste wasn&#x27;t that bad.  I would recommend this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> just love this salt toothpaste, it makes me get rid of all the other toothpaste immediately!</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste!  It shipped quick and the product is as it was advertsied.  Thank You, I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this toothpaste and loves it. She says it has a strong peppermint flavor but she loves peppermint so it doesn&#x27;t bother her. As far as the salt flavor, it&#x27;s a matter of opinion. Some reviewers think its too much but my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t mind it a bit. She says her teeth feel the cleanest they&#x27;ve felt in awhile. She only uses true organic/natural (no hidden junk) products.</li>
    <li> I tried it. It does not suds at all. I find my throat having a reaction to this salty taste toothpaste. I don&#x27;t feel clean after using...even if it works.</li>
    <li> The taste is good It&#x27;s not salty at all but when I put it in my mouth it seems to melt and i can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m using enough idk but I guess it has to be that way since it&#x27;s natural. also I bought two of them but one came kinda squished :/</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste.  No harmful flouride, and leaves your mouth minty fresh. Too bad the prices are now so high on amazon that I buy at Whole foods instead.</li>
    <li> my 2.5 yrs toddler loves it and uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> As a child I hated the taste and effects of all of the “American” toothpastes, so as a young adult I switched to plain Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and have been brushing my teeth with baking soda for decades now (with great results).  That is why I decided to try this “salt” toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the ingredients of Weleda Salt toothpaste, sodium bicarbonate is listed first which is supposed to mean it is the main ingredient, but speaking for myself, I certainly do not taste any salt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ingredients include blackthorn flower extract, myrrh extract, and organic ratanhia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this toothpaste for a month, my teeth are whiter, and it cleans off the buildup of plaque extremely better.  My teeth feel smooth and clean after brushing.  I am hooked.</li>
    <li> It is okay will not reorder</li>
    <li> Really love this toothpaste.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No foam.  I hate all that foam that comes from regular toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t understand why they make it like that.  Not only is it a bigger mess, but it actually gets in the way of the bristles on your toothbrush from hitting the surface of your teeth so it contributes to getting your teeth LESS clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Salt particles.  Those particles really help scrub the film of food off my teeth.  So many times after using regular toothpaste (Colgate usually), I would run the tip of my tongue over my teeth and I could still feel plaque completely (COMPLETELY!) covering my teeth.  As if the brushing did absolutely nothing.  Now when I feel my teeth with my tongue, my teeth feel smooth and clean.  I think it has to do with both the salt particles helping to scrub that stuff off as well as the fact that there&#x27;s no foam to get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Natural!  I really like knowing this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have all those toxic chemicals in it.  I know they wouldn&#x27;t have killed me but I didn&#x27;t feel they were necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this toothpaste is that it has a minty flavor.  I hate mint flavoring.  But at least it&#x27;s not as powerful a flavor as regular toothpaste and it comes from a natural source (ie. peppermint) instead of some artificial flavor.  The salt part does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste does not contain fluoride, but since I rarely get cavities, I&#x27;m hoping that won&#x27;t have too much of a negative impact overall. The primary problem with my teeth has always always been plaque and how it turns very quickly into tartar.  This, along with my cheapo Oral B battery operated toothbrush, have really done wonders for that.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this toothpaste. It takes a little getting used to the gritty, salty-ness, but it is well worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> After brushing my teeth feel mouth salty, but fresh breath</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste that is such a welcome break from all of the synthetic and harmful chemicals in Crest etc. This paste leaves my mouth feeling so clean and fresh in such a non-polluted way. The differences were night and day. Deifnitley loving the natural-ness of all of the ingredients. I really hope Weleda does and is doing well in the States and I will be definitely trying different toothpastes. On a side note, I was in my local grocery store and found Weleda Buckthorn lotion.... and it is similarly amazing. My skin has become restored with a supple glow. This is coming from a working man with working hands.</li>
    <li> My teeth were become very white after use this product. It taste very salty.</li>
    <li> The surprise is this toothpaste is brown.  Despite that, I loved how clean my teeth felt after brushing but unfortunately within 1 1/2 months of first use there were noticeable stains on my teeth that had to be buffed away at my last dental appointment.  At least they came off.  I won&#x27;t be using this product again because of the color and sadly the rest of the tube is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> although i can not stand the weird taste at the first, it is the best toothpaste i&#x27;ve ever used. it gives me extremely fresh breath and clean teeth!</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste and am happy to find one that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which I seem to be allergic to. I do not find it to be too salty, the taste is mild to me.</li>
</ol>
