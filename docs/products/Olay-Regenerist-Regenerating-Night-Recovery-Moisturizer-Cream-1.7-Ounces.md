### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful deal</li>
      <li>Great price for a great product!</li>
      <li>Skin looks great, has velvety finish perfect for even powder foundation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, the price is great.  </li>
      <li>I do have facials and was told by them that what ever I was doing to continue as it made a remarkable</li>
      <li>Good nighttime moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It was the answer to my night moisturizing....thick and feels good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>you will see that this is untouchable - great price and better value..</li>
      <li>The face cream arrived right on schedule and is a great value for the money.</li>
      <li>This was a great price though, and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product!</li>
      <li>and she is now glad she got the purple</li>
      <li>I shopped around and this was definitely the best price!!</li>
      <li>I love the way this cream feels on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Better than many products that sell for 3X as much.</li>
      <li>has noticed no difference, and claims it is the same to her performance wise.  </li>
      <li>4/19/15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original P&amp;G Regenerist Night Cream is WHITE, creamy, and is in a light rose colored jar.  </li>
      <li>I have used Olay Regenerist for approximately 10 months now and it is the best I have found for moisturizing my skin.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves a smooth silky soft finish.</li>
      <li>yes, older formula, but unless someone can tell me the difference in performance from this and the newer and improved stuff, I&#x27;ll take that savings and use it to make my couch more comfortable, or maybe some anti-snoring products or diet pills or exerciser things (does Suzanne Somers still sell them butter-master thing-a-ma-jigs) for the wifewhen (if) she lets me back in bed.</li>
      <li>Having finished several jars, I am well pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>This definitely feels better on the skin.  </li>
      <li>This is not the new improved white cream that you can get in the local drug store which is very nice.  </li>
      <li>difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly would recommend it.</li>
      <li>First, I believe this is the older formulaOlay product, and is a purple colored cream.  </li>
      <li>Well hell, if this will make my wife look more like one of them hot asian women, well, tell me where I can buy a five gallon bucket and dunk my wife&#x27;s big fat.....</li>
      <li>I mean have enough on hand for my beautiful bride of over 30 years</li>
      <li>A slight bit of fragrance, any more would be too much.</li>
      <li>Also, my wife preferred the older purple cream that these are and was upset over the change</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m mostly using organic oils for face care, but this is my go-to for occasional night use and definitely for days</li>
      <li>However, I have pointed out to her that she has been using this product for 20 years now, and yet she looks older now than when she started using it.  </li>
      <li>Not sure of the quality difference, but I have to come to the conclusion that new and improved does not always mean better (Think old Coke and New Coke, as well as Ragu sauce, that I loved until they changed it to a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
      <li>This is the old purple formula from 2013.  </li>
      <li>My face is so soft now.</li>
      <li>Amazon needs to get this old stuff off the website.</li>
      <li>This is the old purple formulation.</li>
      <li>The cream is a lavender color, barely creamy, P &amp; G Regenerist Night Cream product in a lavender jar, and is made in Taiwan.  </li>
      <li>Even though the label is the same, this is the old purple, gooey formulation.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is exactly the same, so I&#x27;m not sure if this is an older formula or what, but I prefer the white lotion I got from the drug store over this purple one.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this thinking it was the Olay I purchase in stores.  It is not!  I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good nighttime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the product in these &amp;#34;lavender jars!&amp;#34;  The cream is a lavender color, barely creamy, P &amp; G Regenerist Night Cream product in a lavender jar, and is made in Taiwan.  I unfortunately could not return the 3 jars, because they were purchased on 4/19/15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original P&amp;G Regenerist Night Cream is WHITE, creamy, and is in a light rose colored jar.  This definitely feels better on the skin.  I did not discover the difference until yesterday, 5/27/15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terri</li>
    <li> I have used Olay Regenerist for approximately 10 months now and it is the best I have found for moisturizing my skin.  I do have facials and was told by them that what ever I was doing to continue as it made a remarkable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I noticed that this had a few bad reviews, so waited until I could judge for myself.  Having finished several jars, I am well pleased with the results.  It seems to add , protect, and retain moisture.  As you can tell by my &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m anxious to hold on to what I have and to improve it while I can.  I give it a &amp;#34;thumbs up&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It was the answer to my night moisturizing....thick and feels good on my skin.  A slight bit of fragrance, any more would be too much.</li>
    <li> The lotion inside is purple and smells different from the Olay Regenerist lotion I bought at the drug store last month.  The packaging is exactly the same, so I&#x27;m not sure if this is an older formula or what, but I prefer the white lotion I got from the drug store over this purple one.  This was a great price though, and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet. It is a different color and made in Thailand!?</li>
    <li> My face is so soft now.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is not from the USA its very thin and doesn&#x27;t work at all. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> First, I believe this is the older formulaOlay product, and is a purple colored cream.  The newer stuff you get at the store is white.  Not sure of the quality difference, but I have to come to the conclusion that new and improved does not always mean better (Think old Coke and New Coke, as well as Ragu sauce, that I loved until they changed it to a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; taste.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the price is great.  Three jars for $30 as opposed to one jar for $17 at the store.  Also, my wife preferred the older purple cream that these are and was upset over the change and she is now glad she got the purple cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has noticed no difference, and claims it is the same to her performance wise.  However, I have pointed out to her that she has been using this product for 20 years now, and yet she looks older now than when she started using it.  You can see my reviews for couch pillows and a couch blanket recently purchased by me on Amazon.  Some women can not take a joke.  And those that can, find no humor in their aging.  Seriously.  I guess we men just get distinguished looking, whereas women simply degrade and fall apart.  (I supposed I should order a Snuggie now just in case she reads that last comment.)  Someone stated that this stuff was meant for the asian market, whereas the white stuff is for us Americans.  Well hell, if this will make my wife look more like one of them hot asian women, well, tell me where I can buy a five gallon bucket and dunk my wife&#x27;s big fat.....errr I mean have enough on hand for my beautiful bride of over 30 years so she will never run out...OMG...thirty...really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, older formula, but unless someone can tell me the difference in performance from this and the newer and improved stuff, I&#x27;ll take that savings and use it to make my couch more comfortable, or maybe some anti-snoring products or diet pills or exerciser things (does Suzanne Somers still sell them butter-master thing-a-ma-jigs) for the wifewhen (if) she lets me back in bed.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff! She feels the difference and I can see the difference. Better than many products that sell for 3X as much.</li>
    <li> Wonderful deal ---compare prices and you will see that this is untouchable - great price and better value..</li>
    <li> I have purchased from Target before and the ones I purchased were not the same. These were purple in color for the cream and a different consistency and smell from the ones I purchased from Target. Also the ones I purchased from Amazon were made in Thailand or Taiwan not here. Not sure what they put in the jar but it was not the same product and I will never purchase this from Amazon again</li>
    <li> I received all three creams but all 3 tops on them were some what opened. I do not know if they had been opened before but previous times when I had boughten these creams at my local drug store the tops were closed VERY well. Still not sure if I would buy this produce again.</li>
    <li> The face cream arrived right on schedule and is a great value for the money. I shopped around and this was definitely the best price!! I got these 3 jars for less than the price others were asking for 2 jars.</li>
    <li> This is the old purple formulation. It is awful  This is not the new improved white cream that you can get in the local drug store which is very nice.  Even though the label is the same, this is the old purple, gooey formulation.  It also has less of the ingredients that are supposedly anti aging.  I called Olay and found this out. Amazon needs to get this old stuff off the website.</li>
    <li> This is the old purple formula from 2013.  I am returning as that is not what is described or expected.  I had to do research to see why it wasn&#x27;t white.  I was afraid it might be a counterfeit or knock-off.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Skin looks great, has velvety finish perfect for even powder foundation.  I&#x27;m mostly using organic oils for face care, but this is my go-to for occasional night use and definitely for days I use make-up in our humid climate!  My foundation has SPF so I don&#x27;t need it in my lotion.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream feels on my skin.  It absorbs quickly and leaves a smooth silky soft finish.</li>
