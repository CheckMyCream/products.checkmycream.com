<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THIS HAIR WAS HORRIBLE , BUT I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN , HARD TO COMB , NAPPY AND FRIZZED UP WHEN I TRIED TO FLAT IRON IT IT WOULD NOT STAY THAT WAY ANY THIS HAIR DOESNT CURL</li>
    <li> These are very good quality extensions, they are thick and lots of hair.  I ordered the color dark brown, not as dark brown as I thought they would be, so I just dyed it with the same color dark brown dye I use in my hair and that matched them up perfect. I also thought from the picture that they were curly, because my hair is curly, I had to perm the hair. After some work of dyeing and perming, I crossed my fingers that I did not hurt the hair. I must say the hair held up.The extensions do not shed but a few strands. Mind you I put them to the test. Also I am a lead singer of a high-energy rock band and I swing the hair 3 hours a night and have not had one fall out yet. You must follow the washing instructions and use good conditioner. I only wash the hair when it has build up on it. I waited to rate this product so I could be sure the hair was worth the time to do a review on. I am definitely order again, great product. The only things I could say negative is I wish they came with 2 X Clips of 2 hair extensions, I have to put all 6 1 clips in to match the back of my hair to the front of my hair lots of work. I hope this helps you when you are ordering.</li>
    <li> These are the best extensions I&#x27;ve ever bought! So much hair, and very affordable! The hair is soft and tangle-free. I will never buy any other brand of extensions!</li>
    <li> I have bought several packages of extensions for my daughter this one being the most expensive and they are no different for the $48.00 ones I bought.  They are not thicker or longer, matter of fact they say on the site that they are 20&amp;#34; - (22&amp;#34;) and it clearly states that they are 20&amp;#34; on the packaging.  Save your money and go with the deal.</li>
    <li> the hair at first is silky and soft. And is a lot of hair. Ive learned from my past extensions that we really shouldn&#x27;t be washing the extensions a lot because you shouldnt be putting a lot of product in your hair extensions. I read the reviews when purchasing these extensions. And there was a lot of good feedback. Ive had these extensions for two months now and they are awful. They matte so badly. They tangle and you have to consistently be brushing out the knots. Ive only washed them once, when first i first received them.  To bring out the volume in them. Every time i bring a comb through them, tons of hair falls out.. they are now all stringy and look completely fake when i try to wear them. Never again will i purchase this brand. I mean the extensions where cheap as in price, but the quality you recieve is also cheap.</li>
    <li> Love at first sight. After only a couple months of wearing them theyve become very tangly and hard to maintain. Good for the price but not the best quality hair. I would buy these again though.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality. Do no buy.</li>
    <li> Love this hair . Gorgeous color. it easy to care for. keeps shine better than many.vi will buy again. nicely</li>
    <li> Starting off, I&#x27;ve been purchasing 18\\&quot; Euronext remi clip in extensions for the past 3 years and recently found out you get NO HAIR for the price you pay (80grams) so I ended up getting fed up paying $140.00 for nothing at all and going through 2 boxes a year.. I came across these extensions on amazon and saw that they were 20inches and 150grams of hair which is great for the price! It took 3 days to receive my hair in the mail and I was so excited to open them! They are a lot thicker than I expected the length is about down to my hips. Although they say the shedding is minimal mine seemed to kinda shed a lot when I brushed through them but still amazing quality for the price and my hairs extremely thick and looks completely natural with the extensions in. I will definitely purchase more! The Color was a lot lighter than my hair but as the description above says you may treat them as your own hair so I dyed them to match. LITERALLY MY NEW OBSESSION. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> First time with extensions and I love them! I have thick dark Asian hair (which is a bit lightened from the sun) and this color works perfectly. Comes with many clips and half the time I don&#x27;t even use all of them. I&#x27;ve recently cut my hair shorter and these extensions give me back the length I use to have.</li>
    <li> The goods as described and quick access</li>
    <li> I would give these negative stars if possible! Only positive thing I have to say is shippinh was fast. Other than that horrible product! Was supposed to have 10 wefts. Recieved 5. 3 of which had no clips on them whatsoever. No way this weighed 150g. Hair quality was horrible. So wispy at the ends. Never once wore them. Returning them already. Ladies, save your money and your time!!!!!@@</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> i love hair like sooo much ive gotton so many different types but this hair wasnt what i had expected it was a bit dry on the ends and really thin from the clip to the bottom of the wefts they seemed to just dry out or thin out.. it was a beautiful color i guess i must of had high expectations</li>
    <li> Hair not as full as I thought it would be. As I was&amp;#34;combing&amp;#34; through hair with my fingers there was major shedding. The amount of hair that a micro loop extension would have was coming right out of the actual weft. The only positive thing I can say is that the clips are very secure and comfortable for the five min I had them in before I repackaged them up to send them back to company. The hair itself was very soft but there were splits in the mid shaft of hair that if any heating was done those would definitely break off or create more split ends.</li>
    <li> I loved these. I had bought some before from a different company and liked those as well, but they got gross very fast. These lasted a long time with my constant styling (I took good care of them-heat protectant etc) and they matched my hair perfectly. I&#x27;m amazon right now to get another set :)</li>
    <li> I wish I had reviewed this product sooner and maybe came to some resolution with the seller. I received my extensions and absolutely LOVED them! They matched perfect, they were thick and really soft. However, after a couple of uses I noticed silver hairs throughout my beautiful chocolate brown locks. I now have noticed so many gray hairs that I don&#x27;t wear them at all. It&#x27;s so disappointing after paying so much for hair extensions. Would be a great product without the unwanted gray hairs. :(</li>
    <li> Initially, I loved the hair, it was soft. After the first wash though, the hair turned straw like and was completely unmanageable. Don&#x27;t even waste your time or money on these. Go to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply. They have the best clip ins for a little extra money. These extensions are not Remy quality hair by any means.</li>
    <li> It is exactly  what i wanted to get. The color was really dark brown and the length was perfect for me&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> They are really thick and I loved them! Great product. Only problem was they didn&#x27;t match my hair. But I simple dye job fixed that! Would recommend them to anyone that wants extensions!</li>
    <li> So I bought this because I wanted to make my hair look fuller and longer! I can&#x27;t really say to much about the quality because this was my first time trying out hair extensions. To me the hair itself  was smooth and color was good but this did not work out for me. I had to return the hair because it was to thin for me. I have natural thick Peruvian hair and this just made my hair look full on top (mixed in with my hair) and thin on the bottom. You can clearly tell where my natural hair stopped and that the length of my hair was fake. I thought these extensions would work because it said for medium to thick hair but my hair is way to thick.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter love it this hair , many thank you , will buy this seller again</li>
    <li> I shaved my hair awhile back and im in the growing out stage and I could just not waittttt!&lt;br /&gt;I usually would just go to sally and what not, but last time I paid a ridiculous price for some that I never wore because they where way too thin,&lt;br /&gt;well I took a chance with these and must say I am VERYY pleased! Thick enough for my super thick hair. and beautiful color, I would totally buy more when these get old &lt;3</li>
    <li> The y advertiste 9 pieces of hair But  i got 3 complete pieces and one broken in 6 tiny Small with one clip each It looks Like someone got a scisor and cut it off , But i had to say that quality of hair Was. Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> Comentario de mi esposa: la calidad del cabello es muy buena, le encanta, lo recomienda. aunque no es el color que hubiese querido pues igual lo usara, lo pintara...</li>
    <li> The hair has gray hair in it and I&#x27;m not old enough for gray hair other than that it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> This product was very good they were exactly what i wanted and was looking for i liked everything about them</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying extensions and I was NOT disappointed. It looks so real and it&#x27;s soooooo much hair!! Look no further for clip in extensions. U won&#x27;t be disappointed. Also, the customer service is phenomenal. The customer service rep made me feel so comfortable with buying these and reassured me I was getting a great deal. When I received them in the mail in less than 2 days I was ecstatic to be wearing them over the weekend!! No one could even tell it was fake. I felt like a SUPERSTAR!! These are worth every penny,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;  with a long trunk.  My hair is in the middle of my back and with these extensions my hair looks so long and very thick.  When my extensions are in my hair is on my lower back area and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-  styles easy&lt;br /&gt;  does not hurt my head&lt;br /&gt;  stays in&lt;br /&gt;  looks amazing&lt;br /&gt;  no regrets&lt;br /&gt;  Cheap worth every penny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- after washing they frizz (just add anti-frizz stuff and there fine.)&lt;br /&gt;  hard to brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for extensions for prom here they are,  just don&#x27;t wash them till your prom is over.</li>
    <li> I love these extensions!  They arrived quickly and blended in with my hair amazingly!  I used them for my bridal photos and on my wedding day!  You could not tell they were extensions!</li>
    <li> I lOve this hair so smooth slinky an plus it&#x27;s perfect length and price is really good I bought extensions at Sally&#x27;s for almost 200 and. They 18 inch this hair is perfect and I&#x27;ll continue to buy HIGHLY RECOMMONES PLUS IT CAME REALLY FAST IN MAIL!!</li>
    <li> I give the extentions 5 stars because they are a perfect match to the color I needed and they are great quality.</li>
    <li> I shaved my head a while back to cut out my dreads and dead hair due to excessive coloring. My hair is at that awkward stage and I bought extensions to help get through this stage, and I love them.  I can style them and they are so easy to put in, I love them so much and so did my friends.  One even bought some of her own.  Yes they were not as thick as my own hair, but what do your expect with extensions they are made to add volume, not be the volume.</li>
    <li> Minus the fact that they get extremely frizzy after you wash them a few times, they&#x27;re alright. I reccomend using CHI sleek-frizz serum to manage the frizz. I realllllllllly loved these when I first got them, but I hate how they started frizzing and getting tangled almost immediately after I washed them.&lt;br /&gt;I never used heated styling tools. Never used hairspray or damaging hair styling junk..&lt;br /&gt;I only wear them in the hairs naturally wavey structure cause its very natural and real looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Sally&#x27;s clip in extensions for about 4 years, and finally got sick of the quality going down the drain, especially when they started raising their prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought these about 3 weeks ago, and they are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I took them out of the packet I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silky soft, SHINY, very full, easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I have received a LOT of compliments about my hair, and wish this was my real hair. Alas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this brand again. And again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critiques would be that the extensions didn&#x27;t turn black when dyed. On the flip side, they became a lovelier darker brown.&lt;br /&gt;So, maybe doesn&#x27;t grab color well, but still gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I ordered  Dark brown hair extensions but when I received it the color was very off, it was more like a medium brown not dark. Also I&#x27;m not sure why it says 22&amp;#34;, package clearly states 20 &amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s really not much hair. Also when I inspected the hair it had some gray hairs, I returned it the same day.</li>
    <li> The product was received faster than I expected, and the quality of the hair was great. They are thick, strong, and the legnth is accurate. The color was also accurate. You get what you pay for, and this was a great buy</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my wedding and was absolutely in love.  No one could tell that I had extensions in.  I bought them to add volume not length, however they were a little longer than I expected them to be.  Still loved them though!  My natural hair is at my bra strap when straight and these came about an inch to 2 inches below my bra strap when curled.  Not enough of a length difference for anyone to notice though.  Wonderful quality and the color was perfect.  Shipment was extremely fast as well.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t the worst extensions, but they&#x27;re certainly not the best. There are many more products that are cheaper and much better than these. They aren&#x27;t 100% human hair like it says. Mine burned the first time I curled them. They also didn&#x27;t hold color whatsoever. Human hair can be colored. The color immediately washed out, which was really irritating because not only did I waste money on the extensions, I wasted money on color as well. They are also extremely ratty. I would not recommend these! I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> First off, the shipping on this was SO FAST it&#x27;s stupid. I had my hair in my hands literally three days after ordering. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bunch of info and care instructions came with it, making me think (in addition to how silky they feel - although they all feel this way out of the bag, don&#x27;t they girls?) that they&#x27;re the real deal as far as Remi and human hair-ness goes. If anything leads me to believe otherwise after wearing a few times I&#x27;ll come back and letcha know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a litttttle darker than I expected (though they did say it would be darker than the model&#x27;s hair in the photo, so that was my gamble) but luckily brown hair blends together really well and I prefer extensions that are a bit darker as opposed to too light anyway. Overall, five stars!</li>
    <li> Loved it.exceeded my expectations.a few little fixes and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> The extensions are very nice, easy to style. I do notice a little texture difference after I washed them. They are thick from top to bottom. I have medium thick mixed girl hair. They look great. They&#x27;re very long like past butt length long and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;6.</li>
    <li> I love them!! Once you get used to putting them on, it&#x27;s a piece of cake. The color matches great, the hair is nice. Great price and great product</li>
    <li> After  many years of wearing various types of extensions from fusion to clip ins, i got sick of all the lying surrounding it. Very thin very expensive horrible customer service and just plain crappy! I found tressmatch and decided what the heck. I emailed them and within one hour I got a lovely email from Jane and we corresponded back and forth for three days until my hair arrived. She was amazingly helpful and knowledgeable and she made it a great experience. I will be putting the hair in tonight but comparing it to my Euronext and proextensions they&#x27;re great. Very thick from roof to tip, very long, silky non tangly and great clips. They used to have four larger wefts but went down to three which I don&#x27;t like because I have thick hair however I purchased two packs so I should have more then enough. I&#x27;m ecstatic to try them out and if they hold up like I think they will, they&#x27;ll have a client for life! Try them you&#x27;ll see what I mean;) thanks Jane!!</li>
    <li> My order came before the estimated shipping date. this seller is great. The 9 piece set was a little to thin for my natural hair thickness and the seller sent me an additional clip to make my look natural. this was super nice of them and it came really quick. the color blends so well with my hair color and before i ordered this, one of my fears was to have it not match mine.... but it was PERFECT . i would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in having a nice set of extensions. thank you</li>
    <li> These extensions claim to be for people with thick hair but that is a joke. The hair is so thin that once in my hair it looks like I have random patches, its impossible to blend with my hair. If you have super thin hair these might work out for you but if your hair is thick don&#x27;t waste the money because you will need at least 3 sets. So now I&#x27;m out about $120 for extensions that are worthless to me. For the quality I received I should have just spent $20 on ebay.</li>
