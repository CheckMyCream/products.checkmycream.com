### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>There may be easier ones to use but for the price, it&#x27;s awesome and it works well if you use it correctly.</li>
      <li>This is the best eye lash curler that I ever bought.  </li>
      <li>Want the best eyelash curler?</li>
      <li>This is a great Revlon Eyelash curler!!!</li>
      <li>My daughter was happy with this and it works perfect for her</li>
      <li>I really loved this eyelash curler!</li>
      <li>Arrived in great time.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>I used to use an old-time Maybelline curler from the 60&#x27;s and loved it to pieces.</li>
      <li>bought this for my sister from her wishlist, she loved it</li>
      <li>I had heard so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great product!</li>
      <li>Really good works fantastic :)</li>
      <li>So sure, if you work at it you may get those curled lashes.</li>
      <li>My favorite lash curler.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even fit it in my eye socket.</li>
      <li>They look long and beautiful when I am done.</li>
      <li>Perhaps people with smaller eyes or eyelash spans would be okay with this one, but if you REALLY want a good curl throughout your lashes, I recommend you steer clear.</li>
      <li>I can push it back on but as soon as I try to curl my lashes and even the slightest bit of pressure is applied to the top piece</li>
      <li>The top piece (where the red pad pushes up against) popped off.</li>
      <li>But sadly, no.  </li>
      <li>The red pads that cushion your fingers come off really easily.</li>
      <li>The curler does not curl my lashes very well, this product did not meet my expectations</li>
      <li>Last one was \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; and not any better than the standard.  </li>
      <li>I am very disapponted.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money!</li>
      <li>It makes my eyelashes very curled they look natural!</li>
      <li>When the curler reaches your lashes it curls just fine, but it is so wide</li>
      <li>The rubber pad that touches your lashes is too hard to be effective.</li>
      <li>I am amazed that so many people say this curler didn&#x27;t work on their eyelashes, I am wondering if they didn&#x27;t hold it long enough because it makes my eyelashes curl a ton!</li>
      <li>It has two rubber bottoms, so when one is used up, you have another new one.  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased this item over my normal go-to from revlon.  </li>
      <li>When that was toast I saw this and thought a new design might last longer.  </li>
      <li>I needed a new one in a pinch because I was away and left mine home.</li>
      <li>$17 very well spent.</li>

<li> I do have to be careful to get down to the base of my lashes and get the end eyelashes in but don&#x27;t you have to do this in every curler?</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this product and definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
<li> I can reach maybe 1/4 of my lashes at the base, and that not without some discomfort.</li>
<li> This is the worst curler ever.</li>

    <li> Works well! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My favorite lash curler. Doesn&#x27;t tear out lashes like every other one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I really loved this eyelash curler! It makes my eyelashes very curled they look natural! Thanks for the great product!</li>
    <li> My daughter was happy with this and it works perfect for her</li>
    <li> This is the best eye lash curler that I ever bought.  It has two rubber bottoms, so when one is used up, you have another new one.  No pinching of the eyelid either.  This is a great Revlon Eyelash curler!!!</li>
    <li> Did not curl for me at all. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> This is the worst curler ever. Does not curl your lashes and the red rubber part WILL NOT STAY IN. I am very disapponted.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> bought this for my sister from her wishlist, she loved it</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes at all.  The rubber strip keeps coming off of it too.  I&#x27;m really disappointed in this purchase.  I had heard so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> I have these and my teenage daughter is always taking them. Decided to get her one as a stocking stuffer. Arrived in great time. Great price. Works great. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Really good works fantastic :)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item over my normal go-to from revlon.  I was hoping it was what it said, \\&quot;Extra Curl\\&quot; and all.  But sadly, no.  There is no spring on this one, which I have only known eyelash curlers to have.  The spring is what helps you gain that curl. So sure, if you work at it you may get those curled lashes. But I don&#x27;t have time to \\&quot;work it.\\&quot; I will not be buying these till they input a spring.</li>
    <li> I used to use an old-time Maybelline curler from the 60&#x27;s and loved it to pieces. This weekend my makeup bag got lost and I was desperate to find an new curler. Purchased this curler at Target tonight - I was hoping that the \\&quot;extra curl\\&quot; would help me and my long-but-straight lashes. I tried it out and I didn&#x27;t get what I was looking for...at all. The angle of the \\&quot;stabilizing bar\\&quot; pushes into my face and doesn&#x27;t even reach the base of my eyelashes on the outsides (the place I need it to curl most). Perhaps people with smaller eyes or eyelash spans would be okay with this one, but if you REALLY want a good curl throughout your lashes, I recommend you steer clear.</li>
    <li> I am amazed that so many people say this curler didn&#x27;t work on their eyelashes, I am wondering if they didn&#x27;t hold it long enough because it makes my eyelashes curl a ton!

There may be easier ones to use but for the price, it&#x27;s awesome and it works well if you use it correctly.</li>
    <li> Hands down. I have been curling my eyelashes for over 30 years. I needed a new one in a pinch because I was away and left mine home. I grabbed this one from a pharmacy and tried to use it. What a waste of $8 something dollars. It does not work AT ALL. The red pads that cushion your fingers come off really easily. The rubber pad that touches your lashes is too hard to be effective. This item is total garbage. Want the best eyelash curler? Go to Sephora and buy their brand. $17 very well spent. Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> When the curler reaches your lashes it curls just fine, but it is so wide I can&#x27;t even fit it in my eye socket. I can reach maybe 1/4 of my lashes at the base, and that not without some discomfort. I have smaller than average eyes, but this is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> The curler does not curl my lashes very well, this product did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple months and it has already broken. The top piece (where the red pad pushes up against) popped off. I can push it back on but as soon as I try to curl my lashes and even the slightest bit of pressure is applied to the top piece, it pops off. I am very disappointed in this product and definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
    <li> Does not work! Tried heating it up and everything. There is no indent in the pad, and it is fairly hard, so I don&#x27;t know how they expect it to curl your lashes. Threw it away within 2 minutes of opening.</li>
    <li> I always use an eyelash curler.  Last one was \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; and not any better than the standard.  When that was toast I saw this and thought a new design might last longer.  I doesn&#x27;t matter how long it lasts, because it does not curl lashes at all!&lt;br /&gt;Complete waste of money!</li>
