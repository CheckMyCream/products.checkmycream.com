      <li>I am very happy.</li>
      <li>THE BEST HAIR DRYER EVER&lt;</li>
      <li>Best wishes.</li>
      <li>I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don&#x27;t have lots of hair...</li>
      <li>Best hair blower I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>I was really impressed with this blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>I bought this hair dryer from Target 4 months ago because it had the best reviews of all the ones they had there on the shelf.  </li>

      <li>I get a nice blow out and no frizzles!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and dries perfectly without drying the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a good hair dryer but not The Greatness, I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I had purchased this dryer before and absolutely loved it until it died.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer often, but when I do, I want a good one.  </li>
      <li>would make the Bride of Frankenstein&#x27;s do look good.</li>

      <li>Over all, I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase</li>
      <li>I decided on this one and am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>But I love the see-through area to the fan!</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing dryer!</li>

      <li>I love this blow dryer!</li>

      <li>This blow dryer is amazing.</li>
      <li>I also liked the turbo button that clicked into place</li>
      <li>and I really liked the way this one felt.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!  </li>
      <li>I use it with the nice difusser that comes with it</li>
      <li>Effective, for Brand name is affordable.</li>
      <li>It works fine and the design is very nice to look at</li>
      <li>The user friendly design is  great too.  </li>
      <li>an other plus is: it&#x27;s beautiful, really really beautiful!!</li>
      <li>I am very happy so far with my purchase</li>
      <li>If you already own a hair dryer, then you&#x27;re probably okay.  </li>
      <li>This is a great buy and worth every cent of the money.</li>
      <li>This one, too, delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>BUT for a good stay at home dryer that works like a charm, has easy to use settings I love it</li>
      <li>super powerful, diffuser is awesome, works wonders on my dreadlocks</li>
      <li>With that kind of air power it would be awesome if it could be focused into a smaller area.  </li>
      <li>On the bright side, I get a nice work out with my right arm using it...</li>
      <li>:)   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many blow dryers.</li>
      <li>so I could make sure my dog remembers that I am alpha female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In fact, I prefer it because it gives me more volume and doesn&#x27;t leave heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So glad I purchased this.</li>
      <li>Love the air flow</li>
      <li>It straightened my hair so well and drys the hair fast without causing tons of fly away</li>
      <li>I would have preferred something more compact.</li>
      <li>fancy ceramic is really better than ceramic.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with it and its magical defuser attachment.</li>
      <li>If you are searching for a blow dryer that dries your hair fast, this product is a great choice.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to hold, and works well at every setting!</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I have used this dryer not only on my hair, for which it is the best, but to loosen up pvc discharge hoses to put be able to install the attachments on the ends.  </li>
      <li>And she love it</li>
      <li>also enjoyed this: http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Infusions-Wahl-Pro-Dryer/dp/B001E6G6FC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top , and I use it as my alternative hair dryer when I can&#x27;t access my Sharper Image dryer.</li>
      <li>im sure hell have this another 6...</li>
      <li>favorite is this: http://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Ionic-Conditioning-SI745/dp/B00007M1U2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_pb_t , the Sharper Image ionic hair dryer.</li>
      <li>my daughter really love this dryer she loves the way she is able to control the settings on the blow dryer</li>
      <li>Features:  3 Heat settings  2 Air Speed settings  </li>
      <li>Most dryers are pretty good, but the \\&quot;Turbo Setting\\&quot; does increase it.</li>
      <li>I have had this hair dryer every day for a long time and it is the best.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is pretty good for the price.  </li>
      <li>Powerful and quick to dry my hair - perfect for a great blow-out.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product and hope it will work for a long time!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this hairdryer because it was cheaper but still had great reviews. I would agree with some of the reviews in that there is not a very good medium heat, its either too hot or cool, but I still think it works great. I love it!</li>
    <li> Does the job as I have thick hair and the one I had got so it did not heat well and it took me forever to dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing dryer! Three heat settings, two speed settings, &amp; a turbo speed - wow! My hair gets dried fast! It&#x27;s not a heavy dryer to hold either which means that it&#x27;s easier to maneuver into whatever weird position you need it and with the Concentrator and Diffuser I get a nice blow out and no frizzles! One of my fav things too is that it has a filter that you can take out and clean once in a while just in case you are in a habit of spraying product while you blow like I am then you don&#x27;t have to worry about gunking up the filter. Great dryer - I&#x27;ll never use a hotel dryer again cause this one is traveling with me!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this blow dryer.  I have very long thick hair and it has always taken me at least ten minutes to dry it.  This got it dry in 5 minutes.  There is a lot of power to it, and I like the fact that it does not get so hot that you can get it close to your scalp.  I also love the attatchments!  This is a great buy and worth every cent of the money. It is a very pretty color too.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and I&#x27;m always in a hurry so when I saw this has twin fans, I bought it.  It really does the drying fast!  It&#x27;s not too loud &amp; the sound doesn&#x27;t bother me like some dryers do.  It is a bit heavy but other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> One of the things that impressed me was the power of this hairdryer.  I&#x27;ve used them for years but this one with three speeds and a turbo button gets my hair dried a lot faster than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  The only caveat is that you have to make sure you use a cream rinse because if not you&#x27;ll have a head full of knots.  I found the Remington D3710 to be easy to manage and maneuver and I didn&#x27;t find my hand getting tired when I held it up for a period of time.  All in all an excellent product.

    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  The amazing thing is that it does it with less heat.  It will dry your hair as fast as the Remington D-2012 (my previous champion hair dryer), but it doesn&#x27;t have to get nearly as hot.  This is great when you dry your kids hair, or maybe a pet after they take a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortcomings are that the power cord is 12\\&quot; less than the D-2012.  We could use the extra reach.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bulkier, so it barely fits in our drawer.  On the plus side, it is quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really excellent hair dryer, you can&#x27;t go wrong here...</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and curly but I&#x27;ve learned that with some good 100% argan oil and a big HUGE round brush or paddle brush, I can get my hair dry in about 15-20 min IF I have a good dryer. This fits the bill and it gives you a workout to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never cared if my dryers are \\&quot;quiet,\\&quot; because how quiet can a blow dryer really be? The weight is a factor but if I can finish in 15-20 min, I will put up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington products last, too, in my experience and often outlast much pricier items. With this dryer, I was able to dry my shoulder length super curly hair in 17 min. Not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, is it better than other 1875 Watt dryers? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really any different...but it does work pretty well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a home appliance that actually works as advertised. This Remington dryer does that and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very well made. It&#x27;s easy to operate. And it dries hair very fast. We&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months and it&#x27;s held up quite well with almost daily use from someone in the household. Good value for the price, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many blow dryers. My biggest problem is that my hair takes so long to dry. I was skeptical to try this product, but I figured it was worth the chance if it could shave time off my hair drying. And to my surprise, it works! The fast finish dried my hair quick, much quicker than any blow dryer I&#x27;ve used before.    It has three heat settings, plus two speed settings &amp; a turbo option. You can use the highest heat to dry your hair FAST or use the lower heat + the diffuser to get close and dry curls like mine (it comes with both a concentrator and a diffuser). I have thick, curly hair, so if it works for me, it&#x27;ll work for anyone!  This blow dryer was much cheaper than the other products I&#x27;ve tried, but I was impressed by the overall quality and that it lives up to its claim. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> When I saw that this was a fast finish, dual fan hair dryer, I had hoped that it meant I could blow dry my hair quickly before my arms got too sore as I have not been able to blow dry my hair for 10 years due to arthritis. Well my arthritis has gotten further ahead of me than I had thought. For me, I couldn&#x27;t hold the dryer over my head for more than about 2 seconds due to it&#x27;s weight, nor could I remove the round disperser from the dryer. This is obviously not a problem of the dryer, but my poor health. I run into problems like this all the time with things being too heavy or too tight to undo. However when my daughter-in-law visited at Christmas, she had no trouble using this hair dryer so I would have to call it a success.</li>
    <li> I have only used this hair dryer one time but it was enough to know that I like it. It did in fact dry my hair faster than my old Revlon. I have long thick wavy hair and I could tell within a minute that it wasn&#x27;t going to take long to get it dry.  I actually bought this at Target because my other dryer had stopped working and I couldn&#x27;t wait a few days for a new one to be shipped to me. I went with the intention on getting a different one but I got to hold them both in my hand and I really liked the way this one felt. The handle is sort of slanted back, which sounds awkward but it feels more balanced this way. It also doesn&#x27;t have that annoying high pitched whining sound that accompanies most dryers. I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don&#x27;t have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn&#x27;t difficult to slide. The tension is just right in that you&#x27;re not going to accidentally switch it off constantly during use, nor will you have a hard time getting it to move.  I am very happy so far with my purchase but if anything out of the ordinary happens, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
    <li> Baby, it&#x27;s super fast (yes it is!).  I used to use the blow driers with the brush attachments, because otherwise my hair would frizz up. Well, they stopped making them so I stopped blowing my hair dry. For years.  Last week I used the Remington D3710 Fast Finish Turbo Hair Dryer because I had a party to go to and I fell in love with it and its magical defuser attachment. Not only does my hair dry before ten minutes pass, it comes out straight as a poker when I use the defuser. It&#x27;s not too heavy and it&#x27;s even snazzy looking. Just seeing it cheers me up.  Prince might prefer purple, but I love my little red corvette blow dryer...</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for a xmas present and in amazon everybody said something good about this hair dryer, that was enought for my to buy it. And she love it but she said takes time to dryer the hair, so i thought \\&quot;double fan\\&quot; must to be enought but not!, is kind of weird because is a \\&quot;remington\\&quot; one of the best!, but is fine! so what do you think?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hairdryer (and I have three, including an ionic one; this one is the best). It is light, which is a very important feature, because it allows easy manipulation and does not tire the hands during longer styling. It has several options of blowing power and heat. Very ergonomic shape. I can blow-dry my hair (chin-length inverted bob) in 3-5 minutes in the morning with a consistent result. I am very happy with this product and hope it will work for a long time!</li>
    <li> Had my wife try the Remington D3710 since she has waist-long thick straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying Time:  Excellent, it took about 8 minutes to dry her long hair using Turbo power on highest settings.  Her previous Conair took about 12 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Heat:  The Remington&#x27;s air temperature on the highest setting was cooler than her Conair but it still dried faster&lt;br /&gt;Size:  Was bulkier than the Conair but was not cumbersome to use&lt;br /&gt;Weight:  Even though it looked bigger that the Conair, it was actually the same weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a fast and efficient machine that does the job.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made and nice-looking hair dryer. It works fine but the one problem I find is that the air that come out is not hot enough - it is only warm. This is surprising because this is not a problem for most other hair dryers. If you have got short hair (like me), this product will work well for you but if your hair is long then you better look for another hair dryer.</li>
    <li> WHEW! This thing BLOWS and I mean that in the most positive way possible. A serious time saving device. The fan is strong enough that it makes you feel that you should be holding it with both hands. Despite the power it isn&#x27;t much if any larger than a regular, less powerful blow dryer. The controls are easy to use &amp; it does feel comfortable in your hand. Even though I haven&#x27;t had it very long, I feel that it is solidly built &amp; that it will last for a long time. If you want to spend less time drying your hair &amp; more time doing other things I strongly recommend that you get one of these! It also works great if you have to shrink wrap anything.</li>
    <li> For years, literally, I&#x27;d been searching for a powerful hair dryer, one that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. This is it. My hair is thin and wimpy, but still takes several minutes to dry. The longer it takes to dry, the frizzier it gets. (I&#x27;m not a pro when it comes to drying my hair. Far from it.) Even if the humidity is high, with this dryer my hair dries fast, frizz-free and straight.     It is heavy for my arthritic hands and arms, so I use a hair dryer stand, similar to [...], that I purchased many years ago at a drug store in their \\&quot;Made for TV\\&quot; section. I haven&#x27;t timed it, but it seems to take less than five minutes to completely dry my hair.     The cord is approximately six feet long, long enough for my use since I don&#x27;t walk around while drying my hair. The temperature and air control on the handle are slide levers. With arthritis, particularly bad in my thumbs, I find it somewhat difficult to adjust them, thus the four-star rating.     Color-wise, I&#x27;d describe it as a rich salmon. I don&#x27;t see a purpose to the clear encasement over the dual fans, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me one way or the other.     Over all, I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase and I do recommend it for people who don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time under the dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different hair dryers, and I&#x27;ve always focused on those that dry quickly and delivers much air flow so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel burned. If it&#x27;s quiet, it&#x27;s a big bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is this: http://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Ionic-Conditioning-SI745/dp/B00007M1U2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_pb_t , the Sharper Image ionic hair dryer. I like the travel version because it&#x27;s light weight, yet delivers just as much power and air. Too bad this is no longer in production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoyed this: http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Infusions-Wahl-Pro-Dryer/dp/B001E6G6FC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top , and I use it as my alternative hair dryer when I can&#x27;t access my Sharper Image dryer. This one, too, delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to our product at hand... it&#x27;s heavy compares to the two I had just mentioned. It&#x27;s not any more quiet. I don&#x27;t generally use the air diffuser on my Wahl, but I do use it on my Sharper Image. I tried using the diffuser with this Remington, but whether I use it or not, my hair gets very tangled afterward, which isn&#x27;t a problem with neither of the two I had mentioned. It also does not dry quickly as the title implies, nor does it make my hair feel anymore healthy than before I use it. In fact, rather than taking \\&quot;half\\&quot; the time to dry my hair, I think it doubles the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is past the middle of my back, so it&#x27;s a bit long. Maybe this is a great dryer for shorter hair? I don&#x27;t know. I can&#x27;t recommend this to others. On the bright side, I get a nice work out with my right arm using it... haha...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars, because it works.</li>
    <li> I received this product hoping to cut my drying time, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I&#x27;m not sure if the product I received is defective but I have thin hair and it didn&#x27;t help my dry time. It also makes my hair lay really flat and somewhate oily, making my hair look dirty and thin. I&#x27;m not a fan of this dryer but it may be better for people with thick hair.</li>
    <li> If you are searching for a blow dryer that dries your hair fast, this product is a great choice. It has over 1800 watts of drying power, and the two fans work very efficiently to get hair dried quickly. Once the hair is dry, I prefer to use a lower setting when styling, to keep maximum control over that process. This is a great blow dryer to use during the winter, when going out with wet or even damp hair is especially undesirable!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Remington D3710 Ceramic Fast Finish Dual Fan Turbo Hair Dryer, 1875 Watts\\&quot;: Remington hairdryer is a fast easy way to dry semi-straight hair quickly. I particularly liked the variable speeds and a fast heat up and cool down fan. I received the red hairdryer, however it was more of a fuchsia color. This hairdryer is very heavy and makes it difficult to dry your hair on top if it is short. I liked the way it dried my hair in the heavy areas. It came with a diffuser so you could run your fingers or a brush through your hair as the dryer blew the air through several holes in about a 4 to 5 inch circumference. There was also a concentrated adapter. This adapter was about 1 inch in diameter. It is designed to let the airflow in one certain area.   I would have preferred a lightweight model hairdryer instead of the extra adapters. The ceramic plates is where the extra weight is at and this is also the part that makes the hairdryer work faster. The price is comparable to other units and could be used as gifts for a teenager.   My next hairdryer will be more compact and lighter weight. This is the biggest issue I have for this model. I hope that this has been a helpful review.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great and it is cool seeing the fans through the clear plastic but it is bigger and heavier than other hair dryers I have used; it&#x27;s not outrageously bulky but it different. The attachments are nice and the power cord is sufficiently long that you aren&#x27;t bound to your outlet. Overall a very good, almost professional quality, hair dryer.</li>
    <li> If you already own a hair dryer, then you&#x27;re probably okay.  Unless it&#x27;s an older model on the fritz.  But if you are in the market for a new dryer, then this might be the dryer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted you aren&#x27;t going to be using the 200% power all the time (I exaggerate...I&#x27;m funny...), but when you need it, it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there for a quick dry.  But quick drying tends to make big bushy hair, so be careful.  Most of the time I have it on the lower or standard setting.  It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, well balanced, and a pretty color!  I use it mainly for drying my dog&#x27;s hair (since I have none!), but my gal uses it regularly and really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again buy if you need a new hair dryer, otherwise you&#x27;re probably okay.  It&#x27;s like trading in your car.  The Camry is running fine, so do you need the Lexus?  If the Camry is going kaput then yeah.  So the same with the hair dryer.  See? Informative and funny!  You can chuckle now.  Really.  Go ahead.</li>
    <li> I look for two main things with a hair dryer: the fan output and the ease of use with settings. This hair dryer worked great on both accounts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The turbo fan was excellent. It definitely dries your hair faster. I have fairly thick hair and it usually takes me several minutes to get my hair from wet (from the shower) to dry. The Remington D3710 cut my drying time in half. I also liked the turbo button that clicked into place so you don&#x27;t have to hold it down the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The settings are easy to figure: 3 heat and 2 speed settings with turbo. The dryer does not run hot at all. I usually like a hotter drying hair dryer because it seems to set my style easier. However, with the turbo speed, I didn&#x27;t have any problems. In fact, I prefer it because it gives me more volume and doesn&#x27;t leave heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the dryer is quite heavy and a little bulky (to accommodate the bigger fan). Since it takes less time, I don&#x27;t mind it but if you have issues with arthritis this may be a real problem.</li>
    <li> As the name implies, this hair dryer is faster than average. It has ionic tourmaline ceramic to enhance drying speed. It is not red but a deep, darker pink...like cherry Pepto Bismol :)... It is just a little heavier than average so if you have long, thick hair you may have to arrange some kind of stand for the dryer for part of your drying time to avoid wrist fatigue.  The 1875 watts may be a problem in older dwellings which haven&#x27;t been updated for modern electric needs... but not for the majority. We found it to be an excellent product. Best wishes. :)   2 year limited warranty    Features:  3 Heat settings  2 Air Speed settings  Turbo button  Cool air button  Diffuser attachment  Concentrator attachment  Removable Filter</li>
    <li> A review from my mother-in-law:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My hair is thinning and this dryer gives me volume!  With my head upside down while blow drying, in just a couple of minutes, I have full, shiny and manageable hair!  The user friendly design is  great too.  The heat and speed settings are at a comfortable spot on the handle and unlike my last dryer, they stay where I set them!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good purchase</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this item as 5 minutes in to using the drier it broke, it was great at first and worked really well but then it fizzled out and died and no longer works.</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer not only on my hair, for which it is the best, but to loosen up pvc discharge hoses to put be able to install the attachments on the ends.  It does everything well.  So happy to have it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Remington&#x27;s [[ASIN:B003V264WW T-Studio blow dryer]] and was excited to see another model by Remington. Both dryers surpass any other brand I&#x27;ve used, so my comparisons will be to each other.  During my first few uses, this FastFinish model seemed second-string to the T-Studio. It&#x27;s the standard professional shape (not collapsible); the standard 1875 watts; with airflow options of low and high (plus a turbo button to rev it a bit more, and a concentrator and diffuser to customize the flow); and heat options of cool, lukewarm, and very warm (plus a button for a burst of cold). But the case is cheap-looking plastic, it&#x27;s slightly larger (though lighter weight) than the T-Studio, it has a slightly higher whining sound, the airflow slider-switch is a little clumsy to use, and the air itself is never actually hot-hot.  So imagine my surprise when I found myself reaching for *this* model every morning. I&#x27;ve finally decided it&#x27;s because the airflow is a bit \\&quot;fuller\\&quot; (if not quite as high-velocity) than the T-Studio&#x27;s, and the \\&quot;very warm\\&quot; setting is plenty hot -- in fact I&#x27;m glad to not suffer the occasional \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; that comes with getting hot air too close to an ear or scalp; this would be very important if the dryer were being used by children or on children.  I do think the T-Studio is a slightly higher quality, better-looking dryer, but this FastFinish is now my favorite. 4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this hair dryer in May, 2013.  After about 9 mos. of use, I noticed that the fan speed suddenly dropped to its slowest speed eventhough the setting was for the highest.  Then, I saw tiny little sparks inside the hair dryer at which point I immediately turned it off!  I&#x27;ve never liked the hair dryer, in part because it&#x27;s positioned in such an awkward upward angle, causing me to twist my wrist to force the angle down.</li>
    <li> This is a hair dryer with lots of heat and power, to get you ready and on your way fast! It is comfortable to hold, and works well at every setting! Love the fiery red color too, it gives a bit of energy to the morning!</li>
    <li> Over a year later and still like new. Best hair blower I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Still going strong. Have had this hair dryer for a couple of years now. Great product and lower price than at retail!</li>
    <li> Want to dry your hair super fast? If so..... This is the hair dryer for you! I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it dried my hair!</li>
    <li> Great Hairdryer with Twin Fans. Does make a scary screeching sound if the power drops. The Hair Dryer is not red, it is pink. also it does NOT have Ionic drying which is a good thing in my case.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with it for the first 5 months, but was shocked this morning when it made a loud bang and tripped the circuit breaker.  I have never had a hair dryer break in this short amount of time.  Buyer beware.  I can&#x27;t return it, but I&#x27;ll write Remington and let them know what I think of their product.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I got dreadlocks so I could easily dry my hair after washing. The high-powered motor is great for drying dreads, and I don&#x27;t notice the weight. The color is a little odd, but I like it, and color wasn&#x27;t a selling point. Getting my dreads dry so that they don&#x27;t mildew WAS a selling point, and this thing does an awesome job.</li>
    <li> This dryer is wonderful, the power you have is second to none .., a little heavy but worth it for the results it leaves. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I try not to use too much heat on my hair, so I really liked the fact that this dryer was fast and efficient in drying. It was easy to use, although the long nozzel did get in the way a few times, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about intense heat damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> For daughter also, she have the very thick straight black hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the ratings and comments before buying for durability and powerfulness.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied so far and recommended.</li>
    <li> Great dryer, gets the job done.  It is a bit heavy but manageable.  I&#x27;ve had it for quite awhile now...can&#x27;t remember how long...and no diminishment in power or performance.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does the job, dries my long, fine-medium hair in under ten minutes&lt;br /&gt;Three different heat settings, not included the extra heat button or cold blast button&lt;br /&gt;Pretty color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Heavy&lt;br /&gt;Short cord&lt;br /&gt;Diffuser is of average effectiveness, at best</li>
    <li> Looked for a powerful blow dryer with adequate heat. This was it. Reasonable price, powerful motor, and heat is really good as well.</li>
    <li> Very very good quality</li>
    <li> Was advertised as red and came as salmon pink. Lasted roughly 2 years before the heating element went out. Also, fairly weak fan.</li>
    <li> After received, I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;Very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the wind. Soon blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t have to buy and try other brands of products in the United States.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer to replace one that had gone out on me...The dryer that was sent to me must be a new version of the same product...It is now a black/purple dryer versus the red one pictured.  Although I got a little excited when I opened the box (black and purple are my favorite colors,) once I turned on the dryer, I felt the difference.  It doesn&#x27;t have as much power as my old dryer.  The &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; on the old one felt like I was in a wind storm, which is exactly what it takes to dry my long hair.  On the new version, there is hardly any &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; on the regular setting, and the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; setting only increases it a little.  My quest for a fast dry time blow dryer continues....</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!  If you have thick hair like mine then it will blow you away at how fast this dryer dries hair.  It takes half the time to dry hair as it states.  It has 2 fans, and you can take the cap off the filter to clean the hair, etc. out of it to keep it working smoothly.  Love the Red color!  It has a turbo boost if needed which I didn&#x27;t.  It has a choice of settings to meet each person&#x27;s like of heat and power. It has all the power a person needs to get the job done! It&#x27;s a little heavy to hold but in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t make your arms tired because your done before that happens.</li>
    <li> I HAVE SPIKED HAIR. THIS HAIR DRYER IS PERFECT TO DRY IT FAST AND GIVE IT THE SPIKEY LOOK I WANT. !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer often, but when I do, I want a good one.  This fits the bill.  It&#x27;s not overly complicated, but it works very well. The setting are basic, but that suits me fine. Powerful and quick to dry my hair - perfect for a great blow-out.</li>
    <li> Switch buttons are not easy to change. Hot air is not as strong as I expected.</li>
    <li> This Remington dryer is just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s got all of the features....ceramic, tourmaline and ionic.  Plus the two fan feature is a bonus. The fact that it&#x27;s red, I&#x27;m in love. Most importantly it&#x27;s very gently on my curly hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and dries perfectly without drying the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to give it a \\&quot;room for improvement\\&quot; rating, i&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a little larger than the average dryer. The thing is it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The fact that it&#x27;s a little bigger to me just means it&#x27;s sturdier. I have nothing bad to really say about this one. It&#x27;s a bargain really.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer.  Since I have relatively short hair, I use this product primarily for my daughter (6 years old).  She like many other children is picky about who dries her hair, and how her hair is dried.  She is blessed with hair that when blow-dried looks beautiful, but unfortunately the process requires working through the many knots she routinely achieves in her hair.  I&#x27;ve found that this hair dryer dries her hair faster than hair dryers that I have used previously.  Its a great hair dryer, its dual action fans give out more air, thus drying hair faster than ever before.  This has been a great addition to my routine because it helps accomplish the task a lot quicker than with other hair dryers.  The hair dryer has several settings, and when on the high setting I can dry hair in less than 5 minutes, which is fantastic for me.  I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for me, it is very fast, so I don&#x27;t have to keep my hair under the heat for too long, which is good since my hair is very thin and I don&#x27;t want to hurt it.. it is a bit heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and it makes up for it with its speed.. an other plus is: it&#x27;s beautiful, really really beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I have this same hair dryer in the 220V version. That version is fantastic. This 110V lacks the power and heat capability of its overseas version. Huge disappointment. Returning as soon as I can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my share of hair dryers in my life time, so I confess I was relieved when my old one died. I knew exactly what I wanted: 1. Ionic technology because it helps reduce my frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;2. At least 3 heat settings. Tired of warm and TOO HOT.&lt;br /&gt;3. Power. My hair is thick and it takes some air velocity to dry it. Most dryers are pretty good, but the \\&quot;Turbo Setting\\&quot; does increase it. It&#x27;s not wind tunnel awesome, but it&#x27;s helpful.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer met those requirements. As noted by several other reviewers, it is a bit larger and heavier than most other hand held hair dryers. If that is not an issue for you, I think you will like it.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend the purchase of this product. It does dry your hair,however, the attachment does not lock in place and makes it very frustrating and awkward to use.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful blow dryer. My daugher is an expert hair styler and loves the power. The color is beautiful also.</li>
    <li> Bought this in July 2012, broke after 9 months worth of use. Not sure what the reason was, and I didn&#x27;t bother to take it to the repair shop so it&#x27;s going to the recycle bin. There were sparks of fire in the wire inside the hair dryer and I did not know what to make of it. Decided to give it up</li>
    <li> This thing really pack a punch. Perhaps they have to make the outlet diameter larger than others so the wind pressure isn&#x27;t too great on the head and hair. This thing isn&#x27;t slim but not too big nor too heavy. My just turn teen daughter like it and find it not too big or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From out many broken hair dryers ceramic is certainly heat more even than non-ceramic ones. But since we mainly use it to dry rather than style, I&#x27;m not sure fancy ceramic is really better than ceramic. There is only one rocker button for cool / turbo. The other buttons are large slide buttons so you can&#x27;t accidentally change the settings. The finish is quality hard glossy plastic. I will not buy non-slip rubbery finishes again as they degenerate in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good for a couple of months. But I think they realized that they made a big mistake by not marketing it only to salons, with a price to match. I would love to have another one to replace my daughter&#x27;s broken one but now it sells for 10 times the price I paid.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is amazing. It has my fine,  thick, middle of my back hair done in less than 3 minutes. The only thing i dont like it the heat. It doesnt get to hot, but than again i guess it doesnt really matter how hot it gets, my hair is still dry. I like the defusser that came with it. I can wear my hair straight, or curly.</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dryer. My old one broke and I got this new one I had no idea! It straightened my hair so well and drys the hair fast without causing tons of fly away</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer just over two years ago.  Love the air flow (so many hair dryers barely have any blowing power) and served us well... until last week.  The switch to slide it on/off broke off.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s not fixable as the point of contact between the switch you use to slide it on and off and the underside is so small there&#x27;s no way to glue it back on -- and no way to use your nail or something else to slide it on and off.  I don&#x27;t believe two years is a very good life for a hair dryer, so that&#x27;s why the so-so review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Air Power -- the dual fan really puts out the air, which allows you to dry your hair faster with less burning heat -- plus the extra turbo option is great (I wish the on/off switch was the same as the turbo/cool button -- much better more durable design.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I have very long, fine hair, which easily gets sucked up into the intake portion of hair dryers.  The way this hair dryer is designed minimizes that problem -- in fact it rarely occurred with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It&#x27;s attractive -- if that matters to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The mouth of the dryer is large -- this really isn&#x27;t a plus for me, so it will also be listed under the minus, but for some this might be what they&#x27;re looking for -- you really can&#x27;t tell from the picture, but it does have a wide opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheap on/off switch that broke off with no way of fixing after two years (which to me is not very long given my 40+ years of experience with hair dryers).&lt;br /&gt;2. Very heavy -- if you have carpel tunnel or any shoulder issues, your arm will tire very quickly holding this dryer -- including if you dry your hair upside down.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cord is way too short.  I share a two-sink vanity with my husband and the outlet is on his side.  The cord does not reach to my side.  Probably the shortest cord I&#x27;ve had on a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;4. The mouth of the dryer is too large for my preference.  With that kind of air power it would be awesome if it could be focused into a smaller area.  With attachments you don&#x27;t always get the full power and there isn&#x27;t an option of a round &amp;#34;concentrator&amp;#34; attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I believe this specific model is no longer available, there are similar products out there.  I would still recommend this product (or similar), but buyers should be aware of the switch issue since it is made cheaply, which from what I can see, still exists on the newer models (perhaps it&#x27;s attached by a larger piece underneath in the newer models??).</li>
    <li> Hey All,&lt;br /&gt;I am not so blessed with fine, thin hair that unless its pinned up and perfectly coifed its a frizzy, fly away mess.  This hair dryer changed that! With its settings and cool air, I can dry it and leave it. No more constant pinned up hair. I can let my locks down! SO yes. I highly recommend it. Its not perfect, Its a little bulky and takes some getting used too (you might have to change how you dry your hair) And I don&#x27;t recommend traveling with it. BUT for a good stay at home dryer that works like a charm, has easy to use settings I love it -So much that I sent one to my sister :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to get a &amp;#34;TURBO&amp;#34; Dryer. When I used it for the first time, I was disappointed with the pressure of air flow. I thought it would be more powerful. It is a good hair dryer but not The Greatness, I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I rarely blow dry my hair, but I might more often with this hair dryer.  It was fast, easy, and quiet.  One thing that I don&#x27;t like with hair dryers is when you burn your ears trying to get your hair dry.  A lot of dryers have a button you push to cool, but this one goes the extra mile to help you find the right temperature for your hair drying needs by providing so many heat/speed settings.  I thought the dual fans would make it deafeningly loud, but that was not the case.  It&#x27;s actually quieter than my last hair dryer.  It comes with a diffuser and concentrator, giving you a few more tools for styling your hair. I did feel that it dried my hair quicker than my previous hair dryer, without scorching my hair.  As for the weight, it does feel a little heavy to hold for a non-adult; however, I use this dryer more than my daughter and don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s too heavy for me. It&#x27;s hard for her to style and blow at the same time, so I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it for someone who is younger.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is pretty good for the price.  It has alot of options as far as speed and heat, plus has the turbo option and a cool shot.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair faster unless I use the turbo option, even then it&#x27;s not a big difference.  I still like the hair dryer though, it&#x27;s easy to handle and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I must admit that, although I like this dryer, I don&#x27;t see a big difference between it and the other Turbo driers I have used.  The weight is slightly heavier than my old one, but then again my arms can use the workout.  The Turbo setting is a little too strong when trying to style my hair, but it is great when I just want to dry it quickly.  This is a good dryer that is not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Satisfactory performance!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be stronger. I even leave turbo option on all of the time, but my older, cheaper hairdryer definitely dried quicker. I do like the attachments though (diffuser, concentrator). It is heavier like I have read before buying, and the cord must be shorter because it gets pulled out of the wall by accicent at least once with every use. Unfortunately, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Wife she absolutely loves this hair dryer. My wife has longer hair and this helps her hair dry faster and I noticed her hair feels softer.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this blowdrying.  She has used several and this is her favorite.  We both recommend this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> THE BEST HAIR DRYER EVER&lt;br /&gt;Takes 3 minutes to dry my hair, Med Length . Unbelievable!! This comes in coral color.-not red, as it looks, who cares!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, you will be amazed!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Better than my first review--unbelievable hair dryer!! After three weeks,wants me to wash my hair, just to see how long it will take to dry!!!!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is pretty but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry my medium length hair.  Keeping it but wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> dries fast, quiet, sleek. bought for my dad for christmas to replace an old remington he had that also had the dual motor. works very quickly and it very nice looking. lasts a long time too. my dad had his old remington for 6 years! lol it was time for an upgrade. im sure hell have this another 6... ha</li>
    <li> Best dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. You don&#x27;t really even need to use the turbo feature it&#x27;s so powerful. I&#x27;ve tried 2 other new ones lately, both by the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brand, and this one is, by far, superior.</li>
    <li> I choose the dryer after reading about it in a fashion magazine. I was disappointed as it was not as hot and powerful as I had expected and the large size makes it rather unwieldly. I would have preferred something more compact. It definitley did not live up to its hype.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this dryer before and absolutely loved it until it died. I have been very disappointed with the one I received and would have sent it back if I had not thrown out all the packaging. The attachment it comes with- which directs the air and was one of the main reasons I liked it- will not stay on. :(</li>
    <li> Even though it was marked as Amazon Prime, it took a week to arrive. Despite confirmation emails that stated I would receive in 2 days. Hair dryer does not have a lot of heat, however, the dual fan makes up for that. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t have a retractable cord. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Drys hair quick! A little bulky but worth it.  The other reviews were worth reading for this item. Thank you</li>
    <li> To be fair, I cannot actually review the dryer itself. I received the dryer with the diffuser attachment missing, which renders it pretty much useless for me. I also received a black &amp; purple dryer, which is not a big deal, but receiving an item that does not include attachments included in the description &amp; a different color when it was not stated that colors may vary, makes me wonder whats happening in quality control. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> I probably bought and returned five other hair dryers before keeping this one. My kids and I all have LOTS of hair that takes forever to dry. This hair dryer is the best; it dries our hair much faster than our old one did. No worrying about accidentally turning it off or changing the setting, you don&#x27;t have to hold the button for the cold shot, and if the regular setting isn&#x27;t quick enough for you, there&#x27;s even a turbo setting. This saves us so much time in the mornings! I&#x27;m thinking about buying a second one to have in the other bathroom so two of us can dry our hair at once. It did seem a bit big at first, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to it. Other dryers had too much air flow and I couldn&#x27;t control how I was styling my hair, or the high heat setting was too hot, but the settings on this one are just right.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer as a gift. The recipient did not like how bulky and heavy it was so I ended up returning it. I also tried the hair dryer prior to returning it. I feel that it did not have the necessary amount of actual heat I need to dry my hair in a timely fashion. I was attempting to do a blow-out as I normally do and this really did not help straighten out any waves/curls.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer every day for a long time and it is the best. I use it with the nice difusser that comes with it and my hair has beautiful curls.  I would highly recommend it for people that want to have pretty soft curls when using a difusser. I do not use it for anything else. I have had people borrow it to dry straight hair and they say it is great.</li>
    <li> I recently had to purchase a new hair dryer since my Conair just randomly died without any advance notice and after only 2 years of use! Amazon prime to the rescue and I had this new hairdryer in 2 days! It&#x27;s incredibly hard to find a hairdryer online! It&#x27;s hard to know the size, weight, etc. so I read tons of reviews on various products. I decided on this one and am so glad I did! Like other reviews say, it is fairly heavy. I like that in a hairdryer though. It makes me feel like it&#x27;s a quality product. For some reason, the lighter hairdryers seem to last the least amount of time. It doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot as my old hairdryer, but it definitely blows more air. I don&#x27;t think it cuts my drying time in half, but it does seem to be a little quicker to dry my hair than before. Overall, I love it! Hopefully it lasts longer than 2 years, but we&#x27;ll see! I&#x27;ll keep you updated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to note - it is not a red or dark pink color as shown here (and on the box. The box also shows it as red) It&#x27;s actually a lighter pink color. I didn&#x27;t care about color, but just in case you are beware! The image here is a little deceiving as far as the color is concerned! But I love the see-through area to the fan!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer says everything it is supposed to do but it does not resemble the picture at all as far as color goes! its more of a \\&quot;rich pepto color\\&quot; a darker pink with a pearl finish and the fans are grey not white . Not a bad looking dryer overall but it will disappoint you if your expecting that beautiful deep red like in the picture!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this hair dryer with all the positive reviews and I was so excited when the box came. Unfortunately, this hair dryer is heavy, so long (in length) with the concentrator on that it&#x27;s awkward to use with a round brush, and not powerful enough to effectively dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time. My old hair dryers both gave out a month or so before I ordered this thing, and I loved both of them. They were a T3 ($120) and a cheapo Conair travel hair dryer ($10), so I know price point doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with why I can&#x27;t stand this dryer. Both of my old dryers did an excellent job of drying my hair quickly and efficiently while I was using my round brush. I could dry AND style my head of short hair in about 5 minutes with either of those dryers. Then, this thing came and I was excited after so many glowing reviews about its power, etc. Don&#x27;t believe the hype! It takes me 15 minutes with a round brush to dry my hair with this thing and even then it&#x27;s not all the way dry. My hair is above chin length, so there&#x27;s no good reason for this. My hair is left shiny, but doing my hair is now an exhausting chore instead of something I look forward to. I am saving up my money for a Supersalono and hope to be able to buy it within the next month. I can&#x27;t see using this heavy old thing for too much longer. As a busy mom of three small children, this dryer just adds stress to my day that I don&#x27;t need. I&#x27;m not even going to give this thing away when I buy my good dryer. Who would want it? It will go straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> My hair dries much quicker with this hairdryer.  it leaves our hair feeling soft, shiny and very healthy. Great product!</li>
    <li> I would like it more if it reached a higher temperature. takes a long time to dry hair. I have thick hair so I need a hair dryer that gets hotter.</li>
    <li> my daughter really love this dryer she loves the way she is able to control the settings on the blow dryer</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised and actually dries my hair in less than half the time as my other hair dryer with much less heat!  I almost didn&#x27;t believe it was possible until using this unit.  The only problem is the color of the unit is not the same as what&#x27;s here or even on the box.  I was expecting red.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a metallic hot pink.  Definitely something difficult for a man to pull off unless you&#x27;re married and can claim it belongs to your wife.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about buying this because it was more expensive then what I usually buy, but it&#x27;s well worth it. Dries my hair very fast without a lot of high heat. We got this mainly for my husband because he has dreads and this was recommended to dry the dreads out completely and now both of us use it.</li>
    <li> My wife really loves this hair dryer. Seems to dry her hair fast (way faster than the one we replaced) and all the various settings makes it great for other uses (like spot drying clothes, drying off the kid, etc.).</li>
    <li> This was my 3rd dryer in about 6 months; couldn&#x27;t seem to find one with the right amount of heat and airflow.  This one is perfect.</li>
    <li> This blow dyer rocks. Effective, for Brand name is affordable. What I like most about it, it is super quite, yet very powerful.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer from Target 4 months ago because it had the best reviews of all the ones they had there on the shelf.  In my house, we only use the hair dryer around 3 times a week total between my husband and myself (I only have to style my hair once every 4 days or so)... so this thing got minimal use.  When I bought it I was annoyed at how the temperature switch (to go from hot to cold) is in a spot on the handle where you usually grip the thing while you&#x27;re drying.  I would constantly accidentally switch it to the cold setting.  And, I never felt like this got hot enough to style my thick, unruly hair.  My hair is crazy thick and I need a lot of heat to get the frizz out while I&#x27;m drying and styling... but I&#x27;ve had to deal with this and hair dryers not being hot enough my whole life, so this wasn&#x27;t a huge surprise.  But then, a few days ago the heat function just completely broke.  So, now it only blows cool air no matter what.. which makes it basically useless to me.  I suppose that for $25 I got my \\&quot;use\\&quot; out of it for 4 months... but I hate that I&#x27;m having to send another plastic piece of trash to the landfill a lot sooner than expected.  :(</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dryer with no heat option... Those that I have found before have the button that you have to press down in order to get the cool hair...This one is different you can totally dry your hair without using any heat at all because  you can just press cool air button and unless you change it you only use the ambiant air like a very powerful ventilator...</li>
    <li> I do like how this dryer feels as I hold it. There is a lot of air that is coming from the unit. I just wish it were hotter. I have very thick hair and it takes forever to dry. It seems as if the hottest setting is the same temperature as &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; on any other dryer that I have had.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was needing. Girlfriend has now purchased 3 of these. The turbo option is great and we will continue to get the same model</li>
    <li> I finally caved an bought a new hairdryer. My old one had a variety of sounds during use for the past year or so and I was genuinely nervous that it might blow up or catch on fire. I also finally decided I was tired of sharing my hair dryer with the dog, so I looked for a hair dryer that would not only work better, but look nicer so I could make sure my dog remembers that I am alpha female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dries hair as fast as my old dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t even get half as hot. At first I was skeptical because at it&#x27;s highest setting it is only as warm as my old clunker at it&#x27;s &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, so quite a difference! I like the diffuser attachment with this dryer. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different if anything about it, but this is the first time I have actually been pleased with using the diffuser. All past dryers that part just sat under the sink until who knows when. Another thing I like about this is the fact it hasn&#x27;t tried to kill me by eating my hair. The last time a bought a hair dryer to replace my clunker, it sucked up some of my long hair and caught on fire, so I returned it and went back to my clunker. I was afraid to buy another new dryer for fear of the same thing happening. I thought maybe all new dryers ate hair. Boy was I wrong! I wish I had bought this a year ago! The only downside to this hair dryer as mentioned by others, is it&#x27;s color. I would not have my dream dryer be a metallic salmon color. But fortunately my dog is color blind, so she won&#x27;t be able to use the color against me when seeing my new alpha-female hair dryer.  Overall, I give this 4 stars, because 5 would require a desirable color.</li>
    <li> It works fine and the design is very nice to look at but I just wish that the cord isn&#x27;t so short. I also had a hard time controlling the sliding buttons. They&#x27;re just not that intuitive.</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer. It has multiple heat setting (low/med/high), 2 speed settings and a turbo boost which seems to increase the airflow, but not the heat. The result of the turbo boost is more air, but the air comes out a little cooler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable to hold and feels solid. It is not too heavy. It does seem to dry my hair faster than other dryers, especially at the higher airflow settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is noisy (increased noise with increased speed/turbo) and it has a tendency to trip my GFI and it once contributed to blowing the circuit breaker for the outlet. That&#x27;s to be expected with a 1875 Watt device.</li>
    <li> If you have hair that takes FOREVER to dry, this is the hair dryer for you.  It not only dries your hair, but leaves it soft and shiny. I have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one.  I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo about 10 or 15 years ago (it used to come in bluish/purple). During this time, I&#x27;ve often looked for other models just to see if I could find something better, and there just isn&#x27;t anything.  Many times, you&#x27;ll find me using two hair dryers at the same time (which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload). I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don&#x27;t have lots of hair... because nothing holds a candle to this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have a compact one that I keep in my gym bag.  It&#x27;s not as good, but will do in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I was tired of cooking my hair so I bought this product after reading the reviews on Amazon from a local chain store and paid more than I would have had I gotten it here. I was skeptical. After all, this would be replacing my old furnace of a blow dryer. I have thick, abundant, coarse, wavy, frizz-prone hair once aptly referred to by a so-called admirer as \\&quot;restless\\&quot; and intense heat seemed the only solution. This new machine does not blow very hot but it has become clear that a blow torch is not necessary to produce good results. I repeat what I said before, without blowdrying these locks would make the Bride of Frankenstein&#x27;s do look good. I suspect it&#x27;s the force of the airflow that wicks the water off the hair much in the same way those commercial hand blowers get the job done in public restrooms--only more quickly. The bonuses are soft, shiny hair with ends that don&#x27;t look fried and best of all the return of the volume that can get so easily lost when you dry the hair under intense heat--no more flat head for me. I cut the drying time by about fifteen minutes which makes a big difference. There will also be fewer \\&quot;hat\\&quot; days as I won&#x27;t have to abstain to protect my hair from constant drying. I found this model comparatively lightweight but still on the noisy side--of course, that was at maximum setting. I think I&#x27;ll get another and put it away \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; but I&#x27;ll go through Amazon when I do as the price was about 25% lower. You may have to adjust the way you style your hair as you dry it due to the increased force of the air generated, but for anyone capable of drying their own hair that shouldn&#x27;t prove too difficult. Try this one; I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer in Europe. I dont know what idiot is designing the &#x27;look&#x27; of this hair dryer but how about creating form AND function? First of all this hair dryer weighs a TON.. I didnt realize hairdrying was considered a workout.  Also the dryer handle points away from the drying air flow which makes it difficult to dry the back of your head? I keep burning my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only saving grace is that the speed actually works well.  I would NOT recommend this product based on design alone.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get excited over a hair dryer. It works , it dries and thats all it has to do.</li>
    <li> super powerful, diffuser is awesome, works wonders on my dreadlocks</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer! I was tired of taking 5 minutes to blow dry my thick hair so I went on a search for something that would be faster. So many say they blow dry faster but this one really does. So glad I purchased this. I no longer dread blow drying!</li>
