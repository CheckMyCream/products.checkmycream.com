<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best one of all variants. Good for dogs too. Don&#x27;t know bout cats, might have to look into that.</li>
    <li> Great texture and scent. I&#x27;d love a body spray and lotion in this scent.</li>
    <li> Best smelling herbal essence out there. Will be ordering again for sure.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and got it at a good price.</li>
    <li> Brings me back to my high school days of using Herbal Essences shampoo!  It&#x27;s a good body wash, no complaints, but my main reason for buying was to smell the awesomeness from way back when!  :-)</li>
    <li> oh yeh smells great thx deb</li>
    <li> Enjoy the good lather and smell.  Cant beat the product for the price - will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have received this product in exchange for my honest opinions. This is one of the better smelling body washes that I like and lathers up good too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not for me I tried it didn&#x27;t like ...</li>
    <li> Great price, smells really nice. Don&#x27;t recommend for a guy because it is a feminine smell.</li>
    <li> I actually haven&#x27;t used it yet, but, I&#x27;m sure I will like it</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling soft!</li>
    <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
    <li> When I shower using this body wash, I feel like I&#x27;m in a field of roses. It smells absolutely divine! It lathers up really well and rinses off without leaving any sticky residue. A little goes a long way (I use about a quarter-size amount on my body pouf) and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I love how the scent lingers in the bathroom and on my skin for hours.</li>
    <li> My guilty pleasure.  I like this item a lot!!</li>
    <li> This has a great smile and I really like it it&#x27;s not too overpowering. A little goes a long way you only need about a dime size and it lathers up enough to wash your whole body which means the bottle last you really long time. Amazon has this on sale quite often so you can really get it for super cheap which makes it an even better value.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works well.</li>
    <li> Its  great and i have this in my subscription!</li>
    <li> This works great and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Always love this product. Best one yet.</li>
    <li> Lathers good and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a ROSE scent which is why I got this it is a fruity smell great for little girls but not for a grown woman. It is soapy however I don&#x27;t like washing with Juicy Fruit.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works fabulously. Just a great product.</li>
    <li> Great scent! It lathers nicely and does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Smell good and leave your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Good body wash, makes a lot foam. But the strong is a bit too artificial and too strong.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since it came out and I love it. It smells like the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; herbal essences shampoo that we all remember and loved! That alone had me sold on it. In addition to the smell, it lathers up very good without using half the bottle. A bottle of this lasts me almost two months! (taking showers daily of course) It literally takes a dime size amount to do the job. Even though it&#x27;s not specifically a moisturizing body wash, it has never dried my skin out.I can smell the faint smell of this on my skin all day. I would highly suggest this to anyone who wants a cheap, great smelling, long lasting body wash.</li>
    <li> I love how cheap this is but mostly I love how it smells like classic Herbal Essences, like before they came out with all the different scents. I always get complimented on how good I smell after I use this!</li>
    <li> This smell is absolutely amazing. Sad I used it all up though! This is a great body wash!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Herbal Essences Happy Go Lather Body Wash!!!  It smells just like their shampoo.  I remember growing up using the shampoo and wanting to use it as body wash!  And now they have this, yay!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> awesome product that leaves your skin feeling soft and leaves you smelling good.</li>
    <li> Love this Body Wash.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is sooooo nice, it puts my a great mood.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love anything Herbal Essences, so when a Body Wash appeared I was all ready to try it.  And I was not disappointed!  The Happy Go Lather Body Wash holds to the same high quality standards that I have come to love and trust from Herbal Essences&#x27; hair care products - a great scent, good lather, and a nice clean rinse.  There is nothing worse than a body wash that leaves you feeling icky and filmy and the Herbal Essences Body Wash does not do this!  You come out of the shower feeling clean, fresh and ready to go in the day (or night). And all at a great price.</li>
    <li> It smells very good and the smell lasts all day.  I really like it and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> This is an okay body wash.  You think being made by &amp;#34;herbal essences&amp;#34; it would smell amazing, but it is just meh.  I won&#x27;t buy it again there are several other better body washes.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful thanks</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 star except the it came open and was leaking. The packaging was wet and lost a small amount of bodywash. Other than that great product.</li>
    <li> It smells very good and it stays on you for a little while. But you have to use a lot each time. The lather ends within 10 seconds so i end up adding more.</li>
    <li> Great smell very refreshing&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t like the smell of roses but this is a great citrus rose blend and is very soothing</li>
    <li> High quality body wash , wish I have bigger bottle :-)</li>
    <li> Good Value, smaller bottle than I m used to. ..</li>
    <li> I like how this body wash lathers and has a great smell to it. It gets me clean, but it also drys out my skin.</li>
    <li> Not great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and makes my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> daughter loves this and the bathrooms smells great after she&#x27;s out of the shower</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash. Purchase on the subscribe and save with a coupon awesome price awesome products.</li>
    <li> Scent is pretty powerful but my daughter likes it.</li>
    <li> Very similar to the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Does not cause my acne-prone skin to break out.  Gets the job done, though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m overly fond of the scent.  I like the blue one a lot better.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Another winner from Herbal Essence, great for work out, or a humid day, it cleans, and you only need a little!</li>
    <li> I found this body gel a unique blend of rose and citrus fruity smell.  Quite an acquired essence but I grow to like it a lot.  The texture is great on the body - definitely NOT drying.  Actually, I love fruity body wash like grapefruit, pink guava, cranberry type of body wash and usually find the floral type a little to strong for me but this is a blend of both.  So, I will alternate the use of this with my other body wash.  Good value for money.</li>
    <li> Love love this, the smell lingers and I actually get told I smell good, but I don&#x27;t tell its shower gel:)</li>
    <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t screamed and moaned like in the commercials, but she likes it nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I love this stuff!!! It smells so good and I feel fresh when I get out of the shower. I mostly love the smell!!!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Herbal Essence Line of products however this one  not so much. It really does not have that great of lather nor does it smell the greatest. I mean its okay, but not my first choice of scents. I will continue to buy Herbal Essence products just not this one. Good product just a matter of personal preference, and sorry, but I didnt really like this one &#x3D; (</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like the Color Me Happy Shampoo</li>
    <li> This smells soooo good!!! And it leaves you feeling fresh and clean!!!  Love it!!!  Deb Goretzke</li>
    <li> Love this product, no problems, arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> Not very moisturizing, the scent is kind of artificial smelling. I bought it because it was a good price, but I will go back to my usual brand instead of buying more of this.</li>
    <li> Smelled great, didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this Herbal Essence Body Wash!  Smells delicious and leaves your skin feeling sift and moisturized.  I would recommend this body wash to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff kind of smells like hairspray but I love it.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome. Makes the whole bathroom smell good. And a bounus for me is that I don&#x27;t have to smell like this body wash all day  long becasue the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells great and leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> This lotion does have a light scent to it, but I love it! I have very sensitive skin and exemia in the winter. This is the perfect, light-weight everyday hydrating lotion. With subscribe and save on this product, it&#x27;s steal for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
