<li> Decent lotion, but not much fragrance.</li>
<li> Not fresh and clean at all, more like heavy and artificial.  </li>
<li> I could pick up a slight Pink aroma, but will buy from store in mall the next time.</li>
<li> Only complaint is...wish I had taken the time and ordered through VS.</li>
<li> I was a little unsure about it considering that it didn&#x27;t look like the same product that I purchased at the Victoria Secret store at the mall a few years ago; but it was.</li>
<li> After one hour of trying, I finally called VS, who suggested I bring it in, just to be greeted by an unhappy CS personnel.  </li>
<li> when I contacted the seller to return it they told me to take it to Victoria&#x27;s Secret as that&#x27;s where they got it.</li>
<li> The smell is horrible, definitely not for me.</li>

    <li> Good one. Great buy. Love it. This one&#x27;s gonna go fast. Bought two :-)</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I were this scent.  I wish they still sold it at Bath &amp; Body works, they&#x27;re shaving formula was the best EVER!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Faulty Products... pump would not twist and open. After one hour of trying, I finally called VS, who suggested I bring it in, just to be greeted by an unhappy CS personnel.  So much for it being a surprise gift!</li>
    <li> Who would I pay this much for this when pink sells it cheaper</li>
    <li> Nothing smells as good as this smells. Bottom line.</li>
    <li> after I ordered it, I found it much cheaper elsewhere, but love the scent, and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall to get it</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! Smells fantastic! My wife just loves it. Not overpowering, just the hint of fresh scents. A must try!</li>
    <li> Smells Great. ..the price is better through the actual merchant. They have a sale for the price I paid for 1 on Amz, I could have had 3. Live and learn  :)</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible, definitely not for me. Not fresh and clean at all, more like heavy and artificial.  It gave me a headache even smelling it. FYI when I contacted the seller to return it they told me to take it to Victoria&#x27;s Secret as that&#x27;s where they got it. So save your $$ and go buy it in the store or online at VS</li>
    <li> Decent lotion, but not much fragrance. I could pick up a slight Pink aroma, but will buy from store in mall the next time.</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure about it considering that it didn&#x27;t look like the same product that I purchased at the Victoria Secret store at the mall a few years ago; but it was. So very happy.</li>

    <li> Came on time. Smells great.</li>
    <li> this scent is my favorite VS scent, a lot for the price</li>
    <li> I got this for my mama and she just love it..And wants some more for the summer time. I&#x27;m going order 2 of the lotion and one the body spray...</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Good price and deliveried on time.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is...wish I had taken the time and ordered through VS. Could&#x27;ve gotten two for the price</li>
