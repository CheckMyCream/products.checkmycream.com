<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is ok it is not meant for someone with a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality. Picture is better than actual product. Stones came off even before i took it out of package and not useable at all! I put it on and after 2 minutes they just fall to t,he ground! What a waste of my money !</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my bridesmaid. They came intact and are gorgeous.</li>
    <li> My niece loved this as her Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> beads came off after one day.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!! Fast shipping and beautiful piece  :)</li>
    <li> Had to re glue sever stones back on.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a little bling in your updo!</li>
    <li> Plastic and there are not stones in it as it appears. It was just textured plastic. The price point is why I am not giving it a one star.</li>
    <li> arrived with a missing piece but too expensive to return.</li>
    <li> nice combs, wish I had purchased more</li>
    <li> So pretty and I wear it all the time. I&#x27;ve had it for months and it still looks like new.</li>
    <li> Simply lovely. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> love it. it is so nice</li>
    <li> Too heavy to stay in your hair and rhinestones fall out easy</li>
    <li> disappointed to open my package for six flower pedals had fallen. it took to get the package. The value of the purchase was economical but does not justify the damaged product.</li>
    <li> Pretty and good value but much, MUCH larger than expected.</li>
    <li> This comb is a little flimsy but beautiful. Well worth the price</li>
    <li> The clip is very nice and as it&#x27;s shown. Good size, stands out. The only problem was that it took a long time to arrive, I think it got lost the first time, but when I inquired about it, they replaced it. Looks really nice on my black hair, I have gotten a few compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Very very pretty. Well done</li>
    <li> Cheezy and fell apart right away.</li>
    <li> its ok for the money. looks a little cheap once you see it in person.</li>
    <li> This is really gorgeous. Material is not plastic and it doesn&#x27;t look like it was glued on. If it is, I can&#x27;t really tell. Good for weddings, casual elegant syle. Hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck when you take it out. Over all...really good for such a price.</li>
    <li> This product is very beautiful, useful and nice to own. I would recommend this to others to buy if they want a nice hair clip of their own.</li>
    <li> absolutely beautiful!  love it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful Barrette its elegant and dresses up any hair do!</li>
    <li> I wish it wouldn&#x27;t keep loosing the flower petals. It&#x27;s a nice hair piece, pretty too! It just doesn&#x27;t stay together. I&#x27;d use super glue if I ever find the lost petals, as it could be glued back together.</li>
    <li> Wow, this hair piece looks great on my sister. She just says thanks each time she wears it</li>
    <li> Beautiful.  I love it.  Good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Good weight for thick hair</li>
    <li> I love this item beautifully made and very sturdy</li>
    <li> Came broken falls apart soon</li>
    <li> The comb part itself is nice and sturdy.  It is very pretty but I had it for five minutes and one of the larger petals fell off and another one was on crooked.  I know I can glue it back.  Because I pay very little I am not really upset about it. It still is very pretty in your hair.  I would buy again and just know I may have to fix it. I&#x27;m crafty so I am okay with that.</li>
    <li> The champagne color is pretty and it&#x27;s a very nice hair piece.  It&#x27;s heavy though and won&#x27;t stay in my fine hair without bobby pinning it.  I dropped it on the floor the day it came in the mail and the jewels fell off, three of them.  But, a little hot glue solved that problem and it was my own fault.  I recommend it but be sure you have enough hair to support it&#x27;s weight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice hair barrette; however, I would have liked if it came in one piece.  Product was broken when I received it.  I am so lucky that I have a glue gun otherwise I would have been very upset.  Once I glued back the pieces I felt better about the product, but I wish I didn&#x27;t have to do so.</li>
    <li> Love my hair piece .. Received it in perfect condition and no rhinestones have fallen out.. Completely satisfied</li>
    <li> As expected it looks beautiful on hair.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and sturdy</li>
    <li> much more toward peach than gold but I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
    <li> This item came in with two of the pieces loose but there was one missing out of the package - can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> i love this hair piece!!!  its so pretty, Ive gotten multiple compliments every time i wear it.  the only weird thing is that there is a missing petal on the flower on the bottom. it really isn&#x27;t noticeable to anyone else, i just didn&#x27;t notice that it wasn&#x27;t there in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looks exactly as pictured and i plan to buy the rest of the colors they have in the same design</li>
    <li> I received two and one was broken. Its nothing a little super glue could not fix. However when I open a package seeing broken merchandise ruins it for me.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful, but I had to glue two of the leaves back on.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t slide into hair well or stay.</li>
    <li> The product took several weeks to arrive, and when it had, several of the stones had already fallen off when I opened the package.</li>
    <li> Pretty, what I expected</li>
    <li> My sister in law loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to her as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Less sparkly than it is in the photo but still good</li>
    <li> really heavy - almost to heavy to use except in a bun.  but tit is beautiful.</li>
    <li> The middle was broken</li>
    <li> Very heavy piece, not sure how well it will stay in my hair. Also very pretend gold looking on comb part- but possibly not visible once I figure out how to put it in a style!</li>
    <li> It is beautiful, but I had to glue two of the leaves back on.</li>
    <li> This hair clip arrived 10/13/14 and was broken into many pieces.  I will be returning the item.</li>
    <li> Part on the flower came out after one use of the comb.</li>
    <li> One of the leaves broke off right after I got it so I had to glue it back on</li>
    <li> Horrible! And I don&#x27;t know How retén the horrible ugly charm. I recibes it damage and come in a envelope ftom China. How Can I retiro it! Ugly ugly ugly. Ofdinary.</li>
    <li> One of the stone already came out I did not even get to use it yet.  It look nice enough</li>
    <li> Very pretty hair pin but I recieved it, some of the rhinestones fell off. Quick fix with some crazy glue and done.</li>
    <li> I have two for when I do my hair with double bun&#x27;s. No problems with gems falling out. Beautiful i get a lot of complements when I wear them.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Looks just like the picture. Just a little on the heavy side, but I have thick hair so it works great :)</li>
    <li> The sequined petals all fell off the first time I wore it...obviously the glue was inferior...what a disappointment</li>
    <li> Not as cheap as I thought it would be based on the price... Also it was very very Good quality</li>
    <li> Very lovely. It is more of a dark yellow than it appears, like the color of these amazon stars *.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful, but very fragile. One of the flowers came off before I even had a chance to wear it.</li>
    <li> Was bent when received and broke instantly</li>
    <li> but i bought two and it feels a little plastic to me it has some sturdiness to it &amp; it had on one sharp plastic edges and one was bent/broken on end leaf but i would buy this again but it would not be for me because I like the metal ones this might have a little metal in it but i do notice a different from my other hair combs but I would buy this for a teenager or friend I would use it because it is pretty and no one will know the difference in quility but I do like the more vintage metal ones I told the sellers about it and they were perfect&lt;br /&gt;contact me immediately i sent pictures like they ask the are willing to reimburse me but I told them no it was fine enough to keep I will just be more careful in choosing the ones I really want i will recommend to other to buy (&amp; sorry for the informal writing)</li>
    <li> It was broken with missing stones when I received it</li>
    <li> It falls down to pieces</li>
    <li> One of the end pieces was shipped bent. The flower piece broke within a day.</li>
    <li> This item is very well done, beautiful colors and excellent quality, it is worth the wait. I love it!!!!! and I recomended to anyone.</li>
    <li> The haircomb was in pieces when I received it!</li>
    <li> This is actually very pretty and surprisingly sparkly but as soon as I took it out of the package, 2 stones fell off. No biggie, I just super glued them back on. Going to order more to use in a wedding this spring. Can&#x27;t beat the price, even if I have to reglue a few stones.</li>
    <li> Just beautiful!  Perfect for church or any special occasion.  I have gotten many compliments!  Of great quality too not just pretty!</li>
    <li> pieces of jewelry came out...not good</li>
    <li> Beautiful comb, but upon opening the package two of the flower petal stones fell off.</li>
    <li> Perfection in an ornament...this goes with a top I already owned and did not realize it until I put it in my hair when I got dressed up.  I wear hair jewelry as it makes me feel totally put together.  I used to wear these when I was a teen and now am wearing again as a senior!!!  Cool man cool!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty in a costume jewelry kind of way but it came with a bunch of stones broken off.  They were in the bag so with some super glue my problem was solved.  I just can&#x27;t help but wonder how well it will hold up with some wear.</li>
    <li> Pieces fell of before I was able to wear it</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken. Not happy!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Only one minor  problem. When I recieved it two of the petals had fallen off inside the little pouch. I took some gorrilla glue and I glued it back in place and wallahh. I love my hair comb. I was not going to do like some people and down rate it just because of a small mishap. The gorrilla glue went a long way and it save the day. Yessssssss!!!!</li>
    <li> This is just a beautiful and unique clip you won&#x27;t see anywhere else at a wonderful price.  If you love your hair, you&#x27;ll appreciate this &amp;#34;hair jewelry&amp;#34;!  Well made, certainly heavier than plastic, so I would advise it for thicker hair or certainly someone with longer hair so that it would not be too weighty on thin, fine, short hair that might be prone to breakage.  Choose to wear it the same way you&#x27;d choose your other accessories, such fun, and well made!  Photos don&#x27;t do it justice, great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this with a fur shrug and a guy asked me if I was fresh off the boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: pair this by toning down other accessories!</li>
