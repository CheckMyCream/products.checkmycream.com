<li> do not like how the back is short, but as long as you are using the front of the cape to cover the back while cutting its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> his only negative is that the hair sticks to the cape.</li>
<li> The only thing negative</li>
<li> and when you sit down, the bottom will cover your feet/shoes.  </li>
<li> They are spaced out about 2&amp;#34; each and there are few of them.</li>
<li> It is extremely short on the back, which make it useless!</li>
<li> For the money it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
<li> Bad design for this item.</li>
<li> but I was a bit disappointed that hair seemed to stick.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed after I used it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The cape seems to be high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Length in the front is very generous.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of compliments on the pattern.&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;Length in the back is very short. Having to constantly dust off my clients clothing because the hair falls right between them and the chair.&lt;br /&gt;The snaps are few a far between. They are spaced out about 2&amp;#34; each and there are few of them. The cape ends up either being too tight or too loose (which again means hair all over their clothing). Maybe 1 out of 20 clients will have a neck that fits perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Cape is unusually static prone. Nothing some static guard won&#x27;t fix if you don&#x27;t mind that smell.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I&#x27;ll definitely buy again from these guys again. It was well worth the money I spent. Try it.</li>
    <li> Well made barber cape. I bought this as a surprise for my barber husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> A must have if your a cosmetologist or beautician, arrived as scheduled.</li>
    <li> Good cutting cape for a barber shop. Simple black and white design. What else can I say !!! Try it</li>
    <li> Nice product, the material is good to where hair will just slide off and the design is nice, but it&#x27;s a little too long up front and way too short in the back.  In the front, when you stand up, the bottom of the cover is near knee high and when you sit down, the bottom will cover your feet/shoes.  In the back it only does down below your back shoulder bone.  I should have bought it in a solid red color, that way I can turn it around and use it as a cape.  &amp;#34;Here I come to save the day&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cape for my son who is a barber. they look great and it dresses up his clients. his only negative is that the hair sticks to the cape.</li>
    <li> Simple to use--plenty big.</li>
    <li> Item came on time and it great condition. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product at anytime to anyone who is interested. Don&#x27;t be scared &amp;#34; BUY &amp;#34;. Honest supplier</li>
    <li> This cape is too short on the back. The picture does not show that.</li>
    <li> This is a new cape ive purchase because the other one I had was starting to rip. It have very nice designs very durable abd the only place that sold them is sallys beauty supply but had to order them. I know one thing if im ordering its coming from amazon</li>
    <li> very nice cover.  works great for cutting my guys hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only cover the front, the back side is short, and would stick on it, won&#x27;t fall off by its our.</li>
    <li> REALLY NICE ITEM AND I&#x27;LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU AGAIN.  . . .  . .  .</li>
    <li> As advertised .. good price and does the job. Pretty styly as well. Make sure to wash and dry with no static sheet</li>
    <li> Just like the professionals use... Works great for home...</li>
    <li> Love it really works great and very cute.</li>
    <li> very nice! i just hope the back was longer!</li>
    <li> This barber drape is perfect for cutting hair and is cool....unlike the old plastic drape we had before. Great item for the money.</li>
    <li> It is just me or do other folks want to have their own? I have a beard to trim, so I need this cape every couple of weeks and it&#x27;s always there because it is so obviously Dad&#x27;s. They (family) either know not to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; it (likely) or are nervous enough to always put it back (I wish!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow the designer managed to make a cape cool. How? It&#x27;s a mystery. And it&#x27;s a great cape</li>
    <li> Bad design for this item. It is extremely short on the back, which make it useless! I am very disappointed after I used it!</li>
    <li> I use it for my son, my husband and my dad, it is big and long enough to provide protection. The quality is very good, the hairs will not stick to it. We like it. I ordered two and my dad took one back home.</li>
    <li> I like the design alot. But I recommend washing only.  When u dry it will shrink neck size for cape</li>
    <li> This is a very well made cape. There is plenty of material and very good coverage. This cape would easily cover anyone over 6 feet tall. The only thing negative I have to say about this cape is that hair seems to cling to it more than I would expect. I&#x27;ve only used it once and it wasn&#x27;t a major problem but I was a bit disappointed that hair seemed to stick. Otherwise I am very happy with the product. For the money it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
    <li> VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE, MY CUSTOMER&#x27;S LOVE THE CAPE.  IT KEEPS THEM BUSY LOOKING AT EACH OF THE PICTURES ON IT.  :)</li>
    <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;I love the design on this cape it is perfect for in house hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;I do not like how the back is short, but as long as you are using the front of the cape to cover the back while cutting its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all worth the cost.</li>
    <li> The cape is plenty large to cover any and all areas.  My only problem with it is hair wants to cling to the material.  I shook the cape and also hung it up outside, but still couldn&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
    <li> Neck fits securely.  Hair slides right off.  Covers the whole body.  Works great!  I like the vintage print -- lots of interesting items.</li>
    <li> Excellent value and a fine delivery service</li>
