      <li>So many hairties!</li>
      <li>SO MANY TIMES IN MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR.</li>
      <li>but they will work just need to remember not to wrap them more then twice around hair</li>
      <li>So glad I bought these.</li>
      <li>I love these hairbands.</li>
      <li>/&gt;much better.  </li>
      <li>is great for doing braids because it&#x27;s clear and it blends with your hair.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s on the fine side.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>Works great, totally invisible in my hair.  </li>
      <li>OKAY, AT FIRST</li>
      <li>if you are in the military it works great for the sock buns.</li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>use the large for full ponytails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you like to do different hairstyles (braids and such), these are great elastics.</li>
      <li>WRAPPING TIME REALLY MATTERS WITH A TODDLER!</li>
      <li>Super handy when you have a little girl who pulls out every clip you put in her hair!</li>
      <li>They have changed them a bit their not as strong as first back</li>
      <li>Amazingly, it looks like you have small bit of cheap, clear plastic in your hair.</li>
      <li>The little tiny ones are perfect for my girls&#x27; dolls and the larger ones work well in their hair.</li>
      <li>I was willing to have the two sizes I do not use just to have the large clear size.</li>
      <li>In fact, they are more likely to snap within the first hour of wearing than they are to actually stay in place.</li>
      <li>have to go to Walmart just for these, haven&#x27;t seen them in any if my other stores, will enjoy the convenience of just ordering them here now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been looking ALL OVER for them recently, but I could not find the large sizes.</li>
      <li>They wear out really quickly and will break due to wear rubber if you try to wrap them twice.</li>
      <li>They are indeed less tacky to the touch than say the old newspaper rubber band, these feel more glossy, which is their secret to not pulling on the hair so much to take out.</li>
      <li>Love these, we use the tiny ones to twist over the ankle then shoe of barbies to hold on - or a hairstyle that takes multiple tiny ponytails at the crown of your head, in one row, looks like a headband kinda, hard to describe sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>does not loose elasticity.</li>
      <li>The largest ones are much too large for my hair--you&#x27;d probably have to have VERY thick hair for them to work.</li>

<li> THEY SEEM TO LAST LONG, I HAVE BEEN REUSING THE SAME BANDS</li>
<li> These bands are three sizes, small, medium, large.</li>
<li> My hair isnt quite long enough to put up in a sock bun yet, so these are a lifesaver since I cant have my hair in a pony tail in uniform.</li>
<li> I can reuse them quite a few times before needing a new band.</li>
<li> but they get the job done, rarely has one broken when i stretched to use.  </li>
<li> The small ones, however, completely break upon stretching even the slightest bit.  </li>
<li> Different elasticity than the small black bands, which I prefer unless you just need clear ones.</li>
<li> use the middle for half ponytails and</li>
<li> I wear them once and throw them away - such a waste.</li>
<li> I have tried the small and tiny ones.</li>
<li> I can use it 2 or 3 times before it&#x27;s stretched past</li>
<li> It&#x27;s dark brown.</li>
<li> They never fall out, and also dont pull the hair out when I take it down at the end of the day.</li>
<li> They never get tangled in your hair and even though they stretch out after a few uses, I haven&#x27;t had any of them snap on me.</li>
<li> Very little pulling</li>
<li> They are really small, so I don&#x27;t have to wrap them to hold my hair.</li>
<li> I should have listened to the other reviewers who rated these poorly.</li>
<li> AND IT STILL HASN&#x27;T STRETCHED OUT TO BAD</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a great look, so I probably won&#x27;t use them except under something else.</li>
<li> I am always losing my ponytails, and you don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about losing these.</li>
<li> Very disappointed and a waste of money.</li>
<li> This was basically a worthless purchase for me.</li>
<li> These were the worst rubber ands I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
<li> These were horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers who rated these poorly. These bands could not be more carelessly manufactured. They are brittle to the touch -- just out of the box you can feel the lack of quality -- and snap at no provocation whatsoever. In fact, they are more likely to snap within the first hour of wearing than they are to actually stay in place. I&#x27;ve had them break in the middle of yoga classes, in the middle of runs, in the middle of teaching a class, or being out with friends. Do. Not. Buy.</li>
    <li> great for my hair. works great on my hair. does not loose elasticity. if you are in the military it works great for the sock buns.</li>
    <li> OKAY, AT FIRST I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THESE BANDS BECAUSE IT BROKE WHILE IN MY DAUGHTER HAIR AND THAT WAS BECAUSE I WAS USING THE REALLY TINY ONES. I SWITCHED TO THE MEDIUM SIZE BANDS AND IT WORKS WELL WITH NO PROBLEMS. THEY SEEM TO LAST LONG, I HAVE BEEN REUSING THE SAME BANDS AND IT STILL HASN&#x27;T STRETCHED OUT TO BAD TO THE POINT I HAVE TO WRAP IT SO MANY TIMES IN MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR. WRAPPING TIME REALLY MATTERS WITH A TODDLER! I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> These work great on girls and dolls hair. The little tiny ones are perfect for my girls&#x27; dolls and the larger ones work well in their hair. Very little pulling and they hold the hair snug.</li>
    <li> These were the worst rubber ands I&#x27;ve ever had.  They all broke before I could getthem on my ponytail. Never again.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my beard. It&#x27;s dark brown. I have tried the small and tiny ones. They work--hold and don&#x27;t pull as rubber bands do. But they are noticeable. Amazingly, it looks like you have small bit of cheap, clear plastic in your hair. It&#x27;s not a great look, so I probably won&#x27;t use them except under something else.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for on the go use.  The small ones, however, completely break upon stretching even the slightest bit.  The largest ones are much too large for my hair--you&#x27;d probably have to have VERY thick hair for them to work. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s on the fine side.  This was basically a worthless purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed and a waste of money. These were horrible. Put these in my daughters hair at night and they were all popped by the morning.</li>
    <li> I love these hairbands. I have been looking ALL OVER for them recently, but I could not find the large sizes. Thank goodness for Amazon, because I was running out of hope. I was willing to have the two sizes I do not use just to have the large clear size. Worth it.</li>
    <li> Love these, we use the tiny ones to twist over the ankle then shoe of barbies to hold on - or a hairstyle that takes multiple tiny ponytails at the crown of your head, in one row, looks like a headband kinda, hard to describe sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the middle for half ponytails and pigtails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the large for full ponytails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to go to Walmart just for these, haven&#x27;t seen them in any if my other stores, will enjoy the convenience of just ordering them here now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda pricey here but they get the job done, rarely has one broken when i stretched to use.  They do stretch out in use so we have to toss them after one use.  They are indeed less tacky to the touch than say the old newspaper rubber band, these feel more glossy, which is their secret to not pulling on the hair so much to take out.</li>
    <li> Works great, totally invisible in my hair.  Makes the hair style look&lt;br /&gt;much better.  Obviously not a permantly reusable item, no elastics are,&lt;br /&gt;but I can use it 2 or 3 times before it&#x27;s stretched past it&#x27;s limit and&lt;br /&gt;breaks.  I&#x27;ve put it on permanent reorder to get it regularly with no shipping.</li>
    <li> I just learned that people are using this to close gaps in their teeth. I&#x27;m gonna try that this week. Just wanna know has anyone else tried this.</li>
    <li> Perfect for trying those Pintriest hairstyles and if you don&#x27;t want the bands visible.  The variety in sizes are great.  A very good value.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT!!!!! I got my daughter these and she loves them not only do they bring 250 but they give you two pack and it comes in three different sizes small, medium, and large is great for doing braids because it&#x27;s clear and it blends with your hair.</li>
    <li> These bands are three sizes, small, medium, large. I&#x27;ve been using the smallest ones. I have fine hair. They are really small, so I don&#x27;t have to wrap them to hold my hair. But 24 hours later, you might as well throw them away. They wear out really quickly and will break due to wear rubber if you try to wrap them twice. I wear them once and throw them away - such a waste. I probably won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> They have changed them a bit their not as strong as first back I bought but they will work just need to remember not to wrap them more then twice around hair</li>
    <li> If you like to do different hairstyles (braids and such), these are great elastics. They never get tangled in your hair and even though they stretch out after a few uses, I haven&#x27;t had any of them snap on me. The 250 qty will last forever!</li>
    <li> So glad I bought these. I can reuse them quite a few times before needing a new band. Super handy when you have a little girl who pulls out every clip you put in her hair! She has yet to get these out! Perfect.</li>
    <li> So many hairties! So perfect for my girls with an equally amazing price.</li>
    <li> My hair isnt quite long enough to put up in a sock bun yet, so these are a lifesaver since I cant have my hair in a pony tail in uniform. They never fall out, and also dont pull the hair out when I take it down at the end of the day. Recommend!!</li>
    <li> great things to have and stock up on. I am always losing my ponytails, and you don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about losing these.</li>
    <li> It looks like the picture. Everything was there. The bands are a good brand. Different elasticity than the small black bands, which I prefer unless you just need clear ones.</li>
