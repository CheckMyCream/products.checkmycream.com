      <li>Best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Great for face, hands and feet.</li>

      <li>great stuff for the face, recommend it.</li>
      <li>I am happy to find it in Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>Everyone received it loved it.  </li>
      <li>This is a good cream to put on your hands.</li>
      <li>I love lanolin cream!</li>
      <li>I am sure you will.!</li>
      <li>This cream is very pleasant smelling, non-greasy and absorbs really well.  </li>
      <li>This cream is non greasy and very soft on the skin and best of all&lt;br /&gt;absorbs</li>
      <li>I also very very rarely have any pimples (I have good skin).</li>
      <li>So, it might work, but I don&#x27;t know because I wasn&#x27;t able to give it a chance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cute that it came from sheep&#x27;s wool~~~~!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love this cream</li>
      <li>Just Ordered Two More ~ I have tried lanolin before, but it was always sticky and gooey.</li>
      <li>Nice, clean smell adds to the appeal.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good night cream at a reasonable price and found it.</li>
      <li>In other words the greatest appearance of lanolin in this product is on the label.</li>
      <li>a child, I have used lanolin facial moisturizer that I loved, which my Aunt bought for me as a gift from Australia!</li>
      <li>The smell is so strong, I could not tolerate it.</li>
      <li>My face feels smooth and comfortable after applying the cream.</li>
      <li>It is smooth and no oily texture.</li>
      <li>It has been several hours since I used it on my hands and they still feel good.</li>
      <li>I hope the price can be more reasonable.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
      <li>I am glad I followed my hunch with this cream - it is non greasy and absorbs into the skin really well - the perfect long lasting moisturiser!</li>
      <li>This wonderful cream is fluffy and feels light, but completely moisturizes your skin, sinking in immediately and leaving no greasy feeling at all.</li>
      <li>I used it first on my face and then tried it on my heels.</li>
      <li>Before this I used Oil of Olay (more than double the price of this product), but I will continue to purchase this product.  </li>
      <li>sure if this is it, under a different label, or not?&lt;br</li>
      <li>I live in a warm climate, but also very dry.</li>
      <li>She uses it on her face and also on other dry spots on her body, a great product.</li>
      <li>The lotion is very moisturizing and hydrating - and not at all greasy.  </li>
      <li>I looked at the different products available and chose this.</li>
      <li>really well.</li>
      <li>Definitely beats the big name popular skin creams</li>
      <li>I suppose I cannot give a full review on this, because I only used the cream once.</li>
      <li>Cream feels smooth and soothing to my dry skin.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying the benefits of lanolin at long last.</li>
      <li>I DO NOT have oily skin; I have normal skin.</li>
      <li>being said, the lanolin night cream I just bought a week ago is still brand new</li>
      <li>I really was looking for a product called Queenskin Australian Lanolin.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>I actually bought this for an older friend of mine and she loves it.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand if you&#x27;re looking for lanolin to care for your skin not so much.</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate, so this says a lot for the product.</li>

<li> No more rough heels!  </li>

<li> Lanolin has helped hydrate my skin without irritating it.</li>
<li> I used to wake up in the morning with a bad itch in my legs and body.</li>
<li> No, it&#x27;s WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for that!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> Just Ordered Two More ~ I have tried lanolin before, but it was always sticky and gooey. This wonderful cream is fluffy and feels light, but completely moisturizes your skin, sinking in immediately and leaving no greasy feeling at all. I live in a warm climate, but also very dry. I&#x27;ve been using this day and night and it is not too heavy, and penetrates several layers down. My husband likes it too. Nice, clean smell adds to the appeal. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have dry feet and my doctor suggested I apply lanolin. I looked at the different products available and chose this. When it arrived and I opened it it looked different than anyone else&#x27;s description of lanolin. Then I read the ingredients.&#x60; lanolin is the sixth ingredient following your favorites: deionized water, stearic acid, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, and mineral oil. In other words the greatest appearance of lanolin in this product is on the label. If you were looking for a product that has lanolin on the label, this is the one for you. On the other hand if you&#x27;re looking for lanolin to care for your skin not so much. Very deceptive and dishonest.</li>
    <li> Cream has a very slight, delicate odor, almost citrus scent which quickly disapates. Cream feels smooth and soothing to my dry skin. I used it first on my face and then tried it on my heels. I thought it would be thicker but it&#x27;s a thinner consistency than expected. I plan to buy another jar for my Mom. It has been several hours since I used it on my hands and they still feel good. Not a greasy product at all, esp. after it has been applied for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream to put on your hands. I apply some before bed almost every night.</li>
    <li> I suppose I cannot give a full review on this, because I only used the cream once. The smell is so strong, I could not tolerate it. So, it might work, but I don&#x27;t know because I wasn&#x27;t able to give it a chance.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of ponds lotion same consistency.</li>
    <li> I am glad I followed my hunch with this cream - it is non greasy and absorbs into the skin really well - the perfect long lasting moisturiser! Definitely beats any department store brand skin moisturiser out there - I am enjoying the benefits of lanolin at long last.</li>
    <li> great stuff for the face, recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cream is very pleasant smelling, non-greasy and absorbs really well.  I used to wake up in the morning with a bad itch in my legs and body. Lanolin has helped hydrate my skin without irritating it. Definitely, recommend this over any department store name brands.</li>
    <li> I love lanolin cream! It&#x27;s so cute that it came from sheep&#x27;s wool~~~~!&lt;br /&gt;As a child, I have used lanolin facial moisturizer that I loved, which my Aunt bought for me as a gift from Australia! Thus, recently I looked for a lanolin cream and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is that when I put it on at night, the next morning when I wake up, my skin is so oily and shine.... completely greasy. I DO NOT have oily skin; I have normal skin. I also very very rarely have any pimples (I have good skin). After I used this lanolin night cream, I have had 2 pimples!! The 2nd one is not gone yet!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am thinking even though I like this cream, because it hydrates, but it just makes my face too greasy and shine in the morning and even gave me pimples, so I probably will stop using it. I am going to buy an Olay regenerist night elixir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being said, the lanolin night cream I just bought a week ago is still brand new and I have only used for a few days, I don&#x27;t know what to do with it when I have my new night cream. Just use it as a hand/body cream? No, it&#x27;s WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for that!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use on my hands, feet, arms &amp; legs and it is wonderful.  It is smooth and no oily texture.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for an older friend of mine and she loves it.  She uses it on her face and also on other dry spots on her body, a great product. Absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
    <li> I bought the same item when I visited Australia five years ago.  I gave it out as gift too.  Everyone received it loved it.  I am happy to find it in Amazon.  The price I paid before was a lot less than it is now.  I hope the price can be more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion upon recommendation from a friend, and I am really happy with the product.  The lotion is very moisturizing and hydrating - and not at all greasy.  I recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin looking for an everyday moisturizer.  Before this I used Oil of Olay (more than double the price of this product), but I will continue to purchase this product.  Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used.  Great for face, hands and feet. No more rough heels!  I order several at a time as my husband also has started using nit.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good night cream at a reasonable price and found it. My face feels smooth and comfortable after applying the cream. I live in a very dry climate, so this says a lot for the product. And, it&#x27;s not overly greasy.  I&#x27;ll definitely reorder this one.</li>
    <li> When I received this product it was 5 months past its sale date.  No wonder it was condensed to half its size. I use it only on my feet and legs.</li>
    <li> This cream is non greasy and very soft on the skin and best of all&lt;br /&gt;absorbs really well. Definitely beats the big name popular skin creams&lt;br /&gt;I have tried.  Happy to find the benefits of lanolin for skin moisturising!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who always had cracks in her feet or they would hurt a lot from her standing or walking a lot during the day. She puts it on before she goes to bed every night and her feet are refreshed when she wakes up and the cracks disappeared in about a week. She now only gets pain every so often but she puts it on every night. I just need to invest in bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> I really love this cream and I think everyone with very dry skin will too ! I am sure you will.!</li>
    <li> I brought 3 Lanolin Night Cream with Vitamin E one of them expire date was last year.</li>
    <li> I really was looking for a product called Queenskin Australian Lanolin.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is it, under a different label, or not?&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be the same, however Queenskin did not list Vitamin E.</li>
