      <li>In love.</li>
      <li>Sweet and warm vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>This light Vanilla fragrance is perfect for an otherwise &amp;#34;non-perfume wearer.&amp;#34; It is perfect as a gift for a teenager who is just starting to wear fragrance as well as for an older woman who wants to make sure her perfume isn&#x27;t overwhelming others.</li>
      <li>If Amazon ever gets this listed under $20 with Prime for free shipping then I&#x27;d say buy it here, otherwise head on over to Pacifica for a couple freebies and better selection.  :)</li>
      <li>It is very sweet smelling with a hint of flowers.</li>
      <li>I love this scent so much it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent so much!  </li>
      <li>I tend to be very sensitive to scents, but this one is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>lovely, lovely fragrance in a delicate beautiful little bottle - a perfect gift for yourself or any girl or woman you love!</li>
      <li>Nice undertones not too flowery, pure vanilla scent not like</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic longer wearing version of the roll-on applicator.</li>
      <li>This perfume smells great, especially with the body butter.</li>
      <li>Fruity and cheap smelling.</li>
      <li>It is amazing and I highly recommend this scent!</li>
      <li>Great smell that last all day.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m not gonna buy it\\&quot; each person&#x27;s unique fragrance preferences is something that you need to explore for yourself, and not take what others say to heart too</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the try and the money!</li>
      <li>Would purchase again, also layers beautifully with other like scents</li>
      <li>Amazing service and natural smell of my woman.</li>
      <li>If you ever tried Philosophy&#x27;s Sweet Cream and thought that was too sweet, you might like Pacifica&#x27;s vanilla one.</li>
      <li>I have tried this out at one of the local stores and loved it.</li>
      <li>That Would Be A Big Help for Those Who Can&#x27;t Pay The Good Stuff.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to have found a perfume blended with essential and natural</li>
      <li>This is currently my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s natural.</li>
      <li>But, I&#x27;d definantly try this, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>Out of all the products I&#x27;ve bought, Pacifica&#x27;s is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It has a wonnderful Vanilla smell, but be aware that when you spray it at first, it is almost too much, but as an hour or so goes by, it feels better.</li>
      <li>Other than that I think it was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, with a rich , long lasting vanilla....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as sweet and not quite as long lasting, but for the price it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a natural yet gourmand creamy sweet vanilla!</li>
      <li>Amazing scent, but it vanished so fast it do not last.</li>
      <li>Buy direct though for free gifts.</li>
      <li>Not too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t last for more than 6 hours</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this perfume!  </li>
      <li>I saw this on display in a local store, and I fellow shopper assured me that she is able to wear Pacifica&#x27;s fragrance even though she has a fragrance allergy, too.</li>
      <li>I war vanilla all the time, and have tried many different brands.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple hours.</li>
      <li>Simple but soft and very unique!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you so much, and shipping was lightning fast too!</li>
      <li>It comes brand new as described!!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I feel it&#x27;s a little..</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s VERY over-bearing.</li>
      <li>A very lovely vanilla fragrance for people who like vanilla but don&#x27;t like very heavy fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have other Pacifica perfumes, I love this Brand</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great deal and a little goes a long way!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nice undertones not too flowery, pure vanilla scent not like you are baking a cake! Would purchase again, also layers beautifully with other like scents</li>
    <li> Love love love this!  The scent is pleasant without being overpowering.  It&#x27;s a great deal and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great, especially with the body butter. It lasts a little while but I spray it all over which uses up a lot, I wish they made a larger size. I love this scent so much it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Not true vanilla. Fruity and cheap smelling.</li>
    <li> This is currently my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s natural. It&#x27;s not overpowering. It smells amazing. You must buy. :)</li>
    <li> I got this perfume as part of a little beauty quest trying to find a low-cost replacement for LaVanila&#x27;s Pure Vanilla which I&#x27;m addicted to. Out of all the products I&#x27;ve bought, Pacifica&#x27;s is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s not as sweet and not quite as long lasting, but for the price it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fussy about scents. This one was not quite what I was expecting and realized I can&#x27;t wear it. This is disappointing, but  confirms I can&#x27;t buy perfumes without trying them on first.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get enough of the vanilla perfume from Pacifica!! It&#x27;s natural, every time I walk into a room I am asked, what are you wearing? &amp;#34;You smell amazing&amp;#34;! I got the roll on for my purse. I haven&#x27;t tried any other scents yet. But I&#x27;m staying with this one for a long time and it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
    <li> I Use This Perfume EveryDay I Love The It Smell It Smell So Nice And I Love Love Love The Smell Of Anything With Vanilla, In It I Hope This Love IS Heavenly Perfume Smell Just As Good. I Wish You Guy&#x27;s Carried More Gifts Set&#x27;s Though For Like $10.00 Dollars That Would Be A Big Help for Those Who Can&#x27;t Pay The Good Stuff. But Anyways Me And My Hubsand Love This Perfume I May Just Put Some On Tonight After I Take My Bath For Tonight.</li>
    <li> The bottle and box look just like the ad image but as it is a a Xmas gift have not opened the box or sampled the scent. I have a diminished sense of smell so I will have to let my daughter tell me if it smells of vanilla.</li>
    <li> Amazing service and natural smell of my woman. Buy direct though for free gifts. Service was fast and the product arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful.  It makes my mornings shine. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have tried this out at one of the local stores and loved it. I found the same perfume on amazon for cheaper. It has a wonnderful Vanilla smell, but be aware that when you spray it at first, it is almost too much, but as an hour or so goes by, it feels better. This is the best Vanilla Type perfume I have tried. I have other Pacifica perfumes, I love this Brand</li>
    <li> I war vanilla all the time, and have tried many different brands.  This is a great product, with a rich , long lasting vanilla....Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was not a huge vanilla perfume fan before I tried this fragrance. I had gotten it because my husband likes the smell of vanilla, and once I smelled this perfume, I have to admit I became a huge fan myself! And since Pacifica also makes another vanilla perfume, my favorite is to mix the two (this one is a little sweeter smelling than the other, but blended together it works very well!). I am considering getting this as gifts for friends for Christmas this year. Definitely worth the try and the money!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this perfume!  It is the quintessential vanilla fragrance - not too dark, not too strong, not too &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34;.  A very lovely vanilla fragrance for people who like vanilla but don&#x27;t like very heavy fragrance.  I will definitely be ordering this again - actually, this is the second bottle I have ordered from this seller.  :)</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most fragrance, so it has been year, YEARS!, since I have been able to wear perfume. I saw this on display in a local store, and I fellow shopper assured me that she is able to wear Pacifica&#x27;s fragrance even though she has a fragrance allergy, too. I&#x27;ve been wearing this daily for a month now with no rashes or irritation. I love that I can wear fragrance again, and I&#x27;m in love with the Island Vanilla fragrance. In the store, the Indian Coconut (or whatever) was a close second for me. They are both &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; fragrances. I ended up going with the vanilla because my husband tries to get me wear vanilla extract out of the bottle (he loves vanilla that much)! The vanilla of this is also more complex than your usual vanilla fragrance, and I&#x27;m contributing that to its &amp;#34;naturalness.&amp;#34; I feel so much better about wearing this than I ever did about wearing fragrance before I developed the fragrance allergy because this time I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals on my skin.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this perfume out, someone comments on how good I smell and asks what it is. I&#x27;ve started ordering it online since Sephora stopped carrying Pacifica products (at least the one near me did). The fact that I like it enough to hunt it down says it all, it seriously smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing!  And customer service is 100%!  I had a problem with a bottle and they sent me a brand new bottle for no charge!  They are amazing and their products smell sooooo good!</li>
    <li> LOVELY SMELL.PITY MY HUSBAND CANT EVEN NOTICE IT ON ME 10 MINUTES LATER.&lt;br /&gt;WHOOSH! YOU CATCH A SHORT WHIFF OF IT AND THEN IT EVAPORATES AND IS GONE.&lt;br /&gt;APPARENTLY ALL COMMERCIAL FRAGRANCES MADE WITHOUT SOME NATURAL OILS DO THIS BUT THIS ONE TAKES THE CAKE!</li>
    <li> I love this warm vanilla smell! Is is a great dupe for La Vanilla which is $50+ a bottle. :-)</li>
    <li> lovely, lovely fragrance in a delicate beautiful little bottle - a perfect gift for yourself or any girl or woman you love!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic longer wearing version of the roll-on applicator. LOVE it!! just a couple of spritzes in the morning and the fragrance lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This perfume is great. It is very sweet smelling with a hint of flowers. It is not the kind of vanilla that smells like food which is a good thing for me. I have read other reviews that comment on how this perfume has no staying power. Well most natural perfumes do not because they do not contain the harmful chemicals that are used so the perfume will stay on your skin for a long time. I am not disapointed with how long it stays on my skin. If I apply it in the morning, at lunch I can still catch a whiff of it. I purchased the rollerball so I can keep it in my purse to reapply when needed.</li>
    <li> It smells so simple but yet not cheap like some other vanilla perfumes I&#x27;ve smelled. I definitely love it and will buy more!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell of this! It comes brand new as described!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume!</li>
    <li> I get compliments. I use this with the Pacifica Island Body Butter in the same scent. I am so happy to have found a perfume blended with essential and natural oils-  No parabens, animal testing, animal ingredients or artificial colors.  100% VEGAN and Gluten-free. And the scent is fabulous!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent so much!  I am literally addicted to it lol.  I can&#x27;t stop spraying it and everyone comments on it all the time.  The only thing I&#x27;d recommend is buying it directly from Pacifica.  If you sign up for the email you get a code for a free coconut lip shimmer with a purchase of $25, they send you samples with your purchase and there are usually good combo packs or sales going on as well.  If Amazon ever gets this listed under $20 with Prime for free shipping then I&#x27;d say buy it here, otherwise head on over to Pacifica for a couple freebies and better selection.  :)</li>
    <li> Please, keep in mind, perfumes work good on some people, and others, it&#x27;s just not their cup of tea, don&#x27;t take this review as a \\&quot;This one says it&#x27;s not good, I&#x27;m not gonna buy it\\&quot; each person&#x27;s unique fragrance preferences is something that you need to explore for yourself, and not take what others say to heart too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, onto the review. Packaging was nice, nice design on the bottle. Honestly, I feel it&#x27;s a little.. Plain. But for the cost of the perfume, I feel like they could&#x27;ve bumped up the bottle to make it a bit more.. Presentable. Box is great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the perfume.. Is... Not my favourite, I didn&#x27;t smell vanilla in this, I got a very heavy chemical scent, same way with the lotions and roll on perfume stick, it&#x27;s sandalwood I know, but.. They just made it so strong and with a couple other scents they have in the base notes, it makes it smell like a heavy chemical, it&#x27;s VERY over-bearing. Now, I said I didn&#x27;t smell vanilla, I didn&#x27;t, but I did feel it, it made my skin warm, and it smelt warm. But, I couldn&#x27;t get past that chemical scent. It could just be that it doesn&#x27;t work well on me, that&#x27;s probably the case here, just have to move on to the next perfume. :3 But, I&#x27;d definantly try this, it&#x27;s worth it ladies, and if you don&#x27;t like it, give it to someone, it makes a great gift. (that&#x27;s what I did lol) and if you don&#x27;t like it, oh well, it&#x27;s worth the money if only to be given as a gift. And if you don&#x27;t like it, onto the next perfume ;D find your signature scent that makes everyone go crazy over you &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> Great smell that last all day.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this perfume!  I&#x27;ll ne buying more!</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail and was surprised at how wonderful it smells! It is the most intoxicating blend of vanilla that is long lasting and all natural! I am going to order this for all my female family members come holiday time! It is amazing and I highly recommend this scent!</li>
    <li> This smells soooo good! :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a natural yet gourmand creamy sweet vanilla! :)&lt;br /&gt;And Pacifica is always animal friendly/cruelty free! Yay! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, and shipping was lightning fast too! thank you! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace :)</li>
    <li> It is definitely vanilla.  My 6yr said he smelled cookies after I put it on.  I tend to be very sensitive to scents, but this one is pleasant.  Not overpowering.  I seems to last about 3hrs for others, but I could smell it on myself for longer.  I would buy it again.  I would also like to try Pacifica&#x27;s other scents now too!</li>
    <li> I am not opposed to the smell of this perfume, it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple hours.</li>
    <li> This light Vanilla fragrance is perfect for an otherwise &amp;#34;non-perfume wearer.&amp;#34; It is perfect as a gift for a teenager who is just starting to wear fragrance as well as for an older woman who wants to make sure her perfume isn&#x27;t overwhelming others.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, but it vanished so fast it do not last. Other than that I think it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Warning: people will sniff you when you wear this. The scent is light and sweet and perfect for spring or summer. I carry one in my purse and keep one at home. In love.</li>
    <li> This perfume was nice and delivery was just as it was proposed.  It&#x27;s too bad these vegan products have to be quite as expensive as they are but it was a gift for my &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; granddaughter and she liked it so that is all that matters.</li>
    <li> I love this vanilla! Simple but soft and very unique!</li>
    <li> Sweet and warm vanilla scent.  Not too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t last for more than 6 hours I would guess.  I tried the roll on perfume, and I believe the scent lasts longer than the spray.  If you ever tried Philosophy&#x27;s Sweet Cream and thought that was too sweet, you might like Pacifica&#x27;s vanilla one.</li>
    <li> I love vanilla, but today I put this on and can&#x27;t smell much, somewhat disappointed, I compare this to sunshine brand all natural from luckyvitamin.com, I paid 3.98 for and the sunshine vanilla is pure natural , would not buy again.</li>
