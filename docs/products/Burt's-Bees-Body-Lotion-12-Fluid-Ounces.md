### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this lotion is awesome.</li>
      <li>Amazon was wonderful as always though and let me return it.</li>
      <li>Awesome price!  </li>
      <li>This works great!</li>
      <li>This stuff truly is great.  </li>
      <li>Great, non-greasy moisture.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great price for a product that is \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Truly great product.  </li>
      <li>But for a lotion that doesn&#x27;t have parabens or pthalates it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, as with all things it isn&#x27;t all good.  </li>
      <li>Really good product and good for people with allergies.</li>
      <li>It smells GOOD and moisturizes all day as well</li>
      <li>it smells good and works good</li>
      <li>but it always seems to be on the surface unless I spend a good amount of time rubbing it in.</li>
      <li>Face to toes, good to go.  </li>
      <li>good feel to this cream</li>
      <li>My nice gave me a bottle of this to try for my psoriasis.  </li>
      <li>My legs have a nice dew-like, non-sticky feel to them hours after using.</li>
      <li>I really liked it</li>
      <li>I liked about this</li>
      <li>Honestly?</li>
      <li>Upon receiving this product, I opened the bottle to smell it and found the light aroma pleasant.</li>
      <li>Love this unscented lotion, it absorbs nicely and keeps the skin hydrated.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an OK moisturizer, does not smell good and on mine the straw on the pump kept becoming unattached.</li>
      <li>Feels ok on my hands, legs, &amp; face.</li>
      <li>like now, except snow:)  14 degrees.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did, click add to cart and get it done.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but with this being the go to place for many to find reviews, I&#x27;ll write one here.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did, click add to cart and get it done.  </li>
      <li>Smooth skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better results from cheap, off-brand cocoa-butter.</li>
      <li>It does not have an odor,except of the natural ingredients, and that&#x27;s a great benefit for someone like me</li>
      <li>Excellent lotion, however pump bottles often turn into a pain to use half to 2/3 of the way along, making me want to switch to the costlier tubes.</li>
      <li>That is fine, not every moisturizer is for every skin type.  </li>
      <li>That is fine, not every moisturizer is for every skin type.  </li>
      <li>, their products have always been fantastic,</li>
      <li>While they are probably the top two ingredients worth looking for</li>
      <li>This mix is fragrance free</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and so far so good</li>
      <li>but they actually look pretty good now!  </li>
      <li>I prefer using straight coconut oil for moisturizing, but this is great in a pinch travelling or when I don&#x27;t have time to let natural coconut oil set into my skin.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting a full bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell just something that makes me feel queasy.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this is a good product for dry skin.</li>
      <li>The scent thankfully dissipates after a couple of hours on you, but frankly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really catch on to the stink until my natural body heat made it warm up (like our bodies to with fragrances and perfumes).</li>
      <li>I thought to myself that this was something worth trying.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found better prices at the store and actually have moved to a more natural body lotion.</li>
      <li>This lotion has great moisturizing qualities, and I know it says that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but it smells like tar and urine mixed together, which is unfortunate because it really is a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
      <li>My skin feels better than I can remember (and in the dead of winter!)...very pleased.</li>
      <li>I have to work quickly because it absorbs FAST.  </li>
      <li>And only after a few days...to say I&#x27;m impressed would be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even using it on my face right now until can find more of their facial product&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed upon opening this bottle was the smell.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products; this one works if used regularly.  </li>
      <li>I use this product multiple times every day, mostly on hands and feet.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients and not chemicals is what makes it better than most other products out there.</li>
      <li>After so many years of using moisturizers that either didn&#x27;t work or made the dryness worse this is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Even this discounted 3 pack is around 1 dollar an ounce and lets face it 6oz goes pretty fast when you are using it from head to toe.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t worry too much about smelling funny.</li>
      <li>I try to make my own lotion, but this is the somewhat less chemical-filled version that I use as a compromise when I don&#x27;t have any made on hand.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker, more cream-like, but absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I would be willing to live with it if this were nice lotion, but frankly, it leaves my skin feeling greasy, and slightly sticky until I wash it off.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to explain it.</li>
      <li>It absorbs fast - so even after immediately applying it, you can touch paper without leaving a greasy spot on the paper.</li>
      <li>I also really like that it has no added fragrance.</li>
      <li>very pleased.and</li>
      <li>Look out summer, i&#x27;m ready.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
      <li>Not only has the itchiness stopped but my skin looks smooth and has a pleasing sheen to it.  </li>
      <li>, I thought smooth skin was a thing of the past, but not with Burt&#x27;s Bees Shea Butter &amp; Vitamin E Fragrance Free Body Lotion.  </li>
      <li>Lastly, it takes a lot of work to spread it out on my skin and I have to work quickly because it absorbs FAST.  </li>
      <li>Sure it sinks into the skin and leaves it soft, it smells like HAIR DYE!</li>
      <li>I needed a dye free, gentle, natural product and Burt&#x27;s Bees delivers, and I only have two complaints.</li>
      <li>Better complexion, smoother skin, less clogged pores than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Once you rub it into your skin, that aroma fades quickly and my skin was left soft and feeling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin feels better than I can remember (and in the dead of winter!)...</li>
      <li>The odor was only detectable to me for the first couple of uses.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s overwhelming, and not at all like the usual unscented products I buy; I was not smelling the natural ingredients, just chemicals.</li>
      <li>The first is that the smell the lotion has is rubbery and synthetic, however the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger long</li>
      <li>The second is that the lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s sensitive to fragrances.</li>
      <li>If you leave it in one place too long it will absorb too much there and leave that part of your skin feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>If you leave it in one place too long it will absorb too much there and leave that part of your skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then it would spread to my other dry zones which is pretty much my whole body at this</li>
      <li>Highly recommend especially if you have dry sensitive skin!!</li>
      <li>I like this lotion because it&#x27;s thick and fragrance free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Every year I try several different moisturizers with little success.  </li>
      <li>only complaint about this product is that the bottle I received was only about 2/3rds full.</li>

<li> even on very very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have normal skin you may find the smell a little off-putting, the cost too high, and difficult to spread it evenly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion multiple times.  I prefer using straight coconut oil for moisturizing, but this is great in a pinch travelling or when I don&#x27;t have time to let natural coconut oil set into my skin.  My legs have a nice dew-like, non-sticky feel to them hours after using.</li>
    <li> My nice gave me a bottle of this to try for my psoriasis.  It along with my prescription worked.  Smooth skin! Yea! Fifty with psoriasis, I thought smooth skin was a thing of the past, but not with Burt&#x27;s Bees Shea Butter &amp; Vitamin E Fragrance Free Body Lotion.  Look out summer, i&#x27;m ready.</li>
    <li> although it claims to be fragrance-free and technically I could not describe/name the smell that the lotion emits (something between chemicals and medicinal) it nevertheless has some sort of odor that is not pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is a cut and paste from the review I wrote for the 6oz tube of the same product (note, this is for the Shea and Vitamin E version):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every winter I go through the same thing.  It starts on my calves.  They get so dry that I itch them (even in my sleep) and they inevitably get bloody and scabbed up (I know, it is gross).  Then it would spread to my other dry zones which is pretty much my whole body at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year I try several different moisturizers with little success.  In particular I find that the average lotion quits working after just a few hours and my skin begins to get dry again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, on a whim, I picked up the Bert&#x27;s Bees chapstick at a local pharmacy.  I really liked it so I thought \\&quot;let me try their moisturizer\\&quot;.  Then I saw this one which says it lasts 24 hours.  I thought to myself that this was something worth trying.  Frankly I don&#x27;t know how they do it but this lotion truly does last up to 24 hours...even on very very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of use the red blotchyness on my skin (my hands and arms in particular) has receded.  The scabs (from the scratching) are all healing and I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling to my skin anymore.  After so many years of using moisturizers that either didn&#x27;t work or made the dryness worse this is amazing.  Not only has the itchiness stopped but my skin looks smooth and has a pleasing sheen to it.  I never ever thought the back of my hands would look like anything other than a troll monster from under a bridge but they actually look pretty good now!  And only after a few days...to say I&#x27;m impressed would be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as with all things it isn&#x27;t all good.  The smell of the lotion is not great.  It is by no means bad but at least to me it smells a little odd.  Also, it is expensive.  Even this discounted 3 pack is around 1 dollar an ounce and lets face it 6oz goes pretty fast when you are using it from head to toe.  Lastly, it takes a lot of work to spread it out on my skin and I have to work quickly because it absorbs FAST.  If you leave it in one place too long it will absorb too much there and leave that part of your skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that I don&#x27;t think this lotion is for everyone.  IF you have really bad dry skin I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you have normal skin you may find the smell a little off-putting, the cost too high, and difficult to spread it evenly.  That is fine, not every moisturizer is for every skin type.  But seriously, if you have really bad dry skin and have \\&quot;tried everything\\&quot; not so fast--try this product.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did, click add to cart and get it done.

    <li> The pump does not work.  The scent is so bad my cat won&#x27;t come near me.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my long-standing favorites to use from Burt&#x27;s Bees. It absorbs fast - so even after immediately applying it, you can touch paper without leaving a greasy spot on the paper. It does not have an odor,except of the natural ingredients, and that&#x27;s a great benefit for someone like me that&#x27;s sensitive to fragrances. The odor was only detectable to me for the first couple of uses. It&#x27;s a great price for a product that is \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried others such as Avalon Organics Baby Nourishing Baby Lotion and it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Milk and Honey. This particular lotion has an odd smell to it.</li>
    <li> good feel to this cream</li>
    <li> This stuff truly is great.  Works for everything.  Face to toes, good to go.  Better complexion, smoother skin, less clogged pores than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Truly great product.  The only thing I couldn&#x27;t wrap my head around for the first few days is that I seriously did think it smelled like urine.  I almost quit using it but nobody else said I smelled like pee when asking.  Maybe 5-7 days in I couldn&#x27;t notice any bad smell any longer.</li>
    <li> Wanted a EWG approved unscented lotion to add essential oils to. This works great!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it&#x27;s thick and fragrance free. I needed a dye free, gentle, natural product and Burt&#x27;s Bees delivers, and I only have two complaints. The first is that the smell the lotion has is rubbery and synthetic, however the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger long so I don&#x27;t worry too much about smelling funny. The second is that the lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb very well. It is thick and moisturizes well but it always seems to be on the surface unless I spend a good amount of time rubbing it in. Otherwise, this is a good product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed upon opening this bottle was the smell. The awful, chemical, something-has-gone-terribly-wrong smell. It&#x27;s overwhelming, and not at all like the usual unscented products I buy; I was not smelling the natural ingredients, just chemicals. The scent thankfully dissipates after a couple of hours on you, but frankly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;  I would be willing to live with it if this were nice lotion, but frankly, it leaves my skin feeling greasy, and slightly sticky until I wash it off. I&#x27;ve had better results from cheap, off-brand cocoa-butter. I&#x27;ve never before been let down by Burt&#x27;s Bees, their products have always been fantastic, hence my deep disappointment with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;  Honestly? Save your money, buy something else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this lotion was past it&#x27;s use by date or if it is just a stinky lotion.  Was supposed to have been fragrance free but the smell was sickening.  Amazon was wonderful as always though and let me return it.</li>
    <li> Really good product and good for people with allergies.</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion made me sick to my stomach. I don&#x27;t really know how to explain it. It must&#x27;ve been the vitamin E because Shea Butter doesn&#x27;t smell that weird. It&#x27;s not a bad smell just something that makes me feel queasy.</li>
    <li> I try to make my own lotion, but this is the somewhat less chemical-filled version that I use as a compromise when I don&#x27;t have any made on hand.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found better prices at the store and actually have moved to a more natural body lotion. It does not have any fragrance and I do appreciate that</li>
    <li> This lotions smells terrible. It&#x27;s like burning rubber, used cooking oil, something chemically and dirty. I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;ve used a lot of fragrance-free lotions and all of them have a slight scent, but nothing nasty like this.</li>
    <li> this lotion is awesome. it smells good and works good</li>
    <li> I use the product when I feel my legs are starting to itch and the lotion takes care of my problem.  I have tried many products; this one works if used regularly.  No suffering for me this winter.  Thanks for the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and so far so good</li>
    <li> It says fragrance free, yet it still smell bad. Feels ok on my hands, legs, &amp; face. But it is STINKY</li>
    <li> This stuff is the rave from my wife. It smells GOOD and moisturizes all day as well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK moisturizer, does not smell good and on mine the straw on the pump kept becoming unattached. It was not fun to try and use it this way, frustrating, but product was OK.</li>
    <li> This lotion does leave my skin soft and moisturized all day, but it&#x27;s very thick and takes awhile to rub in.  It also leaves my skin sticky even when it&#x27;s rubbed in well.  But for a lotion that doesn&#x27;t have parabens or pthalates it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but with this being the go to place for many to find reviews, I&#x27;ll write one here. It smells TERRIBLE! Sure it sinks into the skin and leaves it soft, it smells like HAIR DYE! It has a horrible ammonia like stench that would come from a store bought kit of hair color. Absolutely disgusting and now my whole body smells like it. It didn&#x27;t really catch on to the stink until my natural body heat made it warm up (like our bodies to with fragrances and perfumes). Man, what a waste and so disappointing.</li>
    <li> Even using it on my face right now until can find more of their facial product&#x27;s.  Easier to use.  Live in CO; weather&#x27;s are harsh &amp; dry...like now, except snow:)  14 degrees.</li>
    <li> This lotion has great moisturizing qualities, and I know it says that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but it smells like tar and urine mixed together, which is unfortunate because it really is a great moisturizer. I took away two stars solely because of the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this product, I opened the bottle to smell it and found the light aroma pleasant. Nothing at all like some of the reviews I read. Once you rub it into your skin, that aroma fades quickly and my skin was left soft and feeling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that the bottle I received was only about 2/3rds full. I was expecting a full bottle.</li>
    <li> I had ordered foot lotion got this instead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it anyway and it definitely helped my feet but will order foot lotion from now on and hopefully I will get what I ordered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this is that it is not greasy and it has no fragrance</li>
    <li> Only lotion I use!  No odor, not oily!  Awesome price!  Can&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else!  Highly recommend especially if you have dry sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> Love this unscented lotion, it absorbs nicely and keeps the skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> I use this product multiple times every day, mostly on hands and feet.  I keep one bottle by the bathroom sink and one by bed.  It&#x27;s a little thicker, more cream-like, but absorbs quickly.  I also really like that it has no added fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great, non-greasy moisture.  The fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients and not chemicals is what makes it better than most other products out there.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion, however pump bottles often turn into a pain to use half to 2/3 of the way along, making me want to switch to the costlier tubes.</li>
    <li> Have you ever wondered whether cocoa butter or Shea butter was the way to go? While they are probably the top two ingredients worth looking for I can tell you that for skin application I prefer Shea butter due to the fact that it is non-greasy and will not clog up your pours. This mix is fragrance free and it&#x27;s from Bert&#x27;s Bees which tend to manufacture above average products.</li>
