    <li> i love covergirl clean pressed powder! no problems with it what so ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked covergirl pressed powder but haven&#x27;t used it in quite a few years. Glad the quality is still good!</li>
    <li> I love this color, and the smell is refreshing.  Case is a little hard to open.</li>
    <li> This is the best price I have found for this product. Packaged well, and the exact color I bought at the store, just cheaper. Love it.</li>
    <li> Cover Girl still has it going on!  I have tried many, many cosmetic brands over the years.  Did I say MANY?  Like every product on the market, I am sure!  I loved the Chanel packaging and their products.  I was faithful with Lancome, Este Lauder, and many others, while my roommate was a Este Lauder Cosmetic Rep.  I have been fooled into QVC products, felt obligated to purchase after attending home make-up parties, and even signed up to receive monthly products from online subscription opportunities.  The TRUTH of the matter, although some products are all natural, while others are loaded with chemicals....NONE of them have EVER made me look prettier, more radiant, more attractive, whatever you are lead to believe.  I finally wised up....I realized that no amount of money spent on cosmetics was going to make me ANY more attractive than the less expensive brands.  Yes, they will definitely try to sway you with a fancy and believable marketing advertisement, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t looking any different.  I could only see a difference when I allowed them (make-up reps.) to layer me up...if you know what I mean!  But, then I would feel too made up, or like a stage girl.  So, I am happy to use Cover Girl powder.  It does what it says, it is available in so many shades for different times of the year, it is certainly cost effective, and I have zero complaints!</li>
    <li> This is really the best face powder I have used in years!!! Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I use pressed powder to help set my face after I apply my foundation to help reduce the oil seeping through during the day.  This is a little lighter than I expected, but it still does the trick.  This does have a powdery smell to me, but not anything that is too strong.  I dab a little on my nose, chin, and T-zone and I am good to go.  This is great to carry in your pocket book when you need to touch up as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but there is something wrong with the ones I got from amazon. The powder is so hard and caked in that nothing comes off on the pad. The ones I purchase locally in the stores do not have that issue. These have either been stored wrong or are defective.</li>
    <li> Feels good on. Not oily</li>
    <li> I loved it, perfect color</li>
    <li> Excellent productand they came in their original cover. Physically ok...</li>
    <li> I like Cover girl products, and this powder is very nice.  It covers well and goes on easily.</li>

    <li> I love the product and have used it since 1962;&lt;br /&gt;however, with the newer container, I have great&lt;br /&gt;difficulty opening it....I really prefer the older rounded edge containers.&lt;br /&gt;they open much, much easier.</li>
    <li> The only thing I can use on my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> It is for clear skin. Pleasant smell.</li>
