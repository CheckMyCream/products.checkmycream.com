<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife loves this cologne for me and she wears the Pleasures for Women. It is a light fragrance which lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because I love the fresh clean scent but it smells masculine at the same time--I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the scent, therefore I love the scent.</li>
    <li> The  Girlfriend loves  it !  What more matters than that !!  I like  it as well.  Just wish it was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband love my Pleasure fragrance. I bought this for him once he used it up.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent and original. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite cologne. Description of the product was on point. This is the real deal and not one of those watered down cologne people trying to sell of the street. Will buy another from seller when I run out.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes. I love the fresh citrus smell and get compliments every time I wear it. The smell seems to last all day. I love it.</li>
    <li> Fast and original. Love it</li>
    <li> FAKE!!!, Normaly I don´t leave any reviews on products and less if it is a negative one, but i can´t pass this one. The perfume I would say is FAKE it has not real scent like the original one, the really sad part comes when you pay full price for it believing it´s the real one, I use it in the morning and after a couple of hours the smell disappear completely, DO NOT BUY IT!! and save yourself all the bad experience.</li>
    <li> Super quick shipment-smells wonderful!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love the light scent of this colonge and have gotten several compliments from strangers about it.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my husband. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Great.  Arrived right away</li>
    <li> This is one of my signature fragrances that never fails to garner compliments wherever I go.  I feel it&#x27;s versatile enough to wear for work or play.  Great sillage and projection, lasts for several hours on my skin and clothing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pleasures Cologne for years now and it is not overpowering or not too light, it&#x27;s just right for my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I kind of feel this isn&#x27;t a genuine item because the color is a little darker than what I recall. It also feels like it&#x27;s a lighter version of what I recall. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it Could be a change in the production but either way, something is different.</li>
    <li> Good sized bottle of good smelling stuff. Glad to find this on Amazon for so cheap - will def buy again in four years when I run out.</li>
    <li> When the product was received - I didn&#x27;t notice it was a fake.  Box printed by Lauder - not Estée Lauder.&lt;br /&gt;Product Smells good</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cologne, my husband really likes it. It&#x27;s not too musky and is rather light, but delicious smelling :)</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Man, this shipment of the Pleasures Cologne I received was fast.  It was truely a pleasure of ordering this product.  I will most definetely be ordering again.\\&quot;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fella for Christmas. We both love it. The bottle will last awhile and it is a fresh manly scent....not over powering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments on this scent since I switched from a different brand.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne. It is strong enough to be noticed but not overpowering for me. It is a lighter, more flowery men&#x27;s scent but girls always tell me I smell great and ask about the scent. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years and I still love it. It&#x27;s a very pleasant and light scent. In my opinion the best cologne you can get; better than any cologne that costs twice as much.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne. And the 3.4 oz is big enough that it won&#x27;t run out in less than 6 months. Guys,im an ugly dude and women compliment me when im wearing this.</li>
    <li> Great product! I would highly recommend this to others looking for a similar item.  Item was exactly as described in the product info portion of the listing!</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have ordered this product through Amazon since discovering they had the best prices, almost by half, compared to that of a chain store like Macys, J.C Penny, etc.  I was paying $70 w/ tax per bottle for a long time.  I know for a guy it is important to have \\&quot;your\\&quot; smell and other options but my wife met me when I was wearing this and she only prefers that I wear Pleasures because she says its \\&quot;me\\&quot;.  Love this stuff.  Give it a try.  You will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> My dad loves wearing this fragrance.  He is very pleased with it.  Why do I need to put more words to make a review.  It makes no sense.</li>
    <li> Got it as a Christmas gift to my husband, he loves it, it&#x27;s one of those classic and old colognes. Yet the smell is so good!</li>
    <li> This is a FAKE product.  It has a yellow tinge and does not have a scent.  Do not buy this product!  This is the first time I have ever been disappointed with Amazon for a purchase.  I had gone by the reviews and thought I was safe.</li>
    <li> Good price, good product</li>
    <li> Gift for my dad.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne, well-priced, great service!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because it is his favorite cologne.  We looked for it in the store and the prices were to high so to amazon we went looking and that same bottle was $30 less. The scent of the cologne is unmistakable and extremely &#x27;yummy&#x27; (as i like to descibe it). Worth every penny. Any lady looking for an amazing cologne for your significant other- you have found it! And for men looking to find a cologne that won&#x27;t chock the life out of the people around you but still want to smell amazing all day- here it is! Plus the bottle last forever. With everyday usage, his bottle can last for 6 months with the 3.2 oz.</li>
    <li> Not so sure this is full quality stuff</li>
    <li> Fantastic fragrance, especially during summer/warm months. I&#x27;ve worn it for years. It is a light, yet full-bodied scent. It will bring many compliments your way if you wear it. Definitely one to try if you haven&#x27;t! (Can&#x27;t go wrong with the Lauder fragrances!)</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was an item I&#x27;ve used for many years - and the Amazon online price was most appealing.  My concern is that in the past the color of the liquid was totally CLEAR - but this item has a slight discoloration. There is a slight \\&quot;yellowing\\&quot; of the liquid.  Thus, my question:  Is this the original Estee Lauder product - or could it be something else?</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff for years now. Ive been looking for it for years. Amazon came thru with a good price.Sooo satisfied.</li>
    <li> Recipient enjoyed this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item.  Packaging &amp; authenticity all excellent.  Will definitely continue to order from this vendor!</li>
    <li> The cologne is the exact on I bought from a big box store at a $20.00 savings. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Pleasures is one of the only male scents created by Estee Lauder, but it is masculine in a way that is not overpowering. It smells like a nice blind of citrus with some spice smell and fragrant wood. I&#x27;ve used this cologne for ages, the only dislikes being that the bottle it comes in isn&#x27;t very attractive or functional. Also, it runs out over time and you need to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to a guy that wants to smell nice without that overpowering &#x27;sport&#x27; scent</li>
    <li> Best smelling medium cost cologne on the market. If your not sure if he will like it or not, just pick this one</li>
    <li> Great product have used before would highly recommend. Will not be disappointed. Always get compliments when I use it, Buy it you will enjoy</li>
    <li> Very nice cologne. Beyond Paradise has always been a favorite and was sad to see it go. This is a great replacement. Fast shipping. Will do more business.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne that I have used since I was given a spray bottle over 20 years ago. The fragrance is mild but with a lasting attraction for others to enjoy. Try it and enjoy the results.</li>
    <li> Will be yours once you try it. This is my third bottle in 10 years. It goes a long way. Always get comments that I smell good. Got it as a present the first two times. Had to break down and buy it myself this time. The price here is a lot lower than department stores.</li>
    <li> This is the 3 bottle I&#x27;ve bought for my husband. This smells soooo good!!!! Last a long time too and a little goes a long way. This by far is the best price I&#x27;ve found this cologne for. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Do not know why it is called &amp;#34;decoded&amp;#34; but when I opened the box, cologne is a slight yellow color rather than clear appearance? Fragrance isn&#x27;t exactly the same smell either...purcgased online before but this isu trust disappointment</li>
    <li> Gave it to my husband as a gift and he really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy the other version for myself.</li>
    <li> I Love this fragrance!! Classic, a perfect scent for a man not too harsh at all and not feminine. Perfect</li>
    <li> Worn this colgne for YEARS.  When good stuff, people comment daily how great it smells.  Not hearing any compliments.  Ordered a total of 6 bottles over last year and a half.  Always been great, but last couple simply smell like alcohol and lack any scent -- certainly not the real stuff. All from Perfumes World.  All but one order showed shipped by Amazon, but one showed OxKom and labeled decoded on bottom of box.  I&#x27;ve now opened 3 (THREE!) And the does not have a scent!</li>
    <li> Love Estee cologne for men...Lauder for men is good stuff also:)</li>
    <li> The perfect smell i was looking for. has a fresh sent. not to spicy or overwhelming. my girlfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> This order was made to replace a favorite cologne, and the bottle size and price point were the best I could find anywhere. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> New fragrance, like it a lot, one of the few I have found that I can smell on me.  My body seems to absorb other fragrances.</li>
    <li> i assume those of u wanting to buy this kno wut this cologne is? if not, then why&#x27;re u buying on a whim? anyhow. this cologne smells great. enough said. and it is the genuine product.</li>
    <li> I use the Pleasure for Women. My husband love this fragrance and use my one daily.  I order this one for his own use.</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne. I&#x27;ve been looking for it everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find it which is good. I want something that&#x27;s rare and not many other people are wearing</li>
    <li> Been using since 1997.  The best.  Get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> Something especial for me</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling cologne&#x27;s I have ever tried!!</li>
    <li> So nice to be able to get my husbands favorite cologne online!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Scent! I Bought for My Husband.</li>
    <li> Something has changed as the cologne has hardly any scent. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Everyone tells my husband that he smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> It was just what I expected! Quick delivery at a great price</li>
    <li> This is my boyfriends favorite cologne and i think it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne! I have been using this since I was in college and my wife still loves it on me. My 2 daughters love it as well. The seller was quick to process it and ship it to me as well sell it to me at a better prince than the big retailers. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift this past holiday. Great quick shipping and a lovely, masculine scent appropriate for even the most manly of men.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I LOVE THE WAY HE SMELLS EVERYDAY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very light and clean, not a musky smell.  It has been one of my favorites for many years.  I don&#x27;t think you will go wrong if you purchase it.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne and the price was reasonable.  Received it a week after ordering it.  Would recommend the cologne and vendor.</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean, &amp; invigorating scent. I feel really good each day I put this cologne on. I sweat a lot and when I do on the job this cologne still stands out even after 8hours of work as a law enforcement officer. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne to put my best foot forward meeting a date from eHarmony.  She loved it.  We&#x27;re about to celebrate 1 year of wedded bliss.  So yeah, definitely recommended.  The cologne may not be responsible for that, but it sure didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Great smell,  same product that you pay in teh retail stores and about $15 cheaper.</li>
    <li> gets me ass...its great</li>
    <li> Pleasures has been my favorite for over 20 years now. It smells great, not as overpowering as some colognes for men</li>
    <li> my husband loves the cologne</li>
    <li> After nearly running out of my other colognes I decided to try Amazon to see what they had to offer when Pleasures came up. I decided to try it out even though I had no idea what to expect and I am glad that I did. The scent of this cologne is light enough to where a couple sprays isn&#x27;t overpowering. A lot of colognes are so powerful that more than one spray is unbearable but I find Pleasures to be the perfect weight. The scent is a fresh scent; somewhat airy yet masculine. I often get asked what I am wearing when out. This is more of a day cologne than a night cologne. As an ex-smoker I find that smoke covers up all cologne yet this one fights through and I could even smell it through old clothes that normally smell like an ashtray after a day. I definitely recommend this scent for any man, or any woman who wants their man to smell quite heavenly.</li>
    <li> I read all the good reviews and ordered Pleasures. Maybe it is just my nose but I do not find this scent as pleasing as everybody else did in the reviews. I have only worn it a few times and have since put it away. This is just me but I wouldent recommend this unless you go to a place that sells it and smell it first, I wish I would have been able to do that before I bought it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if its fake or its just not strong at all!! Never order it again so dispointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I am wild about this fragrance! It is has a clean, irresistible smell, and not at all overwhelming like some men&#x27;s fragrances tend to be.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who loves his Givenchy and Bulgari colognes and he loved this one as well. It smells very clean and sexy!</li>
    <li> ANOTHER KNOCK OFF!!!!</li>
    <li> best smell ever this was my fav cologne as a kid and i still love it and its a good price.</li>
    <li> He was very satisfied &amp; fascinated with the name-made a good gift from a well known name @ a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I think Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures for Men is the best FRESH scent from the 90&#x27;s, which let&#x27;s face it, was the FRESH decade. A bit of an unknown everyone knows the scent of &amp;#34;Cool Water&amp;#34; but not Pleasures for Men. Pleasures has a bit of that classic Coppertone Suntan lotion thing happening, which might be why I like it. Girls love it, I have get compliments all the time, they always want to know what scent I am wearing.  GFs like Pleasures, and it&#x27;s the only fresh fragrance they like to smell coming off. It&#x27;s light and, uhm, fresh. Fresh! Yeah, that&#x27;s it...FRESH! Perfect for the summer; or me...all the time.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical ordering online, but the scent is exactly the same as the ones I purchased full retail from the malls.  Lasts just as long too.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> be a ware of replica before buying this one!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance :)</li>
    <li> Very light fragrance. Definitely not a woody fragrance as described</li>
    <li> I like this Cologne and so does my Wife, that&#x27;s why I buy it. It has more of a subtle scent, people don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re still in the room an hour after you have left. Colognes and Perfumes are meant for the intimate partner, not the entire block. Amazon seems to have the best price.</li>
    <li> Ladies love Pleasures!!!</li>
    <li> Used Estee Lauder Pleasures for years.  Just the right cologne for me. A light citrus aroma, but not heavy.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pleasures for Men for at least a couple of decades and I thank Amazon for being able to get this product through them and always a speedy delivery!  Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been wearing this since my 20&#x27;s. Have gotten more compliments on the smell than I can count and the price on Amazon was better than at Macy&#x27;s. Light fragrance and smells great.</li>
    <li> Legit.. came quick...</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  It smells wonderful and he loves it.  He wears it every day.</li>
    <li> My wife always gives me a hug, and sometimes a kiss, when I squirt some of this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s worth the fat price.</li>
    <li> definitely my favorite, for all occasions.</li>
    <li> this is the only cologne that my husband will wear and has for many, many years. It lasts all day and is very memorable. I&#x27;m will definitely be ordering this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Great product! Was exactly what the description said that it was. Nothing less than I was expecting. Happy, happy, happy!!</li>
    <li> This is my husbands only cologne that he wears and its awesome. Smells really good. will buy again. It is cheaper on amazon that going into Dillards or Belk and purchasing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same product at half the price of my local department store. That makes it a no brainer for me!!</li>
    <li> This has been my husband favorite cologne for years.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for the 100ml size. Product ships fast. If you know which perfume you need this is the best way to shop for it since it ships for free as well.</li>
    <li> We are unable to find Pleasures cologne spray in the major department stores any longer.  We appreciate the opportunity to purchase it thru Amazon.  This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for my husband.  He seems to like it, and I think it&#x27;s a pleasant, light scent for a man.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle and it is fake.  The liquid is yellow and its normally clear.  It also smells different the the real stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER Beware!!!!!!!!!!!  Do not buy this!!  This is the first time I have been ripped off by amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne. Very clean smelling, light, not musky at all. Love smelling it on my man. I always make sure he has it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this cologne for a while, and it is a great one.  Fantastic for summer and day, or after a workout.  This scent makes you feel good and energetic upon application.  An exceptionally clean scent.  This is powerful, and lasts and projects longer than many of it&#x27;s genre, but I can&#x27;t see it bugging people, as it has the \\&quot;elevating, happy\\&quot; quality.  I wouldn&#x27;t put too many sprays of it on, however, because a spray or two is about all you need.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a highly recommended cologne I would (and likely will) buy again.  I don&#x27;t see this one disliked by anyone really, unless you have \\&quot;Axe bodyspray\\&quot; syndrome.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast processing order</li>
    <li> I purchased, having never been exposed to it before, based solely on the reviews I read.  Let me say, &amp;#34;No Two Noses Are Identical.&amp;#34;  That said, this sent is o.k., but not really along the lines of what I really like. It&#x27;s a bit, shall we say, &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34; smelling. Women may like it, which is why most men would purchase it in the first place, but I wouldn&#x27;t exactly consider it a manly scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If were living near a Macy&#x27;s I would have checked out a sample of it first. However, we don&#x27;t. Again, my review simple reflects my tastes (smell) in cologne.</li>
    <li> Great product that I use every weekend to change my fragrance.</li>
    <li> Prompt service. I have used this spray for years and found it to be great. Never over powering.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s (and my) favorite cologne and we haven&#x27;t been able to find it in an actual brick and mortar store for ages.  It arrived quickly and in good shape. No complaints.  Smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> He requested this because we could no longer locate it in the department stores. Now he&#x27;s out and I can&#x27;t remember which merchant I purchased it from. Great scent for my guy!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Would order it again.  Good service.</li>
    <li> Have used this for many many years.. Always compliments...very light and not overpowering My wife purchased this for me over 10 years ago..and is the only cologne that I use</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. Would order from this co. again.</li>
    <li> Pleasures for men is a good everyday use cologne.  It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you and it is just a nice smooth smell.</li>
