      <li>Love love this Great product for my long curly very curly hair scent is like grapes not too overpowering leaves my hair so soft and in place without feeling stiff</li>
      <li>The price on here is much higher.</li>
      <li>All I use it a finger tip and boom my hair does exactly what I want it too.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone on a natural hair journey as it leaves your hair soft and healthy looking.</li>

      <li>I have very coily hair that tends to poof.  </li>
      <li>This makes my hair very soft and my twist comes out pretty in the morning.</li>

      <li>If not employing the LOC method, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>it really makes my hair soft and shiny will keeping a frizz free loose curl look.  </li>
      <li>If you want uber moisturized hair that bring forth your normal curl pattern, then this is the product for you.</li>
      <li>It does not make the hair stiff which I love as well.</li>
      <li>First let me say, i&#x27;m surprised they charge so much for this product when its only $5 in family dollar.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype  within two hours</li>
      <li>but it hardly lives up to products that can really define and smooth curls.</li>
      <li>This stuff tightened my curl pattern, and made my hair incredibly soft, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I chose this product after using a sample that was provided at a natural hair expo.</li>
      <li>My hair was soft all day.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>Simple solution for curly hair without feeling heavy and weighted down plus a pleasant smell non greasy and not sticky</li>

      <li>the spiral curls  that hung at the back were not hard nor crusty</li>
      <li>I use it for my dry curly hair and it really defines my curls.</li>
      <li>Seen this product at a natural hair show in Orlando Florida, it makes your hair really soft, but it does not defy the curls enough for me.</li>
      <li>Using this product as the C in the LOC method of natural hair moisturizing, my hair is juicy and soft, and remains so for several days.</li>
      <li>Most other stuff I&#x27;ve tried is using either too thick and doesn&#x27;t do anything unless it&#x27;s fully wet, or too light and doesn&#x27;t actually absorb into my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m less than 24 hours natural (just got my relaxed ends cut today) and this is the first product I used.</li>
      <li>I found it at Dollar General for $5.</li>
      <li>It absorbs it well and my hair is moisturized and so soft and curly when I take my twists out the next day.</li>
      <li>When I opened the box the lids on each bottle were barely screwed on.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair too soft for my twist outs to last</li>
      <li>it also really left my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair was shiny and never dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have 4C hair, that&#x27;s coarse hair. And i started using this product and it did not help. It made my hair dryer,, I was looking for a moisturizer and this did not help. I would not be trying this product.</li>
    <li> This product right here is IT!  My hair is shiny and sooo curly! I have naturally curly hair but this products makes it soft and shiny the best I experienced so far. I have literally become a product junkie and this little product is all I need.  But I have to say that this price is RIDUCLOUS...I stumbled on this at Family Dollar Store for $4.50 right around my house, I&#x27;m going to make sure they are planning on selling this all the time unless I will be buying a case of it!</li>
    <li> I love this custard. I have 4C hair and no custard have given me the results like Aunt Jackie&#x27;s. I see curls from root to the end of my strands. It does not make the hair stiff which I love as well.</li>
    <li> Great!  Puts bounce into my curls. Also works great if you&#x27;re twisting your hair. I found it to be protectant against the heat and sand while I&#x27;m deployed.</li>
    <li> It has a good texture. I think it will work better on curly hair, not so great on wavy hair</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.  Smells delicious and the curls remain soft all day long.  Best to dampen your hair before applying.</li>
    <li> First let me say, i&#x27;m surprised they charge so much for this product when its only $5 in family dollar. I honestly would have been really upset if i would have paid more than that. As a African American with natural hair, i have tried to use it numerous ways, twist-outs, as a moisturizer for the LOC method...etc. the product is very light weight.  For a person who has thick course hair...i feel this is not the product to use. it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype  within two hours my hair felt dry. I guess with any product its either a hit or miss.  oh well...glad i only paid $5</li>
    <li> My hair is relaxed; however, my curl pattern is so strong that a relaxer cannot full straighten my hair. That being said, I do not naturally have kinky hair except for my edges in the front - I have three grades of hair on my head which range from course in the front, to mega-wavy/curly in the middle crown area and almost straight in the very back near the nape of my neck.  I like to use this when I go w/ my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look and it really makes my hair soft and shiny will keeping a frizz free loose curl look.  I use it directly after washing my hair while my hair is still soaking wet and I basically saturate my hair with the product and I think that&#x27;s they key w/ this product in order to make sure it thoroughly moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it, it was a great price so i was hoping for it to work but it didnt do a good job of defining my 4b curl..still on the hunt for a product that doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> It made my curls look great. My hair was soft all day. New favorite product. I didn&#x27;t have any the problems mentioned.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, and you can comb thru it with no white specks</li>
    <li> This custard is absolutely amazing! I used it over the summer, I have 3b/4a hair. I would Co-Wash my hair add Curl La La and let my hair air dry. My hair was shiny and never dry. It kept in the moisture.</li>
    <li> If you are mainly concerned about bending your hair into curls, spirals and shapes that it is not normally, then you may be unhappy with this product (as well as many others, actually). If you want uber moisturized hair that bring forth your normal curl pattern, then this is the product for you. Using this product as the C in the LOC method of natural hair moisturizing, my hair is juicy and soft, and remains so for several days. Juicy hair is curled-defined hair. If not employing the LOC method, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> my  mom bought bought this she has mixed feelings didn&#x27;t work for may be it is because of her hair texture(very kinky)</li>
    <li> I am not writing to inform how well this product will or will not define your curls, but I promise you it will make detangling your hair sooooo much easier whether your hair is wet or dry. It is probably a must have if you have children. Its important to apply the product and smooth it through before combing. Honestly you will love it for detangling after taking down braids or extensions as well. I think anyone can benefit from it regardless of your hair type, color, texture or condition. I gave it a four because one of the claims is that it will define curls, which is true to some extent but it hardly lives up to products that can really define and smooth curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m less than 24 hours natural (just got my relaxed ends cut today) and this is the first product I used. It is only $5.00 (yes...$5.00) at my local family dollar store (Deals) so I decided to try it since I had nothing to lose. Let me say, prior to putting this is my hair my curl definition was non existent. This stuff tightened my curl pattern, and made my hair incredibly soft, and moisturized. I can&#x27;t stop touching it. I&#x27;m going to have to pick up some more, because I have never had a natural hair product work AND be so affordable. I love my natural hair but with this stuff i love it even more...TRY IT!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I trust for my 3 year olds hair. She is mixed and this gives her hair the moisture it needs while helping it continue to grow.</li>
    <li> Really great for twist outs smells good!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to use for natural hair.  My daughter was very pleased.  I wil buy this again.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box the lids on each bottle were barely screwed on.  The product inside the bottles wa smeared all over as if these items had been used</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me or my daughters hair. It made my hair too soft for my twist outs to last and if you add any additional products to your hair (i.e.- gel or leave in conditioner) it will flake like crazy!! It took two washes for me to get the flakes out of my hair and hair brush! I really wanted to love this product because of the natural ingredients but I have to move on (sigh!)...</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does just what it says. It has helped with my curl definition. I am really glad I tried this product it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I especially like that you can use on dry hair and have no flaking day after day of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning and my hair loves this curl custard. It absorbs it well and my hair is moisturized and so soft and curly when I take my twists out the next day. I&#x27;ve tried other products and this one has had the best results for my twist outs. The price on here is much higher. I found it at Dollar General for $5.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. I use it for my dry curly hair and it really defines my curls. It smells really good and lasts me about a month or less sometimes (because i have a lot of hair). The product shipping and delivery process went pretty smoothly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good but it does in fact cause a lot of shrinkage, this product is best for being used with gel and a twist out</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing! Not worth drying out my 4b-4c curls though, so I will go back to my shea moisture products.</li>
    <li> Seen this product at a natural hair show in Orlando Florida, it makes your hair really soft, but it does not defy the curls enough for me. But it makes it manageable. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This product smells great!! This makes my hair very soft and my twist comes out pretty in the morning. My hair had less frizz.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! Curls hair very well and is very moisturizing and affordable. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> As the title says, I use this n my daughter&#x27;s type 4A/B hair for twist outs. I have type 4A hair, and my hair strongly dislikes this product....my daughter&#x27;s? LOVES it. When I used it in my son&#x27;s hair there was some flaking. I have notices that this product works best when paired with damp hair only. When the hair is dry or wet it does not work as well and will lead to flaking.</li>
    <li> Love love this Great product for my long curly very curly hair scent is like grapes not too overpowering leaves my hair so soft and in place without feeling stiff</li>
    <li> I have a low 360 wave-ish (lol) style haircut. This stuff is very light yet extremely powerful when it comes to moisturizing. My hair fully soaks this stuff up from bone dry. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used. Most other stuff I&#x27;ve tried is using either too thick and doesn&#x27;t do anything unless it&#x27;s fully wet, or too light and doesn&#x27;t actually absorb into my hair. All I use it a finger tip and boom my hair does exactly what I want it too.</li>
    <li> Simple solution for curly hair without feeling heavy and weighted down plus a pleasant smell non greasy and not sticky</li>
    <li> When I received this product is was everywhere.....I even initially asked for a refund.....my significant other who refuses to throw anything anyway capture most of it and got it back in the jar........I didn&#x27;t want to touch it......so I used it.....dry hair......wet hair.....whenever and for whatever :).......is allowed to be successfully and comfortably pull my natural hair up and the spiral curls  that hung at the back were not hard nor crusty( other Curl Custards results).....there is no flaking, no hardness ergo no ends shattering......they just have to get the packing corrected..............</li>
    <li> I have very coily hair that tends to poof.  I found that this product did not give me the hold I prefer or the definition I like. Since it also did not play well with other gels and stylers I had on hand, I was left with the soft hold which actually wasn&#x27;t so bad.  It gave me a soft, more natural hold that worked better on twist outs than wash and go styles. it also really left my hair soft.  I would buy it again for styling that did not require serious hold or definition.</li>
    <li> brought on a whim at my local beauty supply for $6.99. I&#x27;ve tried this product 5x and each time I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I used on twist outs. Curl La La left my hair soft but dry at the same time. Used on dry and wet hair and each time I returned to my old faithful, hawiiaan silky activator gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I noticed my hair was full of flakes which prompted me to write my review. I&#x27;m tossing my Curl La La for something with proven results.</li>
    <li> i love the scent and it leaves my hair soft</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. This product works beautifully. I use it when my hair is dry and it expands to nice coils. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The curling custard is amazing.  My curls are moisturized, not frizzy and beautiful!  Give this product a try the next time you twist or braid your hair.  I didn&#x27;t care for the Don&#x27;t Shrink Flaxseed gel.  Everytime I tried it, it left a lot of residue and weighed my hair down.</li>
    <li> This gave me the best twist out on my recently BCed hair. My hair is extremely thick and often dry. My hair soaked this product up and it left a nice softness and shine. As I twisted my hair I noticed the twist were so nice and plump I actually could have worn the twist in my hair. I loved the result and I hope my hair continues to love it.</li>
    <li> Leaves flakes in my hair</li>
    <li> I chose this product after using a sample that was provided at a natural hair expo. The results were great on wet or dry hair and easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone on a natural hair journey as it leaves your hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> love it....especially for the price</li>
    <li> Love this I have 4a/b/c hair and my curls pop especially after washing my hair.</li>
