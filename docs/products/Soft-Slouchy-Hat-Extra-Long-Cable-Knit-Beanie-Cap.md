    <li> I was looking for a hat that could cover my somewhat big head :P I guess it&#x27;s not as big as I thought because this hat looked huge on  me. I had to fold it a bit so I could see what was going on around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty though and kept my head warm, but could have been better.</li>
    <li> I have a small head and unfortunately this slides down easily onto my forehead. Rolling it helps but then it doesn&#x27;t look as nice.</li>
    <li> what I got was nothing like the one shown, since I threw out the shipping documents I couldn&#x27;t return it. not happy with it.</li>
    <li> love it, its so soft and comfortable.</li>

    <li> What a great hat! Kept me warm on a cold and blustery day but looked good too! Everyone in cold weather should get one!</li>
    <li> Received  this had yesterday and loved it immediately.  Took it out of the bag and it felt so soft,  I make scarves and hats for&lt;br /&gt;family and friends,  and had never bought a crocheted hat before.  So for once I wanted it made for me.  The workmanship is so&lt;br /&gt;perfect,  and that is a big compliment coming from someone who has crocheted for 55 years.  The fit is also perfect  and feels so&lt;br /&gt;comfortable.  Stylish looking and not boring at all.  This style is for everyone , with no special age.  Looks charming on.  OK my&lt;br /&gt;fellow Gal shoppers,  this is a good  and sincere tip for you. Please try it.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  and the price is so affordable,  it is unbelievable.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice piece of clothing. My girlfriend loves it she looks so cute wearing it. It is adorable. it appears to be of very high quality it is warm it is attractive its definitely something I would purchase for anyonegood quality it is warm is attractive</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hat that would cover my ears but not completely give me hat head. I absolutely love this hat! It&#x27;s thick and warm and looks nice, and it&#x27;s loose enough to not put hat lines in my hair. Planning to buy it in other colors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;is nice I love it.</li>
    <li> So Comfortable Soft and Easy to wear.  This hat is baggy enough that it does not ride up on your head as you move. Yes there is a label light background with dark lettering DWP but I do not mind. Even if you just totally do not want label to show the hat is large enough to fold the band up, thus not showing label. I have below the shoulder hair, and this still looks good. I feel good in this hat.  First time I ever bought a hat online, took a chance and so glad I did. I bought the black one and is a warm rich color.</li>
