### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It may not be a high-art, sculpted piece of designer architecture - but it holds soap like a champ - and that makes us very, very happy!</li>
      <li>This dish looks beautiful when paired with homemade CP soaps.</li>
      <li>it would be great for a bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s held up very nicely for us.</li>
      <li>Great the way it lets the water drain from the soap rather than sitting in it and getting mushy.  :)</li>
      <li>This works great and is lovely to look at.</li>
      <li>Nice design and will be functional for my olive oil soap bars.</li>
      <li>This thing looks nice and works well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it, nice addition to my bathroom.</li>
      <li>very lovely and works fine for placing soap on.</li>
      <li>All I need and noting more.</li>
      <li>Needs a more durable finish or to be made out of rot resistant wood.    </li>
      <li>Works very well, is sturdy, and attractive.</li>
      <li>It is OK.</li>
      <li>2-month update:although nice at first, it has not stood up to shower use.</li>
      <li>Purchased to present my line of CP soaps, customers love it!!</li>
      <li>works great at keeping  the soap dry, after use.</li>
      <li>It is nicely made and does look nice in the bathroom with all the other bamboo items I have in there.  </li>
      <li>exactly what i was looking for to rest soap in the shower without getting a build up of soapy residue on the tile.</li>
      <li>Only way could be better is if it was made in the USA.</li>
      <li>However, it is much too wide to fit anywhere comfortably, even at the sink in the bathroom I had to put it on the counter, not on  the area around the sink where it could drain well.  </li>
      <li>This is a really pretty soap dish and very well-made.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful, simple, drains easily, is not adversely affected by the water.</li>
      <li>I really like the look of this soap dish and had hopes that we could use it in our shower.  </li>
      <li>Functional, well-made, and a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>Nice soap tray that keeps soap dry for the next use.</li>
      <li>If it was about 1/2 inch smaller in width, then it would fit nearly everywhere that we wanted to use it.</li>
      <li>Great little soap dish, goes with the other bamboo toned accents.</li>
      <li>The lacquer finish feels a little cheap, but then again, they are!</li>
      <li>Only been using 1 month, so not sure about durability of the finish, but seems good.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The water and lather drain so that your soap doesn&#x27;t end up getting soft and mushy.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re for inside my shower on the far corner from the shower head.  </li>
      <li>I might say $8 is on the high side for something so simple.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is small, well designed and just the right size to hold a bar of soap.  </li>

    <li> I really like the look of this soap dish and had hopes that we could use it in our shower.  It is nicely made and does look nice in the bathroom with all the other bamboo items I have in there.  However, it is much too wide to fit anywhere comfortably, even at the sink in the bathroom I had to put it on the counter, not on  the area around the sink where it could drain well.  If it was about 1/2 inch smaller in width, then it would fit nearly everywhere that we wanted to use it.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it fell apart and got moldy in my shower... it would be great for a bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> The wood makes it moldy after a while. I had it next to the bath tub, but had to switch it with the one next to the sink.</li>
    <li> This is a really pretty soap dish and very well-made.  You can use it in the shower or on the sink for your expensive moisturizing bars of soap.  The water and lather drain so that your soap doesn&#x27;t end up getting soft and mushy.  There is nothing underneath to catch the water that drains from the soap, though.  The little slats allow the soapy water to drain directly onto the sink or the shower.  So you might want to put a little dish to catch the soapy water on your sink.</li>
    <li> Great little soap dish, goes with the other bamboo toned accents.</li>
    <li> All I need and noting more. Simple and functional.</li>
    <li> very lovely and works fine for placing soap on.</li>
    <li> Great the way it lets the water drain from the soap rather than sitting in it and getting mushy.  :)</li>
    <li> works great at keeping  the soap dry, after use.</li>
    <li> Meh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few of these for my home. They all varied a little in their manufacture, almost as if each one was hand made. The lacquer finish feels a little cheap, but then again, they are!</li>
    <li> It is OK. i don&#x27;t like that it gets mold really quick tough.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for about a month, so I can&#x27;t testify to how it will hold up in the shower over an extended amount of time.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small, well designed and just the right size to hold a bar of soap.  That&#x27;s the point and it achieves it&#x27;s goal successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not totally up on the soap holder market, but I might say $8 is on the high side for something so simple.  However, It certainly is not a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will continue to monitor is whether the small amount of water that gets trapped underneath begins to cause any mold or mildew (either on my ledges surface or on the item itself).</li>
    <li> I bought one of these a year ago and just purchased a second one.  They&#x27;re for inside my shower on the far corner from the shower head.  They hold soap.  Not only that, they hold soap and don&#x27;t let it get soupy or fall through the little wire rack it sits on.  I can&#x27;t see any indication of coming apart or mold, but I do keep my bathroom relatively clean (not perfect, but no mold or anything).</li>
    <li> Works very well, is sturdy, and attractive.</li>
    <li> This dish looks beautiful when paired with homemade CP soaps. Purchased to present my line of CP soaps, customers love it!!</li>
    <li> I use this at my kitchen sink, and we are a house hold of 5. It&#x27;s held up very nicely for us.</li>
    <li> 2-month update:although nice at first, it has not stood up to shower use. All of the corners are starting to rot. Needs a more durable finish or to be made out of rot resistant wood.    This thing looks nice and works well. Simple construction. Only been using 1 month, so not sure about durability of the finish, but seems good.</li>
    <li> This works great and is lovely to look at. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, nice addition to my bathroom.</li>
    <li> exactly what i was looking for to rest soap in the shower without getting a build up of soapy residue on the tile.</li>
    <li> Nice soap tray that keeps soap dry for the next use.</li>
    <li> Functional, well-made, and a reasonable cost. It doesn&#x27;t slip off the slight slope of the indentation in our shower wall, as have some other soap dishes. We also like the wood design. It may not be a high-art, sculpted piece of designer architecture - but it holds soap like a champ - and that makes us very, very happy!</li>
    <li> Not waterproof enough for the shower. Requires covering with polyurethane or lacquer.</li>
    <li> Not a good design, makes a mess</li>
    <li> Works very well for keeping my expensive soap from dissolving in a puddle of goo</li>
    <li> well made and just what i was looking for. has a lacquered sort of finish to it so it seems it will hold up well in the shower and not get weathered by repeated water exposure.</li>
    <li> Nice design and will be functional for my olive oil soap bars.</li>
    <li> Only way could be better is if it was made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, simple, drains easily, is not adversely affected by the water.</li>
