<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was okay it felt like it dried my skin out more than it should!</li>
    <li> Its ok would buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought it was just as effective as the  higher priced serums that I have used (Obagi, Skin Medica). I could see immediate results, so why pay more. I ordered another bottle and will continue with this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Product is good the pump dispenser is not good at all it makes alot of waste.</li>
    <li> This is working!  The 1 oz bottle lasted me nearly 6 months and I just returned for the bigger bottle to find an even higher concentration of vitamin c.  This is bang for your buck.  It&#x27;s very light and not even noticeable once absorbed.  I have dry, acne-prone, sensitive skin and there was no adjustment period breakout or dryness.  Best part is knowing all ingredients are natural.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Very effective especially after using the Dr.A dermaroller...I have done three treatments so far and apply the serum daily morning and night...age spots are fading and skin tone and brightness have improved dramatically!!! I highly recommend this product and look forward to the continued positive results I am achieving with dedication and regular use...Thank you!!! Give it a try you will not be disappointed! I am a 53 year old while female with moderate sun damage and a few age spots...my skin is rather sensitive so I was concerned about a reaction to the product like I have had to other products I have tried...I clean my face thoroughly...dry and apply the serum...let it air dry then apply ample moisturizer...it has been 4 weeks since I started used the serum and have seen definite results within this time period...I look forward to continued results with regular use and moisturize, moisturize, moisturize...</li>
    <li> I received the Azure Naturals vitamin C Skin Repair serum free an for review.  I was excited becsue I have tried other vitamin C serums and they were thick, orange and smelled like oranges. When I opened this serum it was extremely thin and a cloudy color.  I tried it and I have very dry skin on my hands in the winter and it burned.  I also did not like the smell.  It went on smelling pleasant and thn developed a funky smell. It sounds really weird, but it smelled like raw hot dogs or bologna- not what I expected.  It was easy to apply because it was so thin, but be careful not to use too much.  It does come in a dropper form so it is somewhat controllable.  I was really turned off by the appearance and scent so I only used it a couple of times.  It has to be aesthetically pleasing for me to want to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM4607d7a3d93922310574bbec853931a1&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This product has been a game changer for my 40 year old skin.  I started using it 6 months ago and had results right away.  My friends were asking what I was using on my skin.  Noticably less fine lines and significant difference in overall skin health.  I&#x27;ve given up all the department store products I&#x27;ve used over the years and now just use this along with Argan oil for a moisturizer.  I skipped using this for a couple weeks and my skin started looking dull.  Won&#x27;t make that mistake again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I started using this product.  I&#x27;d never really thought about vitamin C and what benefits it has and now that I have been using this serum, I know that I was totally wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first time using this serum, my skin felt soft and firm, and after a month of using it my skin looks so much brighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally worth adding another step to your routine!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 4 weeks ago with Azure Natural&#x27;s Guaranteed Strongest Wrinkle Eraser 2.5% and 22% Vitamin C serums.  I use all three.  I start with Vitamin C, then the Cucumber and finish with the Retinol 2.5%.  My skin as improved so much!!!  I am 61 with dry, sensitive skin.  The dryness is much improved with no more flakes, texture is better, wrinkles are reducing due to improved hydration.  Great results at a fantastic value!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Brightens my skin immediately, smells wonderful and along with my other skin care products...seems to be making a difference in the texture of my skin.  I wash my face, apply the Vitamin C first, follow that with the Azure Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer and then use the Azure Argan Oil.  Apply my makeup and my skin stays very soft and dewy all day. I also use the Azure Retinol before sleep.  I see a slight improvement in the fading of some age spots on my cheeks and hope to see more with continued use.  I have not experienced any skin break-outs or dryness using this method.  I am a 58 yo woman with sun damaged skin and often get compliments on my skin.  Hope you like it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Tighten your pores and skin!  I use this every morning and night!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great. It really works. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that I had purchased through Amazon, and decided to I&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
    <li> The Azure Naturals Ultimate Vitamin C Skin Repair Serum is all that &amp; some. At such an affordable price anyone can have great results at your fingertips. It is so easy to get into a daily routine to consistently boost your skins appearance. These ingredients are so amazing it will help protect your skin from potential sun damage or other environmental stressors. Plus of coarse I can&#x27;t forget my all time favorite, its also made in the U.S.A!</li>
    <li> great product with fast results....Love it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product about 4 months ago and have gotten compliment on how great my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering my second bottle and can&#x27;t say enough about this product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has gotten back its healthy youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, I am sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have recently become addicted to Vitamin C serums so I had to try this.  It wasn&#x27;t was what I was used to.  Other serums I have tried are like pure orange pulp but this is almost white.  It has a fresh scent and absorbs quickly.  It does not feel oily or greasy.  It comes with a dropper and a sprayer.  Since it claims to visibly plump &amp; firm skin, I wanted to see if I would be able to tell if it was working after the first use.  I took photos of my left eye before and ten minutes after applying the serum for the first time.  It definitely has a slight instant plumping affect.  I have used it for a couple of weeks now and my fine lines are starting to diminish.  I love the way my whole face feels after applying the serum since it does not leave a residue.  I just have soft, smooth, healthy skin.  I would definitely recommend Azure Naturals to anyone looking for a great skin care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for review purposes but was not compensated in any other way.</li>
    <li> I found this serum to do what it promised!</li>
    <li> Just finished one bottle, see no results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. It is cloudy white and good serum. However, after lots of research I am switching to the pure vitamin C crystals. I think the vitamin C degrades very quickly and would rather spend my money on the pure crystals and mix into my serums. FYI I do the 10 step Korean skin care regimen and plan on incorporating the Vitamin C crystals into the first essence I apply.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> I been using it for 2 weeks now and my face seems smoother than before.</li>
    <li> Not sure I saw any improvements compared to the other brands I have used.  I like the Oz products.  With that being said, I&#x27;m sure this will work for some people.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered with no box!!! Plus it&#x27;s looks awful, the liquid is cloudy! I would not try it on my face ! I&#x27;m so dissapointed and I want my money back!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a little less than a week and I am already loving it. The serum includes high percentages of Vitamin C as well as hyaluronic acid, which are essential ingredients in anti-aging products. The serum did not cause any irritation and I feel like it slightly brightened my skin. I recently used it after a derma roller to increase product absorption. I have some discoloration on my forehead and I am hoping that the high concentration of Vitamin C in this product will improve my skin tone over time. It is unrealistic to expect a serum to fix discoloration over night, but my skin looks better than before. I will use this product and note any changes. I am also using another serum for my eyes, and I think the combination of these three products are making a great difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> Good stuff will buy again</li>
    <li> Am loving the obvious of what this product is doing for my skin!  I will continue to use it. Makes my skin so smooth!  Wrinkles definitely reduced!  Getting compliments all the time on my skin!  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I have been a regular user of Cellex C products for many years, but it just got too pricey. The consistency of this product is so rich:  viscous and dense with a lovely fragrance!👍🌹It is not runny like Cellex C. The hyaluronic acid makes my skin feel immediately soft and radiant. I am definitely a convert. I can now afford one for home &amp; one for travel. I give this product a thumbs up!👍 An aesthetician asked me what I use to make my skin so dewy and radiant. I attribute it to this product.🌹👩😎</li>
    <li> wonderful ,helps with all that ales you.</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed into Skin. Smells nice.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered the full line - for morning I use the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C serum and Vitamin C moisturizer, plus the cucumber eye. in the evening I use the Vitamin C toner, Retinol serum and Retinol moisturizer plus the cucumber eye. I also purchased the Vitamin C cleanser but I haven&#x27;t been using it yet as I finish up another cleanser. there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products. I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone. I use a Clarisonic daily. there&#x27;s been no issue with irritation or dryness. My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully. My forehead lines appear to be smoothing out and my eye crinkles do as well. for the affordable price I am REALLY IMPRESSED. I will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> THIS IS DECENT BUT I&#x27;VE HAD BETTER</li>
    <li> I am loving this vitamin c serum. At 22% it has a higher concentration of vitamin c than any others I&#x27;ve tried so far and I can see how thats making a difference in my results. It does a fantastic job clearing my skin and I can already see a difference in the darkness of some spots I have on my face. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the lines around my eyes and forehead soften and liked it so well I am already purchasing a bottle for my mother.Its worth far more than what they are charging on here.  I use an orange blossom toner and apply this after. Its quickly absorbed and I apply my makeup as usual after it dries. I love love love this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed any sticky residue and it smells fantastic. I hope you found this information helpful for you. I did receive my bottle free to try after agreeing to leave a review of my experience with it but this in no way takes away for the effectiveness of this serum. Its the best out of a long list I&#x27;ve tried. It also comes with a 100% money back guarantee if for any reason you don&#x27;t like it so it&#x27;s at least worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this serum! Anything Vitamin C is a must have for me, especially beauty products! Been using this serum about a week and I really do like it, my skin feels so refreshed, so healthy too. It&#x27;s been helping me fight against acne, products that do that is hard me to find, especially the natural kind. I would recommend this to just about anyone! Try it, seriously!&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve received this product as a promotion, thank you!</li>
    <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals have the best naturals products, I started to used them 6 months ago and they really work.  Love all your products!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading such great reviews and really wanted to love it but to my surprise, it clogged my pores. Initially I thought it was a coincidence but my skin immediately got better after I stopped using it. I didn&#x27;t think vitamic C could clog pores.</li>
    <li> I received it in perfect packing too, have not opening yet but after using the other product with similar ingredients and having great results I want it to test this one and I will after m month trial with OZ</li>
    <li> I really liked the pump dispenser (so much better than a dropper for keeping the air out) and the product was good though not as amazing as another product I used before but has that has just about doubled in price so I&#x27;m seeking alternatives.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st product Ive ever tried from Azure Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Azure Naturals&#x27; Ultimate vitamin C Skin Repair Serum fo almost a month now and I am really very impressed with it.I like the cooling feeling it delivers to my pores as I&#x27;m &#x27; taking off the day&#x27; at the end&lt;br /&gt; Of a long day.It is refreshing and soothing and light as water.Better than water tho,it leaves my skin feeling alive,rescued,rejuvinated,tighter,brighter &amp; ready for game night sans makeup.My skin feels so good all I need is a little moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;and Im all set.This product is wonderful.My face looks healthier,feels amazing.A simple way to rewind  the  clock and enjoy the benefits of modern research!</li>
    <li> I did not see a marked difference or even a minor one.</li>
    <li> really improves your skin texture.</li>
    <li> Loved it...quick shipping! Exactly what I wanted...definitely ordering again!</li>
    <li> It works on me. Really like it</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I&#x27;ve found to lighten dark spots. I have tried products that cost hundreds of dollars. This worked the best of all. I use it everyday and am on my second bottle. Cannot beat the price and the quality. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this with the Derma Roller and I would have to say it helped with fine lines.  Beware.........don&#x27;t use the Vitamin C too often use as directed.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to form an opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using AzureNaturals HA/Vit C now for just over a year, every morning and evening. For me and my skin type it is perfect, after a year my skin is much smoother to touch and healthier in appearance. I am 58yrs old and live in the southwest, my skin for years has felt and sadly looked dry and dull. I have gotten many compliments lately that I look healthier. I know everyone has different skin types and climate conditions but this little bottle has changed my skin and I can&#x27;t say enough about it. Living in the southwest I have used almost every moisturizer out there from home remedies to high end regimens that did nothing. About 5yrs ago my skin, I know due to age, my skin started changing and was even getting worse, felt like sand paper and looked just awful, I had breakouts on my forehead, bumps, red spots etc. The dermatologist said it was rosacea, prescribed a tube of meds that cost $75 a pop, that did nothing. I saw AzureNat on amazon and it had great reviews so I thought I would give it a try but really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything, the price was right so why not, I had just finished my last $75 tube of prescription med. Not too long after I started using the HA/Vit C I could see obvious changes. BTW if you have those little florescent curly bulbs overhead in your bath mirror, throw them out!! They make your skin look like crap! Spend a few more pennies and put in regular light bulbs. Anyway I knew I was on to something so I have been faithful using this product for just over a year and my skin has steadily improved each day. Now I have tried to add other products to my regimen, other Vit C (OzNat) and a couple other brands I found here on amazon because the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C is the magic and think I gave them all a fair trial, normally a couple months at a time, but I keep coming back to Azure Naturals because I keep getting the best results and each day gets better. Its been probably 10 months or so since my last forehead breakout. I have afew brown sun/age spots that honestly I do not think there is a product out there that will take them away completely, yes they are still there but a little lighter, I had a few bumps around my nose that seemed to stand out like beacons, I can still feel them under my skin, but you don&#x27;t see them. My pores are almost non-existent and when I hold a mirror to the side of my face my cheeks, everything looks smooth and healthy. I love this stuff and would recommend it and will use it forever. I will say that you do not want to apply this before your workout because as you sweat anything you apply above your cheeks will run down into your eyes obviously, the HA and Vit C will make your eyes sting. Also at my last derm appt Doc asked if I needed a new scrip for the tube of med (can&#x27;t remember the name of the med) for the rosacea because my skin was looking so good and I had to chuckle and tell her it was no thanks to that stuff and filled her in on what I was using. She now is prescribing HA/Vit C. So I will recommend AZure Naturals, out of all the different brands that make and sell HA/Vit C, this is the one that worked for me. If you have just started using Azure Naturals give it time. If you are thinking about it for this price it is well worth the experiment, and a little goes a long ways, you do not saturate your skin, just an even covering. So glad I found it.  I have not been compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> I recieved this poduct so I could give my honest opinion and I promise to do just that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I love how quick they were to ship!&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived sealed and packaged properly.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact this product doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling when you put it on , nor does it feel overly oily.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and smells amazing! My skin had breakouts prior to use and this actually helped clear some up.&lt;br /&gt;This also can be used prior to applying make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am loving this product and have been recommending it to family and friends</li>
    <li> Tightens skin. Leaves it soft and smooth. Great anti-oxicidant. When used in combination with the Kojic acid, it has made a noticeable difference in my melasma, and I have tried everything. Remember to slather on sun screen always!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultimate vitamin C serum for a little over 3 weeks and wow I can see a huge difference.  I am totally in love with my skin.  I have that youthful glow and silky softness I use to have.  I&#x27;ve been horrible about taking care of my skin over the years and the sun has caused some damage.  I am so happy to have found this great skin care product to help me out.  Since I have sensitive skin I did a patch test with the Serum on small spots on my cheeks. That way if I did have a reaction it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad. Per Azure Naturals detailed and thorough instructions: I applied the Ultimate Vitamin C Serum twice a day (morning and night) for 2 days. I saw no adverse affects and was ready to fully use my new skin care product.&lt;br /&gt;When I was ready to get going I applied a thin layer of the Vitamin C Serum. I used it every day 2x a day and was very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat I loved the feeling on my skin. It&#x27;s nice and light while at the same time you can feel it there working. I instantly had really soft and supple skin. I was completely immersed in hydration. My sun damaged skin absorbed the serum very nicely. I didn&#x27;t have a sticky, heavy feeling either. I am noticing diminishing of fine lines around my mouth and eyes and yes I&#x27;m able to apply by my eyes without any rashes, itching or anything. I love it. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this radiant in years. I love that it&#x27;s actually affordable, works and is still gentle!. That&#x27;s a triple win in my book! I can&#x27;t wait to see more changes. I have noticed a little softening in the small line in my forehead but it is still there. The company says for dramatic affects it takes about 6-8 weeks. I&#x27;m truly amazed at how great it&#x27;s working so far and love the compliments I&#x27;m getting :)</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smelling and looking so fresh. I was recently diagnosed with discoid lupus so I must take great care of my skin! This product definitely helps me do that!</li>
    <li> With all of the talk I’ve been hearing about more natural solutions, like Vitamin C serums,  the more I wanted to try them so I was very happy to review the Ultimate Vitamin C serum from Azure Naturals. Ivy skin is very dry so I chose as Astros to my morning care. I rinse my face with water, apply my rose water tonic, blot or air dry, apply my serum and follow with a vitamin c moisturizer. In my opinion my skin has more of a healthy glow and my coworkers have asked if I have been getting more sleep(mother of multiples so the answer is no). I do not wear makeup but if you do I think you would apply after the moisturizer if you have dry skin. Overall I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my skin. In fact, it irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price and had tons of compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is good I recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 6 months.  It appeared to cause very dry spots on my face (flakiness) but I continued to&lt;br /&gt;use it because I have several sun spots I&#x27;d like to see gone.  I never saw any change in the sun (dark) spots and it never&lt;br /&gt;brightened my skin.  Personally, this Vitamin C  never made any improvement in my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t recommend it and I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> First thing, when the product came it was not in a box, it was just laying in the bubble wrap. Second when I put some on my finger, it had the consistency of water and slid off my finger onto the floor. Lastly, it left my face feeling sticky after I used it. Overall, not  impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free. Good product works well seen changes in two weeks</li>
    <li> I just resently got this product, but so far I love it. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized. I am eager to see how it does on my wrinkles over time. I will update my review and let you know.</li>
    <li> I love it. Love what it does to my face. You feel it working immediately. Love that it is a natural product. Goes on easy. Not a bad smell. Pleasant.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, although you can probably find cheaper similar products anywhere.</li>
    <li> I received this to try and I love it!  It&#x27;s applies smoothly and evenly and my skin feels soft.  I use it with the other products as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve tried several VIT C serums. Even the $100 ones. Before my last order I was thinking, I sure wish there was a pump on the bottle.  I was thrilled when my order came and Azure Naturals  Hadbreplaced the dropper with a pump!  The also sent a nice email with information and help. The serum isn&#x27;t runny like some and does not turn orange. I am looking for other items by Azure because they are nice and have quality products. Love Amszon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and have been using it for approximately 3 weeks.  I am very disappointed due to no results at all.  I have used this according to the instructions and am very consistent with my daily skincare and sorry to say &amp;#34;absolutely no results&amp;#34;.  I wanted this to work so bad :(.  I really thought I would notice a slight different after a couple of weeks....but nothing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, my skin feels and looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t exactly been following the recommended usage instructions, but this product has still helped make my skin feel better. Granted it isn&#x27;t the fountain of youth, but your skin doesn&#x27;t know that. Definitely give it a try if you want healthy feeling skin.</li>
    <li> This product was great. Loved the way it made my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a good product. I was not sure what to expect but what i am seeing is tightening up of my 67 year old skin especially under the eyes!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will be reordering when I need more! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product at first glance it won&#x27;t look like much but wow does this product work I got out of the shower and my face a all dry as always and I said hey let me put on this and once I didnt my face felt like new</li>
    <li> Great product. Absorbs quickly...I kept it in the bathroom and after a while it started to smell bad. Unfortunately I ended up throwing it out but I did like how it made my skin feel. If I order again I would keep it in the fridge.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It is so refreshing. I like this product.</li>
    <li> This used to be a great product when it was the 20% vitamin c formula.  The ingredients are the same, but the amounts of those ingredients has changed; not just the 2% increase in vitamin c.  This formula smells different, feels different and dried my skin out instantly.  The old formula left my skin feeling soft, tighter and brighter.  Sadly, I returned this product and am going to try a brand whose ingredients match Azure Naturals original formula.</li>
    <li> I loved the first bottle. It had a secure cellophane wrapping around the top, and the citrus fragrance was  intensed. This time the bottle didn;t have the secure wrapping, the fragrance is horrible, and it is watery. I will NOT order it again!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see any result.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all. I just used this tonight for the first time. This is just as good as most of the other Vitamin c serums on the market. The price is affordable too. It makes your skin feel smooth and didn&#x27;t have any bad smells. I will continue to use this until the bottle is empty. Hopefully, I will see some improvements by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this is best vit c serum. Gimmick &amp; fake. Zero results. Stick with REVISION OR PCA a little pricier but medical grade. Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this azure naturals serum actually cost $99 and your getting a steal...your not.</li>
    <li> Great product, smell yummy and makes my skin heal instantly.</li>
    <li> It is good practice to use a vitamin C serum for the face, but it can be quite expensive. This one is very good and affordable, so that is why I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I really like how smooth and taut my skin fells after using this product, especially my neck.  It absorbs quickly and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> this is fast working and it comes in a cute little bottle wit no mess i cant wait to continue using it ... I got this product from Ilovetoreview.com they are such an awesome company for giving out products to let u use and review cant wait to get more stuff like this ..</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals supplied a free sample to evaluate, test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using this product for several months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed how much this has helped.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to start seeing results.  It really does what it claims.  It is a great product too.  It’s a good idea to keep it refrigerated. This will keep the serum from oxidizing too quickly, and will give you a better result for the price.  Below is how my wife uses hers, I think she read this online somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correct method of application will definitely increase the effectiveness of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Dampen your face with water and start by applying the serum to your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Let it dry for some time and then apply a moisturizer, if possible use one with a sunscreen in it. It is important that you use the serum before moisturizing and not after. This is because the serum is easily absorbed into the skin, while moisturizers work on the surface. If you use the moisturizer first, your skin will not be able to absorb the vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money you cannot beat the results.  The claims of a facelift in a bottle are actually true.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for a few weeks so I guess it&#x27;s to soon to see a difference but I don&#x27;t feel any kind of tightness in the skin when I apply it. I am looking forward to seeing the changes that everyone is talking about.</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought this after I got a high discount code. I live in California, so the sun is really strong. my face has a sun burn last Sunday. i use this product to repair the sun burn.</li>
    <li> Skeptical me has to admit that I do love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other Vitamin C serums, yet I give my&lt;br /&gt;applause to this one.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is as skeptical as me, but it has improved&lt;br /&gt;gently and noticeably.  Without a doubt I will purchase&lt;br /&gt;again!  BTW, I am in my early 60&#x27;s, have a life of&lt;br /&gt;sun sins and few acne scars...this serum has lightened&lt;br /&gt;the load!</li>
    <li> I like very much the product since I was looking for something real and cheap without to pay more dollars for the same ingredients. Works great and I will buy the second one for sure.</li>
    <li> As a woman in her early 50’s I am always looking for that one product that will make a big difference with my skin. I really think this is that product. I follow the regimen that they describe and have added in the toner. By the way I really appreciated the directions and great customer service when I had a question. I have very sensitive skin and had no problems around my eyes. My skin tingles for 10 seconds or so right after I apply it. My skin is looking much better with a dewy kind of look and firmed up around my lips and ears which were problem areas for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! As a professional makeup artist, I have used a similar product for years on myself and clients that I would buy online or at  department store cosmetic counters. When I found this product online, I looked at the ingredients, claims, features and benefits. They were almost identical to the dept store brand with the exception that Azure has all natural ingredients, a higher percentage of vitamin C AND about $40 less. Is a win win and I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;m already seeing with my skin and a short period of time. I will definitely use this on myself and my clients as well as recommending to them. Thanks Azure Naturals!!</li>
    <li> i got a deal on it to give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;skin absorb very fast,smooth and feel very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;will but it again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I noticed results with first use.  Definitely tightens and firms skin...exceptional!  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Really liked this it&#x27;s great for your skin very soft and helps with cracked hands</li>
    <li> After using this for a few weeks I actually had some of my close personal friends asking me what was wrong with my skin… So I went back to the before images I took from when I started using the serum and my face actually looked worse after using it! So I stopped using the serum and switched to another brand and everything cleared right up! I wouldn’t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I recently received this serum. I began using it for the last couple of weeks. This is a great product! The serum smells amazing and goes on very smoothly without the greasy feeling many serums have. It makes my skin very smooth and has allowed me to reduce the amount of moisturizer I have been using. While I have not seen a significant change in my appearance, I have noticed my skin is much softer in the areas I have applied this. I highly recommend this product! I recieved this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Use the whole bottle did not notice a difference. It feels great on the face though. Has a clove smell to it</li>
    <li> I received this a few weeks ago. I like it but I have not seen the greatest results. I am still hopeful. I will write an update in a few more weeks. I did receive this product for my review.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Works well and goes on smooth and absorbs well with no leftover residue.  Did see a quick difference in my skin, softer and lines seem to be fading.  I got this product for free for my unbias review.</li>
    <li> 1st 30 days awesome results! Ready for my 2nd order! Great product. Highly recommend. Leesa McGill.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended Azure Naturals to me so I gave it a shot and I really like the product.  It goes on smooth and I can already tell the difference, face is soft and smooth with no oily feel.  Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Works very well!  ☺ Super fast delivery,  thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> i heard about this product thru the amazon top selling list, and my wife wanted to give it a go. In the last week we found that it cleared up two sun spots, and also made our skin feel much smoother. I recommend this to anyone who wants to clear up their skin.</li>
    <li> I have used several serums purchased in department stores at a much higher cost, and I have to say I like this one the best so far. I like that it is scent-free, lightweight, and makes my skin feel tighter than an anti-wrinkle cream. Plus, and this is big for me since I have uber sensitive skin, it did not cause a break out! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My skin had a pretty awful reaction to this stuff.. broke out all over for days and then cleared up immediately after I stopped using it. It&#x27;s not for me. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> This totally an awesome anti ageing serum&lt;br /&gt;On my 1st day of using it  .I see and feel the good effect of this serum from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks radiant ,blooming and smooth,It absorb quickly ,light to the face and not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Its has the hyalunoric acid aslo knows as for skin tightening.&lt;br /&gt;It save me a lot  of.money having this AzureNaturals , its all in one im looking for my skin with vit c,vit e,amino complex just in one small bottle for you beauty treament.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at discounted price</li>
    <li> Being skeptical about this product I decided to give it a try based on the ingredients and the other comments...sure am glad I did. AWESOME results in a pretty short amount of time too. Love this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other hyaluronic acid products before and this one seems to be more watery.  I prefer more thicker consistency.  When I pump it on my fingers it is very runny.</li>
    <li> So happy with this product, very god quality.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using Timeless Vitamin C &amp; E Serum.  It is all right, but I prefer the other.  This is thinner and has a scent that I just don&#x27;t quite like.</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say bad about this product is I don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product ! My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I really liked the way this product absorbed so quickly into my skin. I used this serum as a treatment after derma-rolling. I did some research and read that vitamin C serum was a great way to heal the skin as well as get rid of fine lines. The product does have a tendency to leave your skin a little dry. I would use this at night before bed every other night , and then use a nice moisturizer such as Nivea or Cetaphil on my off nights. I did make sure to always use a sun screen before going outside in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not have a harsh smell at all, really it does not have much smell at all. I did notice a difference in my pores after about two weeks of using this. I feel like this was more of a healing serum after the &amp;#34;micro-damage&amp;#34; that derma-rolling causes. My skin definitely looks better after this regimen.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. It applies smoothly and has a pleasant scent. I have been using it under my make up and it appears to make my skin smoother. I was given this product free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I did not see a huge difference in my skin from using this product. This vitamin c serum is supposed to produce collagen and elastin in the skin, however I see a difference in my skin just from using sunblock alone.  If you have very sensitive skin, this could be a great product for you because it is light weight, nongreasy, paraben free, and alcohol free. I think one of the pros of this product is that you can use it with your current skin care regimen. It can be paired with any cleanser and moisturizer your currently use. I don&#x27;t like that this product contains some non-natural ingredients, such as hyaloronic acid and ferulic acid. My skin responds better to all natural ingredients, such as cocoa butter. It comes with a small dropper that you can use to apply the serum to a cotton swab. I would prefer a spray.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help treat my post acne hyperpigmentation and fine lines on my forehead. I didn&#x27;t expect miracle working results for either, but by week 3 I usually see some gradual fading of my acne marks if I&#x27;m using a vitamin C serum. For a vitamin C serum that claims to be 20%, this was very ineffective. I&#x27;ve used several vitamin C serums in the past and this one provided absolutely no results. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product and I don&#x27;t recommend it. There is no stinging or tingling sensation even though the concentration is &amp;#34;professional strength&amp;#34; which is nice - it really just feels like you&#x27;re applying water. The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving this serum 2 stars is because it didn&#x27;t do anything to damage my skin or make it worse. It just simply didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 3 weeks and I am pleased with it. It smells great, comes in an easy to use mini pump, and a little goes a long ways. I&#x27;m not sure if my skin feels smoother but I have received complements on my complexion. I know Vitamin C is great for many applications so it makes perfect sense that it repairs damage from the sun as well as protect from future damage. I was given a free bottle to try.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday. Once in the morning and before bedtime. I already feel irs affects. My skin feels smoother and even my pores look different. I recieved this product foe review</li>
    <li> This product is a bit sticky which I don&#x27;t care for.  Overall, it&#x27;s okay.  I haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin yet.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! Not only does it leave your skin with a nice healthy glow, but it also reduces fine lines and wrinkles. It is good for your face and body. I usually put a few drops in my organic lotion as well along with the Ultimate Hyaluronic Anti-Aging serum also by Azure Naturals. You’ve gotta try this stuff!</li>
    <li> My skin got very red. Maybe it is too strong for my type of skin (NOT fair)</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference in the texture of my face right away. Discoloration improved and the overall look of my face was much more vibrant. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It tightens your face and smells citrusy.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the fragrance of this product.  After applying a couple of times I notice that although it makes my skin feel tighter, it does not dry my skin.  Usually when your skin feels tight it is because the skin is dry but instead the skin remains moist and supple.  I am noticing immediately that my skin looks smoother and am looking forward to how it will look in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> i have been using the product for one month and can detect no change in skin or wrinkles.  it is very thin also, but it hasn&#x27;t done any harm either.</li>
    <li> Since using this product I have noticed that my face has been a whole lot softer than I can remember and the way this product is working, I&#x27;m looking forward to the little wrinkles going away soon!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using this serum for a little over a month and my skin is noticeably smoother and softer. I had a small sun blemish on my forehead that has completely disappeared.  I will definitely be placing another order! Thank you Azure Naturals!!</li>
    <li> is absorbed by skin quickly, lightweight to be used before moisturizer</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing after 3 weeks of using</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a product work like this one. My dermatologist said try 30% Vitamin C. 22% was the best I could find, and I&#x27;m totally delighted. This has gotten rid of dark circles I&#x27;ve had under my eyes for 50 years - since the bad old days of early contact lenses.</li>
    <li> JUST IN MY SECOND WEEK AND SO FAR I LOVE IT!!!!  MY SKIN IS FEELS SO SOFT , WILL GLADLY DO BUSINESS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Works better than the other i have tried. Would recommend. Got this in exchange of a honnest review</li>
    <li> This product is simply lovely.  I got it about a week ago and have used it every day since.  My skin is soft and tolerated this product well which is a rare thing because I have sensitive skin.  I was willing to try it since it was all natural. The only thing I noticed was it had an interesting subtle orange smell to it. (Make sense why)  however once I put my daily moisturizer with spf on I could not smell it any longer.</li>
    <li> I bought the one ounce size. Wish I had bought the larger size. Ran out before I could see any difference. I believe it is a good product, though. I liked the way my face felt when I used it.</li>
    <li> i have tried all different kind of expensive products and didn&#x27;t work .. i have sun spot on my face and early sign of aging , but with just a few usage i can see the difference .. I love it ... i will never spend on expensive products anymore ..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product.  But I have no issues with it.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks.  I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really working.  I have dry skin and some sun damage over the years.  I was hoping this product will minimize the sun spots...maybe I have not given enough time for it to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the other glowing reviews. However I don&#x27;t think this did anything for my skin. Still looks the same and I followed the instructions. It has passed the window for return. Oh well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought that an all natural product would be worth the extra money, but I was wrong. I don&#x27;t know if this product even contains HA because it did NOTHING for my skin. It&#x27;s also supposed to contain vitamin c, which is essential for skin repair, but again I saw no improvement whatsoever. In fact, it made my skin worse! First, the bottle is awful for dispensing the liquid, and it shoots out and gets everywhere. Second, this made my skin DRY and my wrinkles and lines looked twice as deep and more noticeable than before. It did nothing to help my skin, and I am very disappointed in this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money with this stuff. What a waste of $20! Thank god I went to Ulta later and stumbled across Dr. Lin&#x27;s aloe and HA moisturizer (it&#x27;s like $7), and that stuff reversed the awful effects of this serum and got rid of my lines and made my skin look smooth within 30 minutes!</li>
    <li> My skin lost that dull grayish cast and developed a radiant glow that accentuated the natural undertones of my skin. I have large pores on my cheeks and baggy under eyes. After using the vitamin c serum, I noticed that I would feel a slight tightening of the skin, similar to using a facial mask, but not as intense. So, I started using the serum around my eyes as well. My pores no longer seem as crater-like as before and the bags are a lot less severe. Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I had used Skinceuticals and it has become very expensive. Although it hasn&#x27;t been very long I am happy with the results of this new product and have shared with others about the great ingredients and price. It also doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my face and neck. I use it at night and moisturizer after and morning. Simple and great results!</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered this product it was a thick consistency and I had to rip the safety plastic off the neck of the bottle.  This time the product was not wrapped (no plastic on neck) and the product is watery.  Kind of afraid to use it, feels like it was watered down.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C serums for several years.  They have cleared up all the dark and red spots on my cheeks and keep my skin looking perfectly clear.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I am beyond impressed with this product.  Just finishing my first bottle now, and what a difference in my skin!!  It looks better all the way around... more hydrated, smoother and with less lines.  I highly recommend this product.  Will be ordering my second bottle today in the 2 oz size.</li>
    <li> This skin care sirum is worth every penny. Even just after 1 week I see the difference in my skin. Try it once and you will be addicted!</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my skin feel. I have been putting a light moisturizer on after and it has really made my skin glow. I just love this stuff and will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> This product smells and feels very natural. It actually smells like orange peels- like vitamin C should! I&#x27;ve used it about 20 days so far and it feels light when you put it on so you can layer moisturizer over it. It is also very easy to use with the droplet application so you never put on too much. Another thing I like about the size is that you can bring it on an airplane. The only drawback is the packaging is a bit boring but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind using it because it doesn&#x27;t look girly- so that&#x27;s a plus. My mom even used it once and said she liked it better than her $70 one!</li>
    <li> Skin health has always been very important to me. I have been looking for a good vitamin c supplement and then I found this. I have been very happy with the product. I do like that the product ships from Amazon and is Prime. I could see me referring other people to buy this as I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far I do like the product except one issue is that when I opened the product it was not sealed so I am not sure if the product was compromise.  I should have contacted the vendor.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday but I don&#x27;t really notice anything different with my skin. It feels nice going on but has no results??</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes but I like the way it just disappears after you apply it..  There is no lotion feeling left on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has an immediate tightening effect. My skin feels great. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I received this very quickly &amp; protected in bubble wrap, thank you! This goes on beautifully, doesn&#x27;t dry out, so you can actually spread it. I noticed a difference the FIRST time I used it!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what my 50+ skin will look like after a month&#x27;s use. I hate my smoker wrinkles around my mouth &amp; lips - I noticed a huge difference after 1 use. YES!!! Thank you Thank you Thank you!</li>
    <li> The product I received is pretty cloudy, i thought it was normal until the other user response my question saying their product is clear as water. from that on, I stop using it  afraid that may cause other skin problem. From the days I had been using it, I don&#x27;t see any skin problem of using it, while I don&#x27;t see much improvement dramatically either.so the 3 star is about the stability of product quality not the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the item description mentioned &amp;#34;ONE YEAR MONEY BACK GUARANTEE: All Azure Naturals products are backed by our 365-day, 100% Hassle-Free, Money Back Guarantee. If you don&#x27;t absolutely love our ULTIMATE VITAMIN C Serum we will give you a full refund, including shipping, no matter where you buy the product!&amp;#34;, but when I submit my question on how to invoke the GUARANTEE - should I return to Amazon for a refund or any other way, my question never get posted, so I don&#x27;t know how to deal with it right now.  may just throw it away.</li>
    <li> I love it. It gave my face new life</li>
    <li> I love this one.  My face get brighter than before, dark spots &amp; freckles gone 50%</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum because it has 22 percent vitamin c.  This is the strongest percentage of vitamin c I have seen in a serum. This is professional strength so I know I am getting the strongest serum.  Vitamin C helps repair the skin and helps with sun damage. This serum also contains other ingredients perfect to repair skin.  I have sun damage on my chest area and this is going to be perfect to target those problem areas.  It goes on very easy and absorbs quickly into my skin.  It only has a light fragrance which is fantastic because sometimes I get migraines. If a products fragrance is too strong I can&#x27;t use it.  This is also made in the USA which is awesome.  I love purchasing products that are made here.  I love this serum.  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency; seems the skin just drinks up the liquid. It works well and makes the skin feel soft smooth and tight. It also gives my skin a youthful texture.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is with the pump style of delivery. it&#x27;s hard to control and sometimes squirts too much. I prefer the dropper which is what I have with the Amara Organics Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;I love both products equally.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  My face is brighter and tighter and I will continue to use and tell all my friends about it.  Shipper sent immediately and I received it in perfect condition in 2 days.</li>
    <li> But I just reordered after using Ultimate Vitamin-C, for only two months and there&#x27;s still some left, so it goes a long ways.  The point is, my face likes it and I&#x27;m listening to what it saying.  I&#x27;m also listening to others: &amp;#34;Billy, you look younger; are you doing something different?&amp;#34;  Not kidding either, that&#x27;s exactly what Christie said less than an hour ago, then Imelda and Sam chimed in to agree.  Yeah, what are you doing!? Right, I just came home from a family patio party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess I do know--guys like to look, well, their age, too.  I&#x27;m 70 and loving it, and therefore I really do not wish to run out of, ah, &amp;#34;Azure Naturals ULTIMATE VITAMIN C Skin Repair Serum Best Vitamin C Serum For Your Face...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, THE NAME IS WAY TOO LONG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill B Younger</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I saw any changes whatsoever after using this product.  I had high hopes, but.......  I&#x27;m  glad others saw positive changes.</li>
    <li> My esthetician suggested I start using a Vitamin C serum. I use a combo product when I travel, but she said I should try a separate serum. Azure Naturals sent me a sample to try and I was so grateful. In the first day I noticed my skin was more supple. It takes just a little product to cover and I really liked that it wasn&#x27;t scented. Kept my skin hydrated even in the hot desert while traveling in the Middle East. Upon returning to the US, I found it was equally as helpful in the humidity of New England as well. Others have noticed my skin being brighter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value and easy to use delivery make this a wonderful option for a high quality Vitamin C serum.  I used some on my daughter after her sunburn and it was such a benefit to healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been about 9 months of using this and I still love it and highly recommend it to many of my friends. I recently saw a friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in about a year and her first question was what I was using on my face because it looks better than she remembered. It&#x27;s hard to see the changes sometimes because we see our face every day. It&#x27;s nice to have confirmation that products we use are working!</li>
    <li> azure ultimate vitamin c skin repair serum  , its easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take a lot , goes on smoothly, it kind of has a citrus scent to it. ive only been using it for a little while and so far all is well.. leaves my face feeling smooth , so far the product is okay enough for me to keep using it for a while. ill add more as time goes on.. a recommendation is try it I am.  &amp;#34;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT NO COST IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> very good product. If only there was a indication of the shelf-life after opening.</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to use Azure Naturals vitamin C serum. I take a few drops of the aloe scented serum and apply it to my face every night before bed. It absorbs fast into my skin and then I use my favorite moisturizer on my face. The serum is gentle on the skin and does not irritate my skin like other products I tried. Within the first week of using the product I notice that my skin was softer and not so dry anymore. I also noticed that my fine lines were less noticeable after I used the product for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive Azure Naturals Ultimate Vitamin C Skin Repair Serum free to review because I have recently had an \\&quot;overgrown blood vessel\\&quot; removed from smack in the middle of my forehead. Super ugly right? Well, I know that vitamin E is great for reducing the appearance and preventing scars and that is added to this serum! I have also been spending a lot of time in the sun now that it is finally nice here so my skin is in need of some serious repair! I have been using it for a week now and I love it. I just squeeze out about 3/4 of the dropper in my palm and use my fingertips to rub it in my face and neck, using a circular motion. I personally see a huge difference when it comes to my scar. It is so much more hard to notice! If I keep this routine up, I feel like it will not be noticeable at all! This serum does not have a strong odor to it and it rubs on really smoothly - it is not greasy or watery at all. My skin absorbs it very quickly. I can feel it working pretty much instantly. This small bottle should last you a long time as you do not need to use much at all! If you have a scar that you hate to look at every day, I highly suggest giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I used the product 2 times a day everyday for 30 days and did not see results.  I was hopeful, but disappointed in the end.</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Azure naturals Ultimate Vitamin C Skin Repair Serum and the texture of my skin seems to have improved over the short period of time I have used this product.  I like that the Vitamin C Serum is not greasy and it seems to tighten my skin but not dry it out. It can be used twice a day and it really does seem to be improving my skin. I am quite impressed so far and am planning to continue to use this product. My skin actually really feels smoother too.</li>
    <li> So far, I am happy.  I do notie a difference following Dr. Oz&#x27;s regime.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. it help my skin feel great and look good.</li>
    <li> Great vitamin C serum! I use this with the derma roller and have great results.</li>
    <li> It works as long as you keep using it</li>
    <li> let me start out by saying that I did like this product&lt;br /&gt;Now the why that needed to be stated first stuff,&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to be on par/ comparable to most others I have tried and as a blogger I have had the chance to review several products like this and this product proved to be simply average for me.  The price point is right at about the average price point the results were about the same as any of the others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;That being said I found this product to be a bit tacky as it dried and it took a bit to absorb in. When I received my bottle I noticed the color is a bit milky/cloudy and it does have a bit of a scent that I cant quiet place and although I do not find the scent pleasant I am not turned off by it either.&lt;br /&gt;This product did give a nice brightness to my skin after just the first use and helped to lessen the dark color under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the majority of the reviews on here that this stuff is AMAZING. I am 25 years old with large pores and some blemishes, so I combine this with the retinol serum from Azure.  I have been using this for about 1 week and I can already see a vast improvement in pore size, plus my skin is SO soft now.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try out this Vitamin C serum and loved it.  This was a very light formula and soaked in very quickly to my face. I love when it soaks in very quickly it makes it so I can get my makeup on fast and get my day going.  I used the serum night and day and my face feels smoother and I have a more even skin tone.  It is a very easy product to use with the dropper and that it soaks in quickly this will not take up a lot of your routine time.  It really did not have any smell at all.  This serum could not have come at a better time with this wacky weather we have been having in Colorado my combo skin was really acting up.  My face is now even and softer and I am loving it.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly; not greasy; works to reduce appearance of sun spots; made my skin softer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None as of now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum! It is easy to apply and it works! I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I notice my chest where I have the most sun spot damage is lightening up and much more soft. Also have been using it on a cut that would have turned into a bad scar. This Vitamin C helped the scar not become very visible, and it made it softer and just completely helped to blend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product on my face, around my eyes, on my neck, shoulders, and as mentioned before, my chest. I have started to use it on my legs, just to see if it makes them any brighter or softer, no results yet, but I will keep you updated :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for around two weeks now and have seen a huge improvement in my skin. I&#x27;m 34 years old and have tried so many skin care products that did not work or caused me to break out. I&#x27;m so happy I found this and will definitely repurchase and recommend.</li>
    <li> They offer a one year money back guarantee. That is very reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains vitamin C and E and hyaluronic acid among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that they tell you that the best results come with consistent use. Some products claim that you will see results instantly...now some results do happen instantly...your face feels nice and it starts to help any sun damage you have. The thing it it doesn&#x27;t necessarily show up so you can SEE it till after you have used it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work though. It doesn&#x27;t take the place of sunscreen but it can definitely help.</li>
    <li> I have tried various products for my skin, as well as various vitamin c serums, and this is by far one of the best! This was super simple to use and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation on my skin.</li>
    <li> Enjoy my product great experience</li>
    <li> This stuff is so cool! I can&#x27;t speak for long term results yet but what it does when you put it on is amazing. Check out my review on blogger for pictures of it in action, name is ReviewStuffz. I did get this product for free to review via tomoson. As a hint though my face feels softer and tighter (looks better too)every time I use it  so I like using it first thing in the morning but you can use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> only receive half the order, and what I did receive I&#x27;m not going to re-order.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels great going on and filled me with hope that my fine lines would disappear. I was sorely disappointed. After a few months of use, the only noticeable difference in my skin was that it was breaking out like crazy. It may smell nice and feel nice, but the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. Save your money.</li>
    <li> It made me very energetic</li>
    <li> It is what you need, at the strengths you need, in the combination you need for hydrating&lt;br /&gt;and brings back that youthful look. As an esthetician, it is quite the value. When you pat this&lt;br /&gt;oil onto your face and then use your Sonic facial brush with your regular day or night moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;cream, it will go deeper into the tissue for an amazing look.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to use this product much. It has a very off putting smell.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this is working as advertised, but in the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, my skin does feel tighter and more hydrated. That could also be because I&#x27;m actually moisturizing it and paying attention to it. This feels smooth and easily absorbs into my skin, but doesn&#x27;t feel any different from aloe vera gel. I have noticed reduced redness to my skin (I have rosacea) and that is a huge bonus!</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  Upon the first application my skin felt tighter and more elastic!  Now i have been applying it daily for a week and have seen significant changes in my dark spots and fine lines!  I am in LOVE!!</li>
    <li> All the reviews have been so outstanding and describe in wonderful detail what, I too, am experiencing with this serum. Luminous would accurately describe my skin after using for only a few weeks. No breakouts, no pore clogging, and no sensitivities have been observed which would, in my opinion, speak for the purity of the product, and I am, shall I say, 65+ with super sensitive skin. The dropper in the bottle is very efficient, easily useable, unlike some other serum bottles I have tried. All in all, an awesome product!</li>
    <li> It is the best product I&#x27;ve used. I have oily skin and have tried different brands and products and nothing had made me feel so fresaca and see results in my skin in such a short time. Definitely highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I feel my face very smooth and soft, but i just don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s making major changes yet....i have been using it for a couple of weeks or more i guess have to wait more. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have only been adding vitamin c recently into my nightly skincare regimen and surprisingly for the first products I used, my skin reacted - irritated red spots in various areas of my face. But with Azure Naturals, I didn&#x27;t get any reactions at all. Compared to the other serums I have tried this one has hyaluronic acid which I am thankful for since I have dry skin. I&#x27;d say after a week or so I noticed that I have smoother, suppler skin. For the past week, I also used this for spot treatment for a rash that miraculously appeared in my jaw line. Every night I would dab a bit more in that area and the result for the next couple of days was astounding. It dried off &amp; I can pull of the remains &amp; for the next few days, the then rough patches became smoother &amp; soft to touch. So far I am loving it! Best one to date.</li>
    <li> This serum will increase cellular renewal by boosting the collagen and elastin in the skin.It contains powerful antioxidants that prevent the formation from free radicals and can reduce sunburn cells. This serum is light weight and thin allowing for deep penetration into the skin. Even though it is thin and lightweight it is not runny or watery. It does not leave a greasy feeling to the skin. It has a light scent and is not overwhelming to the nose. Just like we take care of our bodies, we need to do the same for our skin, and this is your answer to better skin. Vitamin C serum will repair damage from the sun and environmental dangers. With that being said though this is not a sunscreen and sunscreen should still be worn. This serum does not dry out the skin, however if dryness is experienced, it means you are using too much. If you already have dry skin start out using it slowly especially around the dry areas. This product is safe for all skin types including those with eczema. I only use this once a day but it can be used twice a day. I wash and pat dry my face. I then apply my toner. I allow the toner to skin into my skin and dry. Then I apply the Vitamin C Serum. On days that I do wear makeup, I then apply my makeup. My skin feels wonderful and refreshed after using this. It feels cleaner, softer, and healthier. This product will always be part of my daily skin routine. This product gets a 5/5 from me!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum and am now on my third bottle.  It really does soften and moisterize my aging skin and makes me look younger (at least I think so).  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I need to file a claim there is nothing noted where to click on this item, also 3 oz should be delivered</li>
    <li> I honestly love this product! Even though I&#x27;m 19 years old and I don&#x27;t need an anti-aging serum, this product still did a lot for my skin. It made my face feel really smooth and healthy. I also noticed a difference in my pores. I&#x27;m not really sure if this product claims to shrink pores, but it did, and I was extremely happy about that. I tend to have fairly large pores in my under eye/high cheek bone area. Also I noticed a shrinkage of bags under my eyes. This product didn&#x27;t break me out at all, even though my face wasn&#x27;t used to it, which is an A+ in my book. It felt really nice applying it to the skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel syrupy, or sticky, it&#x27;s just a nice thin liquid that also spreads really nice over your face. It leaves your face feeling refreshed. I thought I might have a problem with it drying out my skin, because I have dry skin already, but it didn&#x27;t. The product also says not to over use it or you may experience a little dryness. But just to be safe you can always apply moisturizer on afterwards, like I do. I will definitely repurchase this item because It made my face look healthy and radiant. I have not found any other products that have been as effective as this one.</li>
    <li> it what I was expecting star to use it immediately hope it work good.</li>
    <li> If you have any propensity whatsoever to get clogged pores...avoid.  I&#x27;ve been trying this for a week, and skin is a mess.  I don&#x27;t even have particularly oily skin, first day had whiteheads around nose and now have blackheads on cheeks (something I&#x27;ve never had) I kept at it thinking with these kind of reviews maybe it just took a whole and I would have to put up with the irritation and breakouts.  But on my second week of this, it&#x27;s time to call a spade a spade.  Definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> I have found another very cost effective Vitamin C serum from Azure Naturals called Ultimate C Skin Repair Serum that won&#x27;t cost you an arm and a leg like most other expensive serums out there on the market. You can get this amazing Vitamin C Serum on Amazon for just $19.95!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how you like to use your skincare products but Azure Naturals included both the dropper and the pump with their Ultimate Vitamin C Serum so no matter which way you like to get yours into your hands ready to use, its there either way. I like the dropper best because it&#x27;s easier to control how much I get and if I get too much, all I have to do is squeeze it back into the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t take much to spread all over your face and neck so use sparingly until you get the hang of how much you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate Vitamin C Serum will boost your production of collagen, which increases your skin&#x27;s rate of cellular renewal. This improved cellular turnover will make your skin&#x27;s texture visibly plumper and will firm your skin. Which is why I learned long time ago from several beauty magazines that models keep their serums and gels in the fridge so that they are ice cold when applied to help speed up this plumping action. If you don&#x27;t have a serum handy, they use ice cold water splashed on their faces to immediately shrink their pores making their skin look flawless. It&#x27;s not meant to last all day, but it works in a situation where you need to look your best for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, with consistent use of this Vitamin C Serum you will start to minimize fine lines and wrinkles. It is also perfect for your sun damaged skin. They have combined all three of the most powerful anti-oxidants available into one serum which is the Vitamin C, Ferulic Acid, and Vitamin E and when they are combined, you will get eight-fold antioxidant protection, a 96% reduction of sunburn cells, and prevent the formation of new free radicals in sun exposed skin. This will fade age spots and dramatically improve discoloration leaving your skin looking smooth and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C serum should be applied twice per day, once in the morning and at night. If you can only use the serum once, then it&#x27;s best to do so in the morning. Vitamin C serum will help protect you against future sun damage and other environmental stressors, but please use a sunscreen also! Vitamin C Serums can make some people a little more sensitive to the sun so it&#x27;s best to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin&#x27;s texture should start to improve with the first application, but give your skin at least 30 days of consistent use to see the optimal results. Remember, it took you awhile to get those fine lines and wrinkles, so it will take time to reverse some of the damage, be patient. Some people may take up to 6 or 8 weeks to see really dramatic results and within 6 months is when you will see the maximum effects. They do recommend that you use either their moisturizer and retinol on top of the Vitamin C Serum, but if you don&#x27;t have those, then please use a good moisturizer to get the best results.nd dramatically improve discoloration leaving your skin looking smooth and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C serum should be applied twice per day, once in the morning and at night.

    <li> I have been using the Azure Naturals Ultimate Vitamin C Skin Repair Serum for a week now in my face care routine. I use it twice a day. I always apply it to cleansed skin and allow it to dry.  I then apply a moisturizer and allow that to dry as well before applying whatever makeup I am wearing that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that using vitamin c serums has provided my skin a nice healthy glow and the skin appears tighter (not drawn, just a healthy tightness). The pores are less noticeable as well. My eye area simply does not look as tired now that I am using this, too. Although I am careful not to get the serum close to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a dropper full placed in the palm of my left hand. Using my right finger tips, I spread the serum evenly over the entire face, chin, and neck areas. I use a light, circular motion as I spread the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Azure Naturals has a good product and it is one I can easily recommend</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. My skin felt super smooth by the next day. I&#x27;m still currently using this product. My favorite part about this product is that its not greasy and smells really nice and clean. I even use it on my neck. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but sadly I suspect it breaks me out. My sister recommended it and she seems to like it a lot. So what doesn&#x27;t work for me may work for others.</li>
    <li> Great Serum!&lt;br /&gt;The best one that I&#x27;ve used by far. My skin feels great after use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on sun spots and my fine lines. It&#x27;s working out awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with the Retinol serum and the results have been fantastic. I highly suggest the combo to keep wrinkles under control.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has a plumpness I haven&#x27;t seen in years. LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I realize that I&#x27;m getting a little older and that just lets me know that I need to take better care of myself.  I was able to get a hold of this vitamin C serum and, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just in my head, but it feels amazing on my skin.  I usually put it on my face and shaved head after a shower.  It&#x27;s refreshing and feels like it keeps my skin in good shape.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and try to keep this review updated as I go.  So far highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I did not notice a significant difference on my skin with this product. I used the bottle till the end, and no improvements. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find another brand, and do not always believe the 5 star reviews you see in beauty products here! Make sure you check that the customers that made the review have done other reviews also!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I am a product junkie and love to try new things. I have been getting nice results, so I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum is great for brightening or even your skin tone. I have been using Vitamin C serum for a year already.This is another vitamin C serum from &amp;#34; Azure Naturals&amp;#34;. Their quality and collection is pretty good.As I have dry skin, I need some extra boost or you can say skin-food for my skin cell, and obviously I would prefer something that repair my dull skin well.I love this vitamin C serum for repairing  my dull skin. It&#x27;s brightening up your skin tone.I am not sure if it does reduce the wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have any visual wrinkles yet. I love how it absorb on my skin.You can add it with your face mask or you can add it with your daily moisturizer too. I like to apply directly before the moisturizer on my skin, so that it absorb well and help to produce more collagen for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also cute.You can either use the dropper or you can use the spray applicator.It comes with both option. I love to use it with the dropper☺</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C serum and the best I have ever bought on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am really seeing a difference in my skin.  It looks more vibrant and feels softer just after 2 weeks of use.  The customer service was awesome!  Thank you for such a great product and great customer service!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this bottle of serum last week, so it&#x27;s really too soon to tell if it makes any difference on my face.  My only negative comment is that this product is very thin, and doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant odor.  I&#x27;m gonna keep using it every night though, and will write another review, if I can tell that it is working.</li>
    <li> I notice a huge difference since using this product. i love how it softens and creates a fresh youthful look. It&#x27;s like looking well rested and them some. Great product!</li>
    <li> I still would like to try it for another month before I make a comment on this product I do like it but would like more time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Vitamin C serum to use and this was inexpensive and included other ingredients. I am really happy with my purchase. It was delivered as promised and it was correct. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product was great!  It made my skin feel fresh and renewed and helped with skin tone.  A lot of products dry out my skin but I love that this is alcohol free.  My skin felt smooth and nourished!  I would recommend this product!  Check out my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals offered a bottle of their Ultimate C Skin Repair Serum for me to try and I made sure to give it a few weeks before reviewing. With these types of products, there isn&#x27;t going to be a miracle cure, overnight magic, all-powerful change. It&#x27;s more about preventing future issues, helping your skin age gracefully, and staying healthy. What I look for is whether my skin reacts, do I break out, is there a smell or residue, and do I have any problems wearing makeup after applying a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Azure Naturals, I liked that it was super easy to use. The dropper doesn&#x27;t drip unless I squeeze it (these little things matter). The bottle color is dark, which will help keep the vitamin C stay fresher longer with less impact from the light. I didn&#x27;t break out. I didn&#x27;t have redness. I didn&#x27;t react negatively at all. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and absorbs quickly that I use it every day, sometimes twice because it&#x27;s such an easy part of my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Awesome !!! Love it !!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any change in skin...</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is critical for your body and plays an important role in maintaining healthy, resilient skin. While young skin is full of vitamin C, aging skin naturally loses this nutrient over time. Other factors like exposure to UV light, pollutants and cigarette smoke compound the decline of vitamin C, contributing to signs of aging. The good news is that you can fight back by replenishing your skin’s vitamin C levels to help to combat and even reverse time’s effect on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this serum, mostly , to help fade my melasma and sun spots.... Surprisingly it has started to help them...When it comes to treating age spots, you don’t need chemical peels and lasers – it turns out that vitamin C can have almost the same results! Age spots are essentially sun damage, and vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin. While it’s not a replacement for sunscreen, vitamin C protects against and may repair UV damage like discoloration and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell, texture and the rapid results from this serum... I did receive this product, free, for unbiased testing purposes...the opinions are my own...</li>
    <li> Loooove it!! My skin is very oily and I was looking for a serum that I could wear along with my sunscreen and makeup without feeling greasy...search is over!!! It dries very fast, its not oily or sticky at all, my face is looking a lot better . I really love this serum !!!</li>
    <li> I was given this product at no charge to review. Was a freckly nosed kid. And now as an adult I get more freckles the more I&#x27;m in the sun...except it&#x27;s now called &amp;#34;sun damage&amp;#34; :/ I received the Vitamin C serum and after 4 days I have noticed my skin tones evening out and my freckles appear less pronounced!! It&#x27;s light going on and has a pleasant (subtle) orange scent.</li>
    <li> Being from Arizona, I jumped on the opportunity to try out this product for free with the exchange of my honest opinion. My skin takes a beating with this heat and being out in the sun all day. I started using this with my morning ritual, it went on smooth and dried quickly with only a little scent to it. I have noticed a little glow in my skin, but I have only used it for almost a week. I look forward to seeing longer term results.</li>
    <li> I work in the hot sun all day and my skin is starting to show it. On day 1 I could feel the difference after using this product. and it smells GOOD! I keep rubbing my face because its hard to believe how soft my skin is already! I will be purchasing this product again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> What caught my attention was that this product contains aloe, along with other great ingredients that benefits the skin.  It has a light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. I use it morning and night, and it just take a pump or two as I also include my neck.  I highly recommend it for all the benefits!</li>
    <li> I received this free so I could review it, sadly I have used better and have switched back to my old brand of a similar mix.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product! The serum comes out more like a spray than a gel. It absorbs quickly and feels nice on my skin. It has a great, orange-citrus smell, which I loved. My face felt refreshed and it added a glow to my skin. I would purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Thick oil and not watery. Ive been using it every morning and my face doesnt feel dry anymore...</li>
    <li> Defintely recommend saw results on 7 days. Smoothrr and clearer complexion.</li>
    <li> i tryed this vitamnin c serum as free to leave a review and i loved it . it made my skin have a glow to it made my skin so soft . took away my dry skin. it smelled great. i loved how it dint leave my skin oily . loved it and worked great.will buy more.</li>
    <li> Love! It&#x27;s a wonderful product and my skin loves it. really helped to clear and brighten my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product, would love a pump instead of the dropper. Product works great!</li>
    <li>  I am delighted with my product and the ability to buy them through Skin .  I have been trying every vitamin c serum selling on the market and now i finally found the one that works great without burning my face no bad reaction for me no I rushes or any irritation . If in doubt about trying, go for it you won&#x27;t be disappointed I purchase this item under promotional products with my Honest review and own opinion.</li>
    <li> I just placed my 2nd order &amp; will continue using this serum! I cannot wait to see what new products Azure will be coming out with in the future! This is by far the most natural product I have tried &amp; actually works! It&#x27;s not just for the face... I have applied it to my chest that has some sun spots &amp; in a few weeks they have totally lightened. My face feels so smooth &amp; vibrant since I started using it! I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product:)</li>
    <li> This skin care sirum is worth every penny. Even just after 1 week I see the difference in my skin. Try it once and you will be addicted!</li>
    <li> kind of watery broke my face out</li>
    <li> Like most I picked this brand because of all the amazing reviews. I live in Canada and had it shipped to my sister in Florida because they did not ship to Canada. I bought 3 60 ml bottles and used them all before I made this review. I followed the directions and used it morning and night and I have not noticed in anyway a change to my skin if anything I look worse, my skin looks horrible. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> just bought it and using it every other day. So far no issues. Good product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I noticed a definite difference in my skin, however the brown spots are still visible; which is disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great for sun damaged face.</li>
    <li> It waas already turning Yellow when I revieved it in the mail!  Not Good! only had a few days to ues it before it was no longer good.</li>
    <li> I received this Vitamin C Serum from Azure Naturals to try and review. This serum is great! I love Vitamin C. It is not only good for improving wrinkles, it is also good for preventing them. And it clears up scarring on the face as well as redness. This serum is a quality product. It has extra vitamin E and an Amino Complex.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this product! it wasn&#x27;t sticky or oily it was just right. I tested this product for a good while befor making this blog I wanted to make sure that what I review is real and works and i&#x27;m surprised that Azure Naturals ULTIMATE VITAMIN C Serum did have an effect on the diffrent colors my skin tends to have it over time evened them out I still need to use this product longer and maybe one day I will have even skin again with the results I see now i&#x27;m hope-full quite hope-full! #azurenaturals</li>
    <li> I have paid 2x as much for similar product.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find something that works at a reasonable price.  Delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference. They have so many products that you don&#x27;t know what works.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I have used this every day, morning and night for two months.  Does that little line in between my brows look a little less noticeable?  If I wanted to talk myself into that idea I probably could.  On the other hand I could be a sceptic and say that it did absolutely nothing and not be lying either.  It&#x27;s all in what you want to believe.  In any case, nobody has come dashing up to me saying, &amp;#34;OMG, you look ten years younger!  Did you have a facelift?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets a bog fat &amp;#34;MEH&amp;#34; from me.</li>
    <li> To all of those who care about quality skincare this is an amazing product. When I picked it up from my post office I put it on my hand and it absorbed quickly and my hand was instantly and incredibly smooth and soft. I then applied it to my neck and the same result. I will be purchasing the Retinol next. When I purchased this Vitamin C Serum from Azure Naturals contacted me just to say thank you. Can you believe that?? When does a company ever reach out with a personal touch. That never happens. Before I received my product Jamie offered me a 20% discount on my next order. If you contact them they get right back to you and not make you wait for days. I really like this company and their Vitamin C Serum. I cannot wait to buy the Retinol. Try it honestly you won&#x27;t be disappointed. And if for any reason you are from my brief experience already I am confident that they will help you. This is a company that takes pride in their product line and cares about their customers. What more could anyone want or expect. Great product, great company, nice people to do business with.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 3 weeks now, and I like it ! It wasn&#x27;t easy to apply it at first, it has a water consistence, but I use few drops on my fingers at a time, apply to my face and add more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;It has a herbal smell, and makes my skin feel tight. I apply my Una Brennan moisturizer after wards, which works great with the serum. Azure Natural serum helped lightened my dark spots and brightened my skin drastically, even my husband noticed that and mentioned that my face is no more dull :)</li>
    <li> I accidentally sent a review I didn&#x27;t finish (on the wrinkle repair cream). Oh well. I love this stuff. I went to my 6 year old sons friends&#x27; birthday party. One of the moms thought I was the teenaged sister of the 6 year old birthday girl. Lol. Obviously this stuff is doing something. I&#x27;m 30, was a smoker for ten years (have been a non smoker for 95 days!!), and have some sun damage. But hey. Apparently I look 14. Lol. Awesome stuff b</li>
    <li> smells like witch hazel, will never purchase again. JUNK&amp;#62;  CSI vitamin C serum much better from Vitacost.</li>
    <li> I find that it dries my skin  quite a bit ,  still waiting to see result .&lt;br /&gt;maybe to  early to tell.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of skin care products. Some work well for me, some irritate my skin and some I really see no difference. Topical C serums are one of a handful of products I find make a difference--medium and long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topical Vitamin C is believed to boost the production of collagen and elastin. It is also a powerful anti-oxidant. Some benefits to using vitamin C include smoother skin, faster healing, improved elasticity, evening of skin tone and more. I know that sounds miraculous, just remember improvements are incremental and there is only so much a topical product can do. The difference I&#x27;ve personally see is in the evenness of my skin color. I tend to easily get freckles or sun spots on my very fair skin. I do wear a good sunscreen, but sometimes if I exercise outside or use an outdoors pool I still get spots. The C serum does help with that, but the change is gradual. Also, my skin feels smoother and needs less exfoliation to look good when I use a C serum daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above is generally true for any well formulated C Serum. So now I will focus on this serum. I have used it for a few weeks. I haven&#x27;t broke out from it and my skin shows all the results I usually get from on-going C serum use.  So it seems mild and well formulated. I like that it is affordable--the C serums I use to get were more expensive. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a more expensive C Serum as there are more affordable options like this one that pretty much have the same ingredients.  This serum felt a little sticky at first, but it quickly absorbs and I can forget I applied it. I like to apply C Serum after cleansing and before applying a moisturizer or sunscreen. If I am using other serums, I apply the C first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With any new product,  I suggest reading the ingredients list first to see whether it contains anything you are sensitive to. The try doing a patch test in a small area the day before you use it. If that goes well, I usually introduce more potent products by using them on alternate days for a week. Some C serums do lightly irritate my skin, but this one has not. But everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Keep in mind I am not a medical or skin care professional. These tips are just from someone who has tried a lot of products and who regularly uses new products for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product to review. I used it for about 3 weeks as I like to use skin care products for a while before reviewing.otent products by using them on alternate days for a week.

    <li> Love this product! Does what they say it does, no breakouts or negative skin reactions. My age spots have faded a lot too!</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK, DON&#x27;T BOTHER BUYING IT!!!!</li>
    <li> this product comes really fast in the mail, i have repurchased it several times.  I would recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using over 4 weeks and I see results.....yeah!....almost finished with the bottle and plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> Did nothing - wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  Plain 100% hylauronic acid is where it&#x27;s at and I will stick with that.  This is nothing like the other ferulic acids on the market but many of the others are animal-tested so.....I don&#x27;t think this one is.  That&#x27;s the only thing really going for it.</li>
    <li> Dries the skin a lot.</li>
    <li> Being in the beauty business I have tried many products.  I not only notice a difference in my skin but my coworker who is an esthetician wanted to know what I have been using on my face.  The only new thing I tried was Azure serum.  It makes me look younger and I like the fact that you can use it around the eyes.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about two months and have noticed a more smooth tone to my skin. Recently someone looked at me and said I looked like I had a face lift.  LOL  I did not tell her my secret, but thanked her for the compliment.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle and I like it even better than the first!  Evens out skin tone fades dark spots and I feel like it even makes my pores look smaller and not sure why but the product now has a really pleasant not strong lemony smell. Will forever be a staple</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any smell or care if it came in a box, just want a product that works. I am a believer that you don&#x27;t always have to pay top dollar to get a good product, but in this case, you don&#x27;t get much.  This serum feels smooth &amp; silky going on, but to me, seems more like Vitamin E (listed in the ingredients) than C.  Though my skin felt soft, I saw no improvement at all in the way Vitamin C should work. There was ZERO tingling, as has always been the case with more well known vitamin C products that worked for me &amp; that contained lesser concentrations (10 &amp; 12%).  Overall, would not recommend or buy again, as I found it believe to be in-effective.</li>
    <li> This high potent Vit. C serum surely makes the other skin care products boost their efficacy/ performance in skin care. Vit. C serums are a must, as I&#x27;ve always advised my skin clients. - Yvette (Esthetician)</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel smooth, but don&#x27;t really see any anti-aging effects.</li>
    <li> I have used many vitamin C serums in the past and most of them I do like because you usually cannot go wrong with adding a little vitamin c to your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt; It comes in a easy to apply brown bottle with a dropper. The fact that it is in the brown bottle shields the light from coming in and change the properties of the serum. The dropper applicator helps you apply as little or as much as you want. Just a note; a little goes a long way (a few drops all over). I am about 95% satisfied with this product and the 5% that is missing to make it perfect for me is that it is missing the citrus scent that I prefer. And yes I am fully aware that vitamin c can be derived from other sources than orange.The face texture has improved with added collagen and more elastin. I only apply once a day but it can be used twice (day and night). Because there aren&#x27;t any chemicals it is safe to use on all skin types.&lt;br /&gt; I am also happy that this product is backed by Azure Naturals one year money back guarantee. With that type of backing try using for it to repair sun damage, reduce wrinkles, fade age spots and more.</li>
    <li> Love it. It goes on smooth.  My skin looks and feels great. I love that it comes in a spray bottle. Ive had one that came in a dropper and wasn&#x27;t so impressed because opening it and exposing it to air sometimes can damage the product.</li>
    <li> Too sticky, couldn&#x27;t wear it under anything and it took a long time to dry, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin really either.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to someonr</li>
    <li> Love this product -I am using it now for 3 weeks -  i can feel my skin tightening as it dry on my face - after a week of 2 times a day usage - i start to see the difference.... it is the best thing i ever used. my skin is so soft and i feel confident again to go out without a foundation cream .... i feel like i want to show off my skin .... of course with the foundation cream i look like a pro just did my makeup...i truly recommend this product - i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great for out in the sun</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is the perfect serum! The texture leaves my skin very soft, making it perfect for application of makeup. I don&#x27;t wear as much makeup as I did a few years ago. Makeup and aging are tricky. Consistency is key to any product, and my skin is in much better shape than it was before I started using this. The price is right for my pocketbook. I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Make my face look so luminous.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I can see some changes already.  Love that I received it so fast.</li>
    <li> This is the best product, you will see a difference, Ultimate Vitamin C</li>
    <li> My favorite Vitamin C (etc!) serum, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have purchased it multiple times.</li>
    <li> Product did not work!!! This was a replacement for another similar product on Amazon by Jolie, which worked wonderfully but is no longer available. After using the product by Azure Naturals, the positive results I got from Jolie were reversed. I could see the reversal after about 1 month. It has now been 4 months. I was just too busy to get back online and finish researching which product to try next, but wow! though I continued to use it, but the reversal has just continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 1/20/2015. Azure Naturals did refund my money promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie wrote me, \\&quot;I can tell you that a one ounce bottle is designed to last 4-6 weeks. If you have had the bottle since September and still have 1/3 left you were not applying enough serum or using to infrequently to see good results. All skin care products are like exercise. They require consistent use to see the benefits.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replied to her, \\&quot;I used your product exactly as I have used similar products in the past (products I now longer used either because of changed formulations or no longer available). I used two drops on my fingers on my eyes morning and night.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that I may have forgotten to apply it once in a while, but I used it just like I&#x27;ve used similar products, with which I got great results. And, I was only using it on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and noticed it&#x27;s different than my 1st bottle I ordered 4 months ago.  The first change I noticed was the scent, it&#x27;s more citrusy smelling which is nice but the other scent didn&#x27;t bother me like other reviewers.  I was using the expensive Rodan and Fields line with vitamin C and it had the same funky smell so I knew Azure Natural&#x27;s vitamin C had similar properties.  Secondly, the new formula seems thicker than before which is nice and makes application easier.  It looks like Azure Naturals is listening to feedback here as those were some complaints.  As far as the results, it does give my complexion a brighter younger appearance, didn&#x27;t get rid of my age spots, maybe lighten them but nothing I&#x27;ve tried has gotten rid of them.  I used this with the Azure&#x27;s retinol and liked the way my skin felt, smooth.  I like to mix this with my rose hip and frankenscense oils and pat on the face, then apply their retinol.  The real test was when my sister came into town recently and asked me what was I doing to my skin differently because it was glowing and youthful!  Good things to hear when you are 45!  So far so good, will update review if the new changes affect current results.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks and see a dramatic difference in fine lines and brightness. I even got my husband hooked on it! I&#x27;m hoping the company extends the line to a moisturizer and eye cream.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C with the low price that we cannot get nowhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully ever since I received it weeks ago.  Am on my second bottle and it&#x27;s almost gone, so I have given it plenty of time to &#x27;work&#x27;.  I must say it is a waste of money, just like all the other products that claim to improve lines and wrinkles.  It has done NOTHING for me.  I don&#x27;t expect the lines and wrinkles to vanish,but I did expect that they be lessened,.  They are not.  I took a picture before use, and one now . . . absolutely no change.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference but it has only been a couple weeks I think.</li>
    <li> Very nice texture, smells great too.</li>
    <li> Brighter smoother skin.</li>
    <li> feels good on my skin and brightens it</li>
    <li> After receiving  product the seller informed me that a good addition to the products purchased was their Hyaluronic acid.  This made me question the product I purchased!  Does it not have the proper amount of Hyaluronic acid??  I was counting on this product having the correct ingredient combination!  Now I wonder if I purchased the wrong thing!  I purchased (2) bottles.  I feel I should return what I bought as it may not be what I was searching for.</li>
    <li> works the best for the price!</li>
    <li> Has helped even out my skin tone and more smooth</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the positive reviews and thought I&#x60;d use it in addition to the R&amp; F reverse regimen. I have been using the R&amp; F for 3 months and the Vitamin C serum for 6 weeks, but I cannot see any noticable improvements in my sunspots or anything else for that matter. I am fortunate to have very good skin and only minor discoloration ( I&#x60;m in my 40s) I noticed a couple of areas of slight discoloration after having a baby 3 years ago and thought it would be fairly easy to reverse that with a good skincare line with lightening effect. But even this powerful combination does not seem t omake a noticible difference. The serum also smells unpleasant to me and is cloudy looking. I have to moisturize quickly after putting it on, otherwise my skin feels tight. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I love this, sun spots are gone.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time I was very happy and I love the product</li>
    <li> Great will buy again as part of my skin care regiment</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t really tell it has made any improvements. And there are plenty needed. :)</li>
    <li> Even after just 5 days, my skin feels and looks smoother, happier, and sunspots seem to be fading. I use it before daily sunscreen application.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. She if fair skinned and loves to spend time out doors in the Utah mountains. She was starting to get a little depressed because the spots and wrinkles on here face and neck from the sun were starting to make her look, as she put it, &amp;#34;old.&amp;#34; She has been using  Azure for about 3 months now and those little sunspots around her eyes and cheeks have faded and the crow&#x27;s feet around her eyes are much less pronounced. My wife calls it &amp;#34;The Fountain of Youth.&amp;#34; She really does love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff totally dried my skin out. I used it for a week and my skin couldn&#x27;t take anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dr. Oz 20% serum but decided to try this one based on the price, reviews and the fact that it&#x27;s 22%. I didn&#x27;t really expect to see any difference, BUT I DID! It has a nice citrus scent and it&#x27;s a little thicker than other serums I&#x27;ve used and I like that. It keeps it from running through my fingers before I can get it on my face. My skin looks and feels healthier and brighter. I&#x27;ve used a vitamin C serum for a few years now because my dermatologist recommended I do so (along with every beauty article you read now days). Honestly, I&#x27;ve never been very sure that it&#x27;s made any difference at all until now. I have a new &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> first, i was kind of doubt it&#x27;s really effective because i have used some of other products, but this one works well. as recommended, i purchased one vitamin c serum and one ultimate retinol. it has been for four days of using those products, and the result is amazing. my skin feels very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;another excellent thing for this company is the customer service. very quick response and kind. i made my mistake, but they helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> *I received this product for free to write a review; regardless all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other Vitamin C Serums the price is fabulous and works just as well as its competitors. Not only is Vit C and Hyaluronic Acid great for your skin (Hyaluronic Acid is also called the Fountain of Youth), but Vitamin C can also help protect your skin from future damage (you should still apply sunscreen after applying your Vitamin C Serum as it only blocks UV rays).</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot.  Works well on simi oily skin.  Does well under makeup.  Great to use with Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time but I believe its making my skin look better.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Vitamin C is highly effective and this works very well; I like the high ammount of vitamin C unlike some brands. It is helping fine lines and age spots very well and keeping my skin flawless; glowing and clear. Highly recommend this brand!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I love it!  I use it every mining and night and my skin is looking better!</li>
    <li> great product for aging, wrinkles, redness and large pores.</li>
    <li> I used another product with the same ingredients as this for the spring and summer with beautiful results to my skin. I started using this in September. I can&#x27;t believe that this product has the same ingredients as the one I fell in love with. If they are the same, they are not as pure. With in a week my skin was blotchy puffy and fine lines were very visable again. I continued to use it through September to make sure It was not hormone blotches and breakouts. it never got better. so I have switched back to the other product even though it cost more and with in a few days all is better again. I am glad it has worked for others I do sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product. There are several things that I was initially impressed by.  The consistency this product is great.  It is not too watery and not too gel like.  The dropper makes it easy to control how much product you apply.  The smell is mild and not unpleasant.  All good things so I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple days I felt a weird tingling sensation after applying this. It almost felt like an allergic reaction but not as intense so I assumed it was just a normal side effect of application. After a couple more days of use the reaction subsided but my skin started to develop some odd bump like blemishes.  It wasn&#x27;t where I typically break out and didn&#x27;t look like normal acne.  I opted to stop using this product and the bumps went away after a few days. I honestly can&#x27;t say this product was the cause but I&#x27;m leery of trying to continue using this product.  It couldn&#x27;t have been something else but this is the only new item I added to my routine so it seems like the most likely culprit. There are hundreds of reviews on this product which are overwhelmingly positive so I&#x27;m likely the exception to the rule and doubt others will have the same issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product to review.</li>
    <li> The packaging for this product has recently changed, and it seems like the product may have changed slightly as well. I bought this a few months ago, and have used it every morning. I think it is quite effective, and I like the pleasant citrus smell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my second bottle yesterday. It now has a pump dispenser, which is easier to use compared to the dropper bottle. The ingredients appear to be the same - the product however, feels thinner in consistency, and the fragrance seems just slightly different, but still fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied some from my last bottle on one side of my face and neck, and from the new bottle on the other. The serum from the older bottle stung a little bit around my eye, and as always remained a bit sticky on my skin until it absorbed (5-10 minutes.) The serum from the new bottle spread very easily, and absorbed almost immediately. This could be a plus for some people, but it does make me question whether the product will work as well. I will try to update in a month or two with my opinion as to its effectiveness compared the the earlier bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE YEAR LATER: I still enjoy this product, and am about to order again. It smells great, and really makes my skin feel &amp;#34;tighter.&amp;#34; The pump dispenser is just SO much easier to use, I find I&#x27;m more religious about putting it on every morning. In the evening,  I use Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Retinol PM serum,  [[ASIN:B002VJSGO0 Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM 1 Fluid Ounce]]which is the only &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; item in my routine. (I only mention this because it seems fair to note that this C serum is not the only thing I&#x27;ve been using.) Between these two products, I&#x27;ve seen really good improvement in my skin texture - with smaller pores and diminished wrinkles. In short, I find this reasonably priced and effective - and I bumped the star rating from a 4 to a 5.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the past week and I can already tell a difference in the feel and look of my skin where it was applied.  I suffer from eczema and psoriasis on different areas of my body, and this serum has really helped with that as well - especially on the dry areas where my psoriasis usually forms (elbows).  I also love how easy it is to apply with the spray bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product contains no alcohol (so many other brands use it), no parabens, and that it is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Second bottle purchased and I like how my skin is looking. The serum gets absorbed into the skin quickly and the mild scent is pleasant and unobtrusive. The product seems to promote skin clarity and I see a subtle improvement with elasticity. It doesn&#x27;t seem to eliminate age spots and sun damage entirely, but with daily use, it seems to fade them away slightly. I use this product in conjunction with a BHA exfoliant + moisturizer for night or moisturizer with sunscreen for day. The packaging is good as well.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is the most perfect thing to put on my face after washing it! I love that you can use the dropper, which lets you dispense JUST the right amount of product for your face (no wasting!).  The serum itself is refreshing - a slight citrus scent but not super sticky. I received this for review, and I love layering this under my daily moisturizer! This is made with natural and organic ingredients - you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter she loves it</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesnt even deserve one star.</li>
    <li> Loved it the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> So far I love this serum.  It makes your skin feel tighter and softer as soon as you apply.  Too early to know about the effects on dark spots on the skin but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, have been using it for a little over 4 weeks and seeing good results already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ordered the 1 oz,, was a nice thickness; this time, the 2 oz is watery. It smells the same and feels the same once on, but it&#x27;s harder to apply the fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading other reviews, I find many people mentioning a pump or dropper, both being included. I&#x27;ve only received the pump.</li>
    <li> Excellent Vitamin C Serum.....haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results, but I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived obviously expired.  Cloudy formula with a horrible smell when you put it on your face.  So disgusted.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Didnt really see a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Very sticky and not as moisturizing. Absolutely smells great though...</li>
    <li> I think it works as well as the more expensive brand....</li>
    <li> My sister loves this product and I got it for her so she didn&#x60;t have to worry about having to get it at the store in person.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I really like this vitamin c serum, the only down side to me is that it leaves you feeling a little sticky for a while after applying. That is fairly common for serums I have tried though</li>
    <li> Like the product &amp; is reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels after I apply this product.</li>
    <li> Can see some results when used consistantly.</li>
    <li> tightens droopy skin immeditately.</li>
    <li> I did not see anything fantastic~~~~</li>
    <li> Amazon website boldly states 22% vitamin C, 11% hyaluronic acid, 1% vitamin E, 1% ferulic acid, no fragrance - which is why I purchased this item.  It does contain phenoxyethanol which is a preservative, however I don&#x27;t know the percentage which should be less than 1%.  I wish the bottle label included ALL these percentages to backup the website advertising page.  Serum has citrus aroma, cloudy consistency, pump bottle, packaged in bubble wrap.  Have been using this serum for a month but don&#x27;t notice any results.  This serum is incorporated in my arsenal of skin health - organic sugar scrub, camu camu mask (vitamin C), glycolic acid 14%, tretinoin (vitamin A), organic coconut oil (vitamin E), physical sunscreen zinc oxide 14.5%, scarf to protect neck/decollete, sungloves to protect backs of hands...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Vitamin C Serum and this product is a very good price.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, so didn&#x27;t expect to see a lot of improvement yet.  Since I&#x27;m in my mid 70&#x27;s, the deeper wrinkles are caused by sagging skin, so I&#x27;m not sure how much any facial product can be expected to help.  (A face lift would be the best solution.)  I&#x27;m hopeful for some improvement, intend to use my complete supply and see if there is a difference at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two bottles and got the discount price plus free shipping.  Since I was the first order in our area, the seller sent me an additional bottle free of charge.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this works.. I haven&#x27;t used it but a few weeks. I have been complimented on my &amp;#34;young looking&amp;#34; complexion.. So, I don&#x27;t know if it works, but it makes me feel like it does!! I should know more in a few months..</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item and have already noticed a difference in my skin tone and texture.  This serum is amazing.  I also notice the lines around my eyes are less noticeable.  I will definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for the first time.  Upon opening......found that the dropper inside had been busted.....</li>
    <li> Being older, 70&#x27;s it does help.  Wish I&#x27;d had it in my 30&#x27;s;-)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin after almost 2 months hopefully that will change!</li>
    <li> Product is as good as any I have tried and price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> this will keep old away works great</li>
    <li> No evident benefits or change</li>
    <li> I am very into Vit C serums if you have seen any of my posts.&lt;br /&gt;This Ultimate Vitamin C Skin Repair is a watery like consistence and applies easily. There is no wait time for the product to dry. It does have a slight smoky like scent to it with a mixture with a mix of a very light floral scent. Upon application I also notice a slight cooling sensation while it is drying and after it dries. This might be from the witch hazel that is in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this Vit C serum is my second step in my skin care routine. After I cleanse,I&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a toner, Vit C serum, Hyaluronic Serum and moisturizer twice a day. If you are consistent with use you will notice an improvement in your skins texture and look.  Consistency is the key to see any results. I was sent for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I know that some people take longer to see results but I&#x27;m not seeing anything.  The formulation was a little cloudy, but it was whitish and not at all yellow, but the smell is... hotdogs?  Maybe I should have contacted the company but I read that they make each batch every week and it should be fresh.  I read another review that said it smelled like citrus, but mine definitely did NOT smell like citrus or nothing.  There&#x27;s a definite odor and it isn&#x27;t pleasant.  I was willing to forgo the odor issue is the product worked but I&#x27;m not seeing any firmness or anything.  Maybe I got a bad batch? I don&#x27;t know. The price isn&#x27;t too bad, but it is expensive when the item doesn&#x27;t work.  I was disappointed because I saw so many good reviews.  I guess I should be skeptical when I see a product with only glowing reviews.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  Definitely decreasing color in my age spots.  Have bought more!</li>
    <li> I really live this vitamin c serum  you do not need much. I bought the 1 oz because they an go bad at 3 months . I keep mine in the fridge to keep it fresh.  I did contact the company they said it should stay good until it all gone so that should be around 5 to 6 months. You use very little of this I use two drops on my face 2 more on my neck and back of hands . It&#x27;s a good serum and I hope it does last for 5 to 6 months like the said . They also said it has a 2 year self life not two sure of this but it has a money back guarantee .</li>
    <li> works well for me, love how it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> This was my second bottle ordered. Has helped my kin alot</li>
    <li> Take product claims and super excellent reviews with a big &amp;#34;pinch of salt&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;End of the day it&#x27;s one&#x27;s own personal opinion that counts. I bought this subsitute  product only because the brand I was using  with great satisfaction, Salvere Vitamin C Serum was not availabe at Amazon for couple of weeks . Azure Naturals was a total disappointment for these reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1) It was a thin watery solution&lt;br /&gt;2) I did not like the smell (subjective)&lt;br /&gt;3) Last but most important, after use of 1 bottle (I ordered 2) I suddenly saw the appearance of darkish patches on my face. I immediately stopped applying the Serum.&lt;br /&gt;Now back to using my Salvere Vitamin C product which I am happy with.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I have been using it since 2 months ago. It&#x27;s easy to put on. The Serum moisturize and tight the skin wonderfully. You will see the improvement of your skin within few days of use. The best of all, that this Serum is Natural and organic.</li>
    <li> absorb easily by face. And smells good</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  I use it especially at night under my other facial serums.  It has a most pleasant fragrance and is very moisturizing with the aloe and hylauronic acid mixed in with the Vitamin C serum.  I intend on continuing to use it every day.  This is a good regime to use in place of typical retinol creams and serums, which I quit using entirely due to concerns with the retinol chemicals.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about another product that claimed to remove dark spots. I gave this a try and I have been using it for 2 months now. My light spots faded within 2 weeks and my darker ones are now on there way out... You have to give it time but I do see a difference. My smile lines have gotten less deep.. I believe that if you continue with this you will be happy...</li>
    <li> A really great product.I use this in the am and before bedtime.My skin feels smoother and :tighter.Have been using it for about 2 months and will continue to.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 3 months now and see ZERO results.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for a week and can see and feel  a difference. This is an excellent product and  will update in several weeks of use. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I wish there were different scents but otherwise a good product</li>
    <li> My first experience with a hyaluronic acid product wasn’t that great, as it smelled like sweaty armpits. True story.  Nevertheless, when I was offered the opportunity to try the Azure Naturals Ultimate Vitamin C Skin Repair Serum that contains hyaluronic acid, I welcomed the opportunity.  After all, vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, as well as other ingredients in this product, such as Vitamin E and Amino Complex, all have fabulous benefits that contribute to fighting the signs of aging.  If I let one bad product hinder me from trying others, I would surely look close to 200 years old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C is said to minimize the signs of aging by increasing collagen production.  One way to enhance the effects of a product such as this is to use it in conjunction with a derma roller, which is exactly what I did.  If you’re not familiar with what a derma roller is and does, feel free to check out my review of a derma roller, which can be found on my profile.  Nevertheless, following consistent daily use of this product, I can see the progress my skin has made as a result.  The fine lines on my forehead have plumped up dramatically, including a scar that has been visibly apparent since early childhood.  I was extremely impressed when I saw the difference this product made when it came to the appearance of my scar.  Of course, it didn’t disappear, but I didn’t expect it to either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen some references to the scent and look of this product.  First of all, there is a scent.  Many of the reviews I have read suggest the product does not have a scent.  I am extremely sensitive to smells and can assure you this is not odor-free.  The good news, however, is that it smells delightful, like oranges.  Others have made reference to a cloudy look.  If the product had been cloudy, I definitely would have been hesitant to try it before doing additional extensive research.  However, my product was crystal clear with no cloudy appearance or film.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this product effective, it is priced right as well.  I plan on ordering another shipment very soon!it is priced right as well.  I plan on ordering another shipment very soon!</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review until I had used the product long enough that I should see results. I like this serum the best out of others I have tried and just reordered 2 more, one for my mom as she noticed the lines around my mouth had greatly diminished and asked what I was using. I told her Vitamin C serum and she wanted one as a gift for Mother&#x27;s Day. I think this product does work well and it feels very nice on my skin. It is not irritating at all, does not feel drying, and I feel a tightening of my skin a few seconds after application. I use the product completely on my face and neck, even under my eyes (hey that&#x27;s where the lines are/were), but I do not use it on my eyelids. Let it dry (takes only a few seconds) then put my moisturizer and makeup on over it. The fine lines around my eyes (and mouth as stated) have diminished greatly and my whole eye area and face look brighter. Pores are definitely smaller as well. Feeling better about my skin everyday :) I do believe I look younger and others do not think I&#x27;m in my mid-40s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to add that I have tried various Vitamin C serums to see which ones I like best (the reasonably priced ones). I have researched the ingredients in each of the serums I&#x27;ve purchased and while they all had pretty good ingredients that are suppose to be good for your skin, I have found differences in each of them and is why I re-purchased Azure Naturals Vitamin C serum as I like the consistency, the way it makes my skin feel, there is no smell (that I can tell), not too mention seeing results :) The first serum I tried was the consistency of water and I did not really see any results.  I then tried Azure (liked it) but then found another serum on Amazon that supposedly had every ingredient that should make me look 20 years younger (hoping). I purchased that one and could not use it more that 4 days. I had serious irritation to my skin (rash, drying, irritated all day) each time I used it.  I had read that L-Ascorbic Acidis suppose to be the best for skin results, however the Sodium ascorbyl phosphate in Azure Naturals is working for me and does not irritate my skin. Azure Naturals is the serum I will stay with. Love getting a discount too!</li>
    <li> I have used Cellex C serum for about 4 years and loved it but not the price...so I gave this a try...I see no deteriation of my skin in any way so it is maintaining what I have kept in good condition with the high priced product.  I have now reordered so I will give it another couple of months and good exams with my 10X MAG MIRROR and give a follow up with my next order.  I am 75 so if my skin is going to go to pot it would go quicker than a younger person...stay tuned</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my scars for about a week and they have almost lighten to nothing. Not to mention on even and smooth This serum makes my face feel and look. I definitely recommend this. and such a great price!</li>
    <li> I see that there are a lot of Vitamin C serums on the market now. This is the first time I have ever used this type of product for my face and am happy with the results. The bottle I received from Azure Naturals came with an eye dropper or a squirt top. I have been using the squirt top and then spraying the serum into my hand. I then rub the liquid between my hands and onto my face. It has an unique smell that I think is quite pleasant. It instantly absorbs into my skin so there is no mess, and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product I&#x27;ve tried is \\&quot;professional strength,\\&quot; so I know it is of the highest quality and can give the best results. I am also happy to report that the Azure Naturals Vitamin C serum is made in the USA, which is always a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think this is a product worth trying out to see what it can do for you. Because of the sun, elements, and aging, our skin needs all the help it can get. Azure Naturals Vitamin C may be just the thing to fill in those gaps with the nutrients our skin lacks and needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This leaves your skin smooth and feeling hydrated. The smell of oranges is great instead of chemicals or a bad smell. I used this on my arms to try and lesson the appearance of freckles and sun spots. I believe that the sun spots are starting to fade a few shades. I would purchase this in the future. Thanks to iLoveToReview, I was able to try this for free but all the opinions are of own.</li>
    <li> I guess it is working.  It goes on easily and the supply lasts a LONG time. Not too expensive either. I use it under my retinol - Vitamin C first, then retinol, both Azure, then end up with my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Non greasy serum that soaks in immediately. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping my skin yet, it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks. It smells great! I know the benefits of vitamin C for skin care and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s ok but too watery it goes into your fingers, so put drop by drop and it works fine, absorbs well</li>
    <li> Mix it in with my moisturizer every morning and it feels great, leaving no greasy feeling. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This smells so nice. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and already I see my fine lines disappearing! This is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a facial serum, regarding  natural and organic ingredients that really work. As soon as I apply this serum, my skin is instantly toned and more firm. I use it day and night. It works great under my moisturizer. I will definitely be buying another bottle when I run out!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product and seller. The seller sent me helpful tips about the best ways to use the product, it came very fast and they DOUBLED my order (when I already thought I got a great deal!) As for the product, I love it too. My skin feels so soft after I put it on. I&#x27;m not positive about how it affects wrinkles, I am in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t really have a lot, I bought it more as a &amp;#34;preventative,&amp;#34;  however, I do think it really smooth&#x27;s out my face before I put on makeup.</li>
    <li> not enough funds, didnt  purchase at this time</li>
    <li> Works well.  I use it before hypersonic serum.  Has helped my wrinkles disappear. :)</li>
    <li> I loved it!! It did not irritate my skin, no redness! It does not leave my skin feeling oily or wet. It goes on very easily and dries quickly. I am not one to wear a bunch of makeup unless it is a special occasion, but this is something I can definitely use everyday before my moisturizer in my daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product! A little goes a long way, one bottle lasted me almost 3 months with daily use, sometimes twice a day. Has helped my thirty-something skin appear more even, lessened acne, and heal existing acne. Has cleared my pores and overall brightened my skin. This and a light layer of organic coconut oil is all I use.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like the more expensive brand I was using!  I s switched from another brand as they tripled their price.  Can&#x27;t tell any difference between the two products.  Very pleased. Will purchase again as long as the price stays reasonable.  Keeps skin fresh and helps get rid of dead cells which gives skin a dull look.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Derma Roller. I have only used it once and definitely seen a difference in pore size within the first week. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t had time to try it on any other areas of my body, but I am anxious to try!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different skin care lines and serums and Azure is my new favorite product!  Since I have been using Azure Naturals, my skin looks fresh, luminous, and more even toned.  A little bit goes a long way.  It feels like my moisturizer is more effective after using the serum.  I&#x27;m also allergic to smells and this doesn&#x27;t leave an &amp;#34;after smell&amp;#34; which I absolutely love.  This product is a MUST-HAVE!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this serum on the recommendation of a friend, and I&#x27;m so happy I took her advice!  I love that that the product doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue or have an overpowering fragrance.  After just a few uses, I can tell my skin is softer, and I&#x27;m already starting to see an overall improvement.  I can’t wait to see the results after a few weeks and months.  Azure Naturals is part of my daily routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about skin care.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle and I think the Vitamin C helps my skin. I like that it now has a dropper so I can put a few dropw on my face and neck and rub it in.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Finally found an amazing skin product. I am a new user of this and have really enjoyed it so far. My skin feels healthier and I can already tell the differences in texture and complexion!  My boyfriend even uses it on his skin and says he notices a difference as well, especially in areas that have been affected by overexposure to sun. Absolutely thrilled with the results and will definitely keep using it! A big thank you to Azure Naturals!</li>
    <li> I love the body shops vitamin c and have tried several but i do love this and i dont say that about many producs.I will buy this again in 2 days my face is brighter and i noticed a little mole went away.I didnt buy it for that but hey i dont mind marks from acne and moles going away!I will be buying only this for my vit c fix!</li>
    <li> This serum blends into my skin and leaves a soft, silky feeling. One of the best skin care purchases I have made.</li>
    <li> Okay, this is an amazing product.  It has done more for my 50-year-old sun-damaged skin than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried previously.  Here&#x27;s the problem: the packaging is a nightmare.  The serum used to come in a bottle with a screw-on eye-dropper cap.  You had precise control over how much you dispensed each time.  Now it comes with a pump - the worst possible pump-style for this type of product.  I absolutely promise you that there is no way to avoid wasting a good amount of product every time you use it.  The pump points straight out at a 90-degree angle from the bottle (strike one - what&#x27;s the point of that??  It&#x27;s a liquid - it&#x27;s just going to drip off of whatever it hits unless the target is horizontal) and it has a very stiff &amp;#34;action,&amp;#34; meaning that you have to press the pump hard to get it to depress.  This is strike two because it means you have little or no control over how fast the product comes out.  If you don&#x27;t tilt the bottle so it shoots diagonally into your hand, the serum will shoot (and I literally mean shoot) straight out from the bottle and fly across your bathroom.  Even when it&#x27;s tilted to point toward your hand, the high-pressure pump causes it to squirt so hard that some of it usually ricochet&#x27;s off your hand and onto the floor (or mirror, or sink, or...).  Even if tilting it prevented all product loss (it doesn&#x27;t), it would still be a bad design because you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get anything out of the bottle at a tilt after using 2/3 or 3/4 of the bottle - you&#x27;d have to hold it upright so the tube inside would still be in contact with the product, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t pump out anything except air.  It&#x27;s so frustrating because it takes all control away from you and causes you to have to buy the product more often since so much gets wasted just trying to dispense it.  I initially thought the company changed to a pump so the consumer would not have to unscrew the cap and expose the serum to germs, but the terrible design almost makes it seem as if it was planned to act this way on purpose so we would be forced to buy more product more often.  I realize that&#x27;s highly unlikely, but as I said before, it&#x27;s ridiculously frustrating.  I&#x27;ve bought a few bottles since the change, just to see if maybe the first bottle or two with the pumps came from a bad batch, but they&#x27;re all like this.  I hate to change products, but it makes no sense to waste so much of this serum.  I&#x27;m sad to say that I&#x27;ll now be looking elsewhere.  There are many Vitamin C Serum makers that sell their products on Amazon - I&#x27;m sure to find something similar.  I wish I&#x27;d saved an old bottle.  I would just keep reusing it by pouring out the newer bottles into the old one so I could keep using the dropper (what a pain).  5 stars for the serum, 0 stars for the packaging.em as if it was planned to act this way on purpose so we would be forced to buy more product more often.

    <li> This is amazing!! I noticed and felt a difference the first day of using it. I needed something in addition to my moisturizer.  My face was beginning to show some brown spots, my pores looking big, and in need of that youthful glow.  After a week using it morning and night my face looks and feels amazing!  My husband noticed a big difference and started using it too!  He now looks 10 years younger!  We both do!  A little bit goes a long way and it glides on and soakes in quickly.  I use it all over my face, eyes and down my neck and chest.  There is a tingle and tightening but it feels wonderful!  I&#x27;m going to get my sister a bottle too.  I use Garnier 24 hour gel moisturizer which makes it a perfect combination because my skin feels fresh and clean not weighed down by thick product.  Love love love this stuff!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 30 days and found absolutely no difference in my skin.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful going on, and I have only used it for 2 weeks and its still hard to tell.  What I do want to know is what Azure recommends as a daily moisturizer with SPF that would go over this serum.  Knowing that would really help!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Azure Naturals for a couple of months and am very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;ve even received compliments on how nice my skin looks. The price is very reasonable and it is now a staple in my household.</li>
    <li> I got this product around the end of march this stuff is amazing im only 19 and since im young i guess i dont feel the need to apply this all the time after washing my face so on average i apply this 2-3 times a week as apart of my night time routine and i have received so many compliments on the appearance of my skin my skin looks alot more even in complexion and has kept my oily skin balanced i also have minimal breakouts i really love this product and told my mother about it and she said she was going to look into purchaing it hands down this is amazing and affordable the first serum ive ever used and i must say its the absolute best!!!</li>
    <li> lt appears to be effective</li>
    <li> I will definitely reorder.  Besides using it on my face, I also use it on my hands and arms.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a box and bubble wrap unharmed. I waited to write this review until I had used the product long enough that I seen results. I like AzureNaturals serums. My friends have noticed the lines on my forehead have greatly diminished and have been asking what my secret was. I told them I started using AzureNaturals Ultimate C. It isn&#x27;t irritating at all, does not feel drying, and I would feel a tightening of my skin within a few seconds after application. I use the product on my face and neck and even under my eyes. I let it dry which only take a few seconds then put my moisturizer on and sometimes makeup over it depending if I have things to do that day. The lines around my lips and the lines on my forehead have diminished greatly and my face looks brighter. My pores are even smaller which is great since my pores have been really big lately. I think I look a lot younger than I am and I&#x27;m only 23.  I have tried different Vitamin C serums to see what one I liked the most and which one you get more out of for your buck. I did some research on the ingredients in each of the serums I have tried. I really like the consistency in Azure Naturals Vitamin C. The way it makes your skin feel and there&#x27;s no smell plus the results you have after using it. A couple of the serums I have tried I swear they are just water with maybe if even 2% vitamin c in it. I also like that it can be a dropper or a pump. I really love the pump it makes life so much easier when your in a rush just pump and go. Highly recommend for people women or men.</li>
    <li> I ordered this while reordering a different vitamin C serum. I wanted to compare. I am very happy with the other. And I do also like this one. I switch between the two. Maybe it&#x27;s psychological, but I feel switching up on things a little is beneficial to my skin. I have very sensitive skin and susceptible to breakouts. I will reorder again this serum, and continue to switch between the two. It has smoothed my skin and fine lines, helps my rosacea, gives me a bit of a lift. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I washed my face and applied the Vitamin C Serum to my clean face, it had a slight odor to it but nothing too overwhelming or offensive at all. I like the fact that I can put it on under my makeup and start the day knowing that I am repairing and protecting my skin throughout my day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Serum for less than a month. I like it, my skin looks brighter and feels good when applied. I do not know if the serum is doing any changes to my skin quite yet, I hope so. Need more time with this product to determine whether this serum is really helping my skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t improve areas where I have sun damage.</li>
    <li> This past month my wonderful husband sent me away to a day of pampering and relaxation at a spa. It was so great and relaxing and included a facial. I have never had a facial done before so had no idea what to expect or what was going to happen! Luckily for me it was better than I thought it would be and I walked out feeling incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most important things I took from that trip was the need to take better care of my face. The girl who did my facial mentioned that my face looks great, could use some work but for the most part I still look young considering I don&#x27;t take care of my skin. So I decided I needed to be more active with my daily routine with my face. At that time I was given the opportunity to review Azure Natural ULTIMATE Vitamin C Serum. This serum is super easy to use and you can instantly feel the difference on your face versus using nothing at all! The serum is light and does not feel heavy or greasy on your face and you can easily apply your makeup on top of it without worrying about it. I have been using this serum for almost 30 days now and really see the difference in my face, I have a youthful glow and my face always looks so fresh and taken care of.</li>
    <li> not the product I was expecting I will not purchase again didn&#x27;t smell or look right</li>
    <li> I Love it since I have very oily skin.  Since I use this product,  I don&#x27;t have to touch up my face all day long.</li>
    <li> Skin feels good after using.  Probably better than most serums I have used.  Have seen positive results in just a few weeks.  Looking forward to more......</li>
    <li> My serum arrived so quickly in the mail! I have been using it for a couples weeks now. It&#x27;s important to note it is a serum not a cream, it is very thin. You only apply a very small amount so it will last a long time! The serum goes on smooth and dries very quickly. When applied it is almost cooling and I like that when it dries you feel a slight tightness in you skin as if it instantly tones it up a bit. Wears easily under make up! there is a slight odor that might bother the most sensitive of noses. It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will live up to all of its claims but it can&#x27;t hurt applying something with this impressive ingredient list!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about how this product would work. It has made my skin more supple. It is also softer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she absolutely loves it. In fact, she said she could see a difference after the first application; but more importantly, she has noticed a steady improvement over the last 10 days.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be an ant-ageing serum, but I found that it is such a great primer to use before applying foundation.</li>
    <li> Certainly no overnight changes or 2-week changes.  I am going to use the entire bottle and maybe there will be some improvement at that time</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t any true miracle serums!  This works as well as the high dollar serums and is budget friendly.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin look and feel. It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky like some of the other vitamin C serums that I have tried. It goes on nicely and absorbs very quickly leaving my skin with an illuminating glow. I definitely will be purchasing this again and again....thank you Azure for this wonderful and affordable product :)</li>
    <li> Will always use it from now on. Have used many other products but this has improved me skin a lot.</li>
    <li> Not sure what this product was supposed to do because I see absolutely no results. I would not spend this amount of money for this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product.It really fades out dark spots.I just gotta figure out how to hydrate my face because it really does dry my face and areas that i use it on.I have allot of peeling of the skin.Not pretty.But It does do what i wanted it for &amp;#34;fade dark spots&amp;#34;. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, like citrus when you apply it.  No decrease in wrinkles after one bottle.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen many results yet.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have recently tried to change all my products to&lt;br /&gt;Organic, healthy products. The customer service and help has been outstanding, with an email explaining thd best way tomuse the product and acfoos-up email asking if I was satisfied with the product or if I had any questions. You never get this level&lt;br /&gt;Of service , especially with a product under 100.00.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels much softer and I&#x27;m seeing an improvement with wrinkles and brown spots. I wily highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It actually did improve my facial skin and neck skin.  It feels so light and lovely.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> It is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it!!!  The results are amazing and your skin is so soft after use!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and before purchasing I had my doubts. The liquid goes on nicely and absorbs fast. But a few droplets cover my entire face! There is a slight wonderful tightening sensation after application. The results have been outstanding as seen by self plus my friend. I am 57 and all those winkles on my eyelid disappeared immediately. Now the deeper wrinkles that come out around eyes when smiling don&#x27;t show when not smiling at all. I have used this for only three weeks and will continue use since I am using a natural product , low cost and effective!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last couple of months and have seen significant change. wrinkles are fading and my pores have become smaller. very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I am a proponent of feeling healthy and looking healthy.  Always on the move, this product delivers.  It&#x27;s consistent, quick and easy.  I use it along with my moisturizer I have been loyal to for 15 years.  I have sensitive skin and Azure Naturals make a very compatible product, it feels great and I can clearly see the results.  Bottom line, stop looking elsewhere, buy this product.  You&#x27;ll absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> Although it hasn&#x27;t done any harm, there hasn&#x27;t been any change in my skin.  I&#x27;m still using it, but as of now, there is nothing to report, hence, two stars, since no harm has been done.</li>
    <li> After applying into the skin, it quickly dissolves into nothing.  No moisture, no smoothness, nothing.  From now on I will make my own skincare lotion:  Concentrated Vitamin E oil, lemon juice, and pure hyaluronic gel.  Do not buy &amp;#34;Pure Hyaluronic Serum&amp;#34; from Cosmedica Skincare.  The front of the bottle claims to be &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;, the back has water, hyaluronic acid, and benzyl alcohol 5%.  I think the water was 90% and hyaluronic gel was maybe 5% the most.  Both of these products feels like applying water to my skin.  Total waste of my money.  I still have a tube of Gengigel brand hyaluronic acid mail ordered from EU and feels great.  So does Aloa Vera.  Janet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been in love with jojoba oil, so I was excited to get a free sample of a serum that combines it with vitamin C and aloe. It smells just as nice (perhaps even better!) than my plain jojoba oil. I&#x27;m only 27 so I don&#x27;t really have much in the way of skin damage, but I think it&#x27;s important to take care of your skin early -- prevention is much easier than repairing!</li>
    <li> Use this with the phytoceramides and you&#x27;ll see a difference in your face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works but it does tighten the skin when you put it on. Definitely will continue using. I also have sensitive eyes and this product does not seem to bother them at all.</li>
    <li> Fast ship.  I did not receive 2 bottles of this product, only one.  I feel like I&#x27;m putting something healthy on my face, but only time will tell if it&#x27;s actually doing any good.  Frankly, I have not used this product long enough to give a reliable recommendation.  Since I now want to make my own facial serums, I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing this product again, but I will finish the contents of this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have already notice a change in my skin. It makes my skin feel smooth and reduces the redness. It is a little thin so it will run down your face if applied directly to face from dropper, but it&#x27;s not that bad. No foul odors.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working for me. I think this a great product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not notice improvement</li>
    <li> I love this product. Works great on skin. Will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I purchase. I already tried many serums but this one really showed results for my type of skin. It got noticeably smoother and firmer. I do recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I had to purchase it twice.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum with great results after consistent use!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! My skin feels better than it has in years! I also used the Murad Intense Resurfacing Peel and felt these product pair well together! So happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> My wife used to use it , and she is very happy with this product.It really suited her skin.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I can say that it is a bit costly :)&lt;br /&gt;But very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing, can&#x27;t wait to try more of your products!</li>
    <li> After using it for about 4 weeks now, I see see a difference in my skin. My face is smoother  and has. A nice glow.</li>
    <li> Works great with helping with moisturizing your face or anywhere for that matter and also helped with my brown age spots I have.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I Love it.It definately helped my skin to become more luminous...and radiant .Perfect for combination skin type..</li>
    <li> The serum felt nice on your face (no oily residue) and it came with both a dropper and a pump nozzle so you can pick whichever you prefer. I prefer the pump personally. The smell is not terrible but it does not have a perfume like scent either. I like that it helps fade away sunspots and also prevent sun damage in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved most about this product is that it has high quality ingredients, is made in the USA, AND has a ONE YEAR 100% back money guarantee if you do not like the results. Finally a company that CARES about its customers! The company will refund the price of the product and the shipping no matter where you purchased the product. I love products where the company takes care of you. Being honest and and faithful TO me is what makes me honest and faithful to a company.</li>
    <li> The product is a wonderful product it lives up to its name I do recommend this product to my friends keep it on the shelves and keep it in stock</li>
    <li> When you order a product twice, that says something.  I am quite pleased with this Vitamin C Serum and until I find a better performing product I will keep using it.  I use it daily and I like the way my skin feels.  This has become part of my daily skin care regiment!!</li>
    <li> Useless.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> this was for sis. gift</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! It cleared up my acne scars and toned my skin... I&#x27;m never going back to using anything else. If you&#x27;re on the fence about Azure products I definitely recommend giving them a try.</li>
    <li> what can I say...awesome product!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it along with the hyaluronic acid for a few days, so too early to tell much, except that I love the way it feels. on my skin.  Each of the Azure Naturals products I received was well packaged, sealed and wrapped upon delivery, and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for close to a week now and i notice that i have fewer breakouts, my skin seems smoother, pores smaller. it&#x27;s a bit drying but since i have very oily skin, that&#x27;s a great thing for me. consistency is a bit watery but it dries fast when applied and doesn&#x27;t sting, even when applied to the delicate eye area. Its not as fast as i hope but it&#x27;s early days yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for about a month now so I don&#x27;t know if this review should&#x27;ve waited a little longer. So far the serum has helped give my complexion more clarity. I feel it&#x27;s more revived, especially around the eye area. I wish it assisted a little more with firmness. I mean I&#x27;m 28 so that may be why I don&#x27;t see a dramatic change in that area. Overall I can say I will continue to use a serum like this but I may try a different brand to see if there&#x27;s a better one out there.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Skin Repair Serum by Azure Naturals is a fantastic product.  In my 40&#x27;s I have had sensitive skin issues due to menopause.  I was excited to try this product and see if I could make my skin feel smoother and more hydrated.  After quick shipping and very nice packaging I was able to try my new product quickly.  This serum comes in a brown pump glass bottle.  I applied just a small amount to smooth onto my face.  I have applied it in the morning and evening and have had no skin sensitivity problems.  I really like this product and I really LOVE the smell.  The smell is snot to strong and does not linger.  My skin feel smoother.  Other members in my family have tried the serum and they like it as well.  The 1 fl oz bottle will last me quite some time so it is very good on the budget!  Please note that I was given this product as a free trial to use and to give my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the product until I noticed I was breaking out a little bit and having some itchy patches on my face. On a positive note it&#x27;s a serum so the consistency is like aloe very gel that is watered down. It&#x27;s clear and does not have a strong fragrance.  It feels cool when applied to skin. I have received this product to test from Tomoson. This review is all on my own.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry or tight. Smells just like the vitamin C tablets.</li>
    <li> It is okay. I am not fond of the smell.</li>
    <li> This product has completely changed my skin!  My dermatologist has told me my skin now looks 10 years younger from this Vitamin C serum.  My skin looks amazing, glowing, clear and I get compliments daily.  Fully recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t see any difference. Although I am one of those people that have a hard time seeing differences in my skin (other than multiplying wrinkles). So I will keep using it and update this at a further time. It does make your skin feel nice and tight when you put it on and no greasy feeling or anything like that.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum is the best!  I am on my second bottle and love the results I am getting.</li>
    <li> Love it, I like that it absorbs quickly in the skin</li>
    <li> Product really softened my skin and brightened my complexion. Azure also has outstanding customer service. My initial bottle arrived broken. I sent a pic of it and asked them to provide details on how I should do an exchange. They responded immediately with an apology and immediately shipped out a new bottleof the Vitamin C serum and also included a bottle of the Hyaluronic serum for the inconvenience. This product also performed very well! I definitely recommend trying the products.</li>
    <li> Arrived on schedule and product was what I expected since I have used this product before.</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a promotion, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay for it. I didnt see any improvements to my skin after a few days use.&lt;br /&gt;I did like the spray bottle it was easy to use</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference and It is too watery for me. price is just ok but It leave too dry skin on me. I wanna try something else.</li>
    <li> Very nice texture, sinks into the skin and works very well.</li>
    <li> A great product to add in combination to your daily skin care regimen</li>
    <li> Excellent product. my skin is near flawless using this Vit. C serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for one week. My sun spots have lightened, but my small creases around my lip haven&#x27;t changed. I will definitely continue to use this!</li>
    <li> Helps your skin look more refreshed and toned</li>
    <li> smells funny but i still use.</li>
    <li> I love what this product does for my skin. Would buy over and over again.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a serum consistency!  It&#x27;s very watery.  I had used a bottle of FoxBrim and loved it but read the&lt;br /&gt;promotion material and ordered this - it&#x27;s better than NOT using vit c but I reordered FoxBrim and I immediately saw an improvement in skin texture and softness.  I&#x27;m using the last of the Azure on my hands and must say it&#x27;s doing a good job of evening the skin tone.  I&#x27;m 70 so there&#x27;s lots of room for improvement!</li>
    <li> Love this serum! Skin texture has improved! Ordered my second bottle already</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; so dies my skin!!!</li>
    <li> I think I is helping to get rid of some eczema on my lower face. I take the Emergency C 1000 too. For inside and outside.</li>
    <li> Okay, not as strong as I hoped</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim.  I like the texture and the cost.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> This product has really brightened my skin and lightened my dark spots in as little as 2 weeks. My skin is also smoother and ir seems my pores may be shrinking. Overall I&#x27;m very happy! I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a good product..not the best. I have used two bottles, my skin feels softer and smoother.I use this serum every morning before i put sunscreen and make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did not see a radiant look and did not reduce the fine lines. I ordered a third bottle to see if there will be big difference in my skin. If i do not see the results this time, i am not going to waste my money on this any longer.</li>
    <li> This is the third vitamin C serum I have purchased  from three different brands. I am totally disappointed at this one. The serum itself looks and smell very different form the others two I tried before; looks like it is just 1 oz. of lemon juice with oil, -and it smells like it-. I didn&#x27;t feel any difference in my skin texture at all. I am going back to the Oz Naturals serum which is the only one that really gave results. I just wanted to try around to get the best value for my money. The other one has dropped price so it is a better investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to do a comparison of Azure 22% Vitamin C + 11% Hyaluronic Acid + 1% Vitamin E + Ferulic vs. Cosmetic Skin Solution Vitamin C 20% Serum + Ferulic Acid &amp; Hyaluronic Acid Advanced Formula (available on Amazon - which I bought also).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Azure naturals smells better. Azure is Made in the USA as is Cosmetic Skin Solution (theirs says its made in a FDA approved facility). The Azure&#x27;s Vitamin C is a different type then the Cosmetic Solution&#x27;s Vitamin C and the ingredients in Azure are more natural (ex: Organic Aloe listed on Azure not on Cosmetic Skin). Azure also has a slight smell of citrus so you think you&#x27;re putting on Vitamin C (it dissipates as soon as its absorbed). Cosmetics Skin Solution has a slight medicinal/chemical smell which also goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in Cosmetic Skin Solution are stark and to the point to substantiate what&#x27;s on the front of their label, compared w/Azure&#x27;s that has more &#x27;stuff&#x27; compared ingredient for ingredient. Azure&#x27;s formula is a thick milky white (and it has not changed colors to yellow or anything like that) whereas Cosmetic Solution is pure clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its just my preference for Azure&#x27;s product than Cosmetic&#x27;s Skin Solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;Azure needs to be shaken each time before you get set to pull the product into the dropper that 8 drops will then be placed on the tips of one hand, you rub your fingers together and put product lightly on forehead, down next to eye (where crows feet are) then come down cheeks, across upper lip and across chin. Go back and rub the product into the skin until its absorbed. The instructions say to use this before the Hyraulic Acid serum and then your moisturizer. Whatever you do - don&#x27;t forget to use a light exfoliate - I&#x27;m going to mention Oil of Olay b/c it comes with the scrubbing auto-brush but I only use the scrubber. My exfoliant is the really great product by ADSM and its their Microdermabrasion in a jar. I&#x27;d buy from ADSM direct as they sometimes give a freebie with your order. Nothing compares to getting rid of the junk layer of skin 1-2 times a week than that product w/the scrubbing auto-brush from Oil of Olay but even if you don&#x27;t have the brush and just use your fingers - its awesome! Remember: if you don&#x27;t clean your face and get the old layers off (which the Azure product is helping to do) you will get a \\&quot;pilling\\&quot; effect along the jaw. Work w/ a clean face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it works: I use it in a regime w/Clinique products and there&#x27;s at least 3 minutes for dry time between everything. I had dark age spots coming onto my face as well as deepening crows feet, very dry thin skin under the eyes, and sensitive skin. I use the ADSM microdermabrasion 2x a week w/scrubbing machine. Other than that I use Clinique cleanser every day. Then Clinique 1, NEXT - this is important I think - Clinique 2, then the Clinique spot remover serum, then believe it or not I swear by Cosmetic Skin Solution&#x27;s Day Moisturizing Creme w/its marine extract blend. That stuff is great. AT NIGHT: I wash w/Clinique cleanser, then its Clinique 1, then Clinique 2, then Azure Naturals Vitamin 22% Vitamin C, then Azure&#x27;s Hydraulic serum, then Clinique Moisture Night Mask and I use that right up under the eyes although lightly and it doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle of this, using the 8 drop method, at night, every night, will last you approximately 5 weeks. In the regime I&#x27;ve described above which I started in October, I&#x27;ve lost the little lines that were coming in around my mouth (I&#x27;m not a smoker), my skin tone overall has improved, the lines have lost their DEPTH (which is layers deep into the bed of the skin and and the new skin underneath formed needs to be given the help it needs as environmental factors such as the SUN is trying to hurt it) which I attribute to the HELP of Azure Naturals Vitamin C 22% + 11% Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Amino Complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a fact that all skin product needs 4 weeksof continuous work before you&#x27;ll start seeing any results - and that&#x27;s minimal as the skin cells turn over every 21 days. Its really in the 5-6 weeks that you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve got a winner. As long as you don&#x27;t break out, don&#x27;t have an adverse reaction, the product hasn&#x27;t spoiled, you&#x27;re working on your skin as a project instead of slapping something on for a week and expecting to see miraculous results, keep trying and inserting a new item in your core regime. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way - all products listed in this review are available on Amazon.lts - and that&#x27;s minimal as the skin cells turn over every 21 days.
