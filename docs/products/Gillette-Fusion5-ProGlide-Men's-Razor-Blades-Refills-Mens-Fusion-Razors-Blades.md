      <li>they work fine.</li>
      <li>Works fine and delivery was as scheduled.</li>
      <li>the shave is fine though.</li>
      <li>They really do glide across your face leaving you so smooth and even more well groomed with the top blade to touch up sideburns or goatee/beard/mustache.</li>
      <li>However, these cartridges fit.  </li>
      <li>and I can continue to enjoy the Pro-glide experience</li>
      <li>Smooth and does not cut or burn.</li>
      <li>These Are So great I have been using them for several years now...</li>
      <li>We not only saved money the convenience of being delivered to our home was great.</li>
      <li>I do get a close comfortable shave with these</li>
      <li>great price, last a while.</li>
      <li>The first shave was pretty good though not anything better than my old razor.</li>
      <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
      <li>These blades provide a very comfortable shave and are reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave.</li>
      <li>Used as full body razor.</li>
      <li>These razors last a good amount and we both use them (men &amp; women).  </li>
      <li>there were companies out there copying the true product.</li>
      <li>These blades last me a good month before having to replace them, and I shave every morning, M-F.</li>
      <li>I received the refill cartridges quickly and they were the Gillette Proglides as advertised.  </li>
      <li>They weren&#x27;t Fusion by Gillette, but seem adequate.</li>
      <li>Seller shipped quickly and I received the product intact , quickly and just as described.</li>
      <li>Good price when I first got the 12 pack a while back.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth year money in my opinion.</li>
      <li>(For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s higher blade cost, compared to the Mach 3 and 4 blades.</li>
      <li>â–² The blades nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging.</li>
      <li>The first blade lasted five shaves.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first time ordering them through Amazon.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good price when I first got the 12 pack a while back. But I think the price has gone up. Still a very high quality razor</li>
    <li> Great razor. Give you the smoothest shave around.</li>
    <li> I very much dislike the whole replacement blade business model.  But it is what it is.  Amazon has the best prices I have found, without extensive shopping for sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel like the quality of the Gilette blades has been going down.  Even using a&lt;br /&gt;RazorPit Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Sharpener, Black to try and extend the life of my blades.  The Razor pit helps.  I have noticed that even with the Razor pit, the time I go between replacement has lessons.  When I purchased the Pit a year ago I started getting about a month out of a blade.  Now it is down to about two weeks (from a week per blade without the pit.)  Not sure if this is a blade quality thing or what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually giving some thought to trying one of the older blade versions, not sure that 5 blades versus 3 really matters.</li>
    <li> Good deal, but Walmart can match.</li>
    <li> Best shaving system I have ever used.</li>
    <li> great price, fast shipping, will purchase again as needed</li>
    <li> they are factory and work great</li>
    <li> Best price I could find for a year of fine shaving</li>
    <li> Great blades....Smooth shave; last a month or more..each one.</li>
    <li> The Gilette Fusion ProGlide is by far the the best razor I&#x27;ve ever tried. Their cartridges are amazing: no cuts, no irritation, no stress. It does not matter on what direction you shave. Results are very good. I feel great after every shave. They also last longer than any other razor&#x27;s cartridges. No more to ask for. Excellent product by Gillette. Highly recommended. Cheers.</li>
    <li> The package reached in time and I was very satisfied. There were 3 separate packages each having 4 blades.</li>
    <li> I shave my balls with these suckers. Had a woman comment on how soft they were one Saturday night.  They shave close and as long it&#x27;s not a dull blade, you won&#x27;t feel a thing. Great stuff! Thanks Gillette. I would recommend lowering the price, but women usually have to buy tampons and/or pads, etc a month so I figure the price isn&#x27;t totally bad.</li>
    <li> Great razors.  Expensive, but they last a long time.</li>
    <li> CANNOT CUT THRU MY FACIAL HAIR</li>
    <li> I hate shopping for razors so I bought a ton of these. Same quality as in the store delivered to my house</li>
    <li> a year of baby-butt face</li>
    <li> I ordered the proglide razzers and received a non proglide fusion razzers. Disappointed in what I got . Should have known price was too good to be true</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product fully meets all of my expectations.  The product was received in a timely manner and without damage.  I have used the product previously for the last 2-3 years and was not disappointed on receipt of the current order.</li>
    <li> I received the refill cartridges quickly and they were the Gillette Proglides as advertised.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the quality of the shave that I&#x27;ve received.</li>
    <li> Does one really need 5 blades? Probably not. But my face says yes. Again, these high-tech blades are very pricey.</li>
    <li> Very good price for a relatively expensive product. Fast delivery too</li>
    <li> much cheaper than buying them at the store.&lt;br /&gt;and they work fine.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Blade refills are strangely expensive to many other disposable things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a lot of other razoers, the ProGlide seems shallower in angle.  But for shaving coarse hair, you really need to shave more frequently, because a 3 day growth shave gets clogs this quickly.  The vibrating version of the razor, designed to shake up the hairs for a closer shave with less movement, also helps to clear the blades from clogs under running water.</li>
    <li> Item as described, good communication, fast shipment.</li>
    <li> These are the blades that I always use.  It&#x27;s my first time ordering them through Amazon.  How very simple was this!</li>
    <li> they were new and work great. finally a good shave at a descent price.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide is the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. They really do glide across your face leaving you so smooth and even more well groomed with the top blade to touch up sideburns or goatee/beard/mustache. Seller shipped quickly and I received the product intact , quickly and just as described. Thank you</li>
    <li> These Are So great I have been using them for several years now... I made the mistake of Buying the &amp;#34;non Power ones&amp;#34; ... Not that you Save any Money  the Non Power ones and Power ones are the same price... either way its a great Shave...esp. for anyone who suffers from bumps or ingrown hairs... TIP ... Do most of your Shaving on the Down Stoke First ... all over your face well... then it you must ... like me... stoke up for that extra close shave, and keep from messing up you face this way... B.T.W.  they do seem to last longer than the other 2/3 blade variety...</li>
    <li> Beautiful, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t Fusion by Gillette, but seem adequate.</li>
    <li> These blades provide a very comfortable shave and are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> The first blade I used from Amazon shipment lasted about one-half as long as the blades I purchase at local CVS. Instructions are in Spanish, indicating that perhaps blades are &amp;#34;gray goods&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> 12 blades at a decent price.  Have used these blades since I could shave and never had to worry about nicks and cuts. The trimmer on the backside is so very clutch at trimming side burns and other sensitive areas.  Blade lasts about a month probably so I would project these to last me a full year (shaving twice a week).</li>
    <li> These are the worst razors I have ever used and seriously hurt my face. I had no idea there were companies out there copying the true product. I will be very careful going forward and hopefully these people are shut down soon.</li>
    <li> cant go wrong with these blades</li>
    <li> just needed some refill kits.</li>
    <li> Not sure whether these things needed any more ratings since they are not new on the market....  Anyways... the Power fusion was what finally moved me away from electric razors.  While the electrics are convenient, they sure don&#x27;t last long... either you have expensive blades to replace or the rechargeable battery starts to get weak-kneed as they all do sooner or later.  As some others attest, there is little difference between the manual and power fusion cartridges,  I go with the so-called manual ones since they are usually cheaper.  Frankly... I think the two types are identical except for color.  I think if they were indeed that different, the packaging on either would tout the differences.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected!</li>
    <li> Simple purchase and delivery, everything went as expected and advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent Price, easy to find on amazon,</li>
    <li> Great value, quick shipping and exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> If you want these soon, as in less than 3 weeks, don&#x27;t order them here, it&#x27;ll be a while.</li>
    <li> I was worried because I own a Proglide Power.  However, these cartridges fit.  They work perfectly well.</li>
    <li> Just the perfect tool, you can not get wrong with this!</li>
    <li> Horrible. Get dull after about 3 uses. Not buying these again.</li>
    <li> I never even considered using a razor that had the vibrating function, let alone replacing my old Gillette Atra. I just thought I&#x27;d treat myself when I saw the proglide in the store, and I&#x27;m glad I did. These blades last me a good month before having to replace them, and I shave every morning, M-F. Definitely worth it&#x27;s higher blade cost, compared to the Mach 3 and 4 blades.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors out there. Been using them for a couple years and never had a problem. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I normally pay the same and only get 8.Great deal.</li>
    <li> The best blades for shaving.</li>
    <li> awesett srt uy y uy yu8 uuy uii oi io y tyxftyxtxtrytrtr il;&#x27;;p</li>
    <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and blades and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> as, described I am satisfied</li>
    <li> Actually not yet opened as the razor came with 2 blades.  The first shave was pretty good though not anything better than my old razor. The blades are very expensive I ope that they last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Love the price, hubby is clean shaven!</li>
    <li> These are great razors. Long lasting compared to others I have used.</li>
    <li> I read mixed reviews. some were great, some were terrible. i have no complaints with these. great price, last a while. i will reorder, and have referred these to friends</li>
    <li> Great product! Really good value for the money - Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wow.. I bought these instead of my usual Gillette fusion and they give a very close shave, no irritation on very very sensitive skin. No ingrown hairs, no nicks, no stubble. You get a better shave with these. They do look a little cheaper so I was skeptical at first glance, but after one use I won&#x27;t go back. Each blade lasts for quite a few shaves as well if you keep it clean and dry it after use!  They are a bit expensive but with 12 it&#x27;s about a year supply of razors so it&#x27;s worth year money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Very nice place and last at least two weeks each which is less than advertised but nonetheless you get very smooth shaves.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I get a really great shave from the fusion Proglide and there is no brick and mortar that sells at this fantastic price.  I would recommend that all men purchase from Amazon.  Tell your significant others about this product and maybe you will get some for Christmas and any other time of the year.</li>
    <li> Good price for a change. They are a good blade.</li>
    <li> Cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else. Lasted a very long time too. Product was as expected.</li>
    <li> Currently using the first refill cartridge. Works fine and delivery was as scheduled.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smooth and does not cut or burn. Lasts a long time, which for me compensates for its high price.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also these heads/razor model are just awesome. I&#x27;m trans and I shave every day and THIS SHIT GLIDES like a charm. Used as full body razor. If you apply firm, even pressure, as you are shaving, this razor is perf.</li>
    <li> Good experience and product</li>
    <li> I bought the fusion provides cartridges for my husband.  He has been using them for several years and he rates them as the best he has used.  Since he is 73 years old I figure he knows a lot about razors. I bought the cartridges from Amazon because of the great price.  We not only saved money the convenience of being delivered to our home was great.</li>
    <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Shaves very smoothly!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the $$!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> In general, these razor blades are expensive, but this 12 blade cartridge package&lt;br /&gt;was a good deal for me and I can continue to enjoy the Pro-glide experience that Gillette provides.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this purchase highly.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaving system for 2 years  Never a cut to men face  No burning with After Shave  Great</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product when I received it.  IMHO, this product is a second rate knock-off.  The first blade lasted five shaves.  Don&#x27;t believe Gillette misspelled its name on its packaging.  It would have destroyed the packaging to protect the brand.</li>
    <li> these work great nice close shaves</li>
    <li> These are do a great job at a close shave.  Put them on Auto Order...</li>
    <li> I always bought the Gillette Fusion ProGlide from CVS and I have been very satisfied with the product. I made the mistake of ordering it at Amazon and realized that it is not real one from Gillette. I read the old reviews after the fact and realized that other customers had the same issues.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son &amp; grandson who both love them. Particularly my grandson likes it as he no longer has as a severe acne problem with this blade.</li>
    <li> A little pricey however pretty satisfied</li>
    <li> great product good price</li>
    <li> I received a 3 pack of 12 blades in a very short amount of time. The price is great considering all 12 blades were about the cost of 4 in my local supermarket. :)</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> JUST LIKE THEY SHOULD BE! GREAT DEAL. AND HAVE TOLD OTHERS ALL READY. THIS IS THE PLACE TOI COME AGAIN WHEN YOU NEED MORE BLADES.</li>
    <li> People I&#x27;ll not need to pay the big box shop store price with deals like this for the big A</li>
    <li> Great value when compared to supermarket or drugstore prices.</li>
    <li> OEM blades in factory packaging.  Best razor on the market.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not sure if genuine...the shave is fine though. &amp;#34;Gilete&amp;#34; is spelt wrong on the product title...not sure why??</li>
    <li> In an earlier post I had mistakenly rated this vendor one star, I did receive what I ordered and the goods were new and the right make and model.</li>
    <li> Love these razors and love the amazon prices. we have shopped around from Bj&#x27;s, Costco, Walmart, you name it and Amazon seems to be the cheapest for the amount you get.  These razors last a good amount and we both use them (men &amp; women).  I have sensitive skin and it works great.</li>
    <li> For my \\&quot;field test,\\&quot; I used this product on a ProoGlide razor body.  I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–² The blades nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)  To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–² Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the \\&quot;Enhanced Lubrastrip.\\&quot; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and \\&quot;lubricating polymers.\\&quot; Well, my skin appreciated those \\&quot;polymers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;âœ” SUMMARY: My shaving \\&quot;test\\&quot; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. One possible caveat--the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™« A Review by Chris Lawson</li>
    <li> it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Very good pricing for my favorite razor...</li>
    <li> I like the 12 pack. Its a years supply for me.</li>
    <li> I do get a close comfortable shave with these and like I can trim close to my moustache with the back of the head.  Too expensive, but shopping around at different retailers online, better prices can be found.</li>
    <li> Great price for 12 Fusion Proglide blades and good customer service.</li>
    <li> great price for name brand product</li>
    <li> Expensive but better then competitors</li>
