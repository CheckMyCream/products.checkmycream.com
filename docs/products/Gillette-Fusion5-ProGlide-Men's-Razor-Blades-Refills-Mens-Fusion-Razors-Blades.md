<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best a man can get.</li>
    <li> Tried out the Gillette power blade with my Gillette Fusion trimmer and they did a great job. Normally have issues with razor burn after shaving but I didn&#x27;t have any issues this time. The lubricated blades provide enough moisture to shave my face without using anything but water. Once my hair get&#x27;s a little longer I will more then likely have to use my shaving cream again but for trims in between regular shavings I can just splash water on my face, touch up and go. Nice close shave almost everytime. I don&#x27;t expect anything perfect from any razor blade but these are pretty close.</li>
    <li> These blades are perfect. Gillette is on top of their game with this one. I am so glad i purchased these. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I received my ProGlide Styler and Power Trimmer through a program with Gillette. From the minute I received it I was impressed. The razor powers through my stubborn stubble with ease, even against the grain. The first three shaves were tremendously close leaving my face extremely smooth to the touch. I have noticed that the razor wears fast. After the fourth shave the razor is visible dull. It is also difficult to maneuver around the upper lip as the cartridge is very wide. I loved (my wife as well) that I could man scape in the shower without concern for the ProGlide getting wet. As a road warrior, I appreciate how it stores neatly in its own cradle and packs well for traveling. Overall, I loved it and will most likely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> These blades work wonders. Clean smooth shave with no knicks or cuts. Did not struggle on my 2 week growth. With other blades I would have to trim first.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades on my new Gillette Fusion Power Trimmer that I received free thanks to a program run by Gillette are outstanding.  I usually dread shaving my neck area because my hair sometimes pulls with my previous razor.  With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades I didn&#x27;t feel a thing and my skin was super soft.  Definitely a much more close and comfortable shave with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades.</li>
    <li> I received these for free from Gillette.  The power fusion razor blade does not offer a noticeable advantage when shaving, it just seems to vibrate your hand, but not cut any better. Like other Fusion razors, the cartridges are designed to wear out very fast with soft metal, forcing you to frequently purchase very pricey replacement cartridges. I used to only get 2-3 shaves out of a cartridge with a good shaving cream. I now only shave after showering (to soften the hair), and add shave oil underneath the cream, and the cartridges last about 5-6 shaves before being very dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best out there, but still not great.  I wish someone would invest in a decent metal for the blades.  If someone could use a very hard metal where the blades would last a year, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying $50 for a blade.  These just wear so quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my hands down favorite shaver out there. I received it free from Gillette! I&#x27;m \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; like that! My wife approves!</li>
    <li> After receiving my Gillette fusion proglide power razor from a free offer by Gillette my face couldn&#x27;t be smoother. It glides like no other, there really is no tug or pull.</li>
    <li> GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER CARTRIDGE&lt;br /&gt;I received a FREE razor tat was provided via a program run by GILLETTE. I&#x27;m telling you I love these new blades IMMPRESSED I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I thought the original Fusion Power was best, but the Fusion Proglide Power blade is miles ahead. These are the best on the market now. The blades really do glide over my face quickly and comfortably and it leaves my skin nice and smooth.. The razor blades are thinner enabling the blades to cut effortlessly through the hair with less tug and pull. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge has 5 blades spaced closer together this forms an advanced shaving surface and it has a lubricating strip it will provide you with a visual cue, it fades to white when shaving conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to consider changing the blade on your razor. The Edge Blade that u can find in the back of the cartridge helps you to make crisp and defined lines. I am totally sold on this product&lt;br /&gt;(P.s- commenting via my wifes amazon account ;) )</li>
    <li> Received  Gillette fusion proglide razor through a program sponsored by Gillette and was pleasantly surprised. I used the razor and received the smoothest,closest shave I ever have gotten. I couldn&#x27;t even tell that the razor was cutting my beard. I still felt clean shaven at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I received my free razor via a program by Gillette, and it was the best razor they&#x27;ve made to date! I can&#x27;t complain one bit... The shave was so close and smooth.... drove my girlfriend nuts! I&#x27;ll be using these razors for a long time.</li>
    <li> After several times of trying the Fusion ProGlide Power razor I received from Gillette, I was pleased that the blades are retaining their initial sharpness. They are very easy to keep clean - just a quick rinse after removing the trimmer door. I am able to get a close comfortable shave with little or no irritaion to my skin. I expect the cartridge to last about four weeks as advertised, so I will be spending less on blades. I received this razor free from Gillette to test it.</li>
    <li> I got the Fusion ProGlide Power through a program run by gillette and it is a great razor.  This is one of the few razors that I can use without it feeling like I ran over my face with sandpaper.  The Power Cartridge is definitely a better shave than the regular one having tried both, the power one seems to give a closer and more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it is very easy to use and light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to trim beard and very precise. would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> What is better than a trimmer / shaver all-in-one? I can&#x27;t think of anything. And not to mention the product being sent to me free of charge from Gillette through one of their amazing programs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with Gillette has always been good. I have used the manual proglide razor for awhile and have always gotten a good shave with that. The one new secret about this blade is the microcomb that is built into it which helps guide stubble to the blade for that incredibly smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades cut effortlessly through the hair with less tug and more pull than your normal disposable blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product in the shower because of the watertight technology and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was true to its word. No complications with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power blades for this trimmer are just one of many flavors of the styler, which make this product a must have for all men.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades performed very well and gave a smooth shave.  The strip behind the blades has lubricant that helps make the shave as close as possible with no nicking or pull back.  I have used Fusion blades before but the ProGlide blades seem improved and I liked the narrower side that lets you shave closer to the lips and nose.  Thanks to Gillette for improving an already good product.</li>
    <li> These are super sharp and super comfortable, the moisturising strip is really useful and so is the precision cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these blades to any man who wants a smooth shave with no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better was I got to try these for free by participating in a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I normally let my barber handle all my facial grooming. I received the razor and handle through a Gillette promotion and it worked great</li>
    <li> I got these blades through a program from Gillette to try out. They&#x27;re a great shave, but they&#x27;re a little too close for me. I seem to get more irritation the closer the shave is and so these aren&#x27;t the blades I would be looking for. If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave then try these out.</li>
    <li> Gillette fusion has already been my favorite for shaving products! They never fail to impress me with everything they do. I LOVE THE PROGLIDE razor and the 8 count cartridge is an awesome price for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is a cool razor.  I&#x27;ve been stuck on a razor for the longest time until I tried this out and even though I have packs of razors left from the other razor I&#x27;m making the switch now.  Smooth shave, nick free.</li>
    <li> I received the Proglide Power cartridges as a part of a program by Gillette.  The whole idea was to try them out and share my experiences, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades that come on the power cartridge are nice but don&#x27;t seem to last all that long, especially on coarse hair like mine.  The shave is smooth, comfortable and close; pretty much everything you could ask for in a blade.  However, if you&#x27;re not shaving everyday, these blades require LOTS of pulls to get the hair up and then they dull out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good blades but I would have liked a little more durability and less work.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product for Gillette and I can&#x27;t think of a better set of blades on the market right now. I was faithful to my Mach 3 for years and years until now..This is my new favorite and will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for free to try out by Gillette. This was the first time I tried the Fusion Proglide. It did a great job. I didn&#x27;t have to go over any spot more than once. I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts even the first time I used it, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It gives a very close, smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> WOW pretty much sums up the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER. This is the newest and most advanced Blade that is currently out there. I shave about 3 times a week and got so excited after hearing about this free razor given out by Gillette. I was so used to just using the disposable razors that I never thought of trying a battery one before. I opened the packaged, put the razor together and jumped for joy! The cartridges are so detailed with many blades to provide a clean and easier shave. Turn on the power and it vibrates to stimulate and give a smoother shaving experience. It tickled a little but it really does an excellent. Areas like under the nose above the lip and neck area are the most difficult for shaving. These blades look out for you are care to prevent any cuts or nicks. My first shave was great and not like any shave I have had before!</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge for free from a program run by Gillette. These cartridges are amazing. In the past I have used several different types of razors and blades and these are probably the best. I have dealt with electric razors, disposable razors, manual razors, etc. The 5 blades in the cartridge are great for a smooth and close shave. My face feels and looks great after a shave. The MicroComb seems to help in getting a proper shave. One of my favorite things about this razor is the precision trimmer. It really works well for trimming the sideburns and shaving the upper lip. I have also noticed fewer nicks and cuts while using this razor as opposed to other razors.</li>
    <li> These razors get the job done...however they have less tug for your power razor....these razors are of very high quality and performance...no mistake buying these things...thanks 4 reading....</li>
    <li> I am a man who has tried every blade on the market.  I have a thick black beard and sensitive skin.  I received these razors free through Gillette.  I was totally amazed I could have a shave this close without cutting my face up.  When I shave, I have to shave in the shower so I dont end up with any redness or bumps on my face.  The razor worked great inside the shower, so I wanted to try this razor outside of the shower.  To my amazement, I did not have any redness or bumps after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in the public&#x27;s eye and need to have a good shave.  I totally accomplished that look with these blades.</li>
    <li> I recently tested the Gillette Fusion ProGlide out for market research.  I found that it gave a very smooth, clean shave.  In most areas it actually gave a more comfortable and closer shave than my Sensor Excel.  That&#x27;s the pro side.  On the con side, the massive multi-blade surface acts like a razor-clad paintbrush.  It&#x27;s great on the long smooth strokes, but has difficulty with sharp contours and hard to reach areas (under the nose and around the chin).</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program from Gillette.  I am usually an electric razor guy so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but as the title says I was pleasantly surprised.  I found that the blades gave me a clean smooth shave without any harsh razor burn that I usually get when I use a regular razor.  There are usually a few spots on my neck that I also have a hard time cleaning up and this razor did a great job leaving only a few very small almost unnoticeable hairs.  I think the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge is finally the one that is going to replace my electric razor for good.</li>
    <li> Last week I received a free Proglide through a Gillette program. Now I have bee using the Mach 3 for years and had decided that there was no way I would go for the extra blades. They just seemed like a waste, three was more than enough. Since the razor was free I decided what the heck and I gave it a try. Now I have curly hair and one concern I had was that my hair would get caught in the razor and pull rather than cut, the blades seemed to close together. Having used the razor for a full week (shave everyday for work) I can say that I had it wrong. The blades on the razor gave me a smooth shave with no tugging.The cartridge was easy to install and I am on week two with the same one. I can say that I am surprised and pleased.</li>
    <li> I have used the Proglide shaver for years now.  It provides a guaranteed close shave without pulling or a rash.  The multiple blades and gel built in make this work.  It is always the same shave as long as the blades are changed every 3-5 weeks.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge has 5 powerful blades that provide a fast, smooth, and close shave. The power cartridge further augments the quality of the shave. This product works great - even with sensitive skin (no signs of irritation or nicking). As someone who has had sub-optimal shaving experiences in the past, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge was a welcome change. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their shaving experience. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette fusion proglide power blades for free through a program ran by Gillette and I loved them.  They left my skin feeling smooth and razor burned and didn&#x27;t get caught on my hair and pull it out of my face like my other razor did.  I would definatly recommend these blades to any man.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product and will switch to this razor moving forward. I have never felt a shave this smooth. I use it on my face and my entire head and can shave with or against the grain without irritation. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had to give 5 stars because I am not sure how one could improve on this item. It&#x27;s the best out there by far. Leaves my face \\&quot;baby-butt\\&quot; smooth. (I have never touched a baby&#x27;s butt, so don&#x27;t quote me on that. The razor was provided free via a program run by Gillette. Although the refills are expensive, it&#x27;s worth the premium for that clean shaved look.</li>
    <li> These free razors provided by Gillette gave me the best shave I have ever had. The razors were very smooth gliding, and my favorite feature the precision trimmer is great for getting around tough places like the lip area and side burns. The power function really improves the glide ability. Overall great shave will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> After years of being a Schick Quattro user, I didn&#x27;t think I would change...until I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridges.  Pros: It&#x27;s the longest lasting cartridge I&#x27;ve ever used. Using it 4-5 days per week, it held for up for 5 weeks great.  I hate shaving and have sensitive skin, but the razor worked really well, giving me a close shave without tugging or pulling.  Blade stabilization was great for the contours of my face.  The handle makes it very easy to hold.  Con: An enlarged Lubristrip lubricates skin, allowing for a smoother shave, however, sometimes I felt a little slimy after shaving.  Note:  free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was given to me  by Gillette  to try it and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are extremely sharp and gets you a nice close shave. I used to have a problem with me 5 O&#x27; clock shadow but not since I have been using these razor blades. Also, the Mrs. loves them too. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Gilette has always made good products and this blade is excellent also.  I&#x27;d choose the non power version of the handle though.  I think the vibrations gave less control over the tricky spots and I thought I might cut my chin.  I&#x27;d buy these blades to go along with the Gilette razor that i got in a free promo from Gilette.</li>
    <li> I got to try these blades from a program sponsored by Gillette. In terms of performance it was very nice, especially the trimming blade for under my nose and around my mouth. I did notice it tended to get full of hair and not rinse very easily. Which limited the closeness of the shave. Overall very nice</li>
    <li> I have been a daily shaver for over 40 years and have been in search for the illusive closest, most comfortable shave for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest shave I found was with the old fashion safety razor. The problem with that is the learning curve was painfully filled with nicks and cuts. So close but not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about getting a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge via a promotion run by Gillette. I was willing to give this new shaving technology a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I experienced was the closest, most comfortable shave ever and I&#x27;ve tried MANY shaving products over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave than the safety razor, no tug or pull; extremely comfortable, no nicks and cuts, no shaving against the grain of my beard (good news if you get shaving bumps) and even those tough to reach areas, like under my nose, was a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge to any man who is looking for the ultimate shaving experience. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Since I first started shaving I&#x27;ve always had problems with irritation on my neck. I tried electric razors in high school, but ultimately switched over to the standard kind. I thought that if I tried several brands of shaving cream that I would find one that helped defend my skin, but in the end I discovered it was the quality of the razor that mattered most. I have been using a Gillette Fusion Power blade for several years and only recently picked up this ProGlide razor. The ProGlide was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette. Being a creature of habit I think I&#x27;ll stick with the regular fusion power, but I must say the ProGlide works just as well. I would recommend it to anyone. You can&#x27;t really go wrong with Gillette.</li>
    <li> Just got the Razor a few days ago through a program from Gillette to try it. I have a beard so I use Razors mainly for trimming along the edges and on my neck. This razor works very well for those purposes. Very smooth skin in the areas I trimmed after using it. Also my skin did not feel irritated like it does after using some regular razors. Will buy some more blades , this is a keeper.</li>
    <li> After searching for the perfect combination of grooming products, my face has met its match! I was lucky enough to receive this product through a promotion run by Gillette. After using the Power Trimmer, I smoothed things out with the Power Blades. These blades were thin and sharp, leaving my skin flawless even for hours after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades surpass every razor I have used in the past and are well worth every penny spent. The blades in this cartridge last very long, much longer than others I have tried previously released by Gillette. I love the pivoting head that reaches all the harder places such as under my bottom lip, my mustache, and my chin. I have also used these blades to even out my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a close shave, less irritation, and an easy-to-use blade, this is the razor for you. The ease of this razor allows it to be an everyday use razor. These blades are much better than most other blades I have tried in the past. They rinse clean easily with little to no buildup - even for my thick beard. I was very satisfied with the overall experience and am seriously enjoying shaving again. It has become more of an art than a chore and people are noticing!</li>
    <li> I received the fusion proglide styler blades free from gillette to try out, I have to say i really like the razor a lot very sharp and i like that its thin and glides great on my hard to reach areas with out cutting me, now i like how the razor connects to the trimmer which makes it more sturdy. and the whole thing is light weight and easy to hold in your hand. I really like the look and how easy it is to store. i will go and buy refills for the razor worth keeping thanks so much gillette</li>
    <li> I recently picked up this Gillette Fusion Proglide to replace another 5 blade system. I liked the other razor, but thought the Fusion would be a better product. I compared both razors with the same shaving cream this week. Both razors give a good and close shave. At this point, I would rate the Fusion ProGlide slightly ahead of the other system. The result was the same, but the Fusion blades ran a bit smoother (both had brand new blades for comparison.) I cannot comment on durability yet, but from my initial use, I&#x27;d rate the Fusion ProGlide blades at 4.5/5 stars. I&#x27;m not certain that they&#x27;re worth the extra $5.00 (compared to the other razor,) but they provide a good shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for shaving my sensitive skin.  Gillette did a great job of redesigning a razor that I can use quickly, get a great shave and not cut myself a half a dozen times.  This product is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have had sensitive skin my whole life and I appreciate the quality of the new Gillette Fusion pro-glide razor blades.  The blades make quick work of my stubble whether I&#x27;m shaving with the grain or against.  I would definitely recommend this Gillette product to a fried or family member.</li>
    <li> I like to shave every few days and I find that these blades are the best over any other brand out there. I have tried various brands trying to save money and always come back to the Gillette Blades. They work great on my face while in the shower and give me a smooth shave with and against the grain. I also use these on my head every 5-7 days to give me a clean shave. I use the Gillette trimmer in the shower to get close to the skin and then the ProFusion blades to get a smooth finish. I have been shaving my head for over 10 years and have been using the Gillette ProGlide brands for as long. I will not go to any other brand. The blades give a closer shave than the regular Fusion Power blades and have been lasting just as long. The closer shave is well worth the price of the razor. I have a crease at the base of my head and the single blade on the back works perfectly there to get the hairs out too. I suggest trying it once and you&#x27;ll feel the difference! The handle is really nice and ergonomically designed with great grip action so you don&#x27;t slip while using it.  I was given a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette, but I am going to be a longtime loyal customer of this product from hereon out.</li>
    <li> I really love the gilette proglide when.  The pro glide fusion power is very good, not sure if I would use the power that much because I do not really feel the difference than the regular version.  Very nice, but not sure if I would buy the power again.  Really like the handle though, nice grip and thick handle for more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor was provided for free by a program from Gilette.</li>
    <li> I have been using only Gillette Mach 3 razors for a few years now because I shave my head as well as my face and the open blade design keeps them from getting clogged. I have tried many other blades, but nothing worked as well. I received the new Fusion Proglide as part of a promotion from Gillette to try new products and expected not to like it either. I was extremely surprised at how good it was. It gave a great shave on both my face and head. I had no nicks, no razor burn, and a noticeably closer shave than I usually get. The blades seem to last pretty well also. Overall I am very happy with the Fusion Proglide cartridge and will be using them from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that gives you the closest shave of any other product currently on the market.  Shaving isn&#x27;t something that we love to do, but something that we have to do and this product makes that chore a little be easier and more pleasant.  It glides on your face like butter and the extra blades prevent nicks even in the most delicate areas on your face.&lt;br /&gt;*razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> Full Disclosure: I was given a free sample cartridge from Gillette to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I&#x27;ve been shaving (coming up on 7 years now...seems like forever), I&#x27;ve been using a simple 3-blade generic razor 2-3 times per week. It just given an adequate shave, and I never have given the quality of my shave much thought. I had become complacent with my skin being irritated for about 24 hours after I shaved (lots of redness and blotchiness - I tend to have more sensitive skin). I tried multiple kinds of shaving cream and aftershave, thinking they may be the source of irritation, to no avail. I never thought about changing up my razor blade, and now I&#x27;m kicking myself for not thinking of trying that solution earlier. This blade has made a day and night difference in my shaving routine. Since using the Gillette blade, I have had no pulling on my facial hair, less irritation, and the ability to easily trim my sideburns and mustache areas with the single precision blade on the opposite side of the cartridge. I have also found it amazing that the razor glides so smoothly over my skin, never tugging or causing cuts. I had to check myself in the mirror after using the product for the first time, as I thought that the blade must not have shaved any hair since I didn&#x27;t experience any of those symptoms. Much to my delight, the hair was all gone with none of those pesky side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique of the cartridge is that the conditioner strip along the top seems to wear out a little more quickly than I&#x27;d like. However, just having a conditioning strip on the cartridge at all  (unlike my old generics) is a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> After receiving the Pro Glide Power for free I have realized it is the best thing I have used to shave my face. It provides a very clean, close shave that leaves your skin very smooth and refreshing afterwards. I have to be clean shaven for work everyday so using this product helps keep my skin feeling good. I think the best part is how easy and painless it was for a quick shave when running late.</li>
    <li> I was happy enough to be able to try these blades for free provided via a program run by Gillette. These blades are sharp and they do what they need to do, but beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say beware and this really depends on your face and if you have any little bumps (even ones you can&#x27;t see) because it does a good job of maneuvering around them, but I still got nicked a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say after everything was said and done using these blades I did get the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Recieved these as a promotion from Gilette to try.  Love these cartriges.  Smooth shave and get 3-4 weeks of everyday shaving with each.  Great product.  I would reccomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion Blades when shaving for many many years. So when I received the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; cartridge for free via a program run by Gillette I was very skeptical as to what improvements my shaving experience would have.  Who would think that a simple powered MicroComb would give me any further benefit from an already outstanding razor but i am here to honestly tell you that I was blown away with the improvement that it made!  My shave experience was faster, easier on my skin &amp; more precise then ever before! I would highly recommend getting rid of any other blade and using this great product!!</li>
    <li> I received a  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge and the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette . I was amazed at what a wonderful clean and close shave I had . I have sensitive skin with using the razor I was truly amazed on how well the blades worked and it felt great shaving</li>
    <li> This blade/shaver is the best one by far. I got a better shave at home with this product then when I get shaved at my barber shop!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally shave with a razor but Gillette sent me some of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they feel like good quality Gillette blades, the same I&#x27;ve come to expect. They also feel like Gillette blades because the lubricator strips wear away quite quickly and a close shave turns into a very close shave indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With lots of blades in a good cartridge, they&#x27;re better than fine, but they should be. They&#x27;re expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use them with the trimmer turned on. Vibrating blades near my neck... no thanks.</li>
    <li> I Received this as a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.  I have been using it for about a week.  It gets very close to the skin and never Cuts me.  I was skeptical if it would work better than the non powered one, and it does a much better job.  Great Product,  Very Close shave!  This is MY go to Razor.</li>
    <li> won&#x27;t repeat what some of the other reviewers have said about how well the new Power Proglide shaves, but suffice it to say, it&#x27;s the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced (and I have a very sensitive neck). It&#x27;s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.</li>
    <li> After recieving my gillette pro power styler via a program run by gillette i have to admit at first i was a little optimistic about its blade attachment but i gave it a whirl.to my surprise it worked great.didnt have a problem attaching the blades on the styler it just snaped in.i ended up shaving everythin off my face and then some.i took it in the shower and shaved my ____ ,never felt so smooth so i give it a five star , for excellent.so give it a try i promise you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades included with the Power Trimmer through a Gillette-sponsored promotion. The ProGlide Power blades do a great job of gliding comfortably and smoothly across the skin, whether I&#x27;m shaving with or against the grain. I haven&#x27;t had any issues thus far with razor burn, bumps, or irritation. Without a doubt, the product delivers on providing a close shave. My one criticism: Although Gillette states that one can receive up to 5 weeks of comfortable shaves with one cartridge, I&#x27;ve noticed that the blades dull sooner than that--I wind up closer to the 3-4 week range. A- grade overall.</li>
    <li> Oh yes, you can. The handle is comfortable and assists in allowing you to shave the areas that do not want to be touched. Yes that&#x27;s right. I have been skeptical of these razors for awhile but after receiving one through a temporary program run by Gillette, I knew I had to give it a go. It worked like a charm with ease and I have found a new friend.</li>
    <li> Gillette was running a program to get a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power so I tried it. I found the blade was nice and gave a smooth shave. It cut through the morning daily stubble fine and did a good job with keeping my goatee trimmed as well. I found that it was easier to clean the blades then from my normal razor.</li>
    <li> This was a free razor provided via a program run by Gilette.  I was interested in how the whole trimmer built in would work.  I have sensitive skin and since it is derm recommended I thought it would work.  Well, the trimmer ripped up my neck, but the shaver was amazing on my skin.  Hence the 3 stars.  I really liked the blades on the razor, and got no burns like I normally do.  But when I switched on the trimmer, I could tell it was not so gentle.  I will continue to use this razor until I cannot anymore, and will not be using the trimmer end again.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge and found this product to be very good.  I got a good close shave with the cartridge with no irritation or razor burn.  I also found the face lasted longer in the day before I felt whiskers reappearing.  The cartridge seems to last a long time as well.  I highly recommend this cartridge for men looking for a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> When I first learned to shave, I used my Dad&#x27;s Gilette razor, and I haven&#x27;t considered another brand since! I always get a close and smooth shave which makes my girlfriend very happy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilette sent me a free razor to try out the power glide and it was an awesome shave as always!</li>
    <li> I got this free from Gillette. These blades were a great step up from the mach 3. the extra blade and design really seemed to help create a better shave. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with tugging or pulling because of the lack of space. a real step up giving a much more comfortable shave with no real issues. I think I even finished faster.</li>
    <li> There is nothing worse than razor burn after you&#x27;ve finished shaving.  The ProGlide Power Razor has come to our rescue!  This is simply the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  And as a guy who has to shave every day, not having razor burn is a life saver.  Thank you Gillette!</li>
    <li> the gillette fusion is amazing it gives one of the closet shaves and smoothes shaves i have ever experienced i honestly was skeptical at first but now i am only going to buy the gillette fusion</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge offers a close shave, durability and comfort. All in a single cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used Fusion blades before and being very happy, I was excited when I was invited to try the Fusion ProGlide Power as part of a free program by Gilette. And once I tried it, it was suprising how much better the Fusion ProGlide Power catridge was. Between the lubrastrip and the thinner blades, I did not feel any snags, but rather a smooth, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the cartridges seem to last longer than other Fusion blades. So I can get a better shave for a longer time between new cartridges. I really like these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who uses a Fusion razor and has not tried the ProGlide Power, I hgighly recommend it. For the comfort and the value it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Blades on this product gave a great shave. A close shave and definitely easier&lt;br /&gt;to get to the hard to shave spots. I got this product free through a program run&lt;br /&gt;by Gillette and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep my beard trim and neat and this makes it quick&lt;br /&gt;and easy to do.  The best feature was that the blades didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;clog up and it was just as smooth shaving when I was finished&lt;br /&gt;as when I started.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge through a program run by Gillette and it will now be my razor of choice. Found it to be the closest shave I have ever gotten without sitting in a barber&#x27;s chair and I have a pretty thick beard. The blades are durable as I have not noticed any dulling after about 7 uses, plus the lubricated strip on top is still fully intact. The trimming blade is great for those hard to each places and works so well that you don&#x27;t have to apply so much pressure that you nick yourself, especially around the nose area.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these razor blades.  I received the razor free from a Gillette trial program and I think it will replace my other Gillette razor I currently use. I  really like that head is really flexible and seemed to glide right over my whole face.  I never had trouble or had a \\&quot;tricky spot\\&quot;.  These blades are really thin, and flexible.  The little plastic comb at the beginning of the blades I do believe helps get a good shave. This razor just glides over my face easily and the blades seem to stay clean of hair and a quick rinse in the shower and the blades are totally clean. I am still not sure if I like the vibration or if it helps you get a closer shave when you turn on the battery powered handle.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that I received this cartridge for free via a program by Gillette. Their intent was to receive honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this cartridge for a week now, I have to say that this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! So close that I feel that my face stays stubble free longer. Also, it requires only one pass. The problem with most other blades are the fact that you have to shave the same area of your face two or three times to get rid of the stubble. Not with these, which makes them ideal for those with sensitive/irritable skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price might seem a little high but I feel it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ll put it to you this way, I will be buying these cartridges from now on!</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power blades for free through a program by Gillette.  In this context I thought it was a great product.  The pivoting head perfectly adjusted to the contours of my face, providing a clean and comfortable shave.  However, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t fork over $30 for eight blades.  Although they surpass the budget blades I normally use in terms of quality, I&#x27;m not sure that difference justifies the steep price.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor free as a promotion from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I do love this product. It is smooth, soft and impossible to nik or harm your skin in any way. I used it with and without bataries and I do not see the pulsation as very useful. It is not like electro: it vibrates all in your hand, your hand vibrates with it and it makes difficult to feel how you shaving. Maybe it needs getting used to, but I like it as a manual much better.</li>
    <li> Razors aren&#x27;t cheap.  I am bewildered how much they cost every time I have to purchase them...which we all know is 2 shaves late.  I received a free trial of the Gillette Fusion Proglide and am staying with this razor.  The best part of the Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridges is that they do what they say they do (provide a great shave) and most importantly last more than one shave.  I am sick of single use expensive razors and am happy that I have switched to a cartridge that I can safely use for a week and feel like it was money well spent.  Good job Gillette.  If you purchase based on reviews...like I do...this review is one I happily stand behind.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is the smoothest most comfortable blade I have ever used. Very difficult to cut yourself! Very close shave! The only concerns are that they are pricey and for the price they could last longer. duration is adequate but could be better. I have tried some of the newer competitors blades but come right back to the Fusion. They simply can&#x27;t match the comfort or closeness.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial of these blades from Gillette.  I have used other types of Gillette blades in the past, but I liked these the best.  Got a good, close shave with a minimum of effort/pressure.  Face felt great afterwards.  Definitely would recommend that you give these blades a try.</li>
    <li> After many years using another Gillette razor, I have found my new razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade cuts as close as a straight blade and is by far the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor, great shave.  Though I got this free via a program run by Gillette, I will be using from now on. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge from Gillette for free through a promotion to test it out and share my thoughts. I have just tried it out and was very pleased. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in 5 days and was not looking forward to what I thought was going to be a painful ordeal. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge gave me a close shave with little to no painful pulling sensation. My shave took only a minute and I was very happy with the results. Im not sure the vibrating has any mechanical value to the shave, but what I found was that the sensation of vibrating distracted me from the unpleasant sensation of shaving. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a pain free close shave.</li>
    <li> I normally use disposable razors. I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades via a program run by Gillette for free. It trims well but I did have to go over a few times. It doesn&#x27;t shave all the little hairs on my face though. The blades don&#x27;t go dull as fast as disposable razors do.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge attaches to the power trimmer. while I was blown away with the trimmer and how well it worked, I can&#x27;t say the same about the razor cartridge attachment. the trimmer (handle) felt awkward and bulky. the razor itself, though quite sharp, seemed to pull at the hairs while it was cutting them. this probably serves a purpose however I found it irritating. I tried it with the trimmer turned on and off but the results were the same.</li>
    <li> Men or woman, should own this razor. This razor gives a close shave without irritation or pulling! The little teeth that guide the hair are great too. Even my GF loves it, and she can skip a day of shaving. I wish I could skip a day but my job wont let me Ha! Anyways, its gental enough that I can shave every single day. I will buying this from here on out, well until Gilletes next great thing! Customer for life.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Gillette and this is just one more superior quality product from Gillette. ProGlide Power makes my shaving experience a very pleasant one. I feel the blades are very well designed and the vibrating action of the battery powered handle really made a huge difference in how easy it is to shave, and the razor glided right through thick stubble with no problem at all. I also feel that it is very easy to use while traveling. The best part of the blade is that it gives a very close shaving and the skin feels really soft after the shaving which literally no irritation. I feel this is one the best blades I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free razor via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I  was provided with a free ProGlide Power handle with one cartridge as a Gillette marketing program. After the first use, it looks like a winner. The blades are smaller and thinner than my regular non-power Fusion, and seemed to do a better job of cutting, rather than pulling, at a few days&#x27; growth. The vibrating feature of the handle took some getting used to, as it tends to make my hand feel odd. However, it too seemed to aid in the actual cutting process, by shimmying the blades minutely creating a tool that seems part razor,  part clippers. The trimming blade also worked well, though I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between it and my regular Fusion, other than the thinness of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does seem to work a bit better than my normal, non-powered Fusion razor. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I got a free razor through a Gillette promotion, and decided to try it. I typically use my Dollar Shave Club razor and blade and am very satisfied. I thought this was going to be a normal shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor truly shaves more smoothly and closer than other razors I&#x27;ve used. The \\&quot;edger\\&quot; blade, while odd, was also really useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Gillette! Great work.</li>
    <li> The proglide is the best razor out there.The razor shaves with fewer strokes than the other brands. After shaving, your face does not feel like there is already a new beard forming. Be careful shaving an area too much, the 5 blades make it easier to cut your face. I received the razor free from Gillette.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to my husband for free via a program run by Gillette and I must say that after trying this, he has have no idea why He never purchased one before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor glides on his skin , giving you a super close and smooth shave. He has sensitive skin and finds that He almost always break out in razor bumps after a shave and thanks to this beauty, no more! We Could not be happier with this product. He gets a super smooth, easy shave and I get smooth kissable skin :)</li>
    <li> I got this razor through a program run by Gilette. Previously I had been using other competitor products with the occassional Gilette Fusion (not the power version).  While I like the handle of the non-power version best, I get a far closer and superior shave using the Fusion Power version.  The handle isn&#x27;t as good as the non-power razor but the shave more than makes up for that.</li>
    <li> I received the razor free through a promotion run by gillette but would have bought it myself if it were not given to me, the razor itself is a bit pricey in a price comparison with the competitors but there are some great reasons for that. First off, the blades last longer, if you dry the blades off after using them, the blades will last weeks longer then the average blade you will be surprised. In addition, the closeness&#x27;  of the shave is great, it has cut down on the frequency of me having to shave from four times a week to two times a week. For this alone it is worth the extra money. As all of you know, time is money and i like the extra sleep time in the morning. I enjoyed how well the blades pivot as well, i didn&#x27;t have to worry about missing any hairs that were in odd spots on my lips or chin. Those have always been a pain for me. All in all i would purchase is razor in the future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette regular Fusion razor blades for many years. These Fusion ProGlide blades do appear to be a bit different visually, but still retain their 5+1-blade design. Unfortunately, the ProGlide blades don&#x27;t really seem to be a whole lot better than the regular Fusion blades. These are good razor blades, but the cons seriously hamper their overall value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;+Extremely close shave--the best I&#x27;ve had with any manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;+The \\&quot;lubrication strip\\&quot; functions as a nice indicator of when to replace the blade cartridge\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;+Have never nicked myself.&lt;br /&gt;+Can fit on any Gillette handle, not just the Proglide Power handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-Biggest CON: Not for those who don&#x27;t shave daily! I have coarse facial hair and find that if I go longer than a day  or two without shaving, this razor just can&#x27;t cut it without being uncomfortable or painful. I have to first shave with an electric trimmer and then follow up with the Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;-The clog easily. I have to bang the razor on the sink several times while shaving to clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;-The blades seem to get dull quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-The extra single blade on the top is pretty worthless. It&#x27;s supposed to be more precision, but I find it to be more difficult to create lines with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would still continue purchasing these razors after receiving this one for free from a program run by Gillette. Even though they are expensive and have a few cons, the resulting super-close shave is worth putting up with it, and I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet (but a lot of worse!)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have realized I can usually only shave with razors that have two blades. This is because one blade or 3+ blades usually pull and tug. I then get ingrown hairs and infections, razor burn, and irritation. I was very skeptical of trying this razor, but it definitely does what it says. Receiving this razor to try for free was definitely amazing. This will be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; razor from now on. I think that because the blades are thinner than others is why it works so well. The thinner blades don&#x27;t pull or tug and leave my skin smooth, not irritated. This is really an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; razor for me. In the pst I&#x27;ve had to use multiple razors or devices to achieve my look. Now with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I can shave, use the mircro comb and the trimmer blade and be done. The razor is also very easy to hold and use, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t have an amazon account so I had to use my wife&#x27;s :/ )</li>
    <li> This razor is definitely on the top of my list. The blades are so sharp and leave my face so smooth. i got this through a program run by Gillette and have not used another razor since. thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts when shaving with this razor, but it met my expectations. Smooth shaving which meant no cuts or nicks, also I personally didn&#x27;t get razor burn or bumps after it. I&#x27;m overall very satisfied with this product I recieved this razor via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> Before I tried this product, I have been using cheap razors. Every time I would get cuts and nicks in my skin followed by razor burn. This razor really fits the bill. I haven&#x27;t had razor burn since I started using it and my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Power Razor and the shave could have not been any smoother. I have sensitive skin and this razor left me with no cuts on my face whatsoever. I cant express how smooth the shave was even after my third shave with it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge recently through a promotion by Gillette. Now that I have used the latest offering Gillette has I can safely say I will still not be using their blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broken down by its components the blades are solid on paper. Five blades, a lubricating strip, and flexibility are all a must these days. The ProGlide Power cartridge has all these, and it looks great on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once I started using this I knew that I would immediately regret it later. The first swipe of the razor saw me struggling to shave as it caught and got hung up on hairs. I don&#x27;t have very thick facial hair, but you&#x27;d think I was trying to shave off a full beard. I couldn&#x27;t get through one area, especially my neck, without having to go over it a few times  with the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally all this constant shaving did a beating on my neck, but the lubricating strip would kick in and at least give me some kind of comfort and relief. That&#x27;s what I hoped at least. Instead it was as though I was shaving without one. I barely felt any effect of it being there and at this point it could have easily been there to help me glide the razor better. I still didn&#x27;t achieve that effect mind you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexibility was convenient when shaving my neck so I didn&#x27;t have to make any special moves to shave certain parts, but that&#x27;s hardly a reason to pick this product up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very advanced system of blades but I don&#x27;t think I got anything out of them. When I wasn&#x27;t actively fighting just to use them I wasn&#x27;t noticing any positive or special improvement on my face. In the future I will steer clear of these blades.</li>
    <li> I heard about this catridge promo through a program run by Gillette. Though I was skeptical at first on how much companies can improve on a razor, I decided to give it a shot. After using it a couple of times, I realized it is definitely one of the better products out there. The shave itself was very comfortable, with very little tug and fewer strokes to achieve a clean, close shave. As I don&#x27;t have a thick full beard, a close shave with the Proglide Power catridge lasts me a couple of days before I feel any stubbles come out, which is awesome as I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Before I received this blade, I wanted to know how it was different than every other blade on the market. Every blade seems to have the same features that it makes selecting the right blade confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed while using the blade is how easily it just glided over my skin. The razor immediately left my skin feeling so smooth but the real test is how long is stays smooth. With most razors, you can feel hair coming back after a few  hours. With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge, my skin stayed smooth the whole day. With a razor blade as efficient as this, I won&#x27;t put off shaving as much as I do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Having received a sample of this product for review by the Gillette Company, I have to say that this is one of the best razors that Gillette has ever designed and dare I say it, is even better than the \\&quot;Mach 3\\&quot; brand of razor blades that Gillette also produces and manufactures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utilizing 5 razor blades instead of the \\&quot;Mach 3\\&quot; system of 3 razor blades, the \\&quot;ProGlide\\&quot; system of razor blades for use with Gillette&#x27;s \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; series of razors and trimmers makes it easier to shave with less irritation because you have to make less passes over your face to cut that facial hair off, thanks to the 5 razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When coupled with the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; trimmer handle that is included with the \\&quot;Fusion ProGlide Styler\\&quot; set, the razor becomes even more effective, as the vibration from the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; handle helps to vibrate the razor blades in a way that gives them even smoother movement in effectively shaving facial hair as you bring the razor across your face while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the razor about 10 times, along with the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; trimmer, it started to not cut as well as when it was brand new.  That is to be expected of any razor system in which you have to replace the main razors after so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, the only thing I am a little disappointed with is the fact that replacement razors can be a little expensive depending on where you purchase them.  However, when you think about it, the price paid for the razors when compared to more traditional disposable ones is definitely worth the price and you save money in the long run because the razors last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would you rather buy 20 disposable razors and get a decent shave which may not be comfortable or would you rather buy 6 razors that will last longer and possibly be the most comfortable shaving razor you ever used?  For me, the choice is obvious; I&#x27;m going to get more replacement \\&quot;Fusion ProGlide\\&quot; razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product.  Well done Gillette!l done Gillette!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power gives me a fresh look everyday. Smooth skin, no irritation. Excellent product. I used to shave every other day and skip shaving on the weekends. Been using this cartridges for 2 weeks now and shaving everyday, including weekends. Very very happy, no more rush, perfectly smooth shave. Let me say I  received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for FREE via a program run by Gillette and will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the best smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had the super sharp blades just glide while cutting..with no bumps tugging or pulling...loved the blade across the top too for hard to reach areas... This is the best shave I&#x27;ve had by far with the least irritation ..definitely worth the price and will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Styler packet from a free program by Gillette and I love it! I&#x27;ve always thought that Gillette made really good products. With the proglide styler you get all the tools you need to manage any style your looking for. I let my beard grow for awhile before shaving it. I have really sensitive skin so shaving every day has never been a great option for me. I played around with the different trimmers even though i always shave it the same. I didnt get much irritation at all. I  really like how small it is. I would definitely recommend this to a scruffy friend.</li>
    <li> When i got my razor my first impression was good. Neat style and cool colors. I was excited to try it and left my stubble grow. When i tested it tho i really didn&#x27;t understand the vibration. Its like a gimmick for grown men. I use a similar razor of the same brand that doesn&#x27;t vibrate. It does just as good a job. I am not convinced anyone needs the vibration. It shaves good but the refills cost so darn much i am going to switch to an electric razor. I wont buy another one.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power cartridge blades are really nice.  I received the razor as a promotion through Gillette and couldn&#x27;t wait to try the blades for it.  I noticed the difference from my other blades immediately. Very smooth, just glides over your face (and my wifes legs) so easily.  The micro trimmer was a definate bonus...liked that alot too. My only con is that the blades did not last any longer than any other razor that I have used, that is the reason for only 4 stars.  Other than that, it would be a 5 star product!</li>
    <li> The razor is very good. I have used it for 2 weeks and i have alot less razor burn and nicks then i have had with other razors. My wife loves the feel of my face after i shave and I don&#x27;t mind shaving as much as i did in the past. I recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, I love how close the shave is, I have used a lot of different razors over the years but the power glide is hands down the closest shave I can get.  I have a very thick beard that tends to clog razors and I have never had that problem with the power glide.  Highly recommend this shaving system.</li>
    <li> I was recently asked by Gillette to try their ProGlide Power cartridge.  Having a heavy beard, I certainly have been disappointed by plenty of razor blades.  So I was pleasantly surprised at what a close, comfortable shave this cartridge provided.  And then I was at the mall the other day and found out at The Art of Shaving store that the Fusion blade is the one that they recommend also.  I can understand why.  When using their pre-shave oil, the blades actually last twice as long.  A win-win combination.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer compliments of a program run by Gillette. As a man with sensitive skin, blades have to be good or my face will have major razor burn and who want&#x27;s that. I really liked this razors&#x27; blades.  I got a close, smooth shave with no razor burn. The moisturizing strip is thick and along with my shaving cream. I got the best shave. The blades have a precision trimmer on the backside, providing a perfect line for my sideburns. The precision trimmer would also work with a mustache and/or goatee  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works better than all women&#x27;s razor blades. I hope someone comes up with better women&#x27;s blades. Amazon has the best price on the market.</li>
    <li> This razor blade is the biggest advance in razors I&#x27;ve seen yet--and I try virtually every new one that comes out!  I was still married to a previous Gillette power razor, as I hadn&#x27;t found anything better to date, but I tried the Fusion ProGlide Power for free in connection with a program run by Gillette.  I have gone one week now without a single nick, it&#x27;s definitely a comfortable shave without my skin burning afterwards, and I think it&#x27;s a closer shave, too.  Usually I have to shave again in the evening if I have plans, but I&#x27;m convinced I have less 5:00 shadow with the ProFusion Glide.  I will be interested to see whether the razor blade remains as dependable into week two (I usually replace my razor blade every two weeks).</li>
    <li> Got the Razor a few days ago through a program from Gillette. I use Razors mainly for trimming along the edges and on my neck. This razor works very well. Very smooth skin in the areas I trimmed after using it. Also my skin did not feel irritated like it does after using some regular razors. Will buy some more blades , this is a keeper. The handle is great and it vibrates to. Help to give you a close shave.</li>
    <li> I tried this cartridge as part of a free program run by Gillette. I loved the closeness of the shave and how sharp the blades still are after many uses. They provide a smooth shave. In my opinion, these are worth it because of the many uses you get out of them as compared to other cartridges.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free promotion from Gilette but I am amazed at how well this works.  Before I would always get razor burn, but with this I don&#x27;t get it.  I was very skeptical at first.  I mean, what do I need a battery powered manual razor for.  These blades are so effiicent.  They give me a nice clean shave.  So easy to use...I am converted.</li>
    <li> I recently received a ProGlide Power Styler from a Gillette sponsored program.  While the razor provides a nice shave, the oversized, fat handle makes it awkward to shave with precision unlike traditional sized razors.  Also, at nearly $4 per blade, they&#x27;re way overpriced.</li>
    <li> Normally I shave with an Electric Razor. However I decided to take part in a Free Razor program run by Gillette. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if this type of razor would work with my sensitive skin. I was very pleased with how well these blades worked. I was able to get a close shave. I had no problem with the vibrating feel as I am use too shaving with a electric razor. I think it is time to pack away my electric razor as I love the ease of this razor. As well as the close shave it gave me.</li>
    <li> I feel like this is the razor I have been waiting for my whole life! The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge gave me the closest, smoothest shave I have ever had. It fit over the contours of my face perfectly, never leaving any knicks or cuts, and leaving my whole face completely smooth. I didn&#x27;t feel any tugging on my face which I usually feel while shaving. This razor is also great for manscaping, and not just on your face guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BzzAgent gave me a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor to try for free, provided via a program run by Gillette!</li>
    <li> I just recently gave Gillette Fusion Proglide power a shot, and I couldn&#x27;t be more glad that I did. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is hands down the greatest razor ever crafted. I have always been one of those guys where I could never find the right razor that would give me that smooth, sleek shave without cutting myself. Well, after using the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power I haven&#x27;t cut my face up since, and have had that smooth shave I&#x27;ve always wanted. I will never use another shaving product again.</li>
    <li> I think Gillette hit a home run with this product!  I was using another brand that had 4 blades which was great except I could not get in close around my mustache area and I thought it would be more difficult with 5 blades, but that&#x27;s where the single blade on the back works great. The blades are kind of pricey but when you consider they seem to last at least twice as long as your double or triple blade, its actually a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> (Note: I received the razor blade and handle free as a Gillette test product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very effective. It shaves as close as any blade I&#x27;ve used. However, the big benefit is the lack of irritation, and certainly no nicks. I could never get a shave like this without irritation before. I can&#x27;t yet speak to the endurance/cost-effectiveness of the blades - they are not cheap - but I have used the one free blade I received several times now and it is still all right.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these ProGlides. They give me a much closer shave compared to my older fusion power cartridges. They look narrower compared to the older Gillete fusion power cartridges at first glance, but the width is exactly the same and it&#x27;s a little shorter than the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges are interchangeable between the older Gillete fusion power handle and the newer proglide handle. I can do just one pass ALONG the grain and get good results, which means a lot because I have extremely thick and fast-growing hair, and I usually have to do two to three passes to get a close shave. The blades seem to bend a bit more and there&#x27;s sort of a serrated/furrowed thing (not sharp) at the bottom which I think is used to guide and align the hairs better. I really, really like these.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  After using the Mach 3 blades for years I tested this product and I can&#x27;t believe what I have been missing.  I don&#x27;t feel any pull!  Even when shaving after being unshaven for a couple days.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recieved the gillette fusion proglide free through a program with GilletteI use the proglide for a couple times before I can get an opinion on it. let me tell you. after I shave with a regular blade my skin get irritated and i get a rash. I was sceptical on this one only because nothing has worked before. well it left my skin smooth and no hot spots. after a day there were no rashes. I am going to shave again today. after 4 days of letting my beard grow I have no pimples and it feels smooth not rough like the other blades would feel. I would have to wait longer between shaves just to let my skin recover, but with the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER  I can shave in two days or as needed with out a problem. now I will see how well the blades keep up.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades has to be the best razor blades on the market. This slices through that hair like a warm knife through butter. Its design is sleek and fits comfortably in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette was kind enough to send over this bad boy so I can try it out and spread the word. Well good news, the word is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest thing I have to mention is going in to this, I have always been very skeptical of the whole \\&quot;power vibration lifts the hair for an easier shave\\&quot;, well I don&#x27;t know if maybe I am still skeptical and don&#x27;t want to believe it as I am trying to justify why my shave left me smooth and in one swipe. My frame of mind is that the blades are sharper or at a better angle, or maybe it does work.&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out, but I do have to say that these are the best blades on the market and that the refills aren&#x27;t too badly priced, when you think of how long they last. I&#x27;ve had the same blade in my unit for a week now and it hasn&#x27;t become dull, and might I add that the Lubrastrip has lasted just as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That alone, makes the blades worth every penny. My skin is sensitive, if I shave I break out, if I don&#x27;t I break out, but the Lubrastrip has controlled my break out of razor burns. I haven&#x27;t used aftershave, since I started using these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s been great and Gillette has made me a fan. They truly are \\&quot;The Best a Man Can Get\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor from Gillette from a program that they were running. I haven&#x27;t used Gillette for about a year since I switched to Dollar Shave Club. When I was using DSC, I started to get ingrown hairs on my face. At first I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. When it started happening more and more, I started to look for other options. This is when I received the free ProGlide Power razor from Gillette- talk about timing. I started using it right away and I immediately realized that I missed the Fusion ProGlide power blades. The blades effortlessly took care of the hairs on my face. I shave 5 times a week and since I switched, no more ingrown hairs. The blades are a little pricey, but now that I know the alternative, why would I not want pay he extra few dollars for facial comfort. Also, the trimmer on the back really helps get those tricky areas and also helps keep the lines on my sideburns straight and fresh.</li>
    <li> With my sensitive skin, I have to choose my shaving products iffy. I had no problems with the product. It&#x27;s a smooth shave, and absolutly love the vibs.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck and I have no problem using these blades provided by Gillette for free for me to test out. It leaves your skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and it is also easy to get the hard-to-reach places for me by my nose. I think it is safe to say that these will now be the blades I will be using from now on.</li>
    <li> The razor cartridges were good at providing a close shave, but just like the other reviewer mentioned, they got dull pretty quickly. Normally I change my blades every 3-4 weeks, but I noticed the obvious dulling after just one week. I have very sensitive and dry skin on my cheeks and chin, and the blades didn&#x27;t irritate it, so that&#x27;s the good part about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: The product was provided to me via program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power for free from a program run by Gillette. I was hopeful that the blades would be great because I do love the blade on the back for getting the tough to reach area under your nose.  Unfortunately, the blades last for about 4 shaves before it feels like it should be replaced.  I do not feel that with other brands.  For the cost, they should last longer. I will continue to buy the blades just for the \\&quot;sixth\\&quot; blade but I will also continue to go with a different brand as my main blade.</li>
    <li> I tend to be someone that has sensitive skin when using manual razors, and i will be itchy and my neck will break out. With this razor I didn&#x27;t have those problems, it left a smooth finish with no rashes. If you are someone like myself that has difficult angles on your face (mine being due to a prominent chin) the precision trimmer has no problem reaching those tough spots and keeping them as smooth as that rest. I would highly recommend trying this razor for yourself and you will probably never have to try another razor again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these razors quite a few times, and when Gillette gave me the opportunity to test it against my current razor I was thrilled. Normally I use disposable 2 blade razors because they are economic, but I have tried using Gillette and Schick in the past. The four categories I would like to use to rate these razors are comfort, closeness, longevity, and creativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the comfort on these razors is about a 7/10. I have very sensitive skin and these razors are the most comfortable I&#x27;ve tried so far. When I don&#x27;t shave for two-four days it is totally comfortable and I don&#x27;t notice any discomfort. That being said, when I shave every morning (as is required by my job) I do have some significant discomfort. I&#x27;ve got razor burn on my neck (first use of the blade) and some general discomfort. With this in mind, my standard two blade razors would have me in substantially more pain, with most of my face hurting typically. In all, compared to other razors I would give this product a 9/10. The only comparable razor I&#x27;ve used was a Schick product. Overall comfort would probably be closer to a 7/10. There is still a long way to go in shaving technology, and even though this is near the best on the market, it is not perfect yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next topic is closeness. I would give this razor a 10/10 on closeness. Whether I go over once or twice, I always feel like I&#x27;ve got a very close shave and I&#x27;ve gotten complements on how soft it is. Once again, the only other comparable product I&#x27;ve used was a Schick product. My standard 2 blade bic razors would probably score a 6/10 on closeness for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is longevity. I&#x27;ve used the razor Gillette provided several times, and although it continues to provide a close shave, I have noticed that it gets slightly more uncomfortable every time I use it. This is to be expected-- the razors dull and there&#x27;s nothing we can do about it. I would say this razor is right on par with all other non-disposable razors I&#x27;ve used in terms of longevity. It is not remarkably better than any other product on the market so I will give it an overall 8/10. Once again, it is definitely not a perfect product and I am still waiting to see a razor that will stay nearly immaculate after several weeks of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I would like to talk about creativity. Admittedly, this is definitely the least important topic to discuss; however, the Gillette single razor on the back was an awesome idea. I think it&#x27;s a lot easier to shave around my mouth and sideburns using the single precision blade. I thought that was a cool idea when I first saw it, and it does work as advertised. Also, it&#x27;s not creative but I do like the 5 blade design. It seems to be a lot more comfortable than a lot of other razors, although I&#x27;m not sure why. It may just be a well designed product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this razor to someone with sensitive skin. Although it is not a perfect razor, there are enough positive attributes about it that it would make an excellent addition to your hygiene collection. If you are trying it out, I would still take a look at other comparable models, but be sure to give this product a try!e razors I&#x27;ve used in terms of longevity.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blades for about a week and have never seen my face as smooth. The blades do an excellent job of getting every whisker. Gillette provided a sample as part of a test, and they passed 100%. The blades remove all of the shaving cream like magic. Nothing I&#x27;ve every tried in more than 50 years of shaving has produced such results.</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor. I was not a fan of regular razors in the past and always preferred my electric razor. This blade has an incredibly smooth feel with no pull which made shaving much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> The razor is &amp; stays sharp for two weeks or mores...awesome!  I have sensitive skin, and was having problems with razor burn, but this completely eliminates it. It&#x27;s a smooth shave, and with any shaving cream/gel, it feels like there is no tug or pull during shave, even under my lower lip area! Rec&#x27;d razor thru a Gillette promotion, thanks for introduction!</li>
    <li> Okay. So, I am a creature of habit (what guy really isn&#x27;t??). Had my disposable razor for years. Always get the same ol&#x27;, same ol&#x27; at Target. It has always been good. But, my face is getting older, maybe a little more irregular, and I might have put on a couple of pounds. Been noticing that I have been getting a few nicks lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Proglide. I kept thinking - is it really that much different?? Yep. It was. Wife noticed it right away (always a good thing!). My first time using it, I had not shaved for a few days. It handled the thick stubble just fine. No clogging between blades or anything. Looks high tech, and shaves high tech. Got a smooth shave and glides over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced. It is everything they say it is.</li>
    <li> You get a close shave with these razor blades. They leave your skin smooth and not irritated! I plan on using these in the future.</li>
    <li> I received a free product from a program run by Gillette and was anxious to give it a try. I will admit that it took a few shaves to get used to the fact that I was using a manual razor that was vibrating in my hand. So the usual upstrokes were a little different in that I just had to glide the blades versus using an upstroke. Every shave has been great. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge blades did not cause one bit of irritation or nicks. It honestly was one of the first times I could remember using a brand new blade and not coming out with any nicks on my face. The blades are also convenient for getting those hard to reach areas. I always seem to have a problem with that area on my upper lip right under my nose. I can never seem to get a good shave on that area and if I ever did, that is when I would experience some serious nicks. Not a problem with the ProGlide. It easily reached those areas and gave me a nice smooth and clean shave in that area.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would give this 5 stars and will most definitely continue to use this moving forward. It really was that good in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide cut my facial hair to the style and cut that I wanted to wear it without going to a barber.  It worked great and had no problems.  It was a clean and smooth cut against the hair on my face.  The razor was provided by a program by Gillette.</li>
    <li> My husband used his Gillette fusion pro glide power razor and it made his face look so smooth and clean, one if his best shaves since using the leading razor brands. He got to try it for free and recommended all his friends and family to try it. This razor has everything you need to get that today&#x27;s look</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Blades were of good quality, and they lasted longer then most blades, I loved the sharpness and no nicks,&lt;br /&gt; I received my free razor provided via a program run by Gillette,</li>
    <li> Right up front: I was provided the Fusion ProGlide Power blades through a program by Gillette and was asked to try them and then write an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then, I&#x27;ll also begin by saying that I hate shaving. I know pretty much everyone does, but I have extra reasons to do so. A lot of men have sensitive skin, but mine is so sensitive that even the best blades (including others by Gillette) and shaving lubricants irritate my skin and hair follicles to the point of blistered acne. I&#x27;ve tried natural scrubs, exfoliants, straight razors, toners, aftershaves, everything I could to keep the ingrown hairs and fiery welts from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a professional environment where not even the slightest amount of stubble is permitted, so I have to shave at least every other day to keep it in check. After nothing up to this point has worked, I had resorted to using expensive prescription cremes to keep the blisters from getting too huge, and that was only to minimal effect. I honestly didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for YET ANOTHER FANCY RAZOR that is gonna charge out the nose for replacement cartridges, but I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I&#x27;m incredibly impressed and very pleased with the results. I still get a little irritation on occasion, but I don&#x27;t have to salve my skin any more. One pass with these blades are enough to get all the stubble, so I&#x27;m also sparing my skin from repeated drags of the razor. I also really like the detailing comb on the back to get those annoying little spots under the nostrils and in the corners of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the cartridges are certainly not cheap, they are definitely worth the money for what they do well. I&#x27;ve had them for almost three weeks now, and the blades show no sign of dulling yet, but I also make sure the blades are dry after using. So if a cartridge lasts a month, $5 a month for a shave that (finally) doesn&#x27;t irritate my picky skin is totally a fair deal.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical and thought the whole \\&quot;Power\\&quot; thing was a gimmick.  Boy was I wrong.  After I obtained the razor through a program run by Gillette; I was amazed at how easily the blades went across my face with ease.  I let my facial hair get a little longer than normal to see how the razor could handle it.  I was totally impressed.  I was nervous with the vibrating razor when I put it on my face.  After my first swipe I was sold.  It was such a nice smooth shave and it really felt like an electric razor coming out of this handheld razor.  I highly recommend this razor for all guys, especially those who were nervous or unsure about the whole \\&quot;power\\&quot; thing.  I was so impressed with how smooth my face was with these blades.  I do not use any shaving cream when I shave, and I am amazed at how easily these blades glided across my face.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette. I had been a loyal Schick Xtreme3 user for many many years. Aesthetically, they are day and night.  The Gillette is bright blue and chrome and really looks good.  The five blades made the head much larger than what I was accustomed to, however after a week or so, became comfortable.  The lubricating strip really does the job and early on, maybe too much, leaving a film of sorts on the face.  During the first couple of shaves, the blades glided effortlessly through the hair.  After a couple of weeks with daily shaving, the blades were starting to pull slightly, so I doubt the six week life span of the cartridge would be valid. What I found to be the best design of the cartridge is the trim blade and the top and back of the shaving blades.  This single blade is perfectly positioned for close trimming.  I found the extreme swivel of the cartridge placed the handle at an odd position and sometimes close to 90 degrees to the shaving cartridge.  Once again, after several weeks, it became a little more comfortable to use but still felt awkward to me.  After two weeks of trail shaving, I must admit that the Gillette is by far the most masculine looking razor I have ever used, however it&#x27;s not for me.  I will continue the search for the perfect razor.</li>
    <li> I think the Gillette Fusion was better than this upgrade. I bought the Fusion Power cartridges and then bought this thinking it would be better. But every time I shaved I seem to make multiple strokes and it still is not as smooth of a shave. I Would not recommend upgrading from Fusion Power to Proglide Power</li>
    <li> I received the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER RAZOR for free.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used a disposable razor and have used Gillette in the past, but not this particular one. I have never used one with a battery in it and didn&#x27;t really see the need for it.&lt;br /&gt;After I tried it I liked it. It felt nice shaving although i&#x27;m not sure it improves the quality of the shave. I did get a nice close shave with no nicks or cuts but honestly thats normal for me when using almost any razor.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the big question is the price difference in the razor and blades when I am out shopping again for refills. After trying it a few times and finding it very comfortable and easy to use, I give it a 9 out of 10. I do that because I really believe  I can get the same shave from the regular Gillette razor</li>
    <li> I received a trial sample from Gillette and had the chance to see if all this &#x27;fancy technology&#x27; and names, actually mean something in real life.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical but gave it a shot. To my surprise, not only there was a difference in the feeling, but even my shave time shortened.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are not only &#x27;fancy looking&#x27; but also really work.&lt;br /&gt;As usual, the price is the issue, but quality doesn&#x27;t come cheap...</li>
    <li> My husband tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge for free through a program with Gillette.  He had been loyal to another brand for many years before trying this one, so I really didn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;d think of a new product; however, he was really pleased!  The microcomb feature kept stray hairs from lagging behind - he got a really clean shave the first time around!  Despite having sensitive skin, there was no irritation. Another great feature was that the razors stay sharp for a long time.  They don&#x27;t need to be replaced nearly as frequently as his old razor.  Let&#x27;s just say that the leftover replacements to his old razor are in the trash and this is the only product he&#x27;ll be using from now on!</li>
    <li> This razor seemed to glide along my face easier than my old razor.  I do have very sensitive skin and this has been the first razor to not leave bumps on my skin from an irritating rash.  Will throw out my old razors and never look back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free razor to test via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I thought the original Fusion Power was a slight upgrade on the Mach 3, but the Fusion Proglide Power is miles ahead of both. The blades really do glide over my face quickly and comfortably, and the shave is so close that no stubble appears for hours later than with previous blades. I don&#x27;t like shaving, and I put it off when I can, but the Powerglide has made shaving so fast that I&#x27;m no longer trying to avoid it.</li>
    <li> I received the fusion proglide power razor free from a program provided by gillette and I have to say with my thick beard and sensitive skin the proglide styler blades really shaved my face smooth and i didn&#x27;t break out with a rash. I did nick myself a few times but it was minor. I think this product is a hit! I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received the razor and blades as a testing item, and I have to say I was pleased overall.  The blades themselves were the same fusion blades I&#x27;ve used in the past, and fit solidly onto the trimmer handle.  The trimmer motor even provided vibration for that \\&quot;power\\&quot; blade feel, though I myself don&#x27;t prefer it.  Still, it was very handy to be able to use the razor to shave my face and then pop off the razor blade and trim my sideburns that fast.  Overall, a very solid product.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor through a promo program run by Gillette. I have used multi-blade razors before and frequently I had trouble getting the stubble washed out from between the blades. However, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does not have this problem, despite having more blades than any other razor I have ever used.  Additionally, it delivers an extremely close shave. I had no problems with nicks anywhere, including my chin and neck. On top of that, the precision trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge took care of the hard to shave area under my nose. All in all, the blades on this razor are fantastic!</li>
    <li> I want to admit, first of all, that I don&#x27;t normally shave with a traditional razor.  My skin tends to be sensitive, and during the few times I tried shaving with a razor blade in the past, I cut myself a few times.  That&#x27;s why I currently shave with an electric razor, which doesn&#x27;t provide as close a shave as a razor, but it does the job for me given the fact that my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow at a rapid rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I was able to get a free sample of the Fusion ProGlide Razor, and I was surprised at how well they worked for me.  I&#x27;m not going to go into all the technical aspects of the blade, which can be easily reviewed on Amazon&#x27;s product page, but I will say that I was able to give myself a smooth, clean and comfortable shave without cutting myself or getting post-shave skin irritation.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d switch to shaving with a razor blade since an electric razor is faster and more convenient for me, but I do know that it is worth it to put down some money on these high quality razors rather than skimp on a package of cheap razors with plastic handles.</li>
    <li> When it comes to shaving my grizzly bear face it has been a true challenge to find a razor that actually does what it says it does. Well I am happy to announce the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor does just that.t I received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. The blades are one of the softest feeling but one closest cuts I have experienced, I have tried them all. I did find though that the blades did dull a tad to fast even with me drying the blades completely after each use. I will be buying more cartridges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for technology in my shaving equipment.  I stopped looking for something better when the twin blade came out, seriously.  Well, I can&#x27;t get a twin blade worth a darn anymore so it was time to look to the future and I was able to get a promotion razor from Gillette for free.  This space aged 5 bladed vibrating beast is a bit intimidating but the handle feels well made, balanced and fits in the hand perfectly.  The glide strip is nice and slimy to help it glide easily and the 5 blades look like they could shave a yak.  I don&#x27;t shave everyday so there&#x27;s a bit of a stubble build up when I do shave.  I found the vibrating feature to really help power through the rough beard.  On a next day shave I don&#x27;t use the vibrate feature so I get a better feel for the razor.  I&#x27;m 5 shaves in and overall I&#x27;m impressed with the light pull and smooth shave but I do think 5 blades is an overkill.  We&#x27;ll see how long the blade lasts before I decide if I&#x27;m going to buy more.  At those prices it better last a full two weeks or longer.</li>
    <li> The razor blades of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler, that I received free from Gillette, make trimming around the edges a snap. They give a close smooth cut, better than any I&#x27;ve tried before. Changing blades is so easy even I can do it.</li>
    <li> Want a smooth shave?  Look no further.  Provided free to me by Gillette, I always worried about too many blades.  With other manufactures this was an issue.  Not with Gillette.  The blades are so sharp, not only have I used this product on my face, I have used it to shave my head.  It has never been smoother.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on other products.  Choose Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades free through a program run by Gillette and I really like them. Since I started using them I don&#x27;t get razor burn like I have from other blades it&#x27;s a nice clean close shave. The blades seemed to glide across my face easily,making this nicest shave I have had in a long time.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge was provided via a program run by Gillette.  I have yet to find a product from Gillette that fails to impress.  This product is no different from the rest, it works like a dream.</li>
    <li> Blades trim my beard great but seem to go through them very quick. Would like to get an extra week out of shaves...</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from Gillette, and I was skeptical because I use a 3 blades, and I&#x27;m very picky about what razor I use. 5 blades seemed like a bit much, but I tried it because honestly, it was free and why not? This thing is so cool! The vibrations help mow down thick beard hairs, and the 5 blades uses less strokes than my 3 blade. It&#x27;s also got this 1 little precision blade on the back to get the side burns with out trimming all your hairs off. This was really smooth and I would recommend it because it made a believer out of me, and I don&#x27;t like to try anything new!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette .Used many brands but this is the only one i&#x27;m satisfied with. Cartridges are little expensive but they last longer and also give you a clean shave So when I consider this aspect then it is definitely value for money</li>
    <li> I was provided one of these to try, skeptical at first, am sold and LOVE it. Great razor and I would def recommend this to any man. I am face/head shaver and this makes it easier, smoother, better all around razor!!!</li>
    <li> I got a free razor from a program through Gillette and thought I would try it out. The Fusion ProGlide is a solid razor. I have used it through exhaustion and had very good results. It cuts down on razor burn and provides a close shave. The handle feels nice to hold and its easy to do when its wet and you&#x27;re shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really understand what the vibrating feature does though. It seems to be a trendy thing but I don&#x27;t know that it helps or hurts my shave, its just kind of there. It also doesn&#x27;t really seem to last for a full month, maybe 2-3 weeks, but that&#x27;s alright, its still solid and a decent investment.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Proglide Power Handle shaver through a program run by Gillette. I was interested in if the power made any difference and it did. Its sort of like a gentle vibration while you shave and it seems to help get a smoother shave. The handle is comfortable and I think it evens cleans better under running water while it&#x27;s on.I am quite pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> The absolute best shave you can get at home.There is no more that can be said about these blades.You know you have to shave so why not use the best blades.</li>
    <li> mcelheneyd here.... using my wife&#x27;s account to post my review. This Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette. I had always used the same razor and never considered switching. I just kept buying the refill blades. This has been going on for years. But now, after trying this razor, I just might switch! The shave was so close, but left no cuts or razor burn, and also left my skin feeling extremely soft and smooth. My wife loves it when I use this razor! :) If you&#x27;re looking for a great razor that you never have to worry about, give this one a try!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is by far more superior to any other razor in the market.  Every morning I use the ProGlide razor with their gel and find I could almost shave every other day!  This was never possible before on any other product.  I absolutely hate shaving so having a product that does the job amazing enough to scale back to every other day saves me time in my jam-packed morning schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is awesome for letting me try the ProGlide for free.  Thanks!!!! Customer for life!!!</li>
    <li> Its simple and easy to put together, use, and keep all the parts together.  It provides a clean and close shave.  The multi use shaver is the perfect shaver for every man and makes a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I love these blades too, but not the life of them, until just recently I got this tip from that book about things to know. Blades will last if soaked in baby oil. I put my  razor blade head in a small container of baby oil and leave it their soaking 24 hours a day. 1st it keeps out the oxygen to stop oxidation and next it appears to keep the blades sharper longer and also gives me a really smooth shave on my tough beard and my soft face.</li>
    <li> It is a extraordinary, and strong . I got it  free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, about a month ago i have been using it, and it is excellent, i have a thick strong beard, and grows super fast, now i don&#x27;t have to shave avery day , and my skin feels so smooth and i dont have irritation on my face any more. I&#x27;m very happy with this, GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER BLADES .</li>
    <li> I received this free as part of a campaign from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I love this! It&#x27;s versatile, unique, compact, and a real time saver. Everything you need at your fingertips to groom your face, sideburns, chest for a OUT THE DOOR salon look in minutes.</li>
    <li> These blades give a crazy close shave with out pulling or nicking my face. I have been a Gillette fan for years and this is just the next best blade in a long line of blades!</li>
    <li> I really love these blades and cartridges. They are easy to snap on and off and can fit the fusion proglide razor handle or the fusion proglide styler. Great for a really close shave. Glides smoothly. They are expensive but you can really tell the difference in quality. A great recommendation for any man in your life.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> This razor I&#x27;d worth every penny. It may be a little pricey but I feel that it&#x27;s worth it. It gets a super close shave and it is very easy to use. I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t give me any razor burn or cuts. It is great especially for me because I shave on a daily basis for work. I would definitely recommend this razor to other people because this is the best razor I have found so far.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this in the mail and it was the best my face has felt in a long time, I almost forgot how good Gillette makes razors. This past Christmas I got one of those jumbo packs of razor cartridges that you would find on the shelf of some wholesale club. I put my Gillette in the cabinet and started using this other brand because I figured what the heck, might as well not let them go to waste. The blades dulled fast so you need the jumbo pack just to last. I felt like I was constantly changing the cartridges and it just didn&#x27;t make my face feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I saw Gillette offering a free sample so I wanted to compare the two and instantly my face felt the difference. My wife and kids weren&#x27;t afraid to kiss me on the cheek anymore after they felt how smooth my face felt again. I&#x27;m not looking back now, Gillette is the only brand I will allow in my house. And for my lousy gift giving relative, his birthday is right around the corner and I will be picking up a Gillette gift pack for him.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler, besides being a mouthful, is a good disposable shaver. The first few times the shaver gives a very smooth and very close shave, however, I found after about two weeks the blades get more noticeably dull and require replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this shaver? Honestly, your money is better spent on an electric shaver if money if your bottom line. If, however, you enjoy the visceral experience of jumping out of the shower, lathering up your face, and putting 5 blades to your throat, then Gillette is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette and now they have been hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was historically a Mach 3 man and always believed that adding a 4th blade was just a gimmick. After using this blades for over a month it is clear how much more the 4th blade adds to providing once of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, I always had a issue cleaning up my neck area, but with these blades I&#x27;ve gotten the cleanest and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main pro&#x27;s for me are the closeness of the shave and longevity I&#x27;ve been able to get out of them. The only Con really comes down to the cost of replacements, however this is fairly common for any replaceable blade.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of razors with a high price tag because I&#x27;ve never really been able to justify a huge premium from a middle priced razor to the higher end. I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge to try and I have to say I am very impressed. It actually lived up to all the marketing, which does not happen every day. I have a thin oval shaped face and in my case it worked. I read some reviews saying it did not work as well as some other version, which I can not comment since I am coming from a middle of the road razor. Maybe it will not work with all face shapes and that&#x27;s the issue, I just offer that to suggest that it was awesome for me but may be a face shape issue if it does not work for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have give the razor 5 stars if it did not have such a high price tag on it. Having said that, that things works and I&#x27;ll probably buy more. Not sure I will use it every day, but for sure when I want a truly close shave.</li>
    <li> So I got this free razor through Gillette, which is lovely, and I&#x27;m a die-hard Gillette Fusion Proglide user.  However, when I started using Proglide Power years ago - my skin got irritated - I got ingrown hairs.  I wasn&#x27;t sure why.  Went to the derm - and he asked if I was using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power.  How&#x27;d he know!?  He said that he&#x27;s seen it a lot with his patients after it came out.  He said its the best cartridge on the market, but turn the power off for sensitive skin.  You don&#x27;t need the extra vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I love it.  And was thrilled to get one comped in the mail.  Costs a bit more than the non-power blades, but I&#x27;d use nothing else.  Just wouldn&#x27;t ever turn the power on.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have spent tons of time and money look for a razor that will give me a close, clean shave without irritating my skin. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge has been a true joy to find because it provides that clean, close shave without irritating my sensitive skin. I have been fortunate enough to try Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge for free through a program run by Gillette, and I am so thankful to have found these blades. The Microcomb really works by guiding my facial hair to the blade, leading to a super smooth shave. The glide of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge allows for a super easy shave. There is no catching, pulling or cutting, and it really leaves my skin and complexion feeling smooth and extra comfortable. Another amazing benefit of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge is that I can now shave everyday and don&#x27;t have to skip days because my skin has become irritated by my razor blade. In this way, I can always look and feel my best because Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge gently removes my stubble without being rough and while allowing my skin to stay fresh.</li>
    <li> Through a program run by Gillette, I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge. At first blush, this razor appear very similar to the standard Fusion ProGlide blades that I have used for years.  So I was curious how it could possibly offering anything more than my past experiences.  Honestly, I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after shaving with each once in a few days time, the difference is remarkable.  I attribute it to the addition of the MicroComb.  It really works as suggested to pick up the hairs, separate them, and keep them standing tall to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair has different patches that grow in unique, irregular ways.  With other razors, I&#x27;ve had to use unconventional techniques to get a close shave.  Not with this razor.  Normal, standard shaving motions provided the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, even through the irregular patches.  It felt so smooth sliding over my skin, like there wasn&#x27;t even a razor there.  By far, the best razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Since released, I have always used this product, as I have sensitive skin and these work the best on my face. These are the same that you will find at Costco, Walmart, etc. but the price is better here.</li>
    <li> I recently receive a free Proglide Power Razor and Cartridges through a free program offered by Gillette. I wasn&#x27;t sure if they could get any better but I really like the  Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridges. It gives a smooth shave, is easy to trim around my goatee and mustache and I get a close shave. My beard is tough and grows out quicly so I have to shave every morning and so far the first cartridge is holding up. Twos weeks and going strong.</li>
    <li> likes: very precise 5-blade shave with less skin cut/bleeding, assisted by the battery constant movement that makes shaving smoother&lt;br /&gt;dislikes: big product pack (lots plastic), 5-15 second setup can take as much 30seconds depending on our lazy eyes, no cover for blades after shave&lt;br /&gt;it is a new product for me, a mix of battery operated that makes the sharp blade cut smoother.</li>
    <li> One cartridge came with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler and one with the regular Fusion Poglide Manual razor, both of which I received through a program by Gillette. I used this on my chest to finish the job I&#x27;d started with the Styler. I used the manual on my face. It does take some getting used to, and more frequent cleaning - I find that lightly tapping it against the sink after a run through with hot water on the backside helps to clear more gunk out of it)than my old 3 blade (Hey, they were cheap!), but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. Thanks to an ex-girlfriend, I find that shaving with hair conditioner works a lot better for me than shaving cream, which probably wouldn&#x27;t work well with this razor. As far as performance, I didn&#x27;t notice any tugging of my skin or irritation post shave. Now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to preview it, I think I will permanently replace my old 3-blade.</li>
    <li> When Gillette asked me to try the Fusion ProGlide Power Razor, I was not hesitant. The blades are so sharp that I had no stubble when i was finished shaving. There are 5 blades on it unlike the mach 3. I impressed a whole lot of people by how good my face looked. And my wife was impressed how good it felt. As smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind. I highly reccomend this to anyone who wants that smooth feel on there face.</li>
    <li> These razors are awesome they create a smooth shave and last much longer than your normal throw-away razor.  I enjoy using Gillette Razors, I always have a better shave and these are the best yet! I was given an opportunity to try these razors via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> To start, I have always had sensitive skin to razors. Whenever I would shave my neck, I would inevitably get razor burn and potentially lead to cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free razor through a program run by Gillette and after receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades I was very happy with how smooth they glided. After my first shave, my face felt very fresh and soft, and no razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use, it appears that some of the areas that I would typically cut while shaving on my neck have actually healed where they are not getting cut again after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with these blades since they make it much easier to have a smooth shave without the cuts and razor burn.</li>
    <li> The GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER BLADES provided by a free Gillette run program worked great. The blades last a long time compared to my original blades. Compared to my old blades, these blades lasted me at least 5 to 8 more shaves more. I will definitely be buying more of these blades and spending less money in the process.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through a Gillette program but don&#x27;t let that detract from how much I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it years before they sent it for a free promotion. I have sensitive skin and blades are perfect for me because it cuts so smoothly it never irritates my skin. The best part is they hold there edge for weeks. I mean they have lasted longer than any other razor I have ever used. I will remain loyal to this brand that gives me such a great shave.</li>
    <li> I received this free through a program run by Gillette.  While the blades provide an excellent close smooth shave, I have to agree with the others who have posted that they dull way too fast.  This wouldn&#x27;t be such an issue if the price were comperable to others, but I find them to dull out much faster than other brands and the price is much higher too.  If Gillette can improve on this, they would definitely have a winner.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me and maybe I am just too thick haired but while they can get a clean shave they don&#x27;t always do. I have changed the blades and still the same. I like them and the edging tool is actually useful, once i figured out what do with it, but I find the blades dull to quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Gillette fan for some of the products and while I can&#x27;t say I am convinced this is there greatest product I do think that it is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I consider using these for long, maybe but I might drop to my single blade method. Which provides me a cleaner, yet more deadly shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I received these power blades for my Gillette razor through a program that has been sponsored by Gillette. Though there are one or two minor things, I can say that I am really satisfied with these razor blades over all. I like that the razor has a trimming blade for the hard to reach places just above your lip and for trimming your sideburns. I feel that it gave me a long lasting close shave. The blades provide extreme comfort to ensure that you do not cut yourself, which is a very good thing. The only thing that I would change on these razor blades is the conditioner strip. The conditioner strip is not very big and does not last very long at all. Other than that, very good quality razor.</li>
    <li> I do need to shave on a regular basis due to my Job. My skin is sensitive if it comes to Razors so I only trust what I know.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I have been awarded with a Free Razor from a Program run by Gillette and had the chance to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cartridge has a Lubricant Stripe that should make your skin softer. Should, because I do not feel any difference at all. Using Shaving Cream must be a Killer for the Stripe. It only lasted a couple shaves and according to Gillette if it turns white it means you need to change the Blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cartridge itself has 5 thin Blades and a Precision Trimmer. Even shaving against the grain is no problem for the Blades. My Skin is not irritated at all after the shave. The Quality overall is really good, I believe that this will be my Travel Razor for the upcoming time.</li>
    <li> I received a ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette which included this Power Cartridge.  I loved the Styler but wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the cartridge.  I found that the cartridge was rather large and often the razor head pinched when I turned the vibration on.  The razor head is too large to trim close to mustache and beard. It&#x27;s awkward for a close clean trim next to a mustache and/or beard.  On areas of my face that were larger, I do have to say that the cartridge did leave my face smooth and without nicks.</li>
    <li> I really liked the blades on this razor, The five blades made It so easy to shave. it was one clean and easy shave. I didnt have to go over it again and again. this is a great razor and I will be switching to this from now on.I got this for free from a program run by Gillette, the only bad thing I have to say is that my wife loves it too so \\&quot;Hide your razors men\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor free from a promotion that was being ran by Gillette. This is a wonderful razor. Keeps me looking cleaned up everyday for work. Does not give me razor burn and gets really close to my skin. The razor doesnt pull or tug. even my Gf loves to use my razor. I recommend that you give it a try if you are looking for a great razor!</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette fusion ProGlide power trimmer from Gillette for free. I am in love with it. I like the grip that it has to make easy hold of while shaving. I especially like the blades that have the one blade up top to do a edge up or a easy trim. There&#x27;s nothing negative that I don&#x27;t like about it. I would go around my job and my classes and tell the Guys about the razor. I recommend guys to buy it to give it a try. If you guys would like to try it they are in all stores.</li>
    <li> My dad taught me to shave with the two blade disposable razor when I was growing up.  As I got older I tried several different kinds of razors, but the price and quality always seemed not so great.  So I always went back to the two blade disposable.  When I turned 25 I noticed that the skin on my neck started getting ingrown hairs and broke out after I shaved.  So I stopped shaving all together and grew a beard, so needless to say when I got the free sample of the Gillette ProGlide Fusion blades from Gillette I was kind of reluctant to shave my face since I&#x27;m now 30.  Boy am I glad I did!  These blades are amazing and not to mention the fact that the lubricating strip has lasted almost two weeks!  My blades aren&#x27;t dull, it&#x27;s still as sharp as the day I took it out of the pack.  No razor bumps, no irritation, a perfect clean shave every time.  Even my Dad asked me what kind of razors I was using.  He is now a ProGlide Fusion user.  Just in time for Fathers Day.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from a Gillette program to use and review. I am not a fan of this razer. The blades were too small and narrow that I felt like I needed many more swipes to get as good of a shave as I would with another premium razer. The vibrating feature did nothing for me either, it just added noise while I shaved. I like Gillette products and will continue using and trying new ones, but I think I will pass on this razer in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard the commercials and commentary about how just one razor is enough. I tried the battery operated 5 blade razor and it worked like a miracle. It was a smooth comfortable shave and I&#x27;m only bummed that there was one cartridge provided in this FREE trial from Gillette. I definitely recommend trying it. The blades glide over your skin in the toughest places around the neck. I was so convinced of the product I even shaved my head with it without a single nick or scratch left behind. Excellent product. I will definitely be buying this product in the near future.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette as part of a free program. The power blades in the ProGlide Styler allowed the trimmer to give me close, clean shave with no tugging or pulling at all. Typically I either nick myself or have some kind of pulling with trimmers - not so with these blades in place. The low-resistance coating allowed the blades to cut right through my 4 days of hair build up with no problem! The blades are spaced closer together than normal which helped with the no &#x27;tugging or pulling&#x27; issue that I normally have.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette so for a free razor it&#x27;s pretty good!! I had been using an electric razor but the blade needs to be replaced so when I got this free razor in the mail I thought what the heck! Surprisingly, it gives a really good close shave. A much better shave than I&#x27;ve been getting with my electric razor. Although looking at the cost of blade refills, yikes!! Pricey.</li>
    <li> This is a really good razor. It gives a very quick and smooth shave.  I use it on my face as well as to shave my head.  The only trouble I have is getting a close trim around my facial hair.  Well worth it</li>
    <li> I used to think 3 blades were great. 5 blades are awesome! The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and boy am I happy I got one! I was an avid Mach 3 user and refused to use any other blade. Now I have a new love and it&#x27;s the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge. I use it to keep my bald head nice and clean and this is the product that does the trick! It&#x27;s flexible enough to flow over every contour and it&#x27;s easy to use and glides without nicks and cuts! I believe my wife loves it too!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Gillette for many years. So when I was approached by them to try their new product, I was really excited. I was sent the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power. The cartridges are better than any I have used before, leaving me with the closest, smoothest shave I have had in decades. It makes playing with my baby easier, as I am not afraid of irritating her skin.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide for free in a program run by Gillette. As someone who has sensitive skin, I was surprised by how close and smooth a shave it gave me without any nicks or burns. The precision trimmer was helpful for those smaller areas to ensure a smooth shave all around. I&#x27;ve only used the razor once so far so I&#x27;m waiting to see how well the blades last up after multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I received the razors from a program run by Gillette. I am very happy with the close shave the razor provides and happy about how easy it is replace it. I do wish the replacement cartages where cheaper but last awhile which in a way make up for the cost.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free via a program run by Gillette. I have pretty thick hair and I generally wait longer than I should to shave so I usually have problems with shaving long hair. With this product I no longer have that problem, the razor glides more smoothly than any other razor I have used. In fact, it has even cut down the amount of time I spend shaving because I can move quicker without worrying about getting cut. The only complaint I have is that I feel like it didn&#x27;t give me that close of a shave; I was in need of a shave again in two days when I can normally go about five. For me, the pros outweigh the cons, I am more willing to shave frequently with this razor because it doesn&#x27;t tug or cut my face.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide is the best razor on the market for anyone with sensitive skin. It gives a very close shave and makes your skin feel great. Thanks Gillette</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades that I received free via a program run by Gillette for a few weeks now and I must say they are the best power blades I&#x27;ve used ever.  I really have noticed a difference in the quality of my shaves and how little irritation I feel on my skin after shaving.  The blades provide me with a smooth shave and I think these blades are far better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> To start I have very sensitive skin and even when I go to the barbers I inform them to go easy on my back neck as it tends to bump. Now let me tell you this product beats all other Gillette blades in my opinion. I tried out the product through a program Gillette was offering and I definitely wanted to try it out since it stated it was a dermatologist recommended product. The Blades are very very thin and cuts off my hairs so fast that I barely feel the blades on my face or neck which goes easy on my sensitive skin not causing it to bump. Since I started to use the product a week ago, I have not seen bumps on my neck and its improving. Plus I have to mention the micro comb as it has really helped kept the hairs align as the blades pass through. And the precision blade is a genius idea as it helps me reach areas the normal blade cant. In general if you have sensitive skin, please get this blade as you will thank me. Just make sure you still put lotion afterwards!</li>
    <li> I recently switched from the regular fusion proglide to the fusion proglide power as I received a free fusion proglide power razor through a Gillette program to test out.  I absolutely hate shaving and I was a bit skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t think it would be that much different however I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the fusion proglide power from now on.  It is a great shave.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received the Fusion ProGlide Power razor from Gillette to do a product review and share my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to shave for the past 2 weeks and I have to say there is a noticeable difference in the smoothness of the shave versus my Gillette Mach 3 Razor I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to. It also seems that the blades and aloe strip haven&#x27;t worn down as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery-operated Power feature I thought would be a gimmick but it really improves the smoothness of the shave. I tried half of my face with it off and then turned it on and really noticed how much more quickly my shave was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I don&#x27;t like shaving every couple of days but would rather wait to shave a 4 day almost-beard which can be trickier. Didn&#x27;t have to repeat any sections and no razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked these up on the internet and have to say the price is a bit high. On average I found the cartridges to be $4.50-$5 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a blade that lasts, isn&#x27;t prone to fast wear, cuts quickly, and leaves no razor burn, you should try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion proglide razor for about two weeks now and its wonderful. I actually don&#x27;t dread shaving now. It glides across the skin with no distruction in its path. Leaving a smooth razor burn free face! I love that the batter power helps get the closest shave possible with ease! I recieved this product via a program ran by Gillete BUT these are my honest and true opinions!</li>
    <li> Once again Gillette has out performed!  Be nice close shave without the irritation.  Make sure you inspect the head if you drop it. The blades are easily misaligned if dropped.</li>
    <li> The shave was amazing used it the styler.  But the blade are just to expensive for my taste.  I continue to use my cheap razors and save the money.</li>
    <li> I got an opportunity to try this product in a program run by Gilette and I have to say I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It must seem odd to have such a positive review for something as minute as razor blades, but I have to say, once you start using these blades, and you go back to any other blade, the difference is incredibly noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;Just the other day, I was out of town with my brother and forgot to bring my razor with me, so I used his (not ProGlide Power Blades)and when I was done shaving, I was actually embarassed by how red and bumpy my face was! I had taken for granted the smooth shave that the Power Blades provide for me.&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like these blades last a bit longer for me than any other blade, but that could be because the ProGlide Styler is batter powered and thus I don&#x27;t have to push as hard on the blade.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this blade for anybody who has problems with razor burn/bump.</li>
    <li> What can I say. I recently received one of these razors for free through a program run by Gillette. In all honesty I prefer Gillette to other brands however these blades last me for about 3 shaves and they start to nick and cut. The cartridges are rather on the expensive side which is another downfall in my personal opinion. However I can say that when they are fresh out of the pack they give me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. If it wasn&#x27;t for the price and the duration of the blade I would have given this 4 stars.</li>
    <li> To preface: my husband wrote this review.  We share an account and he didn&#x27;t feel it was necessary to create a new one to write reviews on his product.  Here&#x27;s his thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the power cartridge free as a part of a Gillette promotion, and was very impressed. The blades gave me a consistent, comfortable shave. The precision trimmer didn&#x27;t seem that useful, but the primary blades were all I really needed.  The trimmer would be useful for certain aspects of manscaping, like on the sideburns.  But I much preferred using the primary blades included in the power cartridge.  The shave was close, even and didn&#x27;t leave my skin looking or feeling irritated.  I will continue using this product as part of my daily routine!</li>
    <li> I was given these blades free from a program provided by Gillette. I am beyond pleased with the 5 blade technology. The pivoting head allows a closer shave in tight spaces below my nose, and ear areas. The gel strip at the top of the blade provided a pain free shave post shave. I have very sensitive skin, and the Gillette fusion Proglide blade gave me bump, and rash free experience. I highly recommend these blades!!!</li>
    <li> Good Evening,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing about the Gillette Fusion Proglide Catridges upon delivery from Gillette as part of a free program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s dive in! These blades are mediocre. There I said it. Now, why would I make that assertion. Well, let&#x27;s start with trying to get a good shave. After tipping it with some water, it digs right into the skin getting you a shave with only millimeters left on the chin. However, it digs in and that feeling is just not the best. I hope that Gillette will in the future decide to rethink the way this blade is made. I have used Gillette in the past and have loved their blades. They got the job done, but didn&#x27;t cause any pain or irritation. I have also used Schlik&#x27;s blades and they are much better in my opinion due to their clean shave plus less irritation. I think it maybe a result of the geometry of these blades that causes the slight irritation or maybe just my razor is too raw. I will try to update this review in time if the status changes, but as of now it doesn&#x27;t exceed my expectation. Luckily, I have not gotten cut from the blade and pray it doesn&#x27;t happen in the near future. I really hope this review was informative and thanks for reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, just as my other reviews comments help a lot more than thumbs down, so please take a moment to help me, help you. Thank you and wish you all the best.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free via a program run by Gillette. I have tried a few razors and this is by far the best one. The blade is sharp enough to tackle multiple types of hair and yet be gentle on skin. Also, the blade is very sturdy so that I can shave many times before buying a new one. It takes months before I have to change my cartridge. If I do need to change the cartridge, it&#x27;s very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a reliable, simple, shaver, Gillette is the brand to go with.</li>
    <li> I got to try out these blades for free because of a program run by Gillette.  After trying these out here are some of my general impressions.  Firstly the lubricating strip I love this invention.  With this strip along the top your shave goes silky smooth and I noticed a definite lack of shaving burn.  I actually use an electric razor for most of my regular shaves and notice that when I do go back to regular razor and shave cream there is some irritation and burn.  This time there was no irritation and just only the faintest amount of tingle.  The blades cut nice and close, and the rubber bottom piece does a good job of stretching out the skin giving you a clean shave without having to make too many of those awkward facial poses that most of us guys are used to making.  Over the course of my usage the blades remained sharp and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with nicks or cuts.  The blades also have a nice flexing, springy top head that helps to contour around your face.  Its nice to have something that contours to meet your needs, instead of having to work your face around a non flexing blade.  Overall I think this is a great product and will be using these as my go to on date nights with the girlfriend as she says that my face feels so much smoother when I shave with razors vs. the electric.</li>
    <li> First off, I got a free razor which was provided via a program run by Gillette.  This is my honest opinion about the product.  I give it 4 stars because while the razor and blades are great, they aren&#x27;t fantastically amazing.  I think they give a pretty good shave for the price and are good quality as well.  I would recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. The new design of the blades were at first impression a gimmick but I was proven wrong when trying these out. Smooth is an understatement. When I shave typically I get minor nicks and bumps even with new razors. I have sensitive skin but with these pro glides there were NO bumps or nicks. So a gimmick these are NOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for those who shave and have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These shaving blades are so comfortable! I had to start with that. After receiving a trial through a program run by Gillette, I won&#x27;t go back to anything else. I constantly suffered from razor burn and bumps with other shavers, but these blades just glide. You don&#x27;t feel the hair on your face being ripped out like with other blades. There&#x27;s just a cool glide on your face(or wherever your using them). I can honestly say I would recommend this product and not feel guilty. They</li>
    <li> I received a free Fusion ProGlide razor via a program run by Gillette and really liked the end results. The razor provides a smooth, clean shave, and I didn&#x27;t experience any razor burn or bumps that I sometimes will with other razors. I can&#x27;t say too much else about them, except that I was very impressed! These razors are my new number 1.</li>
    <li> I am not that satisfied with the blades. They could be better. I rate them to be fair. I notice the blades tend to get backed up which is pain. I got this item for free to try via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been looking for a product like this. So, if I had not received it as a free promotion run by Gillette, I would not have thought to search for it. Now, I won&#x27;t travel without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frequently travel on business and speak at conferences. My appearance is important. I always pack both a razor and a trimmer. Carry-on bags get heavy and tight on space. I&#x27;m always looking for ways to offload weight - even a few ounces. The Fusion ProGlide Styler combines an excellent razor and an easy to use trimmer in one light, compact device. It&#x27;s small, fits in the hand ergonomically and enables me eliminate the weight and reduce the space taken by my old bulky trimmer. Some folks might not think reduced weight and space are a benefit. But, frequent travelers will understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer for sideburns, I don&#x27;t know how well it will work elsewhere. But, it&#x27;s a lot easier to maneuver than other bulkier trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  Finally, its worth mentioning that I had been using the most recent Gillette razor and thought the blades were pretty good. But, the new blades they designed for this product are outstanding.</li>
    <li> I recieved these blades through promotion ran by gillette. These blades last for a good while before becoming dull. I have always hated shaving because of irration after shaving but love shaving now. Love how it uses the same items on the styler so you dont have so many things clogging up the counter space. This is a must have if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I received this razor cartridge to try free from a program sponsored by Gillette. I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of this razor blade. It&#x27;s sharp and seems to last longer than other razor blades, but the best part is the fine-toothed \\&quot;comb\\&quot; that helps guide my facial hair toward the blade, so there&#x27;s less pulling and I get a cleaner, closer shave. This is especially useful because I prefer to wait a few days between shaves so my hair growth is longer than someone who shaves every day. The longer hair is more likely to get pulled and twisted and torn when shaving, which can be painful but this blade almost completely reduces that.</li>
    <li> I was able to try these blades through a program that Gillette was running and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. As someone who shaves his head as well as his face, this blade WORKS! It gives a very close comfortable shave. I have used a lot of different blades in my life but this one definitely ranks at the top of my list.</li>
    <li> I am typically an electric razor user. I hate nicks and the feeling of razor burn... plus I am not a big fan of the mess of the shaving cream and the stubble a razor leaves in the sink. Usually, it is much easier to just run the electric razor over my face on the way out the door.&lt;br /&gt;Gillete gave me a free promo Fusion ProGlide with ProGlide blades to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me tell you about the blade itself. The clipper handle is an electric handle that vibrates when you draw the blade across your face. And the best part is that the blade is so great it just takes on pass over each area to provide a shave much smoother than my electric razor could ever do. Normally I need to make several passes; but not with the ProGlide blade. It actually took me less time to shave with Fusion ProGlide than my electric to get even better results than the electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Fusion ProGlide without the handle vibrating and the shave was everything I hate about blade razors. Turn the handle on and it is smoother than the electric and it only takes one pass instead of several. I had less irritation with the ProGlide than the electric. \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying the blade alone without the vibration was about as good as any other blade. It did not nick me at all, but it was a rougher experience and left a slight razor burn on my face. The blade itself is great, but if you want the most out of this blade, get the Fusion ProGlide handle or the Fusion ProGlide Styler. The electric handle is what makes this blade a great comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty specific shaving routine because of my sensitive skin, so when I received a free &#x27;Pro-glide&#x27; razor from Gillette to try I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powered (ultrasonic?) handle allowed me to shave slowly, and cleanly without having to go over the same area twice, which really helped me avoid any sensitive skin/razor burn afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself was closer than I&#x27;ve had in years (I used a mach 3 razor previously) and the time it took to shave was reduced dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the razor before work every day for three weeks now, and I still get an extremely close shave without any &#x27;ouch&#x27; moments. Even when I was rushed and had to do a quick job, I was pleased with the results, whereas I might have tore my neck to pieces using my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The couple of things I would like to know before I would buy this, personally are:&lt;br /&gt;1) How long to the razors last (they&#x27;re pretty expensive, just like normal refills)&lt;br /&gt;2) How long to the batteries last (I&#x27;m guessing months/year?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give the razor a 5 star rating because the size of the head caused me to shave off part of of my goatee, not the biggest deal but it is hard to sculpt as the head is much bigger than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a promotion run by Gillette and I must say that I do not shave often but when I do I need a close shave. I have always used Gillette razors and I am always happy with my shave--I get a close shave, no knicks or missed spots and it is a consistently close comfort shave. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> two weeks back i recived a free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette,from the first use it self i felt the difference,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its really a different experience,usually when using such type of razors very irritating for my face but this one is awesome</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gilette and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the performance.  I&#x27;ve been using it well over a month and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  The shave is extremely close and comfortable with no nicks or pulling.  I&#x27;ve been a Gilette customer for many years, so I&#x27;m not that surprised that this in a great product, but it even surpassed my expectations.  I tried the vibration feature, but it isn&#x27;t really necessary and doesn&#x27;t add to the shave, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean; it rinses easily.  Well done, Gilette.</li>
    <li> I was provided with a Gillette Fusion Styler for review.  Along with the Styler I came a pack of these remarkable Proglide Power Cartridges.  The shave from these little miracle blades was remarkable.  These blades gave me the smoothest shave that I have ever had from a non electric razor. This is also the only razor blade that did not give me razor burn after shaving.  Another great addition to the razor blade is the edger that is located at the top of the cartridge.  This saves me from pulling out a something different to edge in those hard to get places.  A lot of thought was put into this razor.  Another good job from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the blades from a program run by Gillette, and although it did a good job of getting rid of my facial hair, the product becomes dull quickly, which is a shame because of the price. You would hope it would be better, but I&#x27;ll give it an average grade. Nothing really special about this product.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this Gillette cartridge razor blade that I received free through a Gillette program.  I get a very smooth shave with these blades.  The first time I used it,  I had some razor burn but after that it has been a great cartridge and so far it is holding its sharpness which is a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> I held on to my moc 3 for years while all these new gillette razors came out, because my old one worked so well that i didn&#x27;t want to try a new one. After using it once I can say that I am ready for the upgrade. The shave is close and smooth, and the razor is easy to use. It causes little friction and no irritation. I didn&#x27;t think they could do better than moc 3, but they did. The razor was free and provided via a program run by Gillette,</li>
    <li> I found the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler to be a very handy and convenient product for men like myself. I used the product while traveling and periodically used it to touch up my facial hair. I like the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and very light weight. I like that you can change the combs and decide whether to have thick or close beard. It was a pleasure using although I found the edging blade did not provide the accuracy that I had anticipated. The product and all of its attachments including the stand, combs, and organizer are stylish and essential.</li>
    <li> Gillette is a great brand with great products and this one does not disappoint.  I got one of these blades for free by a program ran by Gillette and I was not disappointed.  I have very sensitive skin, it didn&#x27;t bother me one bit and it gave me a close shave.  I love Gillette products, they are awesome!</li>
    <li> Overall the blade was o.k. but with my sensitive skin and course beard it doesn&#x27;t work the best. After receiving this cartridge from a promotion Gillette out on I gave it a try. The cartridge is bulky and with its overall size I could not shave in all the angles my beard grows. This caused tugging and overall razor burn. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this razor for the course beard/sensitive skin types.</li>
    <li> I recently received the product through a program ran by Gillette. At first, they provided a very close and comfortable shave. After about a week and a half shaving 2 times a week, the shave was not nearly as close or comfortable. 3 out of 5</li>
    <li> I recieved the razor free from a program run by gillette. I was so happy i had the oppurtunity to try out his power razor. even though i tend to like 5 blades better, this razor was really comfortable. i have sensitive skin and it caused no irritation. I used shaving cream and the blades just seemed to glide. The best part is that there was no tug or pull, which made it a comfortable shave. the only thing is that i would want the razor to have a sooting or strip with aloe vera or something to make your skin feel it bestest.i Really enjoyed shaving with this razor, but the price for the cartridges is a little to high, i would also like them to last a bit longer before the blades give out. overall it is a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette and I LOVE the blades. I am able to get a great close shave and use them multiple times. Everytime I get a nice shave. I could not be happier with them.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m not generally a fan of these sorts of gimmicky razors with lubricating strips, multiple blades, etc. I tried these anyway, just because it came free with the trimmer and... it was ok for this type of razor. Nothing beats an old school safety razor as long as you learn how to use it. These razors are nothing special but if your skin isn&#x27;t terribly sensitive then I guess they&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for a few weeks after getting a free razor through a Gillette trial program. I find that these give a much cleaner shave than a typical mach 3, but that they last just as long as most other typical blades. I am a little worried that if I drop the razor that the cartridges might crack easier than the standard blades because the plastic part does seem a little less durable, but so far no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish that every new generation of blades wasn&#x27;t a new excuse to sell it for more money!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed these blades.&lt;br /&gt;I had not been able to shave for a week due to traveling to college and getting ready for classes- my beard was rather thick.&lt;br /&gt;These blades cut through the beard where I didn&#x27;t want beard, and I was able to style it with the precision blade on the back.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the blade seemed to wear out faster than I have experienced with other blades.</li>
    <li> the shave that this gave was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally shave in the shower in the mornings, and shave my head.  This has provided me with a clean smooth shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free via a program from Gillette, but I wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
    <li> The blades are awesome they do what they are supposed to honestly no complaints on that what so ever. As a matter of fact I have very sensitive skin and it did not irritate! free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> Before receiving this product from a program ran by Gillette I had used almost every different type of razor, including the disposable kind. I would sometimes get skin burns, rashes and irritation from the blades being a little too rough. My face has very sensitive skin and when using my new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I&#x27;ve never had that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right from the moment I put the razor on my face and started to shave, i felt the difference. The blades are perfect and made the glide that much easier. There was absolutely no tugging and my face felt very smooth and I barely felt the need to throw on an after shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it could be used in the shower and that it has an automatic shut off feature because I do travel often and i would hate for it to be in my suit case or bag and accidentally turn on and kill the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one negative and that is with the blade re-fills and there high cost. Coming from a man who has hair growing rapidly, i find myself shaving every 2 days and the blades tend to get dull quite fast. So having to buy a new 6 count cartridge for $28+ is crazy and rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, The grip on the razor feels just right and is quite easy to maneuver. Its very comfortable and works great on sensitive skin. I would highly recommend this product because it is simply the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used! :)</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor recently from Gillette and have never been happier with a razor before. The power option provides for better precision and allows me to shave faster, as it removes hair faster than a regular razor. The razor conforms to my face so I get a close shave without cutting myself and leaves no irritation. I wish the blade was a little large to cover more area at once, but otherwise I was very happy with the razor.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get to try this blade through a program run by Gillette and I gotta say that I was very I pressed.  I have a stack of razors at home of different brands and this one is faster and smoother than all of them IMO.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Joe</li>
    <li> I received this blade for free from Gillette and it works very well.  Normally, i get a cut on my neck area (I&#x27;ve got a heavy beard), but after a multiple uses, this still cuts like a dream.  I&#x27;m amazed how smooth it cuts on my face and mustache!</li>
    <li> I was able to try the razor through a free program from Gillette. The blades were sharp and gave a close shave without nicks, cuts, or tugs. Happy I was able to try it out for free.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades through a program by Gillette and was highly impressed.  Gillette has always been a favorite brand of mine and once again I was not let down.  I have sensitive skin and if I do not get the right razor my face can look like something out of a horror movie by the time I am done with my grooming.  The strip at the top of the razor helped to make my shave comfortable with very little irritation.  The feature that I liked best about these razors was the precision trimmer blade at the back of the razor for fine tuning my shave.  All in all these blades are great and I think that these blades have found a permanent home in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> So if you are anything like me you may be seeing these \\&quot;power\\&quot; razors at the store and think why do I need a power razor, when my standard razor works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided the Gilette Fusion Proglde Power via a program run by Gillette to give it a try.  Wow was I surprised !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has given me the best, closest shave. with not a single cut.  I never would have thought that this would have been the case, but even my wife commented on the smoothness of my face after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge itself has 5 blades.  Again another thing that I personally thought was overkill, but wow do the multiple blades help get a nice clean, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a product specific type person, at least until now.  From now on I will be only using the Gillette Fusion product.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Schick double blade on my face as my facial hair and very tough and rugged and a pain to shave.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the proglide was great. I did not cut myself and I had not shaved in over a week and the razor cut right down to my skin or a clean shave.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I must admit that I thought that the new razors are more of a marketing gimmick than anything else. However, after receiving a free razor, I figured I would try it out and I was very impressed with the results. The shave was significantly smoother and more pleasant than any razor I think I&#x27;ve ever tried. I didn&#x27;t notice that the microcomb did much of a difference, but the 5 blades left my skin incredibly smooth. The single precision trimmer was surprisingly also useful in getting my sideburns and other hard to get to areas. The vibrating power handle also impressed me because it reminded me of my shaver and made shaving a little more fun if nothing else. Overall, I would really recommend at least trying one of these!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free. The razor is great but I wish the cartridges were a little better priced. I do love the shave you get with this razor so I will for now purchase the cartridge but I don&#x27;t know in the future if I will spend that kind of money.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary ProGlide razor from Gillette and wanted to share my thoughts.  I used the razor for the first time this week and can honestly say it was a great clean and close shave.  Not sure if the vibrating handle helped with that or not but your not getting a closer shave than the 5 blades provided.  They really made a difference in both comfort and quality of shave.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> EVEN WHEN YOU JUST FIRST GLANCE AT THIS TRIMMER YOU NOTICE THE POWER BLADES. WHEN THICK FACIAL HAIR THE POWER BLADES COME IN HANDY RIGHT OFF. IT HAS MORE FORCE BEHIND IT THEN OTHER NAME BRAND POWER TRIMMERS</li>
    <li> This smooth shave goes along great with the trimmer. It offers smooth skin where ever I choose to shave. It is easy to clean and I was able to get close straight lines. I was never cut or got knick while using this I will continue to but this product since its the best I have tried. I got this free via a program offered by gillette</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free and when I used the razor for the first time and it was awesome. It cut through a week of growth (ie laziness) without an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to try it for free and I&#x27;m not sure I could spend the money to continue using the blades when these dull. Also using the the actual trimmer as the handle is weird. It felt huge, think using a child&#x27;s first crayon to write a letter compared to using a pen or pencil.</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor free as part of a program run by Gillette. before using this power razor i never thought power razors were for me or that they would work well for me. I was suprised when i first used it how using power would make such a difference. I get a cleaner, closer shave. using the power razor leaves my face smoother and with a closer cut then any other razor. I dont get razor burn anymore.  The razor has some down falls as well it seems that the blades get dull in a very short amount of time, and the replacement blades are extremely expensive. I do love the razor and would recommend it to others if they have the money to keep paying for blades other wise i might take the chance at getting a little razor burn now or then</li>
    <li> This is really a great product. I recieved it free from a program run by gillette. The trimmer gets hard to reach spots like under the nose and trims close enough how you want it. The razor blades are great for my sensitive skin but harsh hair, I did not get any razor burn and noticed my shave lasted longer than normal blades. I would recomend this to friends and family. The handle was also and I love the easy way to change an attatchment</li>
    <li> I got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor via a program from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a long time Schick Hydro 5 user, and before that a Mach 3 user.  So this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a ProGlide cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this provided a close, comfortable shave, which was on par with Schick Hydro 5.  But with Hydro 5, my skin feels better moisturized after I shave.  After 3 shaves with this ProGlide Power cartidge, my skin felt drier than usual after shaving.  I had to use an after-shave lotion which I normally wouldn&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed that ProGlide Power refills are about $4 each on Amazon, versus about $2.70 for Hydro 5. So because of the price and my skin feeling drier, I&#x27;ll be sticking with Schick Hydro 5.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades are easily the best out there in my opinion. I use Gillette&#x27;s sensitive shave gel with them and they make the perfect combination. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I am shaving when I use them. Simply the best.</li>
    <li> I received free razor via a program run by Gillette. I have been using proglide shaving blade and thought it is much better product than gillete mach3. But i was wrong. I was doubtfull about the purpose of vibration when shaving. But i am amazed when i used it. DO not get me wrong, proglide styler blade does it very good job but proglide power cartrige does the wonder. I have thown away everything else... Amazing product...</li>
    <li> This was an incredibly smooth shave.  It cut through 5 days worth of stubble easily and without pulling on the hair.  This will be my new razor from here on out</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free by a program run by Gillette to test and give my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say it was great. I have been disappointed by other all in one products (not by Gillette) so I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using, Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer,I was pleasantly surprised and very happy. My other system of shaving used to irritate my skin so badly and leave me with burn marks all up and down my neck and face. I love that it goes in the shower as well, makes shaving easier. The blades are so sharp and gets a great close shave. The only problem is the blades to replace them are so expensive, which makes it hard to buy but I really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided free to me via a program run by Gillette. This razor definitely gave a smooth close shave without any cuts. Makes shaving easier and faster and saves me a lot of time since I tend to grow hairy pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Being both a head and face (well, neck, I have a beard) shaver, I&#x27;ve tried every razor that&#x27;s been released since I started shaving, which seems about half a life ago.  Which it probably was, I am 31 now and, sadly; I don&#x27;t have that much more hair on my head that needs to be shaved off.  I first tried the Gillette Fusion razor way back when they were first released (prior to the ProGlide edition) and I wasn&#x27;t a big enough fan to stop using the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo razors which had long been my go to.  When I knew I was able to be part of a Gillette program to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for free, I figured there was no better time than to give them a chance again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get too deep into this, I need to point out that I am an infrequent shaver (of head and face) with sensitive skin (point B is why point A needs to be mentioned).  I shave both my head and face once every 5 to 7 days and have so for a few years now.  I use a razor cartridge (my Gillette Mach 3 Turbo) twice prior to using a new one.  That may seem excessive but given the coarse hair I have to shave off and the length at which I let it get to prior to removing it, blades dull out quickly on me and a dull razor makes sensitive skin worse.  Given my history with shaving, I have ventured off and tried various disposables and other brands and none have worked as well as the Mach 3 Turbo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade is much like I remember the original iteration to be.  5 blades that are very close together with a large moisture strip on top and a rubbery something or other that hugs the bottom of the razor.  On my first use, I was amazed.  It seemed quite a bit improved from the first time I used it way back when.  One stroke and it took off loads of hair.  It rinsed easily and overall my first head and face shave went really well.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I used it a second time.  This time, the razor didn&#x27;t seem to grab as much hair; it would almost stick on parts of my skin that weren&#x27;t really wet or had enough shave gel.  By the time I was done, the back of my head (the area that&#x27;s probably most sensitive for me) almost had a burning feel to it.  That went away quickly, but those kinds of things don&#x27;t happen with my standard razor.  My other big gripe about the razor is that it straight up hurts to go against the grain.  I am not sure if that&#x27;s just me or it&#x27;s not supposed to be used that way, but I don&#x27;t have an issue going against the grain with the M3 Turbo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t see myself switching to this razor but this entire review has to get the caveat that this does not work well for ME, personally.  I think it&#x27;s possible someone who shaves every day or so or has less sensitive skin might not have the issues I do.  For guys who don&#x27;t shave their head, I would also guess they won&#x27;t have my problems, either.  But if you are the kind of person who only shaves once and a while, shaves your head and face and you have sensitive skin, this might not be the razor for you.b as much hair; it would almost stick on parts of my skin that weren&#x27;t really wet or had enough shave gel.  By the time I was done, the back of my head (the area that&#x27;s probably most sensitive for me) almost had a burning feel to it.  That went away quickly, but those kinds of things don&#x27;t happen with my standard razor.  My other big gripe about the razor is that it straight up hurts to go against the grain.

But if you are the kind of person who only shaves once and a while, shaves your head and face and you have sensitive skin, this might not be the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power recently thanks to Gillette for providing me a free blade.  While shaving is generally a chore most of us don&#x27;t care to do but have to keep our appearance up, this razor made that job easier.  My previous razor had a good bit of pulling and tugging while dealing with longer beard hair.  The Fusion ProGlide seems to slide right through with much less effort and just about no tugging.  I thought the power part was a bit gimmicky at first but it does seem to stand things up better and also ease in sliding the razor across the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While one can trim up spots like sideburns with the normal part of any razor, the trimmer on the backside of the Fusion ProGlide is much easier to be precise with and leaves a much nicer line.  The rubberized-grip feels good in the hand and doesn&#x27;t slip even when your hands are covered in water and shaving cream.  Although it&#x27;s not something we typically think about with a shaving razor, it also has a nice weight to it that makes it feel better built and easier to control.  Cleanup is very easy with just a little water although it does have to be cleaned more often with longer hair. I didn&#x27;t experience any issues with it getting clogged up and having to use your finger or something to get the hair out as I have with others at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m sold and have made the switch.  The Fusion ProGlide cuts cleaner and closer without all the pulling and tugging of my old razor.  Smooth gliding, smooth face.</li>
    <li> I love these attached to my ProGlide Trimmer. They make shaving simple and quick since the attachment fits right on to the trimmer. The blades are good, the work well and do not cause irritation. Nice, smooth shave! I was able to try these free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this as a part of a program ran by Gillette and I&#x27;m glad I did. The shave is amazing, my wife loves the close clean shave.</li>
    <li> Received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor free via a program run by Gillette.  After a couple shaves with it my face felt as smmoth as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to review for BzzAgent.com.  I frequently try different razors to find one that works best, as I have a thick mustache.  I liked that this product was a razor and trimmer in one, and that it is waterproof.  Being able to trim and shave in the shower made my wife happy, so she doesn&#x27;t have to see the little pieces of hair in the bathroom sink.  The trimmer was my favorite part, but I really wish that there were more guard levels.  The guards that come with the Proglide are for short mustache or beard hairs.  My mustache hairs are longer, as I don&#x27;t like a close crop.  If I were to use the trimmer on my mustache, it would be way, too short.  It was great for trimming my eyebrows, though.  While the razor worked well and gave me a smooth and close shave, I didn&#x27;t like that it was so bulky.  It&#x27;s quite a handful.  I understand that to have multiple products in one, it is harder to make compact, but the handle is about as thick as a hairbrush.  It&#x27;s a bit much in my opinion.  Good product, but it has a little ways to go to be the perfect fit for me.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and when I was younger I thought that I would just have to deal with irritating razor burn if I wanted to keep a close shave.  Well a few years back I decided to spend the extra money and invested in a Gillette Fusion razor.  I was extremely satisfied with the shave I got from the razor, both in its closeness and also in the reduced irritation and I have continued to use Gillette Fusion razors since.  I still get some irritation when I shave two days in a row, although before it was near impossible for me to shave two days in a row without bleeding out, but if I shave after a couple days now I practically don&#x27;t need aftershave, practically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we get to the Gillette Fusion Proglide and Proglide Power cartridges.  I figured, \\&quot;How could my shave get any better?\\&quot; but Gillette had a program where I could try the Proglide Power cartridge for free so I figured, why not!  According to Gillette&#x27;s own comparison chart, Proglide and Proglide Power are virtually the same, except for an \\&quot;Innovative Micro comb.\\&quot;  I personally did not notice any difference.  When comparing the Proglide Power with the regular Fusion however I did notice a slightly smoother shave.  Whether this is from the \\&quot;Reengineered Blades\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Streamlined Comfort Guard\\&quot; or just the fact I spent more money on them so expected more, is debatable in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Gillette&#x27;s product description the Proglide Power blades are designed to last 5 weeks.  Because of my sensitive skin I usually only shave 2 to 3 times a week and I would say the blades dull noticeably after 5 shaves but continue to work well for about 10-12 shaves.  So if you only shave twice a week these blades will last you 5 weeks.  Compared to the regular fusion I would say these blades last maybe a shave or 2 longer, but it&#x27;s really a toss up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I highly recommend Gillette Fusion razors in general for a close and comfortable shave.  When switching between the regular Fusion and the Fusion Proglide Power however I do not think the cartridges are worth the additional cost.  If you have extremely sensitive skin it may be worth a try, but if you are getting the shave you want from the Gillette Fusion, you will probably not notice an improvement either.ar Fusion and the Fusion Proglide Power however I do not think the cartridges are worth the additional cost.

    <li> With the advent of the 5 blade shaving system I have been move back and forth between new blades from various companies trying to find the perfect fit and the proglide cartridge maybe the next generation of close effortless shave. I got a sample razor from gillette to try and boy did I feel like I hit the jackpot. The 5 blade system is quite sharp and allows for effortless shave even when I let my facial hair over grow. Normally I would run into problems with the hairs getting caught in the cartridge after a few shaves but after a week this is shaving effortlessly like a hot knife through butter. The addition of the microcomb helps to ensure that the hairs stay on track and funnel it towards the blade. I would never think of getting a razor without the lubrastrip that allows for easy shaving and also prevents nicks. Overall I am extremely happy to use this product, it takes away the pain and discomfort of hairs getting caught in the blade and gives you a good clean shaven feeling once your done!</li>
    <li> I was provided a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade as part of a package that also gave me a ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer to give my feedback. The blades can be used with the Styler Power Trimmer or with your Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor. I previously used the razor cartridges on my ProGlide razor and found the blades to be great, but when I used the blades on the trimmer it took my shave to a whole new level! I have sensitive skin and sometimes get bumps from a really close shave, but while using the blades on the power trimmer the bumps have been nonexistent. I strongly recommend these blades as they provide an excellent, bump free, close shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using razors for 25 years now, and I&#x27;ve tried a pretty good range of razors, from fancy razors down to the cheapo $1 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past 6 years I&#x27;ve been using  mainly the Gillette Custom Plus razor, and have been satisfied with it. It&#x27;s the no frills razor that my wife uses, and I have been going along for the ride. She buys the large 52 pack, making each razor about $0.65 - $0.75 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used those razors until the blue lubrication strip falls off, which turns out to be a few weeks. This was all about economy, and very little about the quality of the shave. Still, I was satisfied just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to learn about a Gillette program to evaluate their new razor. They sent me the Fusion ProGlide Power for a free evaluation, and was predictably skeptical. I really believed that there wouldn&#x27;t be any significant difference in the shave quality or the experience. All razors are more or less the same, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent me the Fusion ProGlide Power, and I popped in the included battery. At first I was a little hesitant about my razor actually vibrating on my face. I mean, I usually use gentle straight strokes, and don&#x27;t wiggle the blade or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in the shower (I don&#x27;t use a mirror, I feel around for the stubble. That&#x27;s just my style.) and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to laugh when I took the first stroke. It is SOO much better than the razors I had become accustomed to using. It&#x27;s immediately smooth, solid in the hand, and effective. I could actually feel that my face felt different. I was totally stunned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought the 5 thin blades were mostly marketing at work, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious now that Gillette has really tried to make the most effective tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed right away was that nothing was rattling or shaking around. There are no loose parts, it&#x27;s just a very solid feeling in the hand, like you&#x27;re using a very well crafted tool. I think this has to do with the wide flat design of the cartridge blade. It seems that if it were thin, like my usual razors, it would jiggle around more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is truly excellent, so why haven&#x27;t I been using a razor like this for the last ten years? Mainly the perception that it&#x27;s expensive. This razor isn&#x27;t particularly expensive, but the cartridges are, at least comparatively. Each cartridge is about five times the price of my usual economy blades. I&#x27;m not entirely sure how long they last, but even if they lasted twice as long, they would still be almost three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reality is that the cost is minimal. It&#x27;s probably less than $2 a week for an awesome shaving experience. (a $4 cartridge that lasts 2-3 weeks) I pay more for chewing gum, and don&#x27;t enjoy it half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you out.using a very well crafted tool.

    <li> I wanted to test how this new Gillette Power razor performs in comparison to other Gillette razors I have been using from years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor twice after receiving the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last two experiences have been so good that I can go ahead and say that this is by far the best Gillette Power Razor ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last two shaves have been the most comfortable shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.Shaving with this razor is an absolute comfort.It gave me the closest,smoothest and nicest shave.My skin became so smooth that I started feeling the smoothness again and again, by rubbing my hands across the face.&lt;br /&gt;Well one important thing to note here is that my face stayed smooth all day and even the next day...giving the impression that, I had shaved just a few minutes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the battery yet..but I believe that should be nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a comfortable smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is definitely a WINNER!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades were provided through a program run by Gillette. Great attachment for the ProGlide Styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am normally an electric razor kind of guy, however, I must say I am happy to use this particular razor for the full shave. The blades make a clean cut the first time, rather than having to go over the same area repeatedly. After several shaves the razor is still cutting fairly well with only slight symptoms of dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer blade is pretty standard, meaning it&#x27;s mildly useful and you should just go to your trusty trimmer. I used it to clean up the side burns and my chin only to repeat the process again before using my trimmer. It&#x27;s not a bad precision trimmer, but just a standard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the lubrication strip to be quite a nice feature. It seemed to soothe my skin after the shave and also add a bit of smoothness to the shave as well as my face. I would rather shave without the shaving cream and just use the razor along with water. So this strip was an added bonus worth having to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend purchasing the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler with Fusion ProGlide Power blades.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the shave you receive with these blades.  Great shave leaving your skin soothed and smooth!</li>
    <li> The razor heads were really easy to switch out. When I shaved with this, the shave was so smooth I didn&#x27;t notice I was shaving until I looked at my face. A real close, really smooth shave. As good as a professional.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette I was able to receive a free power razor. Once I received the razor I noticed it was quite larger than most razors and is battery powered. I quickly used the razor after opening the product and was very impressed with how smooth and sharp the blades were and how soft it left my skin. I was impressed that I was able to use this product in the shower and that the blades were still sharp after 5 uses on my very coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> I love the shave I get from most of the Gillette razors. No other razors come close to the shave I get from Gillette&#x27;s products. I recommend them to anyone who asks. I wish they were on sale more often though.</li>
    <li> Totally not worth the price tag (mine was provided for free by a program run by Gillette). Years ago, I had given up on using manual razors because the price tag for blades was getting hefty. Recently I decided to give them a try again and signed up for Dollar Shave Club. &#x27;The 4x&#x27; blade they have, at least for me, provided a smoother shaving experience and a closer shave. The price for those ($6/4 blades [$1.50/piece]) is significantly less than these and provides a better experience. I&#x27;d highly recommend against these blades.</li>
    <li> I recently tried out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Trimmer, which was provided at no cost by a sampling program, sponsored by Gillette. Let&#x27;s start by saying that for around $20 you are getting a quality trimmer, that serves multiple purposes. The shaver left my face smooth, and the trimmer allowed me to shape my goatee with ease.It is also great for trimming any unwanted body hair.</li>
    <li> I received my Proglide Power Blade from Gillette for free to try, and the first time I tried it it was the best shave I have had in years. I have flip flopped between electric razors and blade razors over the years and have never found the perfect razor. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the closest to perfect I&#x27;ve found, with very close shaves and no irritation. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the vibration of the power blade or what, but I can tell you my wife is very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge was heavenly.  It didn&#x27;t even feel like there were multiple blades in it. It just glided across my face so smoothly without any nicks or cuts.  I tried it with five days of growth and with one day of growth and both times it worked like a charm.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this blade for review through a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I got to check out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power blades through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got really sensitive skin so seeing the moisture strip I was a little worried.  Several strips on razors I&#x27;ve used before have irritated or kind of burned my skin, but I went ahead with my shave.  During the shave I didn&#x27;t notice any problems, it was a great smooth shave and the razor treated my stubble well.  I shave every morning and often in the afternoon also, so I never have too long of stubble, but this was a great shave.  Afterward my skin felt nice.  All through the day I noticed it still felt great, no problems with irritation or burning and my face felt almost moisturized.  Which where I live in the mountains of Colorado is a GREAT thing cuz it&#x27;s so dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will have the wife get me these in the future and will recommend to my guy friends.</li>
    <li> I did not like the power blades. I usually use the Fusion ProGlide, but the power is not for me. The blades caught me hairs and it was uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I have just tried the Gillette Proglide razor from a promotion offered by Gillette.I was very pleased and impressed with this razor. I used it after one day beard growth and then waited 2 days to see how it would work. Both times were identical. Not only was there a clean smooth surface after one sweep across my face , but there was no skin irritation nor discomfort even with the 2 days growth. The handle has ridges that made my grip easy and to control.I have used both electric as well as other Gillette razors and this was superior in comfort. I have been unhappy with previous blades trimming my sideburns. However this razor produced a sharp edged result. This is a big step up, in  my opinion, compared to previous razor blades, and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades free from Gillette as part of a product program. After using the trimmer with the included blades several times I have come to the conclusion that this product is Awesome. The trimmer comes with an attached blade that has three different add-on hair trimmers that allow you to trim your hair to different lengths. It also has an add-on regular shave blade so that I can shave my face and trim my mustache or beard any time I want. Great product. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a new razor.</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power bladesfrom a campaign ran by Gillette for free!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have not found a blade that gives a closer shave and leaves my face smooth.. without causing razor burn or irritation. easy to clean and the Blades glide along the lines of my face easily and also get the hard areas to shave around the neck where other blades seem to leave hair.. The Blades i give 5stars but the price just seems high to me.. but you really can beat the great shave you get..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to my friends and Family..</li>
    <li> I received these cartridges through a program run by Gillette and after trying them a few times I have to say that I am pretty satisfied with them. I have sensitive skin so when I try a new blade it either works or it doesn&#x27;t for me. These blades work! Some blades leave my face with a rash because of quick dulling or inferior blades to start with. My first impression was that these blades are extremely sharp right out of the box. And the little blade on the back for trimming straight lines actually works surprisingly well. I always assumed that these little things were gimmicky and would never actually work. Someone put the time in to making this blade one that works and one that I will be using for a long time. The ease of popping them on and off with the push of a button is a quick feature also. Another great feature is the free movement of the blade cartridge itself. It pivots on the end of your razor handle to match the contour of your face when you shave. With a stiff cartridge it was harder to get a consistent shave. Overall I am really satisfied with the Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridge and don&#x27;t really have any Cons to mention. I see a lot of complaints about the price but I don&#x27;t think they are too expensive and it all goes back to \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. I will be using these for a long time. I always shave after a hot shower so the hair is &#x27;softer&#x27; and definitely use a good shave gel or shave cream to help condition.</li>
    <li> These blades are amazing and I was extremely lucky to be chosen by gillette to receive one as a free trial. I do not think that I can use any other razor from now on. The closeness you get cannot be matched by any other razor on the market. I have tried most other brands and this blade is in a league of its own. I never realized that you could get a shave so close without going to the barber however with this blade you absolutely can. I would recommend these to everyone and any one that needs a razor.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about these razors but I decided to give them a try. I was completely impressed. This razor \\&quot;glided like a professional skater!\\&quot; And gave me an incredibly close shave. Anyone who says anything negative about these blades is bitter or an armature shaver. The blades are SHARP that&#x27;s why they cut so well and so closely. I have a large face and lots of facial hair and I didn&#x27;t cut myself once. These blades are definitely the best on the market.</li>
    <li> review of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades - these blades are a great product. They work very well for my face and cut a close shave.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try and why not give it a shot.  I find no real significance in using the power version versus the non power version.</li>
    <li> The blade provides a very smooth shave, and no nicks or cuts. I definitely recommend you give it a try and see for yourself how smooth it really is. I tried it out as I received a free razor from a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I first tried the Fusion ProGlide Power without the battery installed and was very happy with the closeness of my shave, I waited two days before shaving again only this time I installed the battery and turned on the vibration, I must admit I was not expecting much of a difference but I was wrong. I found that for the first time I was able to shave only once that morning and my shave was smoother and closer than I had been getting with two shaves with my old razor. I am pleasantly hooked on the Fusion ProGlide Power.</li>
    <li> After years of using disposable razors and trying so many kinds of blades I was begininng to give up on shaving and growing out a beard.  I then got an invite to a program that is run by Gillette where they send you a free razor.  I said, \\&quot;if its free, its for me!\\&quot;  I was little skeptical using an electric razor but I figured I might as well try it and I was not disappointed.  This was the closest shave I have ever gotten!! The blades were sharp and the power behind it made the difference.  I will never go back to manual blades ever again.</li>
    <li> I received these blades free from a program run by Gillette.  Overall, they are a very good blade.  They get a very close shave without much irriation.  I didn&#x27;t have to make a ton of passes thanks to the multiple blades which is nice and helps with irritation and breakouts afterwards.  The only down side i saw is that it seemed to get dull quickly.  I&#x27;m not for sure if I was doing something wrong but I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable using these more than a few times.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the blades shaving capability. I was able to perfect my side burns and reach certain areas on my face (my upper lip and the crease of my neck) with ease. All it took was a single pass over the areas I wanted to completely shave to achieve the results I wanted. Unlike many other blades I have tried, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and left my face feeling smooth and looking cleanly shaved. I&#x27;m happy to say I have officially found a new razor that has all of the capabilities I am looking for. Thank you Gillette for opening me up to a new experience.</li>
    <li> I received the Proglide Power Blade for free from a program ran by Gillette.  I have been a user of the Schick Quattro Blades for a few years now and decided to try the Proglide Power Blade and I was blown away.  I have very thick whiskers to the point that it looks like I have a 5 hour shadow about 5 minutes after I shave.  WIth the Proglide Power Blades, you face is baby smooth to the point that I don&#x27;t look like I need another shave right away.  What is great about the blades is you can actually feel the \\&quot;pull\\&quot; on the hair as they get shaved off, which I think is because the blade lifts the hair up before cutting.  I highly recommend and I will not be going back to the quattro!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge for free through a program run by Gillette. I had my doubts on how  well these cartridges would work compared to my electric shaver which I absolutely love and have used exclusively for the past couple of years. The cartridge provided a close, clean shave with very minimal effort. I didn&#x27;t feel the blades tugging at my facial hair and I had no nicks from the blades. Each stroke was effortless and grabbed all of the hair in one swipe.&lt;br /&gt;Would absolutely recommend this shaver to anyone, and if you&#x27;re on the fence or have other methods of shaving, give it a try, you&#x27;re going to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades free through a program run by Gillette I found myself not liking the power blades as much.  I have used other razors from Gillette before and have gotten closer shaves easier than when using the power blades.  I found myself having to go over the same place many more times, than I usually would have had to with a different razor.  This led to me getting a small case of razor burn on my neck for the first time.  It was not a very pleasant experience the next day and I would hate to see what it could do to other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think the problem may be in the fact that the power blades come as an attachment to the trimmer.  When shaving, it is nice to have a smaller, lighter handle.  The trimmer is just a little too bulky and heavy to use while shaving.  This also makes it harder to get certain spots by the neck and jawbone.  It is nice to keep the options open with the trimmer and power blades but I would probably just stick with another razor than choose to mess with the attachment again.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a program through Gillette.  I probably would not have tried this razor otherwise; my current razor was perfectly fine and I never had a reason to try another razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, I was a little skeptical about the claims on how great the blades were.  Quite frankly, the head looked a bit big and clunky.  However, the razor works great.  The razor really glides over the skin without any tugging, even when going against the grain.  Even having somewhat sensitive skin, this razor gives a real close shave without any skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I usually use a electric shaver but was provided this razor free via a program run by Gillette. I was pleasantly surprise at the closeness of the shave and the power cartridge aka the blades! They did great and I had no issues even though i typically don&#x27;t use non-electric razors. It is definitely a close shave!</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome. I usually get gillette blades and love them, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised but this razor provides a great clean, smooth, comfortable shave. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it was easy to clean the hair out of the blades. The name \\&quot;power\\&quot; blades is totally accurate. The best part was that I got it for free via a program run by Gillette- but I will totally buy this again in the future, DEF worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest shave I have had in years.&lt;br /&gt;The blade does not cut and pull like other brands&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and is a must buy</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades free via a program that was being run by Gillette.  This is an amazing product.  These razors are capable of getting so close.  Because of the multiple blades it helps to prevent skin irritation which can be a huge problem.  I will definately purchase these blades going forward.</li>
    <li> Very much recommend these blades...I feel less drag when cutting the hairs with little to no irritation on my sensitive skin. Long lasting blades that cut incredibly close! I usually shave every two or three days and can&#x27;t remember the last time I changed them. My first razors were provided on a program by Gillette, however I would have no hesitation purchasing myself when these blades need changing.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridges are the best blade I have used to date. The number of blades that make up the razor and the moisturizing strip combine to leave my face refreshed and bump free. For a clean and smooth shave I highly recommend these cartridges. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades will clearly become a part of my morning routine moving forward. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette with much appreciation.</li>
    <li> Using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler I got free via a program with Gillette, I got a very clean and close shave while defining my sideburns with precision. The blade had no tug and pull like other blades I&#x27;ve used in the past and I experienced no razor burn. I love using this product in the shower and its ergonomic handle on the power trimmer makes it easy to grip and not drop while wet. The blade lasted a little over a month before I needed to replace it with another cartridge. I would definitely recommend this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge if you&#x27;re looking for a non expensive blade system that truly works.</li>
    <li> I got my Proglide power cartridges in a promotion that Gillette is running. I had no idea these razors would give me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. On top of that the not one cut at all! There is one downside though, the blades start to get dull pretty quickly. If that doesn&#x27;t bother you I would highly recommend these cartridges, they are amazing!</li>
    <li> I received these blades for free provided by a program run by Gillette. The 5 blade action is great combined with the lotion/aloe strip on top but be careful of the single blade on top they claim is for precision trimming. This blade cut my nose twice lol maybe I do it wrong but when i shave the top part of the mustache near the nose, I seem to always knick my nose with this blade. I am not a fan of these blades for this reason.</li>
    <li> I received this product free from Gillette through a program they were running. It&#x27;s a great razor. It gives me a nice, close, and ultra smooth shave every time. I get no razor burn at all ( I had this problems a lot before ). It has a really good lubricating strip that is still working after a weeks of use. There is absolutely no pulling or discomfort during use. Overall a great razor cartridge.</li>
    <li> The handle offered a comfortable grip which makes it easy to hold therefore making shaving so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration is a great step from my old Fusion Power. It creates a very smooth shave which is so nice for sensitive skin and so much less irritating. The precision blade works great around the edges. This razor works well in the shower and is not  affected by the water. I have nothing bad to say about this razor.&lt;br /&gt;A definite recommendation.</li>
    <li> I received a blade for free as a part of a Gillette program and was really excited to try it.  I already use the normal fusion blades (and like them a lot) and was curious to see if it could get better.  Well, it can and this IS better.  That said, it isn&#x27;t something that I need.  Blades are already fairly expensive and while these are better, they aren&#x27;t life changing.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for free via a program run by Gillette.  I have pretty much always used multi-blade razors on my face. I tried electric razors and trimmers before, but I hate not getting a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this Fusion Power thing a couple years ago, and didn&#x27;t understand why they put a vibrator inside of a multi-blade razor. After trying the thing, I see that it help reduce irritation well. It also makes it easier to shave if my facial hair has gotten a bit long (normal razors tend to tug at my face). I have very sensitive skin, which is why I&#x27;ve had trouble with other electric razors.  This is unlike a normal electric razor in that it just vibrates the type of blade my face is normally used to, as opposed to circulating or aggitating blades like on most electric razors.  Th indicator strip is nice, so that I know when the blades need to be changed.  The price is right for the device. The replacement blades are a bit expensive, but not any more than other multi-blade razors. All in all, I am very happy with this razor.  I am going to continue to use this product on my face.</li>
    <li> I received a ProGlide from Gillette as part of a promotional program, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks.  After several shaves of the face and a couple of shaves of the head, I&#x27;m impressed by the effectiveness of the powered razor/cartridge combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive face-skin, but my job requires me to shave (boooo).  Generally, I use some after-shave lotion to prevent irritation, but with the ProGlide (and my normal Every Man Jack shave lotion), there was little enough irritation for me to forgo the post-shave treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also pleasantly surprised at the lack of clogs and irritation when shaving my head.  Rinsing the stubble was easy and quick, and there was no sting when I greased up my melon afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no use for the single trim-blade, as I don&#x27;t have sideburns.  In fact, if I have one complaint about the cartridge, it&#x27;s catching my fingernails on this back-side blade when I shave my head.  If the cartridge was offered without the trim blade, I&#x27;d prefer that, but it&#x27;s not worth taking away a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I find these cartridges overpriced, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll go on to purchase them.  It&#x27;s a premium price for a premium product, though, and I don&#x27;t think buyers will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Received this product from a free promotion from Gillette. Overall a good product, a little pricey compared to some. Blades hold up well even after a few weeks of shaving. I&#x27;d rate it more stars, but there are other options out there for less cost.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge for the past week, and I am loving every second of it. The blades do actually glide across my skin and I do not even feel as if I am shaving. It is literally the best shave I have ever experienced and I am approaching being a senior citizen. No nicks, no cuts, no scrapes. I actually look forward to shaving again. The Fusion ProGlide Power razor was provided to me via a special program through Gillette. And the whole shaving process seems quicker than my previous shaves. Wow! This is a great gift for man or woman. The razor was free and provided via a program run by Gillette. I am totally pleased with both the razor and the cartridge. THANK YOU FOR DEVELOPING IT.</li>
    <li> I just used my free razor that I received from a promotion by Gillette. The Fusion ProGlide Power razor provided a nice smooth clean shave. The blades clean out better than my regular Fusion.</li>
    <li> I have been using Proglide for many yrs &amp; I really love how clean my face looks &amp; I usually don&#x27;t have to shave for 2 days before I need to shave again. It&#x27;s that good I haven&#x27;t switched, since I know nothing comes close to what these razors do to my face &amp; I never get nicked or cut. These are the best on the market hands down.</li>
    <li> I have recently tried the Gillette Powerglide razor. I find it to be a superior razor compared to other razors that I have used.</li>
    <li> I git this as a free promotion deal through Gillette. It&#x27;s the best!! I love it, I have had many to choose from and this is now my favorite! My wife even loves it! They keep getting better every time! I can&#x27;t wait to see what comes out next because I&#x27;m buying it! I&#x27;m also went out and bought about 5 for stalking stuffers!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette Fusion for awhile and they work really well. I shave both my face and my head with one blade. That gets pretty expensive since they cost so much. I keep using them because other cheaper blades hurt my face.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a recent program ran by Gillette I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler for free. I do have to say that I really love the styler overall, but I am still not to sure about using the power blades on the styler. It does give a nice close smooth shave however when you are used to using a thin handle razor to shave with using the styler seems to be a bit bulky. It shaves nice and quick, but would take some time to get used to.</li>
    <li> I received this gillette fusion pro glide power razor free from Gillette to try out. I usually use schick.  I must say I like this razor it gave me a really close shave without having to keep going over it and barely any razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I was given this razor to try by Gillette and although it does have a very close shave, it was harder for me to use seeing that I have a smaller face. I found it difficult maneuvering in the tight spots on my face. Even though it shaves very well, I am forced to use another brand based on size.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor from Gillette via a demo program run by Gillette.  The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star rating is the high cost of the product.  However, I am somewhat willing to pay more for an excellent product, which this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all of the premium disposable razors over the years, like the Mach 3, the Quattro, etc., and the Fusion gives me the best shave.  In addition, the cartridges have a longer life than the competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving with the Fusion blades, my face feels super smooth, and I rarely cut myself while shaving.  Overall, the Fusion blades make daily shaving as easy and painless as possible.</li>
    <li> I am a hairy guy. The phrase five o&#x27;clock shadow was invented for me. This means I must shave twice a day depending on what I am doing. The problem is most razors give razor burn or just do not get deep enough to keep my face looking fresh long enough.  I was sceptical about how good this razor was until I recieved it free from a program sponsered by Gilette. Gilette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor gets the job done. The extra blades give me a deep shave that is smooth lasts. Despite the sharp blades I did not cut myself once. Anyone looking for the perfect shave should be using the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor.</li>
    <li> I recieved these cartridges as part of a program run by Gillette and could not be more happier.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very sensitive skin and always try many different name brands in razors in hopes of finding one that will not cut me and irritate my skin. Well search is over, there cartridges are wonderful the closeness of the shave and just the softness of your face after you finish shaving is just unequaled. The only thing that Gillette can improve on in the future is with the lubricating strips which wear out too fast which is the only reason I gave it four stars other than that it is a great product equal to none!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used. I would definitely buy this razor when I need a replacement. I highly recommend this razor to anyone that wants a close shave..</li>
    <li> I love the absoultly amazingly close shave I recieve from this razor. I never get nicked or cut with it like I did in the past. I recieved this razor free from a program that gillette was running and definetly plan to use it in the future!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what a powered razor in this form would do.  but I shaved with a regualr razor week before trying this one.  shave was ok with usual feel.  Tried this one and there was a closer shave without any of the pulling and tugging on longer whiskers.  really liked how this worked and it will be tough to back to a regular blade.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial razor to test via a program run by Gilette.  Overall I like the blade as it provides a smooth shave while also saving time.  The five blades seem to be able to cover more surface while not clogging like my old razor.  I tried it with and without the power being on, and did not notice much of a difference but I do like this version because it has a nice balance and feel.  I would recommend this blade and will buy again.</li>
    <li> The one thing I liked the most about this cartridge was the shape. I was able to get to most of the places that are normally hard to get. i.e. under the nose, under the lip, in the crease of the chin, and on the neck. It also provided a close shave, and didn&#x27;t feel like the hair was getting ripped out like many razors do.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program ran by Gillette.  I used the razor once a day for over a week and loved it.  The razor left my face feeling smooth and clean.  Even after a full day my face did not have any whiskers.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades provided a nice close shave. It left no skin irritation. I looked good after I was done shaving, no nicks or cuts. This is what I would want from any razor. It gets the job done. I really liked it. This was a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I got a package of these Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades in a promotional giveaway from Gillette.  It was a nice freebie, but I have been buying and using these blades for awhile.  I am not a daily shaver, so when I shave I have a decent amount of stubble to work through.  These blades do great and leave me with a nice smooth shave each time.  I also have found that I&#x27;ve had to replace these less frequently than others that I&#x27;ve bought.  Keep up the good work Gillette.</li>
    <li> This was a great razor to use. This free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. With the blades in combination of the strip makes for a close smooth shave. I definitely recommend this product. I have switched my current razor with this one.</li>
    <li> This was provided via a program run by Gillette.  I loved the the blades for a few shaves.  It didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving.  Cutting was smooth and close.  The only downfall I have is how quickly they dulled.  I have had lots of Gillette razors and they never seem to dull as quickly as this one did.  Over all I like the razors and the shave they give. A definite recommend purchase.</li>
    <li> Had the chance to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades for free thanks to a program by Gillette and I was thoroughly impressed. I liked the closeness of the shave and didn&#x27;t have any issues with nicks or cuts even after using the same blade fora about three weeks with out changing. I like how they have a little blade on the back for straightening out side burns as well, this makes it easier to keep the edges neat with clean crisp lines. Overall I found this to be a great product.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide power cartridge as part of a program run by Gillette.  I love the power cartridge it has a wonderful shave that is so close.  My daughter used to tell me &amp;#34;daddy scratchy&amp;#34; every day but she doesn&#x27;t tell me that for days now.  Here&#x27;s the problem, my wife has discovered how well these razor blades work and now she&#x27;s stealing my razor...luckily the blades are lasting for a long time.  Excellent quality razor blades....the only downfall I see is the cost. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Ok I have to say that when I received the Gillette fusion proglide power razor, via a program run by Gillette, I was skeptical at best.  For the past few years I have gotten tired of spending way too much for a razor that would perform just slightly better than that big pack of disposables and I have always thought the \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor was just a gimmick.  When I received the razor, it didn&#x27;t look much different than what I expected, however upon first use, I can say I love the Power razor feature. It really makes a difference on my sensitive skin.  The vibration helps the blade glide over my toughest shave spots.&lt;br /&gt;  Now for the razor blade itself, in the past I could only use a blade 3 or 4 times before I just had to get a new one, (which is another reason the big pack of disposables made the most sense).  So, far I have used this same blade for almost a month and while I can start to notice a bit of difference from the first shave, I am still impressed.  Normally after 5 uses I would have irritation and bumps on my neck, but none with using the proglide.&lt;br /&gt; Overall, great products that may have brought me back from the disposable world.&lt;br /&gt;One note of constructive criticism, why not give us a few refill blades with the razor?&lt;br /&gt;And why so expensive ??</li>
    <li> I was given a free razor to try from a program run by Gillette but i already use them in a regular basis and love them! they are the best razor blades out there and ive not been able to find any other razor that compares to these. A little bit on the pricey side but they are worth it. No razor bumps and my skin is the smoothest its ever been after shaving with these blades. Do yourself a favor and give them a try and you WONT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Overall - Meh.  One really cool thing that I liked was the single straight blade on the top that can be used for precise edging.  It&#x27;s a neat idea that works well.  Other than that, I really wasn&#x27;t impressed by the blade set.  I did receive one of these for free from a program run by Gillette.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Gillette when it comes to men&#x27;s shaving needs, but I started with the Gillette Fusion 3&#x27;s and still prefer those over any of these newer blades (except that top single edging blade...almost makes me want to buy the Proglide Power blades but I know I won&#x27;t). I like the older stuff and will be sticking with those until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge (the actual blades)through a free promotional program from Gillette. Otherwise I&#x27;m not sure that I would have purchased this product. When it arrived in the mail I was excited to try this new combo blade razor/electric razor. I have used both in the past and an now using blades. I loved my electric razor but the expense of replacing the broken screen shield every 6 months or so was ridiculous... So, I started using a blade, but I missed the close shave I was getting with my electric. With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I&#x27;m getting the best of both worlds! Its smooth, silky and soft, that is my face after using this razor. It&#x27;s almost scary how effective these blades are, I&#x27;ve actually cut my shaving time by at least 30%. No more going over the same spots multiply times just to get a closer shave. Love it!</li>
    <li> Shaves faster, closer and with no nicks or cuts. sometimes i shave dry and as long as I go smoothly it gets nice and close. in the shower it does even better. i&#x27;ll keep using for certain.</li>
    <li> I received these power blades through a program run by Gillette. I got these blades with the proglide styler so my experience was with that unit. I had never used a power blade before (just the manual razor) and I was a little hesitant with the buzzing blades. However, these blades exceeded my expectation and definitely give a superior close shave. The blade attachement that comes with the trimmer clips on easily and I presume it is about the same as a proglide power unit. The blades are very sharp and shaving is effortless. My only complaint with the trimmer is that shaving with it can be a little awkward to hold since I am typically used to a normal razor handle Definitely the best blades ever!</li>
    <li> I recieved these razors free from a program ran through Gillette.  The blades were very effective.  I could count on them for a quick trim.  They were even just as effective after not shaving for days.  I was highly impressed by the sharpness of the blades.  The blades even lasted longer for me than typical blades.  I have shaved over 5 times and the blades are just as sharp!</li>
    <li> i tried buying these in the store and paid double what amazons offers as a price; never again; i have them on auto-deliver every three months now</li>
    <li> The powered shaving blades, I like them and have used other brands before. Gillette&#x27;s version in  this product is comparable to others in shaving ease &amp; quality ...definitely not a stand-out, though.  But what I really DO LIKE about the Fusion Proglide blades, at least in the configuration offered in the 3-in-1 Styler anyway, is the weighting and feel of the shaver ...perfect for my hand ...easy to angle and manipulate w/o dropping.  I got the Fusion Proglied 3-in-1 Styler free from Gillette  through a program they were running, so my money is not on the line, but I&#x27;ll stick with their blades and the the shaver at next purchase.</li>
    <li> The free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades were provided via a program run by Gillette. Here are the stats: the vibrating feature made a closer shave, comfort strip is too wide making it hard to reach the hairs closest to the bottom of the nose, four blades make a smoother shave, wish there was a way to fully rinse out the hairs that are trapped in between the blades, love the rotating head for contouring the jaw and chin.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from a promotion run by Gillette. The first time you use these blades they are amazing. They give a nice close shave and don&#x27;t nick or pull any hairs. They left everything smooth and no razor burn. The only down fall is that the blades are so close together that they clog way to easy. The second time you use them the blades feel dullish and the strips fell off. For the price they should be able to hold up better.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t entirely sold on the whole power shave thing until I got these blades via a promotion from Gilette. My facial hair grows in kind of coarse, and I generally have a hard time getting everything, especially if I fall behind on shaving. These blades get in really close without tugging or pulling anything. I&#x27;m definitely sold on these blades for the long term.</li>
    <li> I almost do not like to shave because it is always a pain to see I&#x27;m getting all these bumps over the shaved area. But since I have to do it almost daily because of my job&#x27;s grooming code (except when I decide to grow a beard to allow the skin to rest, which is allowed as long it is neatly shaped), I was really surprised when using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge I received via a program run by Gillette did what it did: besides giving a precise shave in just a single movement, there were no more bumps on my skin. It is easy to use and does its job fast enough for me, really way better than any other blade I previously tried. This is so far my favorite from all Gillette family of products.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades are made for precision, which is what they gave me.&lt;br /&gt;The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.  Only after having experienced the product, this made my face look smooth and clear of facial hair very easily.&lt;br /&gt;What was good and what wasn&#x27;t so good about the blades is the precision and ruly price--nothing bad to say about these at all!!!</li>
    <li> After getting to try the Proglide Power for free from Gillette, I am sold. The light vibration makes shaving the difficult grain areas (like under the chin and on the neck) so much easier and I am having way fewer nicks. That it can be used in the shower is also a great bonus.</li>
    <li> I received these blades free from a program Gillette was running and I have to say these blades are amazing. It gives me the clean shave I want plus I don&#x27;t have stubble later on that day it keeps me fresh all day. My wife also loves that my face is nice and smooth. I recommend these to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> What is the razor without its blades? This excellent system is improved by these blades, and they are superior to other blades I have used.  I don&#x27;t get razor burn and I&#x27;m able to shave without cream.</li>
    <li> This pro-guide power razor/shaper has been awesome. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use and the grip is nice and comfortable. I only gave 4 stars though because the tray that holds it is not the greatest. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades through a program from Gillette. These razors were great, they have multiple blades that help me to get a very a close shave without the skin irritation that I&#x27;ve gotten from other razors. The blades glide smoothly over the hair and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull which is a plus. Leaves my face smooth and bump free, my new favorite blades!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Power cartridges are a step up with its microcomb. It straightens out my hair before slicing it off. I have a much cleaner and closer shave. Plus, you can use these cartridges interchangeably with the other Fusion Proglide line.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free promotion. At first I was apprehensive about this razor. In accordance I started using it with a very cautious stroke fearing I would cut myself. After a week of use I was more aggressive with it. No cuts no worries. It really does glide across the skin. An the trimmer is a nice built in accessory. Blades last about a month or longer. Love the solid feel.</li>
    <li> Ladies and Gents,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question you&#x27;re asking is does the Proglide work? and is it better than my current razor? The answer is a definite YES and then a maybe. First does it work? Yes and it works well. I was given this through a gillette program and have been using it for a few weeks (long enough for my skin to get used to it) and it does provide a nice clean shave. It&#x27;s smooth and easy to use without seeming to struggle through thick hair. The other question of is it better than the previous models is a different answer. Basically if you&#x27;ve used a proglide before you&#x27;ll barely notice a difference. It&#x27;s still the same old classic shave you expect with a few minor changes that the majority of shaver&#x27;s won&#x27;t even notice. So overall it&#x27;s worth grabbing if you&#x27;re out of razors but not good enough to run out and upgrade if you&#x27;ve still got some in the cabinet.</li>
    <li> For as rare as it is that I actually need a shave -- I&#x27;m much more in need of a trim to even out a patchy \\&quot;beard\\&quot; -- I got my first experience of a comfortable razor with the older Gillette Fusion Power. My lack of shaving wouldn&#x27;t stop me from testing the new model I received a free sample of the Fusion Proglide Power from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the lack of the squishy-soft guard (see the Flexible Comfort Guard, pictured in the chart above). I liked this feature, and it did it&#x27;s job. Too many times -- probably through inexperience -- I have nicked myself or got razor burn ... the Fusion Power with Comfort Guard served its purpose in preventing that. The lack of this substantial guard, replaced by the Streamlined Comfort Guard on the Fusion Proglide Power cartridge, worried me, and I can feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who doesn&#x27;t overdo it on the shave cream, I don&#x27;t need a device to \\&quot;channel excess shave prep\\&quot; from my face. I need something that&#x27;s more dummy proof and gives me a better chance of escaping my shave unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if anybody wants to explain to me why only four of the five blades have \\&quot;thinner, finer edges,\\&quot; it would be much appreciated. Is it that much more work to make all five blades of the same high quality? Is there anything left for the final blade to cut?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really try to stay away from the precision trimmer on the back; I&#x27;ll play my \\&quot;lack of shaving experience\\&quot; card again and openly say it&#x27;s a little frightening to me. I used it on my Fusion Power cartridge and I assume it produces the same or better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that gets me about these cartridges is the cost. Purchasing from Amazon for a premium product? OK. In a pinch and need to pick up more catridges at a store? It seems to me that someone who shaves often is going to get hammered on this. Great product, sure, but instead of boasting a lineup of razors, maybe make one really good one and bring down the price a notch, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I can&#x27;t speak from too much experience here -- I do a baby-smooth shave very rarely -- but this razor delivers ... it&#x27;s just missing a very key feature that was important to me as it compensated for my shaving inexperience. I&#x27;ll take the substantial comfort guard of my old cartridges over the streamlined comfort guard every time. And, fortunately, I have plenty of blades leftover that allow me to do that.otch, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I can&#x27;t speak from too much experience here -- I do a baby-smooth shave very rarely -- but this razor delivers ... it&#x27;s just missing a very key feature that was important to me as it compensated for my shaving inexperience. I&#x27;ll take the substantial comfort guard of my old cartridges over the streamlined comfort guard every time. And, fortunately, I have plenty of blades leftover that allow me to do that.</li>
    <li> I love my Proglide Styler.It works great, it&#x27;s easy and convenient and gives a great, smooth shave, BUT...the blades dull way too quickly for my liking. Considering the price, these blades should last more than a few shaves. They do a great job and I especially like that they are easily rinsed free of build-up, but after 3 or 4 shaves it takes more than one pass over the same area in order to get the close, smooth shave I desire. For the money,I would expect the blades to stay sharp enough for one-pass shaving for more than a few uses.</li>
    <li> I received these as a promotion from Gillette, and as a user of the regular fusion I was pretty excited. The power cartridges do provide an added comfort, especially when my stubble is a little longer, but it wasn&#x27;t that significant. Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in smoothness, only in comfort on longer hairs. I would probably save the extra couple bucks and stick with the regular fusion, but the power did make me stop to think about it.</li>
    <li> Overpriced but great shave. Cant afford to spend this kind of money on blades. Im going oldschool with the straight razors</li>
    <li> Love this blades.  I&#x27;ve been using them for15 or 20 years.</li>
    <li> I came back to Proglides after using Dollar Shave Club for a year. Night and day difference. I can get about 3 weeks of shaving from a single &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34;. With the Dorco&#x27;s I was luck to make it a week and the last couple of shaves really hurt.</li>
    <li> Nice having blades delivered to your home.</li>
    <li> I have very hard beard and had been looking for better options lately. Since Gillete Fusion products are still not available in India, i was using Mach 3 till now. I got this from internet shopping.&lt;br /&gt;I must say its a revolutionary improvement over the Mach 3 version.&lt;br /&gt;Saving used to be such a nightmare for me using Mach 3, and now i almost enjoys shaving using fusion proglide.&lt;br /&gt;One can feel the difference instantly.&lt;br /&gt;And if it has made my shaving easier, i believe it would make shaving experience pleasant for anyone :)</li>
    <li> i have tried so many different razors and i keep going back to gillet fusion bought a 130 dollar electric razor works like a dream but i still go back to gillette they give the best save for the price its worth it to my same for my dad and bro im 18 and shave once a week so my growth is pretty thick and it goes thou it like butter easy clean i shave in the shower and aa quick rinse under the shower head and its clean love the new blades they work even better dont upgrade your razor for the blade the blades fit all razors i have the old one and it fits like a glove but bought the new one just to see how it fills and love it. recommend 100%</li>
    <li> These offer a great shave with fewer strokes as advertised.  I have coarse hair and find the blades last me about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Product was undamaged inside, but the packaging and outside wrapper saved the day. Careful with shipping please! fast delivery time 3-4 days. Thx!</li>
    <li> These blades are very good and last me 3 weeks with a thick beard. My advice is simple. After using the blade wipe it off on a towel and then cover the blade with a few cotton balls held in place by a rubber band. Then put the shaver in your sink drawer. You can easily have 3 weeks of use with this method. The reason why people&#x27;s blades wear out in a week is because they dont dry off the blade and they leave it next to the sink. The moisture causes oxidation and dulling. The price sucks, thats why it gets 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The perfect shave. The best razors out there in the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion line since shortly after it was introduced, and owned two rotary electric razors. These latest ProGlide cartridges are excellent, but they do have a major downside: they don&#x27;t last as long as previous Fusion blades. However, they are sharper, causing less discomfort. Also just like the old Fusion blades, you have to be really absent minded to get a nick. I&#x27;d say on average I get about 4-10 shaves out of them before I become frustrated and throw them away. That compares to about 6-15 with the old blades. I think they&#x27;re worth it though, because they are simply the nicest, easiest, most comfortable way to shave. Far prefer them to fancy electric razors.</li>
    <li> Best Blades Out There!!!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite by far.</li>
    <li> Still expensive as hell but really good razor. 12 blades in each razor. - I kid, I kid. I see, nor feel, any difference between the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power and the Gillette M3 Power except the cartridges do not fit one another.</li>
    <li> Well... the package is always the same one, but the presentation of the product inside the package, is not always the same... And the product lifetime, isn&#x27;t too... but I think this one is ok, at least in the point of view of the quality.</li>
    <li> Bought my bro in law the powerglide razor and these refills as part of a Christmas gift 2013 and he likes them so much he asked for them again for Christmas 2014..so we did. He was happy.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest thing since sliced bread</li>
    <li> Simply the best. Pay to play.</li>
    <li> Convenient and good buy! A</li>
    <li> I recently purchased 1 package of these blades, Amazon.com was the seller (not a another company) and they were of poor quality, cheap, knockoff razors.  I separate my razor blades from the places I purchase them and continue to have bad experiences with the blades I purchase from Amazon.com whereas blades purchased at local retail stores always give me a better shave.</li>
    <li> These are not that inexpensive but they do work better than its price range. I&#x27;ve been using these in the last 4 yrs and they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> been looking for good price on these blades and this fit the bill , ty</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m telling you how much I love these new blades because my wife is sick of hearing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the original Fusion Power was a slight upgrade on the Mach 3, but the Fusion Proglide Power is miles ahead of both. The blades really do glide over my face quickly and comfortably, and the shave is so close that no stubble appears for hours later than with previous blades. I don&#x27;t like shaving, and I put it off when I can, but the Powerglide has made shaving so fast that I&#x27;m no longer trying to avoid it.</li>
    <li> Great razors for a great razor</li>
    <li> What can you say? These rock for tight shaves... be it your face or head. I use these and feel they are worth the price. I can get my head straight razor tight with them and the same for my face and neck. They do shave better and last longer than any other brand I have tried. They don&#x27;t knick-up any imperfection like the others do. If you shave your head... pair one of these with Secret Shave shaving oil.. you&#x27;ll be impressed with the results!</li>
    <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease so he needed a razor that would glide easily.  This has worked much better than the ones he has tried in the past.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best razors I have ever used. My only problem with them is that they are very expensive.</li>
    <li> Of course these razors are great but it&#x27;s just so damn expensive.  It&#x27;s like printer ink.  You get the razor for a reasonable price and then the blades are overpriced.  It reminds me of Microsoft office back in the day and how it was 500 bucks now you get all of office for 120.  We need competition here.  Maybe that dollar shave club will knock the prices down to the buck a razor they should be.</li>
    <li> Blades are not as good as advertised. Only the first few shaves were good, after 2-3 shaves, the blades become blunt. Very expensive choice, even with amazon prices each shave is not as cost effective. The first 2-3 shaves are good, smooth and nick less but as the blade gets older.</li>
    <li> I just started using this razor that uses these refills. I was skeptical about people making reviews about the blades going dull in weeks or a month. I have not found this to be true. I got more than 2 months out of the blade that came with the razor, and I only changed it because I thought it was time. Second refill,mover two months, still have not changed to the third refill. Maybe I just have a light beard, but sometimes I shave twice a day and still longer than two months. I use Barbasol shaving cream. You should not be throwing out these refills after a few weeks or a month</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion Power for quite some time now, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  Although I thought the five blades were a gimmick and put off trying it, I really do like it better than the previous Excel razors.  The \\&quot;precision\\&quot; blade on the top rear side is much more convenient than I would have expected, allowing me to get a good line on my side burns.  The blades last over a month for me, and I shave every other day on average (full beard growth, just sensitive skin).  When the Proglide Power razor went on sale for less than a new Fusion cartridge would cost me, I decided to give it a try.  Yeah, that was a no brainer.  :)  I liked the shave, and I decided to stick with it for another eight cartridges when this package went on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, these aren&#x27;t a big advance over the Fusion Power.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t seem much if any different to me.  The Fusion Power worked very well, and so does this.  These give a clean shave with minimal effort, even when I recently went five or six days without shaving over vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed when the bottom glide strip on my first Proglide cartridge came loose.  I have never had a problem with a Fusion Power cartridge.  The two Proglide cartridges since then have held up nicely, though, so I think/hope it was an anomaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I recommend giving these a try if you&#x27;re unhappy with your current razor.  I do think that the Fusion Power are just as good, and they can probably be found for less money because they are the previous model, so you might want to try those first.</li>
    <li> Do NOT purchase anything from Gusto ko &#x27;to!!  It took over five weeks to finally receive my order, only to discover that they were the WRONG blades.  As I am currently deployed in Iraq, returning them via APO is too inconvenient.  \\&quot;Caveat Emtor.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ll just wait until I return to the U.S. and purchase them in person, albeit sporting a full beard.</li>
    <li> I shave my disabled husband and do not worry about nicks or have to spend a long time shaving.  The powerglide makes the blade slide along easier to do its job.</li>
    <li> My husband is very impressed  with these blades  and does follow the suggestion to blow canned compressed air on them after he is finished shaving which extends the life of the blades.</li>
    <li> For mah skin without hair ;)</li>
    <li> Great buy.  These are the only razor blades that my husband will use.  He has sensitive skin and these give him a close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred \\&quot;powered\\&quot; blade razors, even when they were limited to the huge thing that The Sharper Image once carried.  The original Fusion Power was great, but the new Fusion Proglide Power is even better--smoother and requiring fewer re-swoops of the razor.  Also, I really like the little glowing blue light in the handle!</li>
    <li> Very good quality, better buy 8 cartridge or more than less, because price will go high.  Each cartridge lasts long, for me when I use it 3 times a week one cartridge works good for about 1,5 - 2 months.</li>
    <li> First up, my history. When I first started shaving, I used a disposable manual razor. Twice. After that, realizing shaving wasn&#x27;t something one could usually get out of by choice, I bought an electric razor, of the rotary type. When the Gillette Mach 3 was introduced, I got that to keep for a backup, or for a closer shave for important events, concerts, shows, etc. Eventually I upgraded my rotary razor to a Braun Pulsonic (expensive) razor. Soon after, I tried the Gillette Fusion Power, to see how it compared. Lets just say it compared just enough to be actually worth comparing. This again went into the cabinet as a special occasional razor. About three months ago, as the cartridge in my Braun Pulsonic was aging beyond it&#x27;s recommended life cycle and the shave was getting less close, and more painful, I decided to try the Gillette Proglides cartridges. I used them on my Gillette Fusion Power handle, since it&#x27;s basically the same as the Proglide handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here was my experience with not one but four separate cartridges:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to shave at roughly the same time every day, just to get a real good idea of how it performed in relation to my electric. I also shaved the day prior, with my electric.&lt;br /&gt;The very first shave was very smooth and close, with no tug and pull, just as advertised. I was surprised, but pleased. It did tend to nick up my face pretty bad, but the blades were sharp enough so it didn&#x27;t affect comfort. I shave well in advance of leaving home, so this wouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal. The second and subsequent shaves were dramatically different from the first one. All were painful, rough, uneven, and frankly not all that close. I was close to just heading back to the Pulsonic with two year (plus) old cartridge, but I decided to stick it out. As the strip of lubricant wore down significantly, the comfort of the shave improved. It wasn&#x27;t as close, but it was almost, if not as comfortable as the first. This lasted until the strip was nearly gone, and it was clearly time to replace.&lt;br /&gt;I decided at that point to return to my Pulsonic, and just buy the new cartridge, as it had served me well for two years on one cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks later, I had an interview, so I bought a three cartridge set of the Proglide cartridges. I decided that after I used the one for the interview, I would use the other two to do a slightly different test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the final two cartridges, I decided to wait varying periods of time between shaves, so the stubble would be a different length each time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the results were the same as the first time, with a few differences. Any shave of stubble that was between two days and five days old was much more comfortable and close than it would have been at the same point in the cartridge life cycle with shorter stubble. The longest stubble, which was about six days growth, resulted in a shave that was less close, but as comfortable as the other longer-stubble shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether my rate of stubble growth is typical or atypical, but I can grow a nice goatee in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think that Gillette is going in the right direction, but they need to strike a finer balance between shave quality, and longevity of blades in order to make these worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all the hype (which I tried to ignore, but who can, really?) I was expecting something different, and much improved. Frankly, even the few times when I turn to a manual razor, I would probably turn to the old Fusion, just because I didn&#x27;t have as many guessing games. It worked until it stopped, which was just before the color from the strip was gone. Even for someone who shaves primarily with a manual razor, unless they have money to blow, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my opinion is that this is a debatable improvement over the previous generation, and that it was so far over-hyped that it created false expectations. Had it notbeen hyped so much as a dramatic improvement, I might have given it four stars, but that type of advertising really irks me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This was my experience with the product, and since this sort of product depends a lot on individual faces, hair, shaving habits, etc., it&#x27;s not good to draw a conclusion based solely on a few other reviews. In addition, different people expect different things from a razor. I prefer a balance of longevity, comfort and closeness, while others prefer one over the others. My opinion is: if you&#x27;re an owner of a Fusion handle, you can always get a small pack of the Proglide cartridges and try them out. They may well work differently for you.been hyped so much as a dramatic improvement, I might have given it four stars, but that type of advertising really irks me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This was my experience with the product, and since this sort of product depends a lot on individual faces, hair, shaving habits, etc., it&#x27;s not good to draw a conclusion based solely on a few other reviews.

    <li> A dermatologist once told me that I have the double whammy: very heavy beard on very tender skin. He recommended I either shave with an electric razor (which he said I would need to do at least 3 times a day) or grow a beard. He wanted me to stop shaving with a razor because of how often I was cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to say that is not an issue with the Proglide blades. One thing I appreciate about them is that Gillette improved upon the lubricating strips -- they really do make a difference for me and make the shave smoother. I get a smooth shave and do not cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the Amazon subscription service. These blades are ridiculously expensive at the grocery store: I&#x27;ve seen them charge $18 for four blades! With the Amazon subscription service I get 8 blades for less than $25. Still pricey, but I can live with it.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome.  No blade comes closer.  The only&lt;br /&gt;downfall is the price.  They tend to be the highest priced blade.</li>
    <li> just purchased this razor for the first time very happy with it</li>
    <li> Always been a really great brand for shaving!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It actually glides on your skin, and if you use the pro series heat scrubbing, shaving cream, and cooling lotion you won&#x27;t have a problem shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have to say I can&#x27;t feel the difference between power and non powered razor.</li>
    <li> Same Gillett Razor Blades as i have bought at WalMart.</li>
    <li> Great razors, they leave your face baby smooth. Only razor I will use, period. I shave every day, even Sundays, I just like the clean shave look. My facial hair is of average thickness, maybe a little more course than average. Each blade lasts about 2 weeks. I could get longer but I like a fresh one as it can start pulling the hair if you let it go too long. When the proglide strip starts turning white and wearing down, you will know the blade is done. Great price too, even cheaper than Costco. Love it! Works great with any shaving cream, don&#x27;t need expensive stuff for this razor.</li>
    <li> This was a gift but from what I heard he&#x27;s glad that I found the razor&#x27;s he&#x27;s been needing for more than a year...</li>
    <li> This is the best razor hands down.  I can shave for 4-5 days before I have to change the razor itself.</li>
    <li> Over-priced and not as good as past versions of the same item.  It feels like they have made them less sturdy to bolster continued sales.  I like the format but the up and coming competitors now deserve a serious look.</li>
    <li> I will not use another blade again. Great results and less razor burn. Only complaint is that I wish the nourishing bar at the top would last longer.</li>
    <li> great blades great price</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, my wife has smooth skin and our son has facial hair that seems to grow in overnight. i started with the original fusion when it first came out. my wife liked how it made my face smooth and no nicks or cuts. well she needed a new razor and she went with the proglide. our son didnt like the razor he was using so he went with the power fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL OF US LOVE THE SHAVE. its close, again no nicks or cuts, and leaves skin nice and smooth..</li>
    <li> long lasting close shaves</li>
    <li> still using the first blade after 2 months</li>
    <li> There is no question about Gilette, and their need to provide a better way of men to shave their beards and mustaches, without them cutting their faces so closely, but at times they can definitely be a mixed blessing in disguise. That is proof of the pudding with their Gilette Fusion Proglide Power razor, and their refill cartridges. While the concept is right with the closeness of a shave, the big gripe about it is that the cartridges quickly get dull only after a few uses. That dullness gets very tiresome, even with the toughest of shaving creams and mixes to make it easier for your best shave. I really think Gilette needs to honestly find a better razor blade with their next brand of razor. This one isn&#x27;t bad, but loses out very quickly in the long shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convience: C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: C</li>
    <li> This razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Gillette continues to improve upon its already impressive product line.  This razor gets very close and I have not had a cut yet.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who has had problem with cuts and bruises from cheaper razors.  Great product!</li>
    <li> These are good blades but, they are too expensive. Last year I paid 21.66 in Jan. and 24.26 in April for a pack of 8. Now you&#x27;re looking at paying 31.99 through the subscribe and save program. That more then 10 bucks a pack from a year ago. I&#x27;m just going to to buy a Philips Norelco electric shaver. Not  from a Procter and Gamble company. This is why you&#x27;re losing customers and now have to layoff over 5,000 people. Good job Procter &amp; Gamble.</li>
    <li> Works well enough but they aren&#x27;t cheap, though that should come as no surprise.</li>
    <li> Great product, but no money to be saved by buying at Amazon over Wal-Mart (usually very, very close).  I now buy these only as I need them at Wal-Mart of when Costco has a special.</li>
    <li> I love these blades but they&#x27;re greatly overpriced everywhere. I shopped amazon and got them for a steal. Prompt delivery for a great price. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is all it proclaims to be. I try to get all my friends to switch to Gillette Proglide Power</li>
    <li> Glorious razor. I have super sensitive skin and am very susceptible to razor burn on my neck. It never failed. With this new fusion proglide blah blah blah, razor burn is minimal (i&#x27;m probably just shaving wrong) and it&#x27;s the smoothest shave ever. The commercials are real, believe it.</li>
    <li> The best blades I ever used.</li>
    <li> Been using Gillette shaving products ever since I was old enough to start shaving, and so far the fusion proglide power blades are the best I have used. After 4 weeks of daily use the lubricant strip is still on, and the blades still shave smoothly. Also I have noticed that the proglide blades give me a closer shave than the previous generations of blades as my 5 oclock shadow is visibly reduced. If you are a Mach3 or Fusion user, you should upgrade yourself to these. Highly recommended and worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gilette&#x27;s products a long time. The \\&quot;power\\&quot; may seem gimmicky to some people, but it makes a big difference on my face. I have very sensitive skin, and I have to shave against the grain. I can&#x27;t get a close enough shave with the grain. My skin doesn&#x27;t like to be shaved. My father grew a beard - I am in a profession where I need to be clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I battled with shaving for years, but have finally found a system that works. And the fusion proglide is a huge part of that system! I have been through hundreds of dollars of shaving stuff. Tried shaving with a straight razor (some people swear by this)... didn&#x27;t work. Tried all kinds of ointments and shaving creams, nothing worked. Now I shave with this and aveeno \\&quot;positively smooth\\&quot; shaving cream, with some king of shaves pre-shave ointment rubbed on prior to shaving. It has done wonders. I can now shave 3-4 days in a row pretty consistently without seeing much irritation. At the 4th or 5th day, my face starts to fight back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to these blades, of course, is the cost. I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive. And I don&#x27;t use mine for more than about 3 shaves. At $4 a blade, that&#x27;s over a dollar each time I shave. However, for me, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Gillette has me... this product is great. I try to shop the sales, and stop up when I can get them for $2-$3 a blade. Also, one other thing to mention. I tried buying blades of e-bay for about a year. I had good success, but then I think I ran in to some counterfeit blades. I didn&#x27;t really figure it out for a few months. I thought it was just my face acting up... it took some time to realize I got counterfeit blades. So be careful who you order these from.</li>
    <li> These are the only blades my husbands uses. He loves them!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic razor blade, no doubt about it. If I shave every or every other day, I easily can get away with one against-the-grain pass of my face (which is no short order for my very sensitive skin, prone to razor burn).  That being said, at 4 bucks a razor (3.40 with s&amp;s), I can&#x27;t justify the cost for shaving my face (especially when I need to change them out every 2-3 shaves). My girlfriend will continue to use them for shaving her legs, as I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s found anything better, but I&#x27;m going back to my safety DE razor with Feather blades. I get as close a shave with them (closer if I go against-the-grain, though with more skin irritation) at 50 cents a blade (25-50 cents a shave, as I change them every one or two shaves). If I were to use Derby blades (my second favorite, but I only use for with-the-grain shaving), that would be closer to 8 cents a blade.</li>
    <li> These razors are powerful, simple, and very effective...I recommend them to all men. I shave every morning and they never leave a mark!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to try these blades but due to the high price I have been reluctant.  I stumbled across the subscribe and save and purchased these because I got a considerable discount.  These blades really do glide over your face and are a significant upgrade from the Fusion Manual Razors.  I will continue to purchase these and the nice thing is they will arrive at my door every 2 months with no hassle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m use these all the time hands down the best shave ever but here&#x27;s a trick the balde companies don&#x27;t want you to know and I swear it works !!! Every time you shave use the hair dryer and wash and dry your razor it only takes a few seconds but it works !! The ONLY reason blades get dull so fast is the water left on the edge of the razor causes The blade to corrode making it go dull long before it would normally!!! Just try it for the life of one blade and you&#x27;ll see for your self hope you like this little trick for saving you money have a GREAT SHAVE!!</li>
    <li> Gillette makes the blades too close, if you let your beard grow a little past a few days it becomes a pain to shave.  Hair keeps getting stuck between the blades and a simple rinse does not get it out.  You keep have to run your nails over them.  Plus at the high price point they do not last long enough.</li>
    <li> Works as you&#x27;d expect</li>
    <li> First off, I have sensitive skin, and was having problems with razor burn, but this completely eliminates it. It&#x27;s a smooth shave, and with any shaving cream/gel, it feels like running thick water down your cheek. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a motnth now, and its still sharp, so i don&#x27;t know about the other review. Maybe its the way i shave. I always wash out the blade after each use, so it probably won&#x27;t dull as fast as if you don&#x27;t. But overall, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the extra for the vibration, it&#x27;s not that great, and I don&#x27;t use it as much. But for certain people, it might be better than for me. To each his own.</li>
    <li> These blades work really well but they don&#x27;t last very long, and for the price it&#x27;s disappointing but if you want a close shave these are the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Solid razor.  Refills my original gillette fusion proglide exactly like I expected it to.  The battery is pretty long-lasting, so it&#x27;s still going strong even through the refill pack.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor Gillette has put out and is much better than any of the knock-offs. It is a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never risked using any product for shaving my face besides Gillette.  I grew up going through the variety of new products Gillette introduced.  Being a man now, this product gets the job done for me.  You can&#x27;t beat the price Amazon provides.  Pay attention to the product as you can find it on a great discount sometimes.  Overall, even at it&#x27;s average price on Amazon, it is much cheaper than anything you can get at your local store!</li>
    <li> In my opinion these are closest, most comfortable blades available today. I have a heavy beard and sensitive skin, so I am always on the lookout for a better shaver. I have tried several electrics [Norelco &amp; Braun] and of course they are no match for a blade. I have tried the Schick multi blade shavers and the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power with the vibrating handle is better. The blades really do seem to glide over my skin, and if I re-shave against the grain, I get the closest shave I have ever had. This is an improvement over the older Gillette Fusion.  I also recommend using the Gillete Fusion Thermal Face Scrub just prior to shaving. It heats up the skin and seems to thicken and raise the beard hairs so the shave is even closer.</li>
    <li> Authentic razors from Gillette. Same as in stores. Saved a few bucks from local store prices. Still too expensive for plastic tabs with thin razors on them. Did you know it costs companies .05 to .15 cents to make each razor yet they charge 4 bucks a piece..for a total of $30 bucks for an 8 pack. Dont know whats worse, gas prices or razor prices??</li>
    <li> Real deal - work like a dream. I do not have the power version of the shaver, and it works without any issue.</li>
    <li> Good item..good price great with coupon offered.</li>
    <li> Love these blades but they are super expensive everywhere - even here if you ask me!  But this was best price anywhere.  Much cheaper than brick &amp; mortar in my area.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and this is the only shaving product that works me. Gillette claims that one cartridge can be used for 7 days and that may be true for some people. I can use one just twice before switching. So it is expensive but ultimately well worth it.</li>
    <li> Proglide blades are thinner than normal fusion blades.  I&#x27;ve already been sold on gillette since the early mach5 days but they just keep getting better.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  1 blade can last me 3-5 weeks easily, which helps justify the high cost.  I tried schick hydro 5 once.... they can&#x27;t even come close to comparing.  Gillette has a customer for life right here.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product from Amazon and the shipper is fantastic, the review is solely about the product itself.  I&#x27;ve been using whatever the latest is from Gillette for quite a while, however this may be my last.  I love the power, but it seems like the blades on this series don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the older ones.  They will get notched and misaligned very easily.  I&#x27;m assuming this is related to the thinner blades, however usually you can do some about of honing with blade buddy or something similar and that works to some extent with these but not nearly as well.  The biggest issue I have is that there is a rubber pad at the edge of the blade that wears out before the blades do.  The blades will still be usable, but the mounts on the pad will break and the pad will pull over the blades preventing it from cutting.  You can remove it but then it doesn&#x27;t sit well.  I&#x27;ve never had the pads or casing wear out before the blades do on any other razor, but these are consistent and have very short life spans.</li>
    <li> All I need to say about this product is that until they come out with a gel for men that you apply to your face once and you never have to shave again, this is the least painful way to shave. PERIOD.</li>
    <li> AWESOME Purchase. This fits on Gillette Fusion and Gillete Pro Glide sticks.</li>
    <li> Received product as described in a timely manner at a great price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, these new blades work well and are a small step up from the previous model.</li>
    <li> First, I am the account persons&#x27; husband and since it is about me, I thought I had better let you know. I find it objectable that manufacturers continue to just keep producing razors with more and more blades. We then have the option to get new razor or if lucky we receive a free one in the mail. They make the money on those blades. They now have 5 individual blades per cartridge and the cost about $3.50 each in an 8 pack. I opt for my excellent double blade razor that I have used for 15 years and buy the best double edge blades at about 30 cents each. Then a excellent Neutrogena Shave Creme with SPF15. I get a excellent shave, great skin care and smooth shave at about 75% less cost. I rate this low because of the high cost and wasting your money on a razor that will be change within a year. You wives should spend about $30 on a excellent shaver and good skin care products and stop foolishly wasting money on gimmicks...that take your hard earned money. In this case stay with the time tested product. You can get the items I mention on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great and very easy to pop on and off.</li>
    <li> this is by far the BEST Gillette . . i hated shaving and i used to shave once a week cause i had to, but now, i shave every other day and my face hasn&#x27;t been better . . ;-)</li>
    <li> Not interested in writing a review except to say they were great.</li>
    <li> great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> I switched to the Proglide Power a little more than a year ago and have been very happy with it over the traditional Mach 3 that i had been using.  I usually purchase the pack of 8 as it is a lower cost per blade than lesser packs and that is really the name of the game, get as many as you can for as little money.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I think the Gillette Fusion was better than this upgrade. I was used to the Fusion Power cartridges and then bought this thinking it would be better. But every time I shave now I seem to have to make multiple strokes and it still is not as smooth of a shave. Would not recommend upgrading from Fusion Power to Proglide Power</li>
    <li> Good price and quick delivery.  Bought with the Gillette proglide razor, a very woth-while investment.  The first new razor I have purchased in years.  I have been using Bic single bladed razors for years because the multi-bladed ones always clogged up.  This new one is extremely comfortable and rinses clean with ease.  I highly recommend it.  The battery operation is really not necessary, I don&#x27;t find any difference in the save with or without it, but the razor is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Super long lasting and allows for the most comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> if you wash your face with warm water and soak the blade in hot water the blade will last a lot longer. the 8 cartridges will last about 5 months so i give it 4 star</li>
    <li> Gillette now has a program where you can get the Fusion ProGlide razors directly at at least 30% less than what Amazon charged. Apparently, there marketing staff was adroit enough to recognize profits were bleeding because of their high prices -- so to cover they have established an autopay/autoship monthly program that makes the Amazon program appear second-class IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade refills were Gillette&#x27;s and were of the expected quality. The shipment was on time.</li>
    <li> I feel as they have monopolized the razor industry.  Great product but why can no one else compete?</li>
    <li> You can expect a smooth shave for about 4 shaves and then the blade starts to get dull.</li>
    <li> The first few shaves with this razor are great...but then things go downhill.  It lasts less than half as long as the original Fusion and when it starts going dull, the quality goes down quickly.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are not even close to my expectations. When I first used the razor, the shave seemed the same as normal. The second time I used it I noticed that the comfort strip was already dull. I wasn&#x27;t positive of this so I made sure of it on the second blade I used and sure enough I had the same results. I would not purchase, just pay the extra amount at the local convenience store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Amazon: They have been wonderful in helping me with a return.</li>
    <li> Delivery – great&lt;br /&gt;Functionality – great&lt;br /&gt;I got what I wanted, and I got everything I needed.&lt;br /&gt;What more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my friends</li>
    <li> I ordered this refill because I thought I should replace my original blade that came alongwith the shaft.  This was heavily discounted and I think I fell for the bait. It was almost half the price than Walmart Shelf.  Boy, the number of cuts that this brand new blade gave me were uncountable.    Dont know if this is a problem with blades sold by Amazon ! I have read other reviews where reviewers mentioned that the blades sold by Amazon were not good enough. May be thats true.  I may goto Walmart and try theres.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not the standard blades I usually get.  Value for the $$ OK.</li>
    <li> These are the best razor blades ever and are much cheaper here than at the store. They are still way over priced though.</li>
    <li> They do what they advertise.  Very comfortable blade and the change in the green indicator shows when to change the blade.</li>
    <li> The best blades made period, but way over priced. I bought because of a $6 coupon.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Fusion Power for a few years, turning it around to cut my sideburns and trim around my mustache.  It seemed to work pretty well, but had problems getting around my chin;  it seemed like I had to go over it many times to get a close enough shave.&lt;br /&gt;Then I found some Excel disposable blades that I had bought for some reason.  Rather than throw them out, I thought I would just use them and go through them quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, the disposable gave me a much closer shave than these 5 bladed monstrosities.  It was like driving a sports car after driving a truck for 3 years.  It just sipped around my face and easily trimmed sideburns and around the mustache.  My chin became easily accessible again.&lt;br /&gt;I found a place that sold me a Sensor Excel handle and I have now switched completely to the Excel family.  I get a much better shave, and the blades are a LOT cheaper.</li>
    <li> These blades are EXACTLY how Gillette describes them. Absolutely no tug and pull. Even if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a week, the blades glide. By far the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but my husband has me buy these.  Best out there for now.  Hope they come out with something even better real soon.</li>
    <li> I began using the Fusion blades when they were first introduced by Gillette, and then I switched to the Fusion ProGlide in 2010 when they first came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted so much money with this garbage. I hurt my face time and time and time again using this terrible product, and I never got a truly close, comfortable shave. On most days, my face was irritated, and more often than not I gashed my face to the point where I had use multiple band-aids to keep the blood from running down onto my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, if you use this product, you are truly a fool. You have been brainwashed by Gillette into believing more blades are better, when in truth, they are worse. They do damage to your face, and your 5 o&#x27;clock shadow will be back by 2:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? Spend the money on a good old-fashioned double-edged safety razor. Your face and your wallet will thank you.</li>
    <li> Great blades!  I&#x27;ve been using them for years!</li>
    <li> Overpriced but what can I say...there aren&#x27;t many mainstream alternatives.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving razor I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve sticked to it for more than a year. Only make sure that the razor and cartridge are both \\&quot;manual\\&quot; or \\&quot;power\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The blades get a close shave and have a rear facing blade for trimming.  Best shave I have gotten at home</li>
    <li> I have to say the price for all the latest shavers and blades are way to high but they all seem to last me months instead of weeks.  I&#x27;ve been using my current blade on my Gillette Fusion for over 3 months now without replacing it.  I have pretty sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t experienced any bumps or cuts so the blade obviously is working well.  I&#x27;m not one to sacrifice my face for saving a blade so the first indication that it has to go it&#x27;s gone.  Well done Gillette, but maybe think of dropping the price?</li>
    <li> Best razors on the market right now</li>
    <li> Clean shave with these razors!</li>
    <li> It is definitely a better than average product.</li>
    <li> Great razors and very convenient that it gets shipped to me</li>
    <li> THis product is great. Used it for two days and it has been a wonderful experience. Cat dog fish pet turtle pet bonnie</li>
    <li> Tried to go back and save money on safe razor and didn&#x27;t shave as good as these cartridges, last time I used safe razor was more than 15 years ago?! OMG, am I that old?! Only downside is the price comparing to razors.</li>
    <li> Works great smoother than mach 3 if you find good deal like i did here on amazon justifies price difference if u dont then Im not sure I would but these I would take advantage of mach 3 prices dropping</li>
    <li> i dont know why i keep buying gillette products because none of them seem to work well for me.   i used mach3 razors for years and they pulled - im a typical asian so i dont really even have a lot to shave. i was never really satisfied but i kept buying replacement cartridges for some reason.  about a year or so ago, i think, i tried the fusion powered razors. the fusion still pulls a lot and more hair gets stuck between the razors - kind of annoying. the extra razor at the tip when you flip it is AWESOME.   recently, i tried the proglide. i really dont feel much of a difference. i think im just getting suckered into gillettes marketing.</li>
    <li> They had the best prices I could find.  I think they were the ones manufactured for another country, but they fit my razor.</li>
    <li> I like the proglide shaving but the price of the blades is high.  this subscription service reduces the cost a bit.  hopefully these are the real gilette blades and not a knockofff</li>
    <li> I really liked this blade. Gives me a close shave everytime. I have been using this for quite a while now and I have not encountered any problems at all. Ordering it through Amazon just saves me money compared to getting them fr neighborhood stores. I will definitely order again fr this site.</li>
    <li> Much better option than the by-mail shave club razors, better quality with the same ship-to-my-house convenience.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest and most comfortable blades I have ever used. Also, I got them for $5 cheaper on amazon than at Meijer</li>
    <li> These are what you would get at any store around town, although I mostly only find the 6 packs in stores.  It&#x27;s the same thing, but costs less when you subscribe and save.  I think that gets a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I probably got caught into the shaving with 12 razor blades in one advertising scheme.  But in the end the shave isn&#x27;t any better then with something cheaper.  These things are just really expensive.</li>
    <li> Nice but priced is  crazy  for the general public!!!!!  I&#x27;m going to check out the new shaving blades dollar less !</li>
    <li> Excellent product can be reused for many time without issues.</li>
    <li> Very effective razors these are my go to disposable razor heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been upgrading to Gillette&#x27;s newest model for decades and they have consistently been better than the previous generation and the competition. When the Fusion reached $4/razor (and that I need a new razor every week) I was determined to find an alternative. I went back to double edged razors, I tried Schick, and online I tried Harry&#x27;s and Dollar Shave Club (the best online product I found), and several others as well as even trying a Trac II and Mach 3 again. I tried many different pre-treatments and even a Braun electric. After a year I gave up. The Fusion is still head and shoulders better than the rest. So, reluctantly, I am biting the bullet and shelling out the extra cash. But I am sincerely glad that others have found alternatives because that gives me a small satisfaction that Gillette is getting hit where it matters....just not by me.</li>
    <li> As a guy who shaves his head on a daily basis, I have gone through a lot of razors/blades in my day.  The Fusion is by far the best I have found.  They are the least irritating blade I&#x27;ve used and even if I&#x27;m being quick/careless, I don&#x27;t have to worry about nicking or cutting myself.  I attribute this to the 5 blade system doing an excellent job of spreading out the pressure.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a Gillette Mach 3, influenced by the quite wonderful reviews of the Proglide. It has been exactly what I expected, with a smooth shave and no cuts to report. The only problem I find is that it cuts too close and causes ingrown hair, something I now have to worry a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper then the store. Save yourself some coin and buy them from amazon. As far as the blade itself goes; it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> The Fusion system works perfect. But its obvious Gillette is packing way to much margin into their prices of the blades. Come on already lower your price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect item, I love it.</li>
    <li> The shave is all about the blade and the lather.  This battery operated &#x27;thing&#x27; is a waste.  Let us discuss the supposedly upgraded blade.  You definitely pay for the upgrade - it is twice as much as the regular Mach 3 blade.  And although you get more blades, they are very thin and are literally less stable.  The buildup between the finer blades happens quicker too so I think in the long run you end up going through the Fusion ProGlide blades much quicker.  And last, you can get cuts much easier.  I stopped using the power feature altogether and this system is going to end up in the non-recyclable trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mach 3 blades are fewer in number, but bulkier and seem to provide a cleaner more comfortable shave.  And the blades last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best shave will come from a double edged safety razor - and these blades can be recycled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, the Fusion ProGlide powered or not - can glide right off the shelves into shaving history as far as I am concerned.  I think the Gillette marketers make you think you are getting more because you paid more - but you are actually getting less. Proctor &amp; Gamble stockholders and doing pretty well right now - maybe you should buy their stocks instead of the blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you choose to be concerned about your environmental footprint - you are not helping the environment with this purchase either.</li>
    <li> great price and service!</li>
    <li> I actually did a sample review of this a couple of months and liked it so much I switched over to this. I gives a much smoother shave over the Mach III.</li>
    <li> Always on the cutting edge (pun intended) Gillette is top of the line for me.  I shave my head with this razor blade without cuts but with a clear head.  Good purchase.  Get one for yourself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good~I like it.I will be back soon.So i will take ti more.It&#x27;s very very good.It&#x27;s very very nice.</li>
    <li> This shave is extremely smooth and fits the contours of your face as you glide it along.&lt;br /&gt;The pro-glide along with the battery powered vibration allows you to slowly shave your face with precision and ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> The Proglide is the best razor out there for a close shave. Last for weeks and only needs changing when you notice a difference in shave which is usually a couple of weeks. Will not go back to a regular two blade unit.</li>
    <li> Read closely!! These are for the Proglide POWER…I mistakenly purchased thinking they were for the regular proglide razor. Probably work well though, Gillette is a good company!</li>
    <li> This is a refill for the Fusion Proglide Power razor, wich is best razor I ever used and I&#x27;m pleased to choose this poduct. I recommend for everyone.</li>
    <li> I was blessed with a face that has a lot of acne scars on it. thus the beard hair comes out scraggly, rough and uneven. With other blades and razors, they couldn&#x27;t cope with the peaks and valleys of my skin. The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor and these blades, does a great job making quick work of my scruffy stubble. I have never cut myself once, and don&#x27;t even use shaving cream, just hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is they are expensive, as all disposable blade cartridges are. But they are cheaper on Amazon than in a retail store and to me, they are worth it. I can shave for almost a month on one cartridge.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette blades since I was in the Service decades ago and can vouch for the company&#x27;s constant search for a better product. The shave of the Fusion Proglide Power (to my knowledge they give no details—and I called— as to what the &amp;#34;power&#x27; actually accomplishes though the implication and price suggest that this is top of the line and the vibration of the power/ battery combination gives a better shave). As I like to use the best version of a product, I opted for the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; combination and then went for the gimbaled ball when that appeared (yes it is superior). I suppose I should invest in a couple versions and then can speak more authoritatively, but I&#x27;m not made of money.  Bottom line, regardless, I am very happy with the shaver and blade.  I cannot, however, imagine a blade lasting a month as claimed.  I suspect someone in marketing came up with that after a three martini lunch.  I find the blade is less efficient after a week and two weeks is really pushing it with a sacrifice in comfort—and I have a light beard.  Hence I&#x27;m giving 4 rather than 5 stars for P&amp;G&#x27;s hyperbole.</li>
    <li> No problem with product or vendor!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> Plenty of shaves per blade on my tough beard. At least 5 per blade.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really seem to review these without reviewing the razor, but they are great. Some replacements I can get in the store, but a great price. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The blades r not very sharp...almost like the were used before or the r reuse blades...</li>
    <li> I have to say that these are certainly the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. I ran out of shaving cream one day, and so I just used plain hot water. The blades cut my whiskers just as well, and there was no burn. I highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and tender skin, which makes getting a smooth, comfortable shave difficult. The Fusion Proglide system works well for me. My face is not irritated even immediately following the shave, but the beard is gone.</li>
    <li> I like both the Fusion Proglide Power and manual blades and tend to simply buy whichever I can find for the best price when I need more blades.  The difference between the two -- the \\&quot;microcomb\\&quot; at the edge of the Power&#x27;s cartridge, which allegedly exists to \\&quot;help guide the hair to the blades,\\&quot; seems like a silly concept to me.  Then again, I&#x27;m a daily shaver and my hair isn&#x27;t so long after one day that it needs to be \\&quot;guided\\&quot; into the razor blade.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave.  I never get nicked or scratched when using a Fusion blade unless I&#x27;ve been using it too long; the first nick is a sign that the blade is dull and needs to be replaced, which sometimes happens before the lubricating strip indicates a replacement is warranted.  I get about two week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of each cartridge and don&#x27;t do anything special to try to prolong their life.</li>
    <li> Perfect razor, I guess there is nothing better than this in the market right now. I used senser excel before, and I think I am pretty late in trying this product. After using this product, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth of a shave this razor gives. Only reason why I gave this 4 stars is I was getting a cheaper rate for the same razor at costco. I always thought amazon has the cheapest rate, but I was wrong in this case. Same set of cartridges 25% less. I was going to order couple more for my brother and dad, but buying at costco this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Srujan</li>
    <li> Best close shave I&#x27;ve ever had and will last for weeks.  Don&#x27;t be fooled into buying ProGlide that is not POWER.</li>
    <li> The worst quality of Fusion Proglide blades I have ever used, they start scratching the skin after 2-3 use. I have been using Fusion Proglide blades for two years and always very satisfied with them, they last for 15+ shaves. This is the first time I hated it.&lt;br /&gt;I know there are lot of cheap/fake Gillette Fusion blades sold on amazon by third parties but I bought this because it was being sold by Amazon and I trust Amazon. From now on I will stick to local stores for blades.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time I am disappointed by any product sold by Amazon (not Gillette as I have used this line of product for long time).</li>
    <li> Too expensive -- but clearly the best blade on the market.</li>
    <li> wonderful for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion five stars</li>
    <li> The best long lasting blade ....and it stays sharp too!....but beware of counterfeit one&#x27;s ......even from major sellers !....was once a victim ,they will tear out your face from the get go !</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, delivery was fast too.  This includes two of the plastic &amp;#34;cases&amp;#34; each with four replacement heads in it.  The &amp;#34;cases&amp;#34; easily remove / attach from the bottom of the plastic case for the razor itself.  This is very handy for both storage and travel purposes.</li>
    <li> Very good and clean shave. Love it. No hassle . Smooth and clean and fast. Ned to order more</li>
    <li> I fell for the free razor that Gillette sent out to me and here I am four years later after $300 in for the razor blades. Kudos to Gillette marketing team. Definitely no regrets and they are very high quality razor blades. I have very sensitive skin and these blades provide smooth shave without any irritation and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was easy to open packaging available the one wish does not require scissors or knife.</li>
    <li> Great razors for all parts of the body.  Shave&#x27;s very close without irritation.  I would recommend this to everyone. Go get it!</li>
    <li> Much less expensive than buying in the store.&lt;br /&gt;We did a price comparison while shopping, and found this listing that saved us many dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, worth buying again and again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where Amazon is getting a list price of $55.29, but these 8 count packs are going for $20 on Ebay and between $22 and $26 on most other major online retailers (Walmart, BJs, Coscos).  Amazon needs to cut the price by $10 to stay competitive.</li>
    <li> These are less expensive than any other Fusion power blades I could find including Costco. Also, note that the power blade version has additional features that can benefit both power and non-powered Fusion users.</li>
    <li> Great value buying these on Amazon! Love having these on automatic purchase cycle, who likes going to the store to buy more razor blades?</li>
    <li> Close shave without nicks. Wish they were some less expensive, though. Gillette claims they will last a month; but, I only get about two weeks.</li>
    <li> Great razors , great program,</li>
    <li> The most comfortable blades I have used. Easy refill program.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette for over two decades and Fusion for over two years. Never had a problem before but this particular batch of8 cartridgesthatI ordered in May is somehow defective. I have used 3 of the 8 so far and all of them drag on my bristle painfully within the first few uses.  This is in contrast to my normal 20 to 25 uses per cartridge. Since I purchased these in May, I am not us what recourse I have. At $30+, it&#x27;s substantial enough to make me quite annoyed. Has Gillette&#x27;s quality control slipped?</li>
    <li> Seems they do not hold sharpness as well as store bought</li>
    <li> one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. gillete to be congratulated</li>
    <li> I have a very tough beard and very sensitive skin. I have been disappointed in Gillette in recent years as they have been up pricing their blades and the cost of a shave has gone up faster than the cost of healthcare! I have experimented with other blades but revert back as the Fusion does give a superior shave compared to alternatives. What I have done is extended the use of this blade to about 3 weeks which brings the cost of shave down.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  If you need get it here!</li>
    <li> These are my go to brand.  Once got caught out of town and bought the manual version to save a few bucks and I regret it.  The power function is the way to go.</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
    <li> I tried the Dollar blades but came back to these. The 5 blade from the dollar club gave me a good shave, but the Gillette blade seems smoother and the cartridge itself is narrower and shaves closer to the underside of the nose. I&#x27;m probably a 5 day/week shaver and I can make a cartridge last just over 3 weeks before I feel it needs replacing, so the overall expense isn&#x27;t that terrible. I don&#x27;t really see a difference between the &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; blades and the non-power variety, but I have a power handle, so I got the power blades this time. Really a good shave.</li>
    <li> After using this blade for the first time in over a year, I remember why I stayed with this razor for so long: the comfort. Maybe I was using my Schick Quattro wrong, but that doesn&#x27;t matter anymore as there blades cut smooth in a way the Quattros never did.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE...RECEIVED COUNTERFEIT BLADES!!!  I ordered the 8 pack Fusion Power refills...And the blades I received were 100% guaranteed COUNTERFEIT!!!  Ended up throwing 5 of the blades away after trying to use 3 of them.  Felt like I was shaving with a dull cheese grader.  I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years and a real blade would normally last about a month.  These blades I received are not even good for just 1 shave.  Total waste of my money.  Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> Darn expensive, but the only blade that works for me by keeping away the 5:00  swarthy look.</li>
    <li> A great razer... much improved from previous Power razer</li>
    <li> great product thank you</li>
    <li> These are less expensive than any other Fusion power blades I could find including Costco. Also, note that the power blade version has additional features that can benefit both power and non-powered Fusion users.</li>
    <li> What is there to say?  They are blades and Gillette pretty much has a monopoly.  Sometimes, I get blades that last 10 shaves and some that last maybe 5 shaves.  Not sure why.</li>
    <li> Great product--fast shipping---very pleased</li>
    <li> You need refills, the blades are like the ink on the ink jet printers this is where these companies make their money you do not have a choice and have to dance to their tune</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best shaving method for me that I have ever experienced in some sixty years now. I do not always get the closest shave with this system, but, the comfort of this shaving method is unsurpassed, for me, at least. These replacement blades are priced much better than those that I can purchase at any of my local stores.</li>
    <li> Always happy with Gillette razor blades and Amazon typically has them as cheap as any where.</li>
    <li> I had a beard for 37 years but shaved it off just before turning 60.  I&#x27;ve been all around the shaving block in the past 10 mos and have spent alot of money trying tons of different shaving solutions for pre,during, and post shave and here&#x27;s what I have come up with:  Fusion Proglide Power cartridges, manual razor, Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil ($2 for 8oz at Walmart), keep the razor (cartridge side down) covered in mineral oil between shaves.  If the blades seem to &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; a little, just strop them on your wet arm in the shower about 10 or 15 times (i.e. opposite direction of shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cartridge is AWESOME but expensive.  The subscribe and save price is okay.  But if you will keep the blades covered in mineral oil between shaves, they will last for months making them quite a bit cheaper PER SHAVE than old fashioned double-edge safety razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;The procedure I&#x27;ve settled on (after watching hours of youtube and reading lots of articles) is to clean them under high pressure hot water in the sink, both sides.  Shake dry and spray with alcohol.  Blow dry on hot, stick cartridge head down (handle up) in a container of mineral oil (enough to cover the cartridge).  It actually does work.  If you feel a tug of discomfort (I do about ever 10 shaves) then strop it against your arm about 15 times.  The cartridge will go on and on when combined with the storing oil AND the shaving oil (Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with oil and water and nothing else is the way to go.  I typically use 4 drops for my face and neck.  Then during the shave I let the water hit my face once in a while.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with stubble clogging the blades for two reasons:  The mineral oil soak dislodges any left over stubble, and the Fusion cartridge is open from the back.  So during the shower I allow the shower water to hit the back of the cartridge and combined with the oil it just pushes out stubble.  I find I don&#x27;t have to rinse very often during the shave.  Also with oil and cartridge you can just keep shaving till you&#x27;&#x27;re done.  No 2nd pass or 3rd pass, no reapplying oil or anything.  Just let the water hit your face a couple times during the shave.  Just keep shaving till all is clean.  Its SO NICE and SO FAST.  Try it 3 times in a row and you may just get hooked!  It is SO GOOD for your face.  The only problem I had getting started was some shave oils are a little too thick and make the shaving quite slow and not so close.  The Africa&#x27;s Herbal Oil does NOT have this problem.  It is the best oil I&#x27;ve found to shave with.  AND SO CHEAP!!  (King of Shaves Kinexium was my 2nd best oil I found.  So close and so good for your face.  Just WAY MORE expensive than Africa&#x27;s Herbal Oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I&#x27;ll mention this because I&#x27;m trying to help someone:  I discovered I have adult acne.  I didnt know it when I had the beard but when I started shaving I discovered it.  I thought I was going to have to use a safety razor and shaving soap bc that was much easier on the acne than this wonderful Proglide cartridge.  Well once I realized this was acne and not razor bumps or razor rash, then I started treating my face for acne after each shave and now I can shave with any shaving regimen out there.  That&#x27;s why I happily went back to these awesome Proglide cartridges!&lt;br /&gt;So I shave in the shower (just spread some liquid soap on the mirror and wash it off.  Your mirror will not fog up during that shower) and AFTER shaving I wash my face with Olay Foaming Face Wash (rub it between your hands before applying) and after my shower I wash it off.  Then after drying my face I apply Dr. Song 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel and let it dry (approx 10 min).  Then I apply Fruit of the Earth (cheap at Walmart) 100% Aloe Vera gel.  The shaving oil will leave your face quite well moisturized!  But I add the aloe because it helps moisturize and is quite good for your face especially after shaving.  I do hope this helps somebody.ve.  Also with oil and cartridge you can just keep shaving till you&#x27;&#x27;re done.  No 2nd pass or 3rd pass, no reapplying oil or anything.  Just let the water hit your face a couple times during the shave.  Just keep shaving till all is clean.  Its SO NICE and SO FAST.  Try it 3 times in a row and you may just get hooked!  It is SO GOOD for your face.  The only problem I had getting started was some shave oils are a little too thick and make the shaving quite slow and not so close.  The Africa&#x27;s Herbal Oil does NOT have this problem.  It is the best oil I&#x27;ve found to shave with.  AND SO CHEAP!!  (King of Shaves Kinexium was my 2nd best oil I found.  So close and so good for your face.  Just WAY MORE expensive than Africa&#x27;s Herbal Oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I&#x27;ll mention this because I&#x27;m trying to help someone:  I discovered I have adult acne.

    <li> this is areal scam! the blades in the package that include the razor are very nice and run smotly, but the recplacement baldes feels like passing a sand paper over your face! everyone be aware, this is a real bad product. Probaly the one sold are fake or copies, because there is a huge difference with the originals. By the time I finished to use the blade includeded with the razor and tried the one in the only-balze package there was no possible to return them. I bought two raplacement packages and tried both of them...incredibly rough, with your skin iching and red!! be aware from this scam! you pay as much as the original but you get aterrible product that feels and cut much worst than supercheap single blade razor. Never again!!!</li>
    <li> This is still my go-to brand for razor blades, and does an excellent job.  Never had any issues, but boy are they expensive.</li>
    <li> Before I start reviewing here I want to bust a myth: Yes, these cartridges are interchangeable with regular Fusion Proglide or Fusion Proglide Flexiball razors or the Fusion Proglide Slider 3-1.  You do not need to have different versions of cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used safety razors for most of my shaving ages till I came across these 5 blade system.  I shouldn&#x27;t say I am never going back to the safety razor but it does not look like I am switching back in the near future.  My initial purchase was Fusion Proglide Power with 4+1 blades as I couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades at a convenient store while travelling.  The next move has to be the next gen shaving kit if and when it comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best and the top of the line cartridges available for \\&quot;nearly\\&quot; top of the line razors.  The machining and technology is the best.  It should work smoothly on most types of beards, if you have issues with these I would try different shaving creams as sometimes you just need a better moisturizer or need to let you beard soak for a while.  The strips on top of the blades works for some (based on the other reviews) but I don&#x27;t think they add a lot of value to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the blades and this purchase:&lt;br /&gt;1. How long do these replacement blades last?&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day on weekdays and occasionally on weekends and have to replace the blade once every ~8 weeks.  I know most people recommend changing this sooner, but I learnt that if you clean your razor more often while shaving and no hair gets clogged between the blades these last a bit longer.  Considering the price I think it is better to spend  that extra time in rinsing more to get those additional weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Where is cheapest price to buy these replacement pack?&lt;br /&gt;As of 1st Aug 2015 - the standard internet search engines, local department stores, local membership stores I found Amazon to be the cheapest.  This does not include any coupons that one can find occasionally.  Do your research before you buy some.  I personally do not prefer random internet sites so these were excluded from the research.  Also, Amazon does get an extra star for convenience and delivery. Also, my purchase from Amazon included a $3 coupon which made it slightly more cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Why the 8 pack?&lt;br /&gt;I did the math and figured that 8-pack should last me roughly another 60-70 weeks.  Think about it, either the new technology is going to force the price lower or one will upgrade to the new better model if available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Why only 4 stars?&lt;br /&gt;Price.  Yes, it is pennies per shave but I think there is a small room for price improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust the company and have been using their products for a long time so I strongly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.

    <li> It&#x27;s working out just fine</li>
    <li> Great deal well buy again</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette products since the Seventies starting with the &amp;#34;Good News!&amp;#34; double blade razor in 1976. I&#x27;ve moved through each Gillette&#x27;s upgrades throughout the years and have been astonished at the consistent level of improvement from one version to the next. When the Mach 3 and its offshoots came out, I thought Gillette had taken us to the highest level of comfort and close-shave as was ever possible. But I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During Super Bowl 2006, Gillette announced the five-blade Gillette Fusion with a one-blade trimmer. I thought it was just another gimmick until I tried it. Again, Gillette shocked me with an even closer, better shave. As the years have passed I&#x27;ve graduated to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide and, about a year ago, the Fusion ProGlide Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion ProGlide Power, combined with Remington King of Shaves Shaving Gel (menthol), creates the finest shaving experience of your life. The blades hold up FOREVER and will actually provide a close, comfortable shave for months without dulling. I have a pretty tough beard and I shave every single day. I only need a 5-6 blade changes a year, which makes the cost cheaper than just about any other alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: Buy it and try it, you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave like I&#x27;m supposed to.  I shave against the grain; these razors allow for a good close shave with little irritation.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast delivery. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and blades and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> this was a very good deal for the money and the product its self was excellent and was very easy to use and worth the money i paid and i would have paid more</li>
    <li> Great Product. First time shaver who loves it. Really a smooth shaver. Also the blades are wonderful.  Doesn&#x27;t pull my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Received order as Indicated. Packaging Good.&lt;br /&gt;I recently order the wrong Blade design. Now I have the correct Refills for my Power Razor.&lt;br /&gt;Thought these Refill are Expensive to say the least. It shave is good and I recommend these refills.</li>
    <li> Until Dollar Shave Club came around. These always gave me more razor burn than any other razor. Much cheaper options now (especially DSC) so I&#x27;ll never, ever go with these again.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide Power blades I buy at Wal-Mart has an orange strip at the bottom; these are blue. These blades do not seem to be as sharp and they seem to get dull quicker. I cannot explain it, but it is consistent from blade to blade. They are cheaper than buying in the store, but replacing them more often negates the cost savings.</li>
    <li> BETTER PRICE THAN LOCAL STORES UNLESS YOU HAVE COUPONS AND WILL BE PURCHASING ALL OTHER GILLETTE PRODUCTS AS I NEED THEM.  BEING A DISABLE VETERAN IT MAKES EASIER FOR ME AND LESS PAINFUL.</li>
    <li> great product. the price was amazing. thanks</li>
    <li> Love the razor&#x27;s only reason not 5 stars is the price which is twice the price</li>
    <li> got sent this from Gilette to review.. Its all around a great product when it comes to function, it gives me a nice smooth shave bump free. I don&#x27;t worry so much about cutting myself. I guess the one downside is the price but can you really put a price on razor burn free skin.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Gillette Fusion razor.  These blade refills are great and 8 of them lasts over a year at our home.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave. They have been an improvement over the earlier Gillette Mach 3 I was using before. Docked one star for the price. Last a long time with pre-shave oil.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard, so I decided to go from Mach 3 to the Power Fusion Proglide, just to see how good it is and if its really worth it. After trying it a few months, its ok. I dont shave every day or a few days even but this will shave without cutting or nicking me. After using a blade a few times, I switch. I know, I should or be able to use it more than a few but I dont enjoy cuts, ect and since I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years now, I just dont feel like shaving all the time...lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know theres a non power model, I&#x27;ve tried it once, so I wont comment on the 2 and which one is worh it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair, you might want to try this, at least once and if you like it, make sure you get the subscription here, every penny helps!</li>
    <li> These are the best reusable cartridges I have used. I have very thick and course facial hair, and these blades provide the smoothest shave I have had outside of a barbershop. I use one blade per 5 day work week, which makes the price per use higher than I would like, but it&#x27;s well worth it to get rid of the razor burn I used to experience on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> These blades are as good as I have had to get a clean shave.  The Amazon price isn&#x27;t bad, but I found a better prie for them at Sam&#x27;s Club.  I have been using them for a few years now and will continue to.</li>
    <li> They are good quality razor heads. I can get about 4 uses out of each one before I have to use a new one.</li>
    <li> Probably the best way to buy your blades for the best price.</li>
    <li> The price isn&#x27;t cheap, but thankfully the blades don&#x27;t go dull as fast as off brand blades tend to do with heavy stubble. I think I save more per a year using these than with a razor subscription plan.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with these and I&#x27;ve used this to shave any part of my body that has unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Nice price!! Works great!</li>
    <li> why do razors have to be so expensive....great razors and fast shipping will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> The razor is OK but the shaving product has problems. I;m nowe on my third can that&#x27;s nearly full but fails to dispense.  Be warned!!</li>
    <li> Prompt service and product as described</li>
    <li> Best Blades on the market! The only ones I use and will continue to use</li>
    <li> Best Razors period! I have sensitive skin and I look forward to the close shave I get with these with almost no irritation thanks to this and the flexball.</li>
    <li> one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had, even my wife uses these blades.</li>
    <li> works fine for the hubby who uses it with the bigelow brand of shaving cream. he did say he likes the schick 5 blade better though for ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> These razor blades are the best per my husband!  He gets a good smooth shave and they last a long time!</li>
    <li> P&amp;G over-designed it. 5-blades are over-kill when they are so close to each other.  You spend too much time to clean the blade and see the water going waste. If you are a busy person in morning running to the office, then stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> I have the razor, I need the blades.  This was the right blades at a good price. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Clean cut yet smooth.</li>
    <li> Razors are such a personal thing that is seems hard to review, but for me personally, these are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to shave daily, and if I go out at night, one more time.  I seem to have pretty sensitive skin, it can get red and irritated easily, but I have my method down, and this is one of very few razors that perform very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is price when it comes to blade cartridges, just have to wait for a sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I recommend to anyone who asks about razors.</li>
    <li> For my &amp;#34;field test,&amp;#34; I used this product with a ProGlide razor body. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The blades nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. One possible caveat--the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris Lawson</li>
    <li> These blades give the best and most comfortable shave Ive ever had but are surprisingly flimsy last only 3-4 shaves before becoming one of the worst and most uncomfortable shaves ever.  At the price, its getting to be a real luxury and am tempted to just go back to good old fashion manual shavers.</li>
    <li> Once you shave with this everything else feels like you are shaving with a kitchen knife. Expensive,yes. Worth it, absolutely yes. Come out of the dark ages and try this.you definitely will love it.</li>
    <li> best shave still to be had!</li>
    <li> Cheaper than any retail store. Good product and works like a champ!</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hello to everyone everything  so far is perfect  and I saved money  just my review stevworks</li>
    <li> Great deal, fast delivery</li>
    <li> These blades always seem a bit pricey but the do the job well.  Shaving is not one of my most favorable tasks therefore it is not one that I perform on a daily basis.  Consequently, the life of an individual blade is extended dramatically making it a better buy for my money.</li>
    <li> Tried a bunch of blades and the are the best for me. The actual number of blades is good.</li>
    <li> Order was intact and on time. Received when I was supposed to the ease of the blade installation was good. would recommend to anybody that has this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile now and found it better than other shaving products that I have tried. I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED AND WHEN I NEED MORE I WILL BUY HERE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> always my favorite and always the best!!</li>
    <li> Just bought a new razor with one blade. Great shave. Tried these replacement blades several times, not as good. I don&#x27;t know if Gillette is producing substandard replacement blades or if these are Chinese counterfeits. At $4 per blade they very well could be knock-offs.</li>
    <li> Quality as expected at very reasonable prices!!</li>
    <li> It Was what I was what I was looking for, and it was user friendly. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> After several times comparisons, I think the Fusion-proglide-power one is not that comfortable as Fusion-power one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fusion-power without proglide more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled to use multi blade razors with a floating head.  As much as I&#x27;ve wanted to use them, they usually have been unbearable to shave with.  I had resorted to using disposable razors for their comfort, but that actually weren&#x27;t that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came along the Gillette Fusion razors.  What a difference!  When the vibration is not turned on these still shave very smoothly.  But, the vibrating handle makes a huge difference.  The vibration makes these razors cut like butter.  It is almost unbelievable.  The multiple blades give a good close shave too.  I am a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple versions of these Fusion blades that can be confusing.  Here&#x27;s my sussgestions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All fusion blades will work with all fusion handles.  They are interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;- The &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; model has an extra sharpness that helps with smoothness of the first shave or two.  Usually that first shave with a razor is a bit more rough, as the micor-burrs on the new blades need to be worn off.  The Power version has removed these already and give a perfect shave out of the box.  That&#x27;s worth the extra pennies in my book.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fusion Proglide for a few weeks now and hands down this is the best shaving solution I have encountered in a long time.  I got it from bzzagent.  I have sensitive skin and in grown hair, and I used to be bloody after the shave.  With Fusion Proglide all the pain and blood is gone and I get a close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor. It&#x27;s the best to shave my face, because my skin is very sensitive. I recomend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great price great razor</li>
    <li> Pricey, but of all the razors out there, these are the ones my skin love the most. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the swivel head when they first advertised them, but now I can&#x27;t do withhout it. And I especially love the vibration. I can&#x27;t even use non-vibrating razors anymore.</li>
    <li> BEST VALUE ON REPLACEMENT BLADES</li>
    <li> work well, decent price.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my grandson, who has a very heavy beard. They&#x27;re wonderful and he prefers them. Very effective and don&#x27;t torture your skin.</li>
    <li> I tried all the cheap alternatives that have been popping up, but now went back to Gillette.  Yes, you need to take out a second mortgage to pay for them but they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Only kind I use. Watch out for fakes.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver!! So versatile. Proper size,good handling and so easy to handle in every way. Absolute recommendation for everybody who wants one</li>
    <li> Oh these things are great, without a doubt. I have very coarse facial hair and these things slice through it and leave my face as smooth as a baby. They also work great on &#x27;other&#x27; areas also. However, they are just so darned expensive. I know, I know, supply and demand, etc.&lt;br /&gt;However, in my opinion, they are the best at what they do, so I consider them a necessary evil.</li>
    <li> I use it for a day or two, then go back to my olde safety razor.  Just wish I could get a good quality blade for the safety razor.</li>
    <li> I HATE shaving, who doesn&#x27;t though?! You might as well get the best shave you can though. These blades provide just that! I have very sensitive skin and get razor burn really bad, not with these! They make shaving much easier and at least tolerable. I appreciate the easy of subscribe and save too, even if these are pricey, they last longer and really are less (at least where I live) than any store (by $10, easy!). Thanks Gillette for a great product!</li>
    <li> Husband will only use these razors. Much cheaper on Amazon than Walmart/target/etc.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaving system, but these cartridges don&#x27;t last very long and are quite expensive.........but hooked.</li>
    <li> Gillette THE BEST A MAN CAN GET. THIS IS A VERY, TRUE STATEMENT. HAVE USED GILLETTE FOR YEARS AND NOTHING HAS EVER COME CLOSE TO MATCHING A CLOSE , CLEAN SHAVE.</li>
    <li> no close shave as expected</li>
    <li> Yes, they make for a comfortable shave.  But for the average Joe, they&#x27;re not worth the extra coin.  Criticisms:  1. Five blades are ridiculously wide.  It&#x27;s hard to accurately shave the narrow area between my lip and nose.  Using these to square-up my sideburns is like using an axe.  2. The proximity of the blades to each other causes rapid build-up of shavings, requiring more frequent rinsing. You pretty much have to rinse the head after each row. Very tedious.  3. Even this bloodthirsty capitalist grows weary of Gillette&#x27;s program of forced obsolescence.  I was perfectly happy with the Mach 3 system; now you can&#x27;t even find the blades.  Before that it was Sensor; Atra; ad infinitum.  Does the human face keep changing?  Maybe in another million years. But until then, Gillette can stick it.</li>
    <li> The 1 and 2 blade disposables are cheaper and last longer than these blades. The only advantage to having 5 blades in 1 is that you take fewer strokes to get a close shave. You&#x27;ll pay extra for that advantage.</li>
    <li> Like any other razor blade, these guys do feel a bit pricey. But you get what you pay for. These blades are sharp and leave my face feeling very smooth after I shave. If you have a lot of hair, they can dull pretty quickly, so you may want to replace your blades frequently. (I only get about 2-3 shaves out of each blade... but I really like clean, fresh blades when I shave.) I&#x27;ve tried other blades (and even done the whole Dollar Shave Club thing a few times), but I always keep coming back to my Gillettes. Give them a try!</li>
    <li> The subscription service is very convenient.  The product is as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent Blades. Very close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Does the job of getting a close shave but I don&#x27;t really see that much of an improvement over the previous Fusion blade.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving product!</li>
    <li> Very good razor blades, long lasting great shave</li>
    <li> great blades to shave with .</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product, pricing, and shopping convenience!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even need a review from me. Anyone that tried it knows it works perfect! Excellent... If it was for me the price showd not be so high! But when I find a product that works and I need it, I&#x27;ll pay for it because it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of razors but the Power Fusion Proglide is the best one by far.  The refills last a long time and give me a smooth shave everytime.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described,  fast shipping, great price, will buy from seller again!</li>
    <li> works well and 5 pak is handy to ,have</li>
    <li> great price for a great product</li>
    <li> Good Deal For Blades!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with these razors and one blade last me quite awhile. I can use one blade comfortable and easily for well over a month with no issues. I have to shave every single day or I would have a full beard in three days so I like these razors just fine.</li>
    <li> As most of us guys know, the cartridges are expensive.  I&#x27;ve found these to be very comfortable to use, though, and they seem to last two weeks, if not more, each.  The extra trimming blade is especially useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-J</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these types of blades any longer.... but I still have to rate it well because the blades are just like store-bought and at a great price.</li>
    <li> This razor works great!if I have very sensitive skin but I found this works best for me.</li>
    <li> use it with RazorPit Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Sharpener and it holds for 1 year...instead of 10 weeks as before.</li>
    <li> The best blade to date, ever. I&#x27;ve used them all.</li>
    <li> Bot good deal could bought at Walgreens cheaper</li>
    <li> The blades lose the sharpness to fast</li>
    <li> Provides a good shave consistenly.  A little pricy compared to other razors but for me, worth it.</li>
    <li> These must be knocks off they are not the quailty at all like when bought at Target. They are dull and cause razor burns after 2-3 uses</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Just as pictured.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor is the best blade as today.</li>
    <li> Cancelled the subscription prior to receipt.</li>
    <li> Gives a close shave but doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. I have sensitive skin, and this is without doubt the best cartridge I&#x27;ve ever used. Say goodbye to nicks.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion PROGLIDE cartridges provide a much better shave than Gillette&#x27;s non-proglide shave heads!  Yes, it costs a little more, but it is worth it in terms of a closer shave.  I am balding and shave the top of my head with only a new Proglide cartridge once a week (no bumps) and get about a week per cartridge shaving my face.  I recently goofed and forgot shaving cream on an overnight trip; the green glide strip got me through the shave without a cut.  This cartridge does have a small single &#x27;detailing&#x27; blade on the back side that I have given up on after multiple cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy these on Subscribe &amp; Save.  The price is good and it is nice not running out.  Be careful to not buy non-Proglide by mistake chasing a lower price.</li>
    <li> ....these are amazing blades....the shave is smooth, clean, and nick free....like the title says, ...&#x27; they get the job done ...&#x27;</li>
    <li> You get a great shaving every time with this blades, they also last a long time, haven&#x27;t had any issue with them, just don&#x27;t wash them with hot water, that will damage the blade, always use cold water to rinse them.</li>
    <li> the gillette powerglide blades are xcelent.. how ever they are very pricey, and for the amount of money for the blades. they shpuld last longer than 7 shaves.. gillette needs competion, as wilkinson did to them in the 1980&#x27;s with the bonded razor</li>
    <li> I find it absolutely outrageous that there is no lower priced options to buy these blades.  For the super steep price, they just don&#x27;t last.  But again, it is a monopoly.</li>
    <li> The best and longest lasting blades $ can buy and the best deal is on Amazon.com! Thanks! When I need more in 8 months I will by more at Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> they do not last as long maybe a week also do not get as smooth shave as I was told and as they are advetised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just waiting until someone comes out with the 10-blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joking aside, this expensive refill is actually decent quality.  I have a gnarly beard with growth in every direction and a mixture of soft and wiry hairs.  This reality tends to kill blades quickly and results in wretched shaves after a few days.  Gilette likes to advertise that you can get a month out of these blades.  Not for my beard, but maybe for yours.  I can say that where most blade systems are cutting and burning my skin after about 3-6 uses, this one doesn&#x27;t start giving me hell for about 15-20 on average.  Another nice fact about these is that I have never seen a bit of rust on the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lifespan of this is interesting... the first 2-3 shaves are like a hot knife through butter and leave my face baby smooth.  Then the shave quality seems to drop quickly to a somewhat labored effort (multiple passes over the same locations).  But the outcome is still comfortable and smooth.  After the aforementioned 15-20 uses, razor burn begins to increase and smoothness begins to suffer with my wiry hairs not getting completely shaved.  Throughout the period of use, cleaning has been simple under a good stream of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experiences with these blades include use of various name-brand canned shaving creams (some better than others), soap only, hair conditioner only, premium skin lotion only, and professional shaving soap.  Despite the hyperbole of the various supporters, I have seen minor advantages to any of these with my beard using these blades.  The biggest disadvantage of some is that some methods are harder to clean out the multi-blade design than others - but none to the point of leaving gunk in the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now it is just personal preference.  If you have success with electric - good.  If you have success with straight blades - good.  If you want a decently long-lasting multi-blade cartridge - this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> By far the best shave that I have experienced in my 76 years on Earth.</li>
    <li> I have a subscription for these blades because it is a staple for everyone in my household uses this brand. Great price and trusted brand.</li>
    <li> Just the same type of razors my husband has been getting for years</li>
    <li> These are not the same blades that I buy in the store.  Blades from CVS last  1 1/2 months or more,  these blades last a week.  ? !</li>
    <li> my husband loves these and is happy with the delivery plan</li>
    <li> Work great, wish they werent so expensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated shaving - the nicks, the razor burn, the wasted time. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every shaving innovation over the past 30+ years, but the Fusion Proglide is the first real breakthrough. The blades cut cleanly and completely, without pulling, and nicks and razor burn are very rare. The bonus is that shaving now takes about a third less time.</li>
    <li> Too good, both the product and price.. Delivery was good as well. The blade does last me for some weeks now, with no need to change yet.. I shave every day</li>
    <li> I am a loyal Amazon customer and probably have minimum two purchases per month, but I have great concerns about the \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; I signed up for in purchasing razors. After signing up for the subscription and purchasing my first order of the razors, I received an email shortly prior to the second month, which I was notified of a price increase. The increase? 38% higher than the original price. So what&#x27;s the deal?? Does Amazon hook people in for automatic purchases for items similar to this that use the Gillette business model? Get them hooked then increase the cost, in hopes that the consumer doesn&#x27;t notice or is too lazy to cancel?? I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and fairly annoyed. This is a bad business practice. If you&#x27;re going to offer a subscription on a product at a set price, then try honoring that price, not an immediate increase of 38% once you have the consumer signed up. Bad...bad business Amazon!</li>
    <li> For years I had to stick with the Gilette sensor razor because these newer three, four and five blade razors jammed too easily and did not shave as well. Gilette finally addressed that in the Proglide. These do not jam and shave very well. Also, as you may have seen in the ads, you can shave against the grain, as I have to do to get a close shave, and it is quite smooth. My only complaints are that they do not last long (three shaves are usually the max, maybe four, I do have to shave against the grain so each shave is almost like two but the sensors with this usage lasted longer) and they are pricey and the price keeps rising. Knocking off one star for those complaints.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I am an old Gillette user, about 25 years. I started with their old fashion shaver and kept on going up.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for several months and have yet to cut or nick my face with them.  In addition, the blades have lasted three weeks before needing to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know shaving is a very individual thing, so these comments will not apply to everyone.  I have a fairly tough beard that can need shaving twice a day if I need to look presentable in the evening.  I also have enough wrinkles that it can be difficult to shave all the contours around my face.  And I take a blood thinner, so any nicks become annoying bleeders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Gillette Mach 3 blades which lasted only four to seven days and generated numerous nicks.  Septic pencils were a regular use item after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide cartridge starts with great shaves and gradually tapers off to ok shaves by the end of the third week.  At three weeks, they give the equivalent of a Mach 3 shave after three days of use, at least on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to the cartridges is the \\&quot;precision trimmer\\&quot;, which is awkward to use and is fairly easy to cut yourself with.  I just don&#x27;t use that attachment and do any trimming with the regular blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricey cartridges, but they give great shaves with no bloodshed.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced my blades in a while, however, this new version of fusion is simply fantastic.  Its such a close shave and the precision trimming helps out with outlining your beard/sideburns etc.</li>
    <li> Great Product they are name brand Fusion razor blades for more affordable than what you would get at the store.  Great sharp amazing blades</li>
    <li> gracias por los comentarios son muy prcticos  era lo que esperaba muy suaves son una delicia los recomiendo a a</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the reviews (and ignored the bad reviews for this product) and went ahead and bought this product. this is utter useless product - In one Sentence-It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job...</li>
    <li> More bang for the buck!  Great deal!</li>
    <li> I really thought this was an exaggerated product, and maybe it is a little, but I like it a lot more than I expected to.  I still use it in combination with a tiny &amp;#34;Good News&amp;#34; disposible to get into tight spots, nose and ear hair, etc, but the main part of shaving is now very fast for me.  I feel like I&#x27;m shaving with a paint brush!  Once you&#x27;ve tried one, you&#x27;ll see what I mean:  The blade part is soft and floppy, kind of like slapping on paint.  I shave using Dove Bar soap (the best shave cream in the world!) and &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; downward strokes to quickly remove 95%, then upward strokes to cut it close.  Follow that up with the tiny disposable and I&#x27;m done... 3-4 minutes start to finish.  Note that I said nothing about the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;... I don&#x27;t use that because it is overkill and not needed.</li>
    <li> I have a Fusion proglide power two year ago and is the best razor that i used ever, nothing compare</li>
    <li> I have been using Fusion Proglide Power blades since they came out. I buy them on subscription from Amazon- with the last shipment I noticed a change in trays that hold the cartridge and the country of origin was omitted. Previously the packaged listed \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot;. Aside from the changes in packaging, these blades are not as sharp and do not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges from  previous shipments would give a great smooth shaves and last at least 8-9 days , now I feel like changing this new blades after 5 days. The cartridges herein are no better than their competitors and more costly . I am disappointedwith this , and now will look for other shaving options.</li>
    <li> Very expensive the next time I should find a different one. Gillette is too greedy.. and I wish another company will produce one.</li>
    <li> It is too expensive and don&#x27;t really see a lot of difference after sing the previous set of blades introduced by Gillette.  Bottomline, they are too pricey.</li>
    <li> Queste lamette hanno un solo difetto: quando non ci si fa la barba ogni giorno ma la si lascia crescere un po&#x27; non sempre si puliscono adeguatamente. Forse le lame sono troppo vicine o non so cosa sta di fatto che si incastra la barba in mezzo. Tranne questo piccolo difetto, ecco perch&amp;eacute; 4 stelle, nulla da dire per precisione di taglio e durata. Forse leggermente care.</li>
    <li> Enough cartridges to last me for at least 2 months or so.  Maybe even longer. Great purchase, keeps me from running back and forth to the store.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler provided by a program run by Gillette a few days ago. I have been using Gillette products for years now and quite frankly was very happy with the Fusion. Gillette does it again and provides an even better razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: It is Gillette so you know it is great quality and something you can depend on. Great quality with little irritation left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: The only downside would be the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great buy! There are a lot of competitors entering the razor field and yet Gillette still is staying ahead of them all!</li>
    <li> I probably the got the cleanest shave ever using this product.  I have always had a hard time getting a clean shave on my chin, and I always seemed to get cut.  I used this product and I have yet to get cut and I have gotten an awesome shave.</li>
    <li> I am happy to have this product given to me by Gillette through a free item program. This blade provides a close shave and eliminates tug and pull from the equation. the fact that this product is available is a revolution in shaving design and comfort. The blade handles well and conforms to the contours of the users face to allows for the closest shave possible. this is worth the money and is a good deal to boot.</li>
    <li> I received these razors through a promotion ran by Gillette, and I have to say... wow... I have never in all my years, had a shave as close and comfortable as those provided by these 5 blade beauties. The sharper thinner blades allow for such a close comfortable shave, you my think that your face has been replaced by a baby&#x27;s butt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the price point set on the replacement cartridges. $25-30 for 8 cartridges is a little steep.... but they are worth every penny....</li>
    <li> i got some free blades from a Gillette program. I must say these are the best blades i have ever used. no tugging or pulling my face doesn&#x27;t get irritated. i will continue to buy these</li>
    <li> I got the chance to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade itself is great...there was no tugging on the hairs as I&#x27;ve experienced with some other products (including the Mach3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say there&#x27;s a MicroComb and I certainly see it but am not sure what role it plays--maybe it&#x27;s the reason there is no tugging?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five-blade design is sleek and the blades are thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s certainly an upgrade from the Mach3 blades and it looks like I might finally make a switch from old reliable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a ton to shave when I do since I have a full beard, but this was a good blade to shave above my beard and parts of my neck. The fourth blade mixed with the power blade really got a close shave. I have used Gillette Mach 3 for the past 10 or so years, but would seriously consider changing to these blades. The fourth blade mixed with the power blade really got a close shave.</li>
    <li> I tried these razors through a program from Gillette. They are great. I have tried many other ones that pull quite a bit more and don&#x27;t shave as close as this one does. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razors really do work very well. My only complaint is that the detailing blade on the backside of the razor tugs a bit more than some others. All in all, an exceptional razor that will shave close and glide right over your skin for a very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge is a great product to cut your beard. im happy to announce i didnt cut my face like when i use the other razors. its light weight. its easy to clean and it i would recommend it to my buddies</li>
    <li> When I decided to try this new product by Gillette I was a little skeptical but I was in much need of a change because the current razor I was using was not going to do the job anymore. Before I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I had bought two other types and had horrible experiences because they pulled my goatee and left my skin irritated. Immediately after starting to use this product I knew that it was different than the rest I felt no pulling and it was getting the job done quickly. When I was done I was very satisfied about the results and I have finally found a new razor for keeps, for the price and value truly a shave above the rest! Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> This is the shaver you have been waiting for! I always find it hilarious that the razor commercials show guys who have baby faces and don&#x27;t need to shave but once a month because they don&#x27;t grow hair and make it look like their blades are amazing. I must tell you though that this razor has done it! The blades are unbelievable! They are sharp and stay sharp through the entire use of the blade. I have a very thick beard and it grows at an extraordinary rate, i have to shave every morning. If any of you are out there like me the razors of the past just didn&#x27;t hold up well, tugged at your hair, and had to be thrown away after a couple of uses. After a couple months of use with my new pro-glide fusion power it is absolutely the best razors money can buy. I can shave every morning now without fear of razor burn, tugs, and cuts. Besides all of that the blades give a me a good shave for a minimum of a month and a half. Again being a guy with a thick beard this is a godsend! Don&#x27;t waste your money with any other razors, pay the extra dough and get the fusion pro-glide, you wont be sorry. I got this free razor from Gillette provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this for free via a program run by Gillette. I love this razor.  I usually have to shave every other day but now I can go 3 days without shaving.  Great time saver and allows me to sleep in longer a couple days a week.</li>
    <li> This is the best gillete invention in all its history!!!....... Excelent, Excelent, Excelent, Excelent, Excelent, Excelent, Excelent, Excelent, Excelent, Excelent,</li>
    <li> great product. love it.  just what I needed.  couldn&#x27;t ask for better.  worth every penny.  best of the best. perfect.</li>
    <li> THE ONLY RAZORS MY HUSBAND AND I USE! ...seriously, any other brand doesn&#x27;t leave skin half as smooth after shaving</li>
    <li> Its mens care.  Can&#x27;t be that complicated.  And the price makes it a bit less complicated since I think its cheaper here than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> After seeing the Fusion Proglide in every magazine, coupon book and billboard for a few months, I decided to give it a try.  The shave was good, but the blade that came with the razor lasted me ten days.  My Quattro lasts me over a month.  I threw the Proglide in the trash, and am happily back with my Schick Quattro.  I will not pay a dollar every two days for a shave...no matter how good the shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m guessing Gillette recovered their considerable research and development costs on this iteration of their wowie zowie blade in the first 6 months.  Now they have to be just minting money what with the high cost of these.  To be clear, this is the best blade on the market for me -- but the price is just breath-taking!</li>
    <li> No matter where I go these things are pricey. Thanks to safety razors becoming Hipster Posh they are also climbing in price. Beyond the price tag these razors do take down my wiry beard with ease. It only lasts 5-7 days not a month or more like it is stated in the commercial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 2 years and will never use anything else. They cause very little irritation, if any, and shave well. Downsides are they are very pricey and only last about 5 or 6 shaves. I use these with Nivea for men shave gel and have very little trouble!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price, and will order again when I run out of this product. What else can I say</li>
    <li> Always find Gillette fusion easy to use and very efficient, the blades are sharp and run smoothly over skin, good quality package</li>
    <li> Excellent product...no problems.</li>
    <li> Used these for years.  Will continue to do so.  They have been the best option for me as i tend to get razor burn easily and these seem to be easier on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. Makes shaving like wiping butter off of your face and they can last over a month!</li>
    <li> Great razor; these are the replacements for the blades. A bit pricy but the product works well. No issues on this end</li>
    <li> Have to shave daily as beard grows while I sleep.  Face must want the full beard again.  The &#x27;proglide power razor&#x27; has always been my choice razor since first marketed.</li>
    <li> I got this product through a program Gillette was running. The pros are that after using this product I didn&#x27;t get any lumps or bumps. The bad is that it seems to take forever to use and it doesn&#x27;t glide the way I would like it to glide. I do not recommend</li>
    <li> The blades were great.  The razor is powerful and the blades make my skin smooth with no irritation.  The razor fits great on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I have received these through a free Gillette marketing Campaign. This product was attached to the Gillette Proglide syler trimmer.  The razo was good but not with trimmer as it was bulky but stand alone it was great.</li>
    <li> I have always used disposable razors but I received a ProGlide Fusion styler for free from a program run by Gillette and was amazed how smooth and comfortable these blades are.</li>
    <li> The blades give a great shave and really do a wonderful job.  Easy to clean, I get many uses out of them.  This was a great product and I look forward to using it in the future!  Razor was provided free by Gillette!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got a GILLETTE® FUSION® PROGLIDE POWER BLADE, provided free via a program run by Gillette. I have always been a Pro-glide razor fan. The 5-blade ProGlide works great, especially with the use of the power vibrating feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the product really impressed me. Finally a packaging in thick plastic that has an easy-pull release. No need for a full frontal attack with scissors, razor blade, pocket knife or chainsaw.  Easy to open, well organized daily-use storage unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a design improvement and is high quality, heavy/solid with a non-slip grip. Easy to clean, clip-on/clip-off. The ProGlide Power blades are simply the best on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrator feature is quiet and powerful. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received these blades as a program from Gillette at no cost, and have been pleasantly surprised with their performance.  They provide a close shave, and seem not to dull nearly as fast as other similar blades.  I also haven&#x27;t (yet) cut myself, so they really do make it a more pleasant experience versus my previous blades.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor provided by a program sponsored by Gillette.  I was skeptical about this blade being better than the standard fusion, but after my first shave I have to admit it was smoother, there were less knicks and it seemed like a closer shave.  The most noticeable difference seemed to be on the smoothness of shaving against the grain with this cartridge.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge as a sample from Gilette. These cartridges are great for shaving. I enjoy the closeness of the feel. My only hesitation from giving it 5-stars is the price. They can be fairly expensive even compared to other Gilette products</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor if u got sensitive skin Thin blades close and clean shave no bumps only bad part is price .got it from Gillette program nice clean close shave blade are thinner  glides smoother .only bad is that they coast a lot  but all in all amamzin razor</li>
    <li> I got to say awesome razor. the blades get close to the skin and i dont get razor burn like i do with them el cheapo razors. so thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was provided this shaver via a program Gillette ran. I was orignally thinking this shaver was going to be light with a cheap plastic design with a chepy motor,Boy was I was wrong! This shaver is very heavy duty in the hand,Very solidly built and the vibration moto/trimmer is amazing! It shaved through thick facial hair with easy and never snagged nor got caught up in all the hair. It is also very easy to clean,You just press a small button and the trimmer pops up and just run water to wash all the hair out. That easy. The best part is you can take it in the shower and not have to worry about getting it wet or ruining it. I have had friends notice how my sideburns are much cleaner cut now and they are now going out to purchase one for themselves.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razors through a promotion from Gillette and I like these hassle free blades compared to other disposable razors I have tried. I have sensitive skin and I have tried lots of different razors and these are great for sensitive skin. Since they have 5 blades, u don&#x27;t have to go over stroke after stroke. Usually just shave with the grain , then against the grain once instead of various times. Helps eliminate razor burn. The only drawback I had was cleaning the blades was a little more time consuming that standard one, two or three blades. Overall was very satisfied with this product gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> THis is such a great product. It leaves my skin smooth. Being military I have to  shave daily and this is by far the best razor. I got to try it free from a Gillette promotion and its amazing</li>
    <li> Being a person with extremely sensitive skin the quality of my razor is of upmost importance for my comfort and the prevention of nicks. Even with the most expensive razors I still get razor bumps and enviably nick myself quit often. They are even abrasive to my skin causing discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was exceptionally impressed with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades. Immediately I noticed that it was a smooth feeling on my skin while shaving. It felt as smooth as gel with no discomfort at all. The aloe strip is very soothing. Something I had never experienced. After using for some time I have yet to get razor bumps or nick myself once. After this experience there is nothing that could compare, or I would use beside the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also thrilled that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer included a free razor provided through a Gillette program.</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Gillette Proglide has just replaced all razors I have owned! Works great on bald head and facial hair. I am pretty sure my wife snuck it before my first use and loved how nice it shaved her legs.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to test provided free via a program run by Gillette, and have been very pleased with the results. I have to shave every day for my job, and have not had a smoother or cleaner shave than I have had with this razor. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently received the free razor via a program run by Gillette and I am very happy with the results.  The cartridge was easy to install and use, and I appreciated having five thin blades to reach all the contours of my face.  The precision blade was especially useful while I was sculpting by beard/goatee around my mouth and nose.  The cartridge seems to hold up well after multiple uses, adding to the longevity of the life.</li>
    <li> i was recently selected to receive a Gillette Fusion Proglide power cartridge for free from a program that Gillette is running. Normally i don&#x27;t shave my face completely smooth but i decided this was a good opportunity to give it a try again. Initially the razor was working excellent without any issues even dry shaving because of the strip built into the razor but after about 6 or 7 swipes it did start to irritate my skin, but that can be expected with dry shaving. Aside from the slight irritation it was working exactly as i would expect a electric razor to work.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide free as part of a program run by Gillette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like how great this item shaves with out problems if your not sure it will work buy it and give it a try and see what you think about it also if you have money to spare..... but either way i&#x27;m really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;But i dont think i would buy it for the price would have to be on sale for a really low price to get my interested in actually spending the money.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent my these Blades through a program they where running. I have very sensitive skin and have to be picky as to which razors I use. I have been using the same brand for about 10 years. Well not anymore. These blade are much more comfortable and smoother. There is no pull or irritation. I shave everyday and after 4 to 5 days on my old blades I would start to feel a pull. Not with these. I will be able to use them longer, save money and get a better shave. I have thrown away all my other razors.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough great things about theses blades! I received them free via a program run by Gillette but I will definitely continue to purchase them on my own in the future. my facial hair is pretty rough and this is the only blade I have tried so far that has left me cut free for over a week!</li>
    <li> I usually by the store brand razors to save money and have also used the Schick razors.  When I received the proglide power blades as part of a free Gillette promotion I gave them a shot.  I have to say that there was a significant difference, these really felt like they were gliding on my face.  My usual razors do a good job but I can feel the pulling when I shave, but with Gillette it felt smooth while shaving.  I will admit, I will now have to seriously consider converting to the proglide now.  They are definitely worth a shot if you have not tried them yet.</li>
    <li> So I regularly use disposable blade razors. Until now I have always used disposable razors as I have had the best results with them. Powered shavers, mesh and rotary style have always aggravated my face and neck, usually from the cut being too close resulting in ingrown hairs and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration function on the Fusion ProGlide during shaving enhances the shave resulting in a shave not too close to cause irritation, but just enough to leave smooth skin. The disposable power blade heads also have a sharp defining blade at the very top for fine tuning your style. Many thanks to Gillette for letting me try and keep (for free) the unit they sent me to try out. Very generous and this goes a long way to expose new customers to their products and keep loyal ones.</li>
    <li> Ok so you must be thinking these cartridges are way to much money, there is no way I am going to purchase that razor. Well think again my friend. These razors are fantastic not only do they have Thinner, finer blades with a low-resistance coating that replace the tug and pull of shaving with an effortless glide. There is a small little razor at the end of the blade called a MicroComb it guides stubble directly to the blade getting me a extremely soft smooth shave. I love the fact that if I want to use it in the shower I can and I wont ruin the handle end itself. I also love the fact that I can shave, and not have that itchy feeling after I do when I use some other razor blade brands. This product truly is a fantastic product. I am thankful that I got a free sample through a program ran by Gillette.</li>
    <li> These blades are like the manual blades. The positive is that they are replaceable, the negative is that the proglide strip wears out quickly. All in all I would recommended to my friends. I was given this product through a promotion by Gillete.</li>
    <li> Recently I had an opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor via a promotion from Gillette.  I have used numerous Gillette products in the past and always find them to be of the very highest quality.  Gillette blades are pretty much the best blades on the market, the crisp smooth shave they provide really has no equal.  After using these blades you can really tell the quality they provide, my skin is pretty sensitive and having a series of blades that each shave gradually closer really helps diminish the irritation/redness that other blades would give me.  The one drawback of these blades is just how expensive they are, but like most things you get what you pay for and while the cost is high the quality is certainly high as well.  I have tried in the past to go back to a cheaper disposable razor but the results are just so noticeable that I always end up going back to Gillette.  -Don</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor (mouthful of a name) free through a Gillette program just a couple of days ago. I am lazy when it comes to shaving and usually don&#x27;t get around to it until I have some thick stubble on my face. So, I gave this new  contraption a try. I have tried just about everything out there in search of a comfortable shave for my extremely sensitive skin (another reason I don&#x27;t like shaving that often) from electric razors to the old fashioned safety razors, and I have not been thrilled with anything yet. Skeptical about this vibrating razor, I used it and was pleasantly surprised. The five blade cartridge glided gently over my skin and removed my stubble with one downward pass over and minimal pressure placed on thew blade. No shaving against the grain with an upward stroke was required! I didn&#x27;t really even need the precision blade on the back. My only criticism for this product is the small space between the blades tends to trap clippings and requires a little extra rinsing. But, that is not a huge gripe, nor is it a deal breaker in my book. Overall, I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> These razor blades are the only blades I an shave with that does not cause irritation. Highly recommended! If you have sensitive skin you&#x27;ll want these blades! A++ to Gillette</li>
    <li> I received this free razor from a program run by Gillette.I love the power razor, it cuts close and leaves my face smooth.I have no irritation on my neck from this razor.My only thought is way does the razor need power seems to do just as good as my manual proglide razor.</li>
    <li> Gillette provided a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade. I have really sensitive skin. Razors usually leave my skin red and irritated. This was a very comfortable shave. There was no tugging even though I was past due for a shave. These blades provide a really close shave. There was no irritation and I would feel comfortable shaving in the morning before work which is something that I would never attempt with any other razors due to how they irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I was a Mach 3 user and these ProGlide Power Blades were pretty sweet. I got just as good of a shave with these as the old Mach 3s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision trimmer is what was really handy on these though. I wonder why these weren&#x27;t added sooner. I was able to get the tricky spots much easier than with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the razor free provided by a program run by Gillette. As good as they are, I really don&#x27;t think these are worth the 30+ bucks they are asking for them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for a long time, and one thing I&#x27;ve always griped about was how the shave wasn&#x27;t pleasant and the blades were mediocre. I had seen these ProGlide Power cartridges in the stores and thought it was a good idea to try them. At first I balked at the small packs price but for a bulk buy of these blades its well worth it. I thought this particular blade felt really smooth and gave me one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I got the blades for free from a Gillette promotion and I love them. They get really close with no razor burn. I have been using them for a while now and they are still sharp and I don&#x27;t get any tug or pull. The trimmer blade is really nice for those awkward places that still demand a clean look. Love the quality that Gillette delivers in its products and will definitely stay with them.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it was part of a promotional TRY-ME campaign run by Gillette. I received a razor and blades free via snail mail. I had been stalking the mail man for several days anticipating the arrival of this magnificent device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked on this razor &amp; the blades. I have never had a closer, smoother shave with another product. My face felt smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom after my first shave, and with several shaves after that. I experienced no nicks or cuts that I do with other well-known shaving systems. That&#x27;s good since my wife is a vampire! With other shaving systems, I was fearful to shave while she was near.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending these blades and razor to every guy I know.</li>
    <li> This Product lived up to what it said it would.  I got a clean, smooth, close shave!&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt very smooth and clean after I shaved with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it too all the Men who shave!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really all about the shave you get with this great Gillette Fusion Proglide System, it&#x27;s the closest, most comfortable blade I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been doing it a long long time. Every now and then I try an electric, hoping to god that it will work like a blade, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before I come running back come to the blade, and this particular Blade, and overall system, is the best I&#x27;ve come across, what more can be said. Don&#x27;t think twice about buying these blades, for if you buy them in a pharmacy or even Costco it&#x27;s much more expensive, not even close. You get these with free delivery, what more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> I had seen this a few times at the store and I never got it because I wasn&#x27;t sure about having 5 vibrating blades next to my skin. But after i got this free via a promotion from Gillette, I could kick myself for not trying this sooner. This razor was smooth and easy on my face. I know that I will not be going back to my old razors. It took about half the passes to get a good, clean, smooth shave. Stop thinking about it and get this, your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> I have skin very sensitive to razor burn. I was provided a free razor as part of a program provided by Gillette. Having tried many diffent razors in the past, I was skeptical that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor would be any different than others on the market today. After trying it the first time though, I was sold!! The ProGlide Power cartridge gave me an extremely close shave without any nicks, scratches, or razor burn. The blades vibrate, which feels a little strange at first, but the results are noticable. One of the cleanest and smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve had in a very, very long time!</li>
    <li> As a devoted Mach 3 razor user I was a bit skeptical about the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge. I can now say I received the best closest, smoothest shave ever after using this blade now for the second day. I have none of the usual nick bumps or razor burn that I get from other blades. (except the Mach 3 is great also) I&#x27;ll continue to use the Fusion Proglide Power system until Gillette tops this one. :) Give it a try guys, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was originally skeptical about switching from the original Fusion blades to the new ProGlide Power Fusion blades.  The first thing I noticed was the smooth feel of the blades and how they immediately started cutting through my beard.  They are comparable to the original blades, and I did not get cut once.  A downside to the blades I would note is the lubrastip, as it leaves a slimy mess on your skin.  Overall, they are good blades, but I would stick with the original, as I felt I had to use it to clean up stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were provided to me via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a sample from Gillette.  The blades operated smoothly and didn&#x27;t nick any of the imperfections on my face.  It smoothly glided over them leaving a smooth face with no blood.</li>
    <li> I stopped using my electric razor for a week and tried this....  How did it work out?  Great!  Close shave, skin felt soft afterwards.  This razor is easy to hit corners and small spots.  I was able to get precision shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping my electric razor unplugged!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades cut through facial hair like butter!!  With normal blades I usually need to pass over a spot 4-5 times to get a close shave.  These blades cut that down to 2.</li>
    <li> These Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridges are fantastic in providing a really close shave. They are comfortable, don&#x27;t leave you with razor burn, nor do they cause cuts. You do not have to apply much pressure for a clean, close shave. I would recommend this shaving system to anyone. I love it. These replacement blades are the best thing that I have seen in quite some time.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor and blades from a program Gillette was doing. The  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge are by far one the best blades I have used. I have been a fan of Gillette ever since the Mach III came out. Love the open blade design that rinses out the hair effortlessly. The power option is also a plus to this item. Blades stay sharp for almost a month for me with every other day use. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> As a special promotion, I received the new Gillette Proglide razor from Gillette and it is great for sensitive skin.  I have a beard in part to avoid shaving but I do shave my neck once or twice a week with an electric razor because I haven&#x27;t found a razor that would not irritate my skin.  Until now.  The Proglide cuts closer than the electric razor so I look nicer and it hasn&#x27;t given me the dreaded bumps on my skin.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge seemed to function at the top end of the other multi-blade razor I have tried before. My face was smooth at the end and as of current (about 8 hours after shaving) the stubble is a minimum - mostly due to me missing a few spots.  The blades still pulled on my hair a bit (used Edge Sensitive Shaving Gel with it) but not as much as some of the other blades I have tried. I didn&#x27;t need to use the trimmer blade on the back as the main razors got close enough for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide Power handle seemed to be comfortable no matter which was I held it, however, the vibrating function didn&#x27;t seemed to make a difference, more of an annoyance in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Loved the razor cartridges! It gave a comfortable shave that was effortless. Worth the money, but it is expensive! I would totally recommend it to anyone. A really good razor is hard to find and I think I may have found my favorite. The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave and easy to use the razor.  Will be switching to this razor full time.  Much better than the razors  would normally use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 blades for years but will now always use the Fusion Proglide Power due to the smoother shave experience.  The lubrication strip is larger and last longer.  You definitely have a new fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhett</li>
    <li> I prefer to use an electric razor but I was given these blades as part of a promotion by Gillette so I figured why not give them a try. I always liked how close a blade actually could shave my face, but my skin would always get irritated no matter what blades I used. These blades however not only gave me a close shave but my skin did not suffer at all. I still prefer the convenience of an electric but if I was going to switch these would be my 1st choice. They also seem to be pretty durable as I have used the same blade 5 times now &amp; it still seems sharp.</li>
    <li> The blade on the Fusion ProGlide is awesome. I got this free cartridge via program run my Gillette. Thank you Gillette! I&#x27;ve just used it once so I can&#x27;t speak in terms of the longevity. I am hoping it will get me through a few weeks before I have to order more. However the performance was excellent. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this razor. It shaves my thick facial hair well and leaves me feeling slicky and smoothe :-)</li>
    <li> I received the razor free as a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the razor for several days now. It seems to do a better job then my older power razor, giving me a cleaner shave and more control over the edges. However, I find all  multi-blade razors to be far superior to electric. I have used electric for years because I don&#x27;t like messing with the water and shaving gel and such in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;As for comparing to other blades, the Gillette does a better than average job and the lubricating strip does make for an easier shave. The edging blade is a nice feature not on all razors, and is better and creating a clean edge than the trimmer on my old power razor.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a good product, and I will continue to use it as I feel it gives me a more professional image, now that I am dealing directly with clients once again.</li>
    <li> The razor was not really what I expected. Pulls on the hairs. Then I have stubble by the end of the day . Blades dull to quick . I am glad I received this razor free through a program ran by Gillette and did not purchase. Not what I expected from this company.</li>
    <li> I (Babetta&#x27;s husband) quit using blades YEARS ago after a major case of razor burn. Since then, for more than a decade, I settled on electric shavers. This is the blade system that&#x27;s bringing me back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the blade via a Gillette review program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the right balance of cutting finesse and comfort, allowing me to shave with a degree of confidence I had long since forgotten. Being able to get it done on one pass is invaluable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked the seamless mounting mechanism: it worked well. Together with handle, it was the perfect combo. I liked the cartridge enough to change my shaving habits and the cost of the cartridges.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the catridges that I got with my Proglide. I recieved this via a program run by Gillette. The blades offer a smooth, soft shave without tugging on your skin. It leaves you feeling and looking fresh.</li>
    <li> The razor provided a nice close shave.  I have sensitive skin, so razor burn is always a concern.  I get nervous about trying different razors, but I received the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette, so I decided to give it a try.  I was very happy with the results, however, I was a little let down with the durability.  The razor did not last nearly as long as other similarly priced razors.  With the wear and tear factor, I would have to think closely about if the price outweighs the durability.</li>
    <li> I got the power blades for free from Gillette included with my power trimmer/styler. To be blunt, there&#x27;s not much you can say about these blades. They look just like Gillette&#x27;s past Fusion blades, they cut easy, there&#x27;s no razor burn left behind, the shave is close and SMOOTH. They are a little pricey as far as replacements, but this is to be expected for a top notch blade that you will get more uses out of than just a cheap disposable. It attaches to the power trimmer and it&#x27;s just the best shave you can get, really. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> As a person with the most sensitive skin, receiving my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge from Gillette was a Godsend.  Not only has my skin been less irritated that normal, but my fiance has enjoyed the smoothness that I have only seen with using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge.  This is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> I received a free Fusion ProGlide Power through a Gillette promotion. Admittedly, I had tried the razor before when I got it as a Christmas gift. But I didn&#x27;t really think much about it. Until recently, I used the Mach3 razor but have recently switched to a safety razor of another brand. However, with the promotion I decided to give the Fusion ProGlide another chance. I used it about three times before I started to make up my mind about the razor itself. In short, it&#x27;s really good. I have a really thick beard and don&#x27;t spend a lot of time shaving since it&#x27;s not worth it. But, I noticed that the shave I got was really close, with relatively little effort. The one knock against this razor is the price of the replacement razors. In my opinion, the razor doesn&#x27;t stay sharp very long. The replacement razors are pretty pricey and given they don&#x27;t last long, I&#x27;m not sure I would continue using the razor over time.</li>
    <li> I normally shave with the buy in bulk razors from the local warehouse store. Thanks to a free sample from Gillette I had the chance to try the Proglide Power razor. I was skeptical at first. I am not a fan of change but am I glad I gave this a try. While the razor blades themselves are a tad expensive - they are well worth it in my opinion. I will definitely be buying more of these razor blades!</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program sponsored by Gillette.  I have to say that this is one of the closest shaves I have ever gotten. I love Gillette and these blades did not disappoint, exactly what I&#x27;ve come to expect from them. I would recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> A free program run by Gillette has given me the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Blades and I cannot seem to find the flaws in them. After several uses, I&#x27;ve come to find that I&#x27;d prefer nothing else, but Gillette&#x27;s ProGlide Styler Blades. They provide for a close edge with the utmost precision. It didn&#x27;t cut me or even leave any razor burn.  I was only left with a clean shave that even took a day or two longer to grow back. In the future, I can&#x27;t see myself buying or using any other blades for styling or shaving.  Gillette has continuously improved their products and exceeded my expectations yet again.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It left my face smooth without the need for multiple strokes, it also left me with very little irritation (razor burn).</li>
    <li> I was always a proponent of the Mach 3 razors and when the fusion originally came out I tried it once and could not justify the price difference.  after getting a free sample from Gillette for the fusion power I again gave it a try and think I am a new convert.  I thought it was such a smooth shave and I had not shaved in several weeks and had no issue.  Even against the grain it just felt so close!  The small single blade on the back was great around my sideburns and did not bother my upper lip the slightest bit (usually a sensitive spot for me).  Great razors and definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this razor in a free program offered by Gillette to review it&#x27;s products. I have been using this product for several years. At first the razor had no equal. in later years, it has become a little less durable. The blades do seem to wear a lot quicker than they did a few years back. Aside from that, honestly they still are the best I have tried. I wish the price was lower. I find the price of these refiles extremely overpriced for the length of time they cut smoothly.  So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - superb results when using newish blades&lt;br /&gt;Cons - high cost and limited lifespan</li>
    <li> I received a free razor and 1 blade free from Gillette and I am glad I did.  I really like the shave I receive from this razor.  I have always decided not to try the expensive razors like this because I figured they probably worked about the same and just cost more.  I am here to say that this one just might be worth the extra cost.  The vibrating razor really takes away the pain of shaving and the handle is very comfortable and makes you really feel in control of the razor.  I am slightly disappointed with how long the blades work, but that may be just the free one they gave for the test.  I am not sure, but I am probably going to buy at least one pack of replacement blades to find out.  The only issue I had with it is that sometimes if I am running late I will shave in the shower and this is not the razor for that.  When there is to much water it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as well.  Overall a great razor though.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge for free from Gillette and it is great because it gives me a close and smooth shave without irritation. No more multiple passes!</li>
    <li> great product best shave I&#x27;ve had in years . my wife loves how soft my face feels and for how long . nice close shave and easy grip handle</li>
    <li> After receiving the razor in a Gillette promo program I tried it out instead of my electric razor. It definitely cuts closer and the shave lasts longer. I can go almost two full days from one shave.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised you do not feel the vibrations but the shave is very smooth. The neck areas seem to be very well done. There is no burning or irritation after either. But since the shave is so smooth I found it easy to cut myself!!! A big negative.&lt;br /&gt;A big positive is that the vibrations make it much easier to clean the razor with no problems. The shave it gives is definitely better than the average razor.</li>
    <li> This was a nice thing for Gillette to do. A free razor program. I just had to review it. I got my razor in the mail, and first used it in the shower. It glided very well right through my shaving cream. The little channels made it so the foam didn&#x27;t pile up as much. the little comb that the blade has was helpful getting through the stubble. Nice, thin blades, super sharp. Very smooth shave, and it was a power razor, so it really was pretty fast. Thanks Gillette...</li>
    <li> I used this Fusion ProGlide Styler from a program run by Gillette. These blades give me a smooth and precise shave. I will never use any other blades for my styler or razor. Gillette is the best brand I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This razor is nice, comfortable, and expensive as all get out. I enjoyed using the razor but when I looked at the price for blades I decided to keep using my double edge safety razor at 4 cents a blade.</li>
    <li> I was provided with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor to try and I was extremely pleased with the results.  Let me start by saying that I have very sensitive skin and cut easily.  I started by not shaving for four days and the ProGlide was easily able to take off the stubble without a single cut to my face.  The ProGlide had my face so smooth that I didn&#x27;t even need to shave the next day, which is something that I haven&#x27;t experienced in a long time.  The vibrations that the battery powered unit appear to almost lift the hairs to cut even closer.  The blade is still functioning as if it were new a couple of weeks after first using it.  In summary, I have nothing negative to say about this razor and will be switching over to this model going forward.</li>
    <li> I am overjoyed at getting this razor through a Gillette program as these are quite simply the best blades I have EVER used.  I have extremely sensitive facial skin.  I can&#x27;t often shave more than once every few days as I get horrible razor bumps and skin irritation.  When I do shave, I often have to use a facial trimmer to shorten the length of my beard to get a close comfortable shave.  This blade has eliminated all of that.  If needed, I am able to shave once a day, and I can often forgo the use of an aftershave.  This blade produces and extremely close and comfortable shave.  If I do get lazy and decide to shave once a week, the sharpness and durability of this blade easily cuts through the longer facial hair and leaves a smooth shave, with less strokes, still leaving me with a less irritated face and a clean smooth shave.  While the blades may cost a bit more than your tradition blades, they last two to three times longer and give a closer more comfortable shave than I have ever experienced.  This razor has ruined me for any other razor as its strength, durability, ease of use and close shave are simply second to none.</li>
    <li> the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does the job really well.  I like that the five blades get you closer than ever.  I love it when a blade shaves clean and saves time too.&lt;br /&gt;the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I have received the Gillette Proglide Power Blades free from a program that was run by Gillette.  I have to start with saying that I have been a faithful Gillette customer since I started shaving.  I have used the same Mach 3 handle and blades for the past 14 years.  The blades I received are starting to make me think it&#x27;s time to move into this century.  I have sensitive skin and the Mach 3 blades have always given me the shave I need without being painful in the process.  These cartridges have a microcomb to lift up hairs and five blades that really allow for a close, comfortable shave without cuts, bumps or razorburn.  I like that I can attach them to my current handle as the handle that came with my trimmer is a little too big to feel comfortable in my hand while simply shaving.  The only reason I would not give these blades 5 stars is again because of the price of the cartridges. I really feel this continues to be a rip off.  Gillette is wonderful in promoting their product and getting free razors out there but they fall short in offering the replacement cartridges at a price that is reasonable for the everyday shaver.</li>
    <li> This is indeed a great shaving system! It provides an extremely close shave and great comfort with the pivoting head. I will never use another razor.</li>
    <li> When I first switched from using a electric razor to a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power that I got for free from Gillette I was pretty skeptical. But after the first shave or two I found it to be a lot smoother on my skin. The thinner blades ended up tugging less on my skin than my electric razor. I usually wait couple of days between shaving and the MicroComb helped direct my hair into the blade so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area again and again like I did with my old electric razor. There&#x27;s also a teal colored lubrication strip that really helps soften the skin and prevent razor bumps. Although I&#x27;ve found that taking a hot shower right before shaving helps too. The pivoting head and blade suspension system took a lot of the work out of shaving against the grain because the razor moved with the shape of my jawline for a closer shave with less strokes. Oh, and don&#x27;t forget about the precision trimmer blade on the other side of the razor that&#x27;s perfect for bringing or leveling the sideburns with one or two quick strokes on each side. Overall. After a month of shaving with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power I have to stay I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I got a Proglide Manual razor free from a program run by Gillette. My hair is thicker and rougher than most. It doesn&#x27;t take long for it to make the blades dull. I did not see any difference between it and their other razor blades. They are all easy to clean and do not clog up so much. Gillette is the only brand that I use. What I don&#x27;t like is the cost of the refills. I can buy a whole new razor for less than what they cost.</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillete customer for years.  I shave once a day in the shower.  The new Proglide was amazing.  It was super smooth and there was no irritation or tugging in tough to shave areas like right under your jawbone.  If it hadn&#x27;t been for a Gillete promo to get me to try the power option, I don&#x27;t think I would have.  Man, am I glad that I did.  I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how the power feature would help a traditional shave.  It is pretty impressive.  The vibration or pulses help the blades sail across my face.  I am a believer.  Gilette has made a long-term customer even happier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even going to bother relaying my experience with these - I&#x27;ll just say it was good, not great.  It hardly matters, though.  $4 per razor blade is absurd.  Razor blades are 10 cent items, for heaven&#x27;s sake.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor via a program run by Gillette. The blade has all the right features - comfort strip and very sharp. Not sure the small comb does anything useful when shaving every day. Also, found the size of the cartridge is a little too large, from bottom to top, when shaving my upper lip. I shave from my lip towards my nose, and I can&#x27;t get all the way up under my nose. Otherwise a perfectly usable blade.</li>
    <li> I received a free Proglide Power blade from Gillette thru a promotional program they are running. Here is the good. I was able to get exceptionally close shave with no irritation. This blade contoured to my face making shaving around my jawline seem effortless. The Bad there was nothing about this razor blade I didn&#x27;t like. I recommend trying one out for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought Gillette products in the past, but I didn&#x27;t really see where they could make it even better.  They have done that.  This razor and the Gillette fusion Proglide Power Cartridges give you a smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate you skin at all.  It left my skin feeling smooth because the shave was so close and my face was soft.  I also used the trimmer and loved it.  It worked wonders on my sideburns and especially the eyebrow hair that grows together in the middle, which I usually ignored.  I recently received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> Received this free razor, via a program run by Gillette. It provides a nice smooth shave. Glides across the skin and no nicks. What more could you ask for from a razor?</li>
    <li> I recently got to try out for free the Gillette Fusion ProGlide power shaver from a program from Gillette. The razor is hands down the best razor I have tried. The power cartridge on the raver shaves my face smoothly without grabbing the hair. In addition, it gives a good close shaving without me having to go back and shave spots again. Its just one time pass and I&#x27;m done. It also made it easy to shave tricky parts of my face like at the corners of my mouth as opposed to other razors. A nice plus is the micro pulses which gives a nice smooth shaving motion and helps with getting a close shave. Definitely recommend this shaver as its going to be my choice now.</li>
    <li> I stopped using razors a long time ago because of skin irritation. Through a program with Gillette, I was provided an opportunity to try the ProGlide for free. So, after reading about the stated upgrades in the razor, I agreed to try shaving my face again. I used the ProGlide a couple days ago and I can say that the new cartridge left my skin with virtually no irritation. I have had no bumps develop and no soreness in my skin so far. During use, I still felt some tug with the first couple strokes and it took several strokes to completely remove the hair. After those strokes, I could really feel the lubricating strips affect on my face and the vibration felt like a mini massage. The blades did tend to clog up frequently, but one BIG plus (for me at least) is the design of the cartridge allowed for quick rinsing to completely clear out the blades. The trimmer blade was quite easy to use on shaping my goatee. It did not fare well with shaving my head though, which is what I normally use a razor on. Found myself going over the same area more times than usual because of the clogging. Overall I like the feeling it left my face with and glad for the chance to try it, for I doubt if I would have just gone out and purchased a power razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette ralors for years and have found this razor to be the best I have used yet. I not sure the vibrating action really does anything but I turn it on every time and I believe it makes it a smoother shave.</li>
    <li> I participated in a free trial campaign ran by the friendly folks at Gillette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with their blades. I&#x27;ve used the fusion/proglide blades in the past but haven&#x27;t tried it with the new power version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be upfront, I&#x27;m not all that fuzzy to begin with. So to state that the powered version works better than the traditional shaver would be a guess at best. Regardless, the blades don&#x27;t disappoint and I&#x27;m very happy with how effective they are compared to the discount drugstore brands.</li>
    <li> GREAT BLADES BUT STILL PRICEY</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor blade from the manufacturer. I get a closer shave than I did using my old razor without any additional irritation. This is important to me because my skin is easily irritated. I only shave every other day, and this blade easily lasts 4 weeks, making up for the slightly high retail price of the blades. It is hard to get too enthusiastic over something that I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy doing, but if I have to shave I&#x27;m glad I have the ProGlide Power blades. Overall I think these are great new razor blades.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide Power as part of a promotion from Gillette for a free razor. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but decided to accept the free razor instead of paying to replace the blades from my old store-brand razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for the first time the other night and boy was that a CLOSE shave! Every other razor that I&#x27;ve ever used has left sharp or noticeable stubble on my face (to the touch). After I shaved with the ProGlide Power, I did the &#x27;touch test&#x27; and my skin was smoother than ever. No visible or touchable trace of stubble at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, granted I did a lose a few extra layers of skin &amp; a few ounces of blood in the process, but I have always experienced that with new razors or blades, so nothing unusual here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trimmer/grooming blade is a fantastic addition! It works so much better than the trimmer/grooming blade on my electric razor every has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still can&#x27;t figure out what the power is for. It makes the razor vibrate but I can&#x27;t tell if that has any real effect on the shave or not.</li>
    <li> I was given the gillette fusion proglide to try and what a great shave.I have been using the Pro Glide for about 1 week now and love this product. I feel the shave is very close and really like extra single blade on the back side for trimming up sideburns. I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with how this razor shaved my face. Really smooth and close shave. You turn it on and the vibration move the razor just right to get that close shave. I have only used it once and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> First off I want to mention that the Power Blades I am reviewing was received free via a program run by Gillette.  Now for the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous \\&quot;power\\&quot; blades and manual blades, and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  I can go multiple days between shaving and have that \\&quot;shaggy\\&quot; look - then use these blades, and with one swipe the stubble is gone!  I don&#x27;t have to go back over the area multiple times like I do with other blades - including those you get in the mail - so I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I love the extra blade on the back of the razor - I use it to make sure I get close to my beard without cutting into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these blades are a bit on the pricey side, but after trying almost everything else out there, these are definitely worth the money - to make sure I have the closest shave I can get!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest; I haven&#x27;t used a conventional razor in a long time.  I stared using an electric shaver years ago, and haven&#x27;t looked back.  So, I was skeptical to try out the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor that was sent to me for free through a program run by Gillette.  I waited until a Monday morning to try the new razor as Monday is my heaviest shave day of the week.  Sometimes I just get lazy on the weekend and by Monday have quite the scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I first noticed was how light the razor was compared to my bulky electric razor.  I lathered up my face, and turned the razor on.  I must say, that it is louder than my electric razor but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother my sleeping beauty in the next room.  I proceeded to shave my entire face with incredible ease.  The blades seems to glide right over my skin and there was very little (if any) pulling of the hairs at all.  Even when shaving \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; it was smooth and comfortable.  If I had one criticism it would be that it was hard to gt a straight edge on my sideburns using this razor.  I still had to take my electric attachment out and clean up my sideburns area.  BUT, the absolute best part of this razor, is that I was able to skip a shaving day the next day.  That&#x27;s right; I got a close enough shave on Monday morning using the new razor that I did not have to shave on Tuesday morning.  Very impressive in my book!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power in a product program from Gillette.  I have often bought Gillette blades in the past and would again after using these.  The lubrication and the obvious way of telling if the razor is still good are wonderful ways to continue shaving in a manner that will make you very presentable and lovable.  I can think of no downside, the razor even cut through my thick beard without pulling or catching.</li>
    <li> I was given the Fusion Proglide Power Blades for free through a promotion run by Gillette. The razor worked for my minor stubble, but the blades were not as sharp as they could have been. The razor worked but I can see myself needing to shave more often due to the dullness of the blade. I think I would have to buy these razors on sale or with a coupon in order to buy them again.</li>
    <li> The soothing micropulses help reduce friction and increase razor glide I barely feel the blade. The thinner, finer edges and advanced low-resistance coating, enable the blades to cut effortlessly through my beard with less tug and pull. The Lubrastrip(tm) is large and infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers, allowing the razor to move smoothly over my face reducing razor burn and discomfort. The Innovative Microcomb helps guide stubble to the blades creating a closer shave and better experience.[[ASIN:B003983I1S Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge 8 Count]]</li>
    <li> I like the extra blade it really provided a close shave but my shave was the same with the power button turned on or off. The whole razor pulsated in my hand and was kind of annoying and made shaving uncomfortable. If I wanted an electric razor id buy an electric razor that can be recharged and plugged in.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample from Gilette and this has got to be the best razor in the market bar none.  It has the ease of a much higher priced electric razor and yet gives you the great shave you expect from a catridge razor (actually even better since the vibration technology actually preps you bristle prior to the shave).  All in all - this is the only razor I need.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide Power Blades through a free program being offered by Gillette. I absolutely love these blades! I have tried almost every brand and kind of blade. The ProGlide blades are as close to perfect as you will get! They give a clean close shave without the nicks and the razor burn. They glide over even the difficult spots on your neck and chin. What a sigh of relief to finally find a blade that DOES what it claims! Great job Gillette!</li>
    <li> NOTE: I did receive a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. That being said, I have purchased the razor blades both prior to and after using the free product. The below review applies to all of the above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things to know beforehand, I despise shaving, I love &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have tried almost every iteration of manual razor out there throughout the years. In the past, I have tried both three and five blade varieties. I have found the five blades have been too many blades and the stubble/shaving cream would clog the small openings, thus I have typically stuck with the three blade models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENTER THE FUSION PROGLIDE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this new product on the shelves and decided to give it a shot. (Yes marketing people love me and it drives my wife nuts :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I was VERY impressed. The shaving experience was quick, clean, and easy. This was also the first five blade product that worked the way it was intended... Closest shave without clogging or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin (especially on my neck) and this blade got close and smooth with no irritation or nicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for fun I tried a couple different types of shaves: daily shaving, skipping a few days, even going a whole week. The PROGLIDE did not disappoint. There was no irritation with daily use and no &#x27;pulling&#x27; feeling with the longer facial hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I am happy to say is my new manual razor of choice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for more than 20 years. I remember back in high school avoiding shaving so my horrible looking &#x27;stasch could come in....and then I remember shaving it for the first time with my fathers generic razor. I remember the redness, the blood....oh the blood...and most of all, I remember that I did it wrong...I shaved against the grain, from my lip UP to my nose. I never did that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days I shave only my neck. I&#x27;m a beard guy. I only shave in the shower, and for the past year or so, I&#x27;ve been using exclusively an online razor club&#x27;s offering. I remember thinking &amp;#34;well these are garbage&amp;#34; when I first used their product. But the price was right ($6/month for 4 cartridges) so I suffered through it. Truth be told, I did acclimate to them. Maybe I grew chain mail on my neck or something but I eventually found them to be an adequate blade. That is, however, until I got my hands (again, for the first time) on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power. Holy smokes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free blade cartridge from Gillette for a promotion, and knew right away that I had found a superior blade. Effortless shaving. Smoother for longer, softer skin, no nicks. The way it&#x27;s supposed to be. I was so pleased with the shave that I was tempted to shave...um...other things. I started with my shoulders. Awesome. The back of my neck. Awesome. Parts lower down... Still awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve incorporated a new strip that feeds the hair in a more consistent manner into the blades, so they cut more evenly. The moisturizer strip is great and has lasted several shaves. The blades are impossibly thin, which makes them glide through my tough beard hair (and other hairs) with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gillette for making my morning routine even more pleasurable.</li>
    <li> Thanks for my free razor provided through the program run by Gillette.  The razors are very sharp.  I actually swipped my face and head only once, with the the vibration off then with the vibration on.  They are both rather excellant. But with the wibration on the blades left a second hand shadow.  Other that the the blades are still amazing.  I would recommend this razor to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use razors because I don&#x27;t usually do the whole \\&quot;clean shaved\\&quot; thing, but because these were being offered for free by Gillette, I figured I&#x27;d give them a whirl. Several smooth, clean shaves later I can honestly say I was impressed. I haven&#x27;t really used blades since the days of the 3 blade razors, and these were still comfortable and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Overall: solid shave.&lt;br /&gt;If there was one thing that I had to nitpick about, it would be that the blades are somewhat difficult to clean, but no more so than any other blades.</li>
    <li> When I used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I was pleased with the initial results. I hate stubble and I have to shave frequently for my work, so when I got this in the mail I ripped it open and tried it that night. The ProGlide was easy to use and left my skin feeling very smooth. Unfortunately I have sensitive skin, so the day after I had irritation even with using after shave and bump stopper. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to all men (and women).</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge through a program run by Gillette.  My grooming needs are minimal, having a short beard and doing no grooming below the neck, so I was skeptical if the Cartridge would provide any benefits over my current razor. After using the Cartridge for multiple cleanups, it is now my go-to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first fear was my coarse facial hair would get stuck in the blades. It didn&#x27;t. The blades felt so sharp that I barely needed shaving cream. It was also easy to get the blades right up to the hairline on the back of my neck and I saw a noticeable reduction in ingrown hairs after switching from my previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Cartridge to anyone that is in need of he best shave of their life.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am impressed with this item.  Since this was a free item for a campaign, I was a bit skeptical.  But it got up close and personal for me.  I do recommend!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it 4.5 because I really think this is great.  Been using for about 2 weeks and I noticed that the shave is much closer and with less irritation than both my 6 month old electric and my mach 5 manual razer. There is really only 2 shortcomings. 1.price.  Refills are half the price of my electric race. That&#x27;s spendy. The other issue I have is the time of takes. This is normal with the manual taking longer than Electric and since I use both this is a down fall. Overall great however. Super close and barely irritated my very sensitive skin. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> First, I have to admit that I got these through a special program from Gillette. I usually use an electric, but wanted to see if this was a better option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these blades worked well when I shaved against the grain, I simply couldn&#x27;t get a really close shave with the grain. This makes me think that perhaps the electric is the right way to go, since I don&#x27;t have to put in as much work and I get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That isn&#x27;t to say that these aren&#x27;t good; they simply didn&#x27;t beat my current option.</li>
    <li> Gillette always provides me a with a smooth,close,comfortable shave. I&#x27;ve upped my ante from Gillette&#x27;s four blades to five blades. Each Gillette Cartridge has much thinner blades for effortless glide and less tug &amp; pull. What I like most is it has an precision trimmer that allows for better access to tricky places like sideburns and under the nose. Its enhanced blades come with anti-clogging rinse slots which helps when your rinsing when your done shaving. Maximum comfort is provided by its Lubrastrip which is larger than most cases but moves smoothly over skin even on repeated skin strokes. These are high quality cartridges that are meant to provide extensive use at maximum comfort. An investment well made in my opinion, \\&quot;You Simply Can&#x27;t Go Wrong With Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor free through a program run by Gillette.  I have to admit I was a little skeptical of a razor with a vibrator on it, seemed gimmicky.  I thought the razor worked overall pretty good.  The handle was a bit more bulky than a \\&quot;normal razor\\&quot; but pretty comfortable and ergonomic.  The real test for me was a dry shave.  Most times I use an electric razor followed up with a blade razor (no shaving cream).  This is where the product really showed that it is different.  Even with a new blade on a normal razor it does grab a bit.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide was markedly smoother.  I&#x27;m not sure how it will do under continued use, but it shows promise.</li>
    <li> I received a new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge through a promotion run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Gillette user in the past with the Mach 3, but also have Schick Xtreme 3 user too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor after not shaving for a few days, this is always a challenge and I end up with sore skin.  The razor was smooth and the vibrating helped massage my skin.  The shave was clean and smooth, no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every razor I have ever used starts off great but the blades diminish quickly.  These are still going strong after over 2 weeks of use.  I thought the power vibration was a gimmick but it helps with a cleaner shave and also soothes skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades rinse off well and keep clean unlike some that keep hairs clogged in them.  This helps with better shaves and keeps the blades in better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed, I will be buying more blades,even though I know they are expensive</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades via a program run by Gillette.  I was a little skeptical at first, because this razor was like no razor that I had ever used.  The large base and handle were unique to me, but I quickly adjusted and am definitely enjoying the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very clean shaves after my time with the new blades and feel like I could actually go 2 days w/o shaving...although I never do because of my job.  The large handle, which initially was a slight turn off, is now one of the things that I like the most about the product.  I feel in good control of the blades and always receive a clean, and quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not used may Gillette razors in the past, but there is a good chance that I am now a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only word of warning; if you are switching from a razor with slightly dull blades, take your time so you do not end up with toilet papers spots on your face.  After my first shave, I may have had a nick or two.</li>
    <li> Used the Gillette Fusion Proglide after receiving it as a promotional program from Gillette.  I have been using the Schick Hyrdro 5 for a few years.  I have shaved 5 times with the Proglide blades and found the shave is very comforting, leaving my face feeling fresh and with a smooth shave.  I like the way the blades are closer together compared to the Hydro, and perhaps what gives it a slight edge.  The only draw back is the price of the cartridges are a considerable amount more then the Hydro 5.  Great product, but too expensive on the cartridges.</li>
    <li> Great cartridges.  I have coarse facial hair and it tends to grow back faster than I would like.  I received these cartridges for free through a program ran by Gillette and could not be happier.  These will replace what I&#x27;m currently using.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best I have ever used/ WOW!!! I cant believe the closeness and the oain free shave.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades are by far the best razor blades I have tried. My experience with the blades was both fast and easy. For starters, the blades latched on to the razor very well, and they felt very secure. I was not worried about the blade slipping off the handle. I normally shave every other day (my hair grows a little slow) so I made sure to wait at least 4 days before trying out the new blade. I had a lot of facial hair to get through so I started with a new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade and some warm water. The very first thing I noticed was how the blade literally glided across my face. No tugging, no pulling, nothing uncomfortable. The shave was so smooth that I was very surprised to find out that in one swipe all my hair was gone. No going back for seconds or thirds; a rare occurrence when shaving. After all my hair was gone (a quick job, I must say) my face felt so smooth and soft, I couldn&#x27;t wait for my wife to feel it. She was also extremely happy with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades. This is the blade I will use from now on. I am SOLD!</li>
    <li> Although this product worked better than off brand razors, it did not work as well as the regular Gillette razor. It seemed to tug and pull more and was not as comfortable. I can only assume this was from it vibrating. I love Gillette products, but this just wasn&#x27;t it for me.</li>
    <li> I received this via a program through Gilette.  Let&#x27;s just say I was less impressed. Using gilette shave cream the blades felt as though they were knicking me.  I&#x27;ve never had this issue using other razors with the same shave cream.  Recently I switched to Shave Soap, and the issue has minimized.  Glad I got it for free, because I wouldn&#x27;t pay for it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion razor from a program ran by Gillette to test and review for free. I must say that the blades are smaller then my other razors which gives me a cleaner and closer shave. I didn&#x27;t get any cut while shaving which is great. Can&#x27;t be going to work with cut all over my face. I also noticed that it lefted my face feeling smooth, not much stumbled lefted behind.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades free via a program run by Gillette. I love these blades. They slice through my beard like a hot knife through butter. I have thick facial hair and even when I have substantial grow out these blades don&#x27;t have a problem. They also don&#x27;t leave me with a rash or razor burn. They work like a charm.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Blades provide a smooth shave every time.the Proglide styler came with the trimmer,three different length comb attachments,and a shave attachment.I was able to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler free via a program run by Gillette.First i trimmed my facial hair down with the smaller attachment. I was surprised by how smooth it glided over my hair.No pulls or tugs.Then i used the shave attachment i experienced the smoothest shave and i usually have shave irritation but i didn&#x27;t with these blades.I would recommend this to every man with facial hair looking for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> i recived this free from gillette to try they worked very well if price was not a factor i would highly recommend them but i would not say the out preform there competitors who are priced a little more reasonably but they did work well</li>
    <li> I loved the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge.  This razor made my skin feel very smooth and easily got rid of the stubbles.  My wife and daughter said my skin felt as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  They loved it!  It was easy to use with the trimmer!  I was able to see the difference and felt that my appearance was enhanced.  I am grateful that Gillette through one of their programs gave me the opportunity to try this product for free.  I will continue to buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> First off, I received the ProGlide styler free from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the proglide manual and power blades. I have to say that The power blades give me a closer shave than the manual ones. Less strokes, so I can get out the door faster in the morning. These cartridges are my go to over any brand I have tried. I&#x27;ve never gotten a closer shave with less strokes before trying this. Since the blades are very thin they help against the tugging which has happened with other types of blades. My face is some much smoother aswell. Overall I love this product and would gladly recomend to anyone who is in need of a better power cartridge!</li>
    <li> This product provides a close and smooth shave - my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up very late!!  The best part - how smooth and silky my skin feels after each use!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received these blades along with the razor through a program run by Gillette to review.  I&#x27;m in the Army and a clean shave is very important.  These blades did the job.  They gave me a smooth, even shave with no nicks or razor burns.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy these.</li>
    <li> I was selected to try the Gillette fusion proglide power cartridge free via a program run by Gillette! The Gillette brand gas always been good with me, but after experiencing these blades, I&#x27;m sold!! The comfort is amazing. I&#x27;ve used other products in the past who claim to be the best, but really leave behind bumps, rashes, cuts and scapes. But with this product, none, I repeat, none of that. I thank Gillette for the opportunity to try this awesome product and recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Gillette had a program going on that ofefred a free razor so thats how I came about giving this awesome product a try! I have the kind of hair that grows right back day after shaving and can be really hard to get close shave on me but Gillette Fusion Pro Glide went above and beyong my expectations giving me a nice close shave,smooth face and no instant re growth of hair next day! The blades didnt dull up afetr few uses they lasted about 4-5 shaves for me and even at the end of use I had no hair feeling like it was being pulled like with some razors I have used in the past.This product may be a little more then what Im used to paying but its well worth it!!</li>
    <li> Best shaving blades I&#x27;ve ever had. Insane. Forget that King of Shaves hype. This is the real deal!</li>
    <li> These blades give a very close comfortable shave. Too bad they&#x27;re quite expensive no matter where you purchase them. I can&#x27;t use cheap blades.</li>
    <li> I have used the Mach 3 since it came out, I never thought I could get a better shave but I was wrong.  Gillette sent me a free razor to try, and I can honestly say the Fusion Pro-Glide Power Razor Is much better. It took less strokes so less time shaving, and the edging blade makes it so much easier to get a nice clean border around my goatee &amp; side burns.  I highly recommend Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Power Razor and I will be using it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver every other day, and have never received shaver burn and always receive a very close shave. My wife love my fresh soft skin!</li>
    <li> Manual and power really make a difference and 3 to 5 blades can show you the power and appearance 2 extra blades can do. Not only does the cartridge have 5 blades, but it has 5 thin blades for the ultimate shaving experience.I received this via a free program run by Gillette. With the Gilette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge I don&#x27;t have to worry about burns or bumps around my neck and face area. I have used it even on my head. One thing I am sure of, after using Proglide Power Cartridge it does leave my face looking refreshed, ultimately smooth, and best of all a very youthful appearance. My wife and daughter LOVE!</li>
    <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power blades for free through a Gillette run program. I normally use a Schick Hydro 5 and I use to love it then I tried this! I get an incredibly close shave with this thin 5 blade razor. I am the kind of guy that has a five o&#x27;clock shadow well before five o&#x27;clock. My girlfriend usually wants me to be clean shaven and complains about my stubble. So I spend a lot of time shaving unless I&#x27;ve gone my beard and mustache out. The moisture strip actually lasts so much longer than my hydro 5. If I accidentally place my Schick razor close to moisture the strip gets all foamy and sloughs off quickly. My Gillette can handle some water without a gross foamy strip the next time I shave. I also like that it glides smoothly without pulling my facial hair whatsoever. Overall I am a satisfied customer and will be switching over to POWER cartridges. (Well worth the price!)</li>
    <li> These razors that I got through a Gillette program work great.  It&#x27;s hard to tell if the razors are what&#x27;s so great or the Gillette Pro Glide 3-in-1 that makes it awesome.  Either way I&#x27;m happy and will be purchasing more in the near future!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Cartridge was provided by a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try these blades since I had use many in the past that left me disappointed. Either the blade dulled too quickly, the shave left me with painful razor burn or I experienced just a painful shave thanks to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;The Gilette Fusion Proglide cartridge was a nice surprise. The shave was close, smooth and seemed as if the shave time was reduced. I experienced no razor burn, no pain and have been using the same blade for 3 weeks. I am happy to report that the blade is still sharp and I am still using it. Another key point is that the razor has not rusted like others have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very happy with the results and this is definitely my favorite blade to use.&lt;br /&gt;In addition there is a trimmer blade on the back of the razor head. This is a great idea by Gilette and works wonderfully. Great for a quick, dry cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this razor 4 stars is due to the cost. These blades do cost a lot more than others so even though they work really well, it is hard to shell out that kind of money for blades.</li>
    <li> These blades were really sharp. I was impressed by the number of blades and the moisturizing strip. Really provides a close shave. These are not like any other&#x27;s I have tried. Doesn&#x27;t tug as much as most. Glides across smoothly. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I am always wary of trying new blades. However, I got these free as part of a promotion by Gillette, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a great close shave, and I had no skin irritation at all! It was great. However, the blades do seem to dull a little quickly which I knocked off a couple stars for. Great product, just wish the blades stayed sharp longer</li>
    <li> Received free razor through a program ran by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend any Gillette product out there. Gillette products are known for great designs. The blade stabilizer helps maintain precise blade spacing for optimal comfort. The 5 blade technology that came out is one of the best I have seen. For the closest shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;The lubrication strip is wider, infused with more lubricants and mineral oil. Varies length of time that blades last on many variables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with the awesome ProGlide Styler 3 in 1 Power Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Its a razor and use it as a trimmer. Plus with three exchangeable combs adapt to the contours of your body to keep length consistent. No pulling or tugging. Hangle is big with good grip. Easy to rinse after use.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite found shaver and trimmer in one. I reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I got this razor as part of a program run by Gillette but man was I proven wrong these blades are the best ones yet. Vey smooth and confortable shave. I have a very sensitive skin and it appreciates a lot the feel of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;They last longer then the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brands I&#x27;ve been using and I have had less razor burn and bumps. I will be buying replacement blades for this. Nicely done Gillette.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blade from a program that Gillette was running. I have to say that I am very pleased with this razor. I have used Gillette razors ever since I began to shave and I think that this is the best one yet. The shave is easy and smooth. It does not tug or pull and has never given me razor burn. It even cuts through four day old stubble without even thinking twice about it. I have been using it for about three weeks now and it is still shaving like it was new out of the box. I also like the fact that the back of the razor is open so I can rinse out the bits of hair that get caught between the blades during the shave. It also has a single blade on the top that can be used for edging. This is pretty handy and does the job without tearing up my face. Overall, this razor produces a very smooth and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that the Fusion Proglide Power blade is the best razor that Gillette has produced to date. I highly recommend trying one.</li>
    <li> i was able to try this product for free by an offer through the gillette company. this razor was able to stand up to the daily ritual of shaving that i put it through. it lasts longer than other brands have. i like the power option, because it seems to give a closer shave than you would get with a manual razor.</li>
    <li> Great blades really close shave and easy to handle. Leave my skin really soft my wife loves it.  The great thing the blades are so close together that can get any hair out just what I need it. I always had problem with shaving blades I have sensitive skin but this work perfect! I got this product complementary from Gillette</li>
    <li> I received this blade through a program run by gillete. The Blade performed very well closely shaving my entire face after a 2 day shaving break to test its strength against a rougher surface since i dont tend to shave on a daily basis in order to save a dollar here and there. It performed nicely with maybe five breaks to clean the buildup. It went through smoothly on my chin and upper lip area which tend to be my more sensitive spots while shaving and i felt no pull or tugging at any of my facial hair while shaving. I give the blade a great review and word of mouth to others that wish to feel a smooth shave with little if no discomfort for sensitive shavers.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best razor I&#x27;ve used to date. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power provides a super close shave on a very serious beard. If you keep the blade clean, it lasts almost a month! Well done Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridges free via a program run by Gillette.)</li>
    <li> I received the blades from Gillette to sample for free. I&#x27;ve been using Mach3 beforehand and I was used to it for years. These blades made me think that it&#x27;s about a time to change to a newer designed blades. The shave is so much closer. It runs smoothly and stays sharp way longer than my old blades.  I didn&#x27;t see any rust during the last 2 months I was using it. I&#x27;ve always loved Gillette  and they didn&#x27;t disappoint me this time as well. It is a bit pricey , but the shave stays longer. So it totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the refills for the Proglide power razor, my face is so smooth everytime I shave. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the price, but I guess you get what you pay for so I&#x27;m happy to pay the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect quality, arrived on time! What more can you ask for!</li>
    <li> If you Google a search on \\&quot;razor blades\\&quot;, it&#x27;s completely dominated by Gillette. That&#x27;s just like our politics or our news, controlled by the elite few. Companies sell you a razor fairly cheaply and then ream you on the replacement blades: at best, $17 for 4 razor blades and $32 for 8. Come on, that&#x27;s absurd. It&#x27;s just like the pharmaceutical companies with their 1000% return on sales. You can buy into it if you want to, just remember to bend over....&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;And when you trust your television&lt;br /&gt;What you get is what you got&lt;br /&gt;Cause when they own the information, oh&lt;br /&gt;They can bend it all they want\\&quot;  John Mayer</li>
    <li> The mark up on blades seems ridiculously high, to me. Other than the price, I like this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect knives for those who shave very often because you don&#x27;t need to pass the knives many times and it feels very smooth when you are shaving.</li>
    <li> I got a fusion razor for Christmas and bought these as replacement blades. They are expensive but I love the razor so, I bought these to keep on shaving.</li>
    <li> electric blades arer a trip! work better than expected</li>
    <li> These are just TOO expensive anywhere!</li>
    <li> Best razors for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best razor blade ever. Bar none. My husband has an electric that he has used for years and one he likes very much. This, however, is his new favorite.</li>
    <li> Good blades. I can use a single blade for at least 10 times and it still sharp</li>
    <li> They work. Good close shave. I could almost go two days between shaves instead of needed another at night.</li>
    <li> very easy to use!!!  Will do it again when needed.</li>
    <li> I love this proglide power. it is just like the ones on local store, just with a better price through amazon. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have to learn to sleep on my back. After shaving with with theFusion Proguide, I can&#x27;t  sleep on either side because my face is so smooth I keep slipping off my pillow.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice shave. No Facial Cuts using these razors!!! I would recommend giving the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor&lt;br /&gt;a try.</li>
    <li> Close, yes but I&#x27;m on my third week and my face is still getting used to this and it burns when I shave. Also it starts to have a lot of friction after five days and is shot in seven (you know when you know you&#x27;ve had your last shave with any blade). I&#x27;m done and I&#x27;ll buy some reasonably priced blades now</li>
    <li> Works with the razor I bought for my husband.  I&#x27;m still trying to&lt;br /&gt;figure out why razor blades are so expensive.  If anyone knows,&lt;br /&gt;please share with me..</li>
    <li> Superior product.  Only blades my husband will use.  He never cuts his face with these blades.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great and i love how it cuts cleanly no SKIN CUTS! easy wash and easily cleaned. Get this for your face!</li>
    <li> I switched to using these cartridges when they first came out when I had to shave every day for work.  I had issues with razor bumps and ingrown hairs, but attributed it to my coarse beard.  I eventually switched to DE wet shaving and haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased these again because I had to travel and didn&#x27;t want to take my whole shaving kit and I thought using these would suffice for an occasional use.  Not so much.  Now that I&#x27;ve learned how to shave based on my facial hair patterns, I haven&#x27;t had an issue with the DE wet shave.  Even following the same routine and pattern, my neck breaks out something fierce after using these.  Best I can tell, the multiple blades actually shave too close and causing my to be more prone to razor bumps and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the best feature of these cartridges is the single trimmer blade on the backside.  That is an awesome feature and the only reason I keep a few lying around for my own use.  The rest I gave to my wife and she loves them for her legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, these are so expensive for the few shaves I get out of each cartridge due to my thick, coarse facial hair.  All in all, not the right product for me</li>
    <li> Since I use this razor, getting a good price for original cartridges is important. The company was quick and the product was exactly as described. I will use them again.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years... Nice and close shave... I let it last longer than recommended with no face rash...</li>
    <li> It works just about like any other razor the price is the best part</li>
    <li> I get an excellent shave with these blades. I use them on vibrate, and they never cut me. A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Best razors I have ever used.  No nicks, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> As advertised - prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Best blade on the market. No other blade gives you a closer shave.</li>
    <li> great razors and a great shave just a bit expensive</li>
    <li> I have used these for years to shave my head. They stay sharp a long time. I use King of Shaves shaving gel with this and it is a smooth experience.</li>
    <li> Great close shave. the blades do not drag and pull while you shave and only require one pass. the blades are very long lasting.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair so I need a razor that can hold up to my tough hair.  Gillette&#x27;s razor give me just that without any irritation.  The moisture strips soothe your skin while you get freshly shaven.  Yes these blades may cost more than the average razor blades, but they&#x27;re worth it.  They&#x27;re the Mercedes of blades!</li>
    <li> the power blade leave a nice clean smooth shave. I have very sensitive skin and these blade are the only ones I have found that don&#x27;t irritate my skin I recommend trying them for your self</li>
    <li> I received my power blades for free through a program gillette ran and couldnt be happier. Smooth shave with no irritation. The extra blade makes all the difference. I didnt think it could get better than gillettes manual razor but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> Great razors for sensitive skin no irritating razor bumps or burns. !!!!! go get you some I got mine thank you Gillett</li>
    <li> There is nothing bad about these blades! I have been using Gillette products for years. These are the best I have ever used. Perfect shave everytime. No nicks, cuts or razor burn. These were free sent to me by Gillette.</li>
    <li> As part of a Gillette trial program, I received a Gillette razor compatible with this blade, and one of this blade. In addition, I bought a pack from my local Walgreens to supplement the one blade that comes with the razor. My first impression of the blade: long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY so long? Only our cheeks could possibly benefit from such a long blade. The rest of our face will only be touched by the center of the blade, granted, when doing some precision trimming, I used a corner of the blade. This problem brings me to another point, since i used the center of the blade for most of my trimming, the blade lasted very little time, in my case, about a week. Coming from using a manual 2-blade that lasted me a month or more, this blade lasts far too short to be practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the largest deterrent for me is the price. For the comfort these blades give in comparison to the 2-blade manuals, I am willing to pay double or even triple the cost, (maybe even quadruple since these feel so much better compared to only two blades,) but $4 each per blade? It seems a little too high, even for this degree of comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second impression: comfort. Compared to two blades that pull and tug all over your skin, five blades seem like heaven. I still have a habit of using the edge of the razor for those precision areas (you know the areas, no need to explain) but overall, the blades do a good job of getting those hairs that always seem to evade the blades, and all without the familiar razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product, but with one too many faults. This time they nailed the comfort and ease section with grace. Maybe next time, Gillette will come out with a product to best them all.</li>
    <li> I was invited to test the Gillette ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette. The ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is Braun-engineered for ultimate maneuverability and effortless, even trimming. The Trimmer comes with three exchangeable combs to adapt to the contours of your face and body. The Trimmer&#x27;s handle is ergonomically designed to maintain grip and control from start to finish. The ProGlide blades are thinner and finer than ordinary razors, which replaces the tug and pull of shaving with an effortless glide. Gillette&#x27;s innovative Microcomb guides hair to the blades for effortless, against the grain closeness, and the precision edged blade creates crisp, defined lines. Gillette has created the #1 Dermatologist recommended razor to give you the smoothest, most comfortable shave ever offered!</li>
    <li> I received the pro glide power trimmer via a program with Gillette. The pro glide power trimmer blades are great! No tug and pull and they are very affordable!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Power blades for free through a program run by Gillette, and I am impressed.  I have been using the standard Gillette Fusion 4 blade razors for a few years, and the Power blades are an even better product.  The shave is smooth and I had virtually no pulling or tugging even when shaving the thickest parts of my beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these razors from a campaign by Gillette, and these razors are great! If you have an electric Gillette razor, these are the ones to get.  They&#x27;re extremely comfortable to use, and you get a very close shave. The only thing is the price. Don&#x27;t be intimidated, you get what you pay for. These razors are very comfortable, and they&#x27;re very durable to last a long time. If you shave a lot, definitely get these!</li>
    <li> At this point in my life I have used almost every method of shaving from standard safety razors to electric to most recently straight edge. These days I sport a beard so my shaving is limited to keeping my upper cheeks and neck clean. Of all the methods I have used for shaving the straight edge is by far the best. This probably is not the best option for everyone and the first time I went this route it was literally a bloody mess (pre -beard days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that bloody experience the idea of a safety razor that vibrates still set my nerves on edge. There is a reason why I check my barber&#x27;s hands before opting for a hot shave, I don&#x27;t want to go out God Father style. I decided to man up and give the Gillette a go. Since I got the razor for free through a Gillette sponsored program, this decision was even easier. As it was I was in a bit of a rush and  the straight edge is not a rush shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was really surprised. I had not shaved in about a week so the hair was longer and coarse. I popped in the batter, lathered up, turned it on, and went for it. The blade cut through the hair with relative ease. It still took a little more tugging than I am used to but not like had it been a standard safety razor. The shave itself was very smooth and I did like that it had a single blade edger on the opposite side so that my lines were crisp and even. This is surprisingly better than a traditional safety razor and I did not loose any control with the vibrating on. Still not as close as a straight edge razor shave but I don&#x27;t think anything is. This is a razor I would definitely use again when time does not allow for my preferred option.</li>
    <li> When I saw that Gillette was running a program to try this out for free, I really wanted to try it out.  I have very thick facial hair and I only use razors now when I want a close shave due to the irration on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested three areas to see how well this razor does work.&lt;br /&gt;1) My beard - Very thick&lt;br /&gt;2) My neck hair under my chin - medium thickness&lt;br /&gt;3) Small sample on my forearm- little to no thickness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard- The Gillette Razor did irrate my skin, but only 5-6 times around my chin only.  Normal razors irrate my skin 15-20 times per shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neck hair - The Gillette Razor worked perfectly.  I felt no irration and all neck hair was removed with one swipe of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My forearm- Very smooth shave with no irration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some reviews that said that the clean up with difficult.  I did not experience this.  With other razors, I would have to put some TLC into cleaning the razor.  I was able to wash the razor for a few seconds and it was clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rated this 4/5 because this razor was not \\&quot;tug-free\\&quot; on my beard (very thick).  However, this razor is much better than it&#x27;s competitors.  I would highly recommend this for anyone with no to medium thickness of facial hair.</li>
    <li> You want skin as smooth as silk? Then you need to shave with Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades.  I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades for free via a program run by GilletteYou will not get a closer shave, with most importantly, not getting the pull of the beard or that makes you winch when going over it.  When shaving an extra long beard, there is not pulling just a smooth glide and clean face in one stroke. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out the new Proglide Power Blades through a program run by Gillette and I have to say I am more than impressed.  I was able to get a clean close shave and not at the expense of quality.  The blades on the ProGlide Styler are awesome and definately worth the money that you pay for the whole system.</li>
    <li> I received one of these to try out through a program run by Gillette.  I have really enjoyed using this blade and it has become my go-to razor.  Very sharp blades provide an extremely close and smooth shave.  I really like the option of using the precision blade on the back to get those hard to reach places.  Looks like amazon is running a $3 off coupon right now, TAKE ADVANTAGE!! These are well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette and now I am done stealing my wife&#x27;s razors.  Those were the only ones that would not give me razor burn.  These things are awesome!  New, life long customer here!</li>
    <li> This was a cut above (sorry for the terrible pun!) any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m 26! Unbelievably close shave... Smooth as silk. Normally I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to razors and shaving but not with this! Love it! Will buy over and over again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit up front that I got my Proglide Power for free via a program run by Gillette. However, I wouldn&#x27;t &#x27;sell my soul&#x27; for a free razor, so this review is my honest opinion. I&#x27;m not the type of guy who jumps on every new product. I&#x27;m more the type of guy who gets in a comfort zone when I have something I like and tend to stick with it. In this case, though, I&#x27;m really glad I tried out this new razor. I had been using an older Gillette product called Mach 3 Turbo and have been very happy with it. This Proglide Power razor blows it away. I was shaving this morning with it for the first time and could barely tell I was even shaving. It was amazingly smooth and clean. They really have put a lot of great features into this product. I recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> I recently tried these out thanks to getting a free one from Gillette. I use ProGlide razors already, but have never tried the Power version. This makes an already great shaving experience even better!</li>
    <li> I used to use a Gilette Sensor razor everyday. It was pretty good.  Then I switched to an electric shaver and used it everyday for about the past 3 years.  When Gillette offered to give me a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to try - I figured sure - I&#x27;ll try it.  Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the money on one since I was happy with my electric, but after the first day - I&#x27;d buy one.  Super smooth 7 hours later!  Faster shave this morning. No irritation at all.  Thanks Gillette for a great new product.</li>
    <li> Received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide in the mail and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  I was hoping for a close shave with a blade that made it easy to shave in those hard to get areas of my face and to my surprise, that&#x27;s what I got.  The smooth shave was noticed by my wife as soon as I walked up and kissed her cheek. Usually I&#x27;ll miss a hard to shave area or not get as close with one part of my face as the other but with this razor, I got a clean even shave that we noticed immediately.  Gillette has made a believer out of me.  I will encourage my son and friends to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I finally got my free Fusion Proglide Razor cartridge through a program from Gillette. I opened the box and took out the razor and was amazed at the new stylish design. I have been an avid Gillette user for as long as I can remember and I have never seen a razor like this. The cartridge looks space aged yet stylish. The five blades feel extremely sharp. I wet my head (yes I shave my head bald)  down, spread on the shave cream and took my first swipe. The cartridge just slid over my head with no tugging or pulling on the hairs. By the time I was donemy head felt as smooth as a babies bottom and no nicks. The conditioning strip left my head feeling smooth and moistureized. I will definitely be keeping this razor as it is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the fusion proglide. Smooth close shave without irritation what could be better than that. Oh yeah, a single blade on the back for those tight spots that&#x27;s what.</li>
    <li> Through programs run by Gillette I&#x27;ve got to try the Fusion Proglide and the Fusion Proglide Styler for free.  I started with the Gillette Sensor I received from Gillette when I turned 18 and was amazed how much better it was than the disposable I had previously used.  When Gillette introduced a new razor I would get it and was constantly amazed at how much better the new razor was over the old razor.  Gillette has out done themselves with the Fusion Proglide blades.  With shaving cream, with just water or even dry these blades provide a great shave without irritating my face.  These are the best blades you can buy.</li>
    <li> These blades are pretty sharp...pun intended.  I received some of these free from a promotion that Gillette was running which is amazing in my mind.  I have never had such a smooth shave in my life.  I think I need to be worried about my wife stealing them for her legs.  She loved how my face felt after using these blades.  They are expensive but seem to last a long time.</li>
    <li> I got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge from Gillette! I absolutly LOVE this razor! It give such a nice smooth shave! With the gentle vibrations makes my hair stand on end which gives me such a nice close shave! My girlfriend is constantly stealing my razor to use on her legs!</li>
    <li> The Gillette name have long been associated with quality razor blades and the Fusion ProGlide Power blades remain true to that name.  The blades utilizes five blade edges to give me one of the closest cut I have gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the free razor with the Fusion ProGlide Power blades in a trial by Gillette.  Like other Gillette blades, this one gave me quite a close shave with its sharp blades.  It was a smooth feel associated with good precision blades and my skin felt refreshed with the lubrication strip on the razor blade.  However, they got dull with subsequent usages which follows through with their concept of blade cartridge renewals.</li>
    <li> I received these blades for free through a program run by Gillette. The razor I normally use is the Fusion ProGlide Power which uses these blades. I have sensitive skin and these blades give me a really close shave without causing irritation. The extra fifth edger blade is great as well for shaping the edges of my beard. The vibrations of the power are excellent for lifting hairs up so I don&#x27;t get razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I received my razors a couple of days via a programm run by Gillete. The next morning I decided to try the blades during my morning shave. I am not gifted with being able to grow a full on lumberjack beard but I do need to shave every day. With other blades I have tried before, my face would get irritated especially on my neck and under my nose, but with Gillete&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide Power blades my skin felt smooth and there was no irritation afterward. I liked the precision edging blade on the back because it allowed me to really reach under my nose to get those hairs that other razors make hard to reach.</li>
    <li> The blades that  were attached to my Gillette Fusion Proglide razor that was provided by a program rub by Gillette were awesome. This blade makes it easy to shave without any tugs or pulls, I did not cut my self with these (most of the time I do when I use other blades) and is great if you shave against the grain. I am totally in love with these blades, once you shave you get super soft skin, I cant feel the hair right after my shave. These blades are a must buy.</li>
    <li> These blades made for a great easy shave that was very comfortable.  I&#x27;m really happy with how my shave looks.  Close shave without hurting my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s account... Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades are terrific, they give a really close shave, very happy.  This razor was provided to me for free by Gillette, will recommend to everyone.  I did my homework for the cost of the replacement blades, a little pricey but worth it in my opinion.  Nothing beats a close shave.</li>
    <li> Three words! best razor ever!! When i received this free razor from a program run by Gillette, i was ecstatic! I love how smooth your face feels after, and how good of a clean cut it leaves! If you are thinking of if to get this product or not, you must get it! It is the best razor i have ever used, it just leaves my face clean and smooth! Definitely get it if your looking for an easy to use razor that leaves a perfect clean cut! The blades are just so slick and wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an on and off user of Gillette razors since I started to shave and I&#x27;ve never been really satisfied with them.  But I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades for free via a program run by Gillette, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have sensitive skin and I always end up with some level of razor burn an after using Gillette razors.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades, however, are a massive improvement on other blades.  Really smooth shave and the razor burn has decreased dramatically since I don&#x27;t have to go over a spot multiple times.  Great blades, would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I received this free blade via a program run by Gillette. This is the perfect way to get that close shave that will not irritate sensitive skin. Proglide power is exactly what you get with these blades. Professional level that glides with ease and provides the power to create a smooth shaving experience. Great work Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor and cartridge via a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve used these in the past and they are by far the best blades I have used. They provide a clean, comfortable shave even when shaving against the grain. I used these everyday in Iraq for almost a year under various water quality and dry, dusty conditions. They performed great and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since. The cartridges last about 3-4 weeks if you dry them with a towel after each shave. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I found these Gillette blades to be super sharp, precise and provide a very smooth shave.  I received that razor/blades free through a Gillette promotion and  would definitely recommend them to anyone considering buying them.  I was extremely satisfied and I&#x27;m not that easy to please.  Gillette has many years of research behind their products and it shows!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for a long time, and the Gillette brand has always been a good choice for quality.  I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette.  I have sensitive skin, and I noticed a great difference post shave - no rough redness as I usually get, and no nicks!  While the effects  of the MicroComb seemed negligible to me, I did find it easier to get at the trickier spots with the re-designed trimmer - I have a trimmed beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several uses, I still have not had any nicks or redness, and the shave has been smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this experience so far, I would definitely recommend the Fusion PROGLIDE for anyone who has to shave regularly, especially if you need to every day.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best ones yet. I received them for free via a program ran by Gillette and let me tell you, they provide a very smooth and comfortable shave. I have very sensitive skin and they feel great on my face. Lasts me about a week per razor shaving everyday.</li>
    <li> I was actually scared to use the power blades at first. Even at my age, late 30&#x27;s, I have sensitive skin and break out from shaving at times. I didnt want to disturb the groove, but the power blades worked great and actually kept my shave lobnger than normal, by a day or so. I could notice the difference in smoothness and also in the lack of irritation. These are my new razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I need to mention that the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. Glad it happened because I may not have tried them otherwise.</li>
    <li> These are the best cartridges for shaving.  If I&#x27;m not using a straight edge razor, I use these as they are the closest to a straight edge shave.  Your skin is smooth after using this cartridge.  I received a free sample through a Gillette program and will be using these from now on.</li>
    <li> These Blades provide a smooth shave when used with the Fusion ProGlide Styler. They will replace my current blades that I will not be using any more. Thank You Gillette for including me in this campagne. I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for several years now and I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for free via a program run by Gillette. I was not expecting to see much of an improvement - what&#x27;s one more blade going to do? I usually shave about once a week and this time I had 8 days of growth - a good test. I was a bit leery when I powered the device - a vibrating blade doesn&#x27;t conjure up pleasant thoughts: Boy was I wrong! It was the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! Wow! It was noticeably faster and smoother than the Mach 3! I would give this a strong recommendation!</li>
    <li> I got to try these blades from a program run by Gillette and was very excited to try them.  I loved them for the first few minutes and they started to clog and it was very hard to unclog. I think for such an advanced Azores, they should clog so quickly.  On a positive side, I did like the the single blade on the reverse side for under the nose and. Hard to get areas.</li>
    <li> Obtained the Gillette fusion proGlide Power Razor as part of a free opportunity from Gillette to test the product. I must say the results of several days of use are great. The blades provide a smooth, clean shave with no nicks or cuts. I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;The storage device is convenient. It is a good idea having a blue light visible to identify the razor is in use.</li>
    <li> Almost as close as when I wet shave.  It is a smooth glide with minimal to no irritation...depends on whether I do a second pass or not.</li>
    <li> I received these blades free via a program run by Gillette. These blades are okay for me but I don&#x27;t think they work as well as my normal brand. I do  however really like the blade on the back.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through a program run by Gillette.  I&#x27;ve always been a great fan of razors as they give you the closest shave.  However, a few years ago I switched to an electric shaver due to the irritation blades caused to my skin.  So, I was a bit reluctant at first to try the Fusion ProGlide at first.  I was delightfully surprised by the smooth glide.  With the vibration, I almost didn&#x27;t even feel the blades.  It felt like a good face massage and a close shave at the same time.  Overall, I am very happy with the experience and am going back to using blades again but this time it the Fusion ProGlide.  Great blend of technologies.</li>
    <li> I was provided a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor via a program run by Gillette. I was finally able to use the cartridge this morning, as I don&#x27;t shave all that often, and wow. My face says \\&quot;Thank You Gillette!\\&quot;. I have pretty thick, coarse hair and I usually have problems around my jawline and around the inset portions of my neck. With this razor i noticed immediately the ability to get both of these spots with ease. The shave is extremely close without the need to go over the same spot multiple times. This obviously created less irritation as well. By far the best blade I&#x27;ve used in some time. I may even start shaving a little more often. I&#x27;m sure my wife would appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion pro glide razor as a promotion from Gillette.I was skeptical at first but once I tried the new blades I was delighted! Shaved with ease and left my face the softest I have ever felt. I had everyone in my house touching my face to feel how soft it was. My fiance was very happy with the results! My new favorite blades are these. I was excited to try the new razor, I never used a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor. After using it once I was hooked. I knew this was my new razor of choice. My face was super soft! I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it was. Best shave I have ever experienced! Love the blades so much I threw out the other razor i have been using for years. This is my knew razor of choice.</li>
    <li> I just love this cartridge.  It is smooth on your face, and it just glides across even the heaviest of stubble.  It also helps reach the tough spots to!  I received this free to try from Gillette and am so glad I did!</li>
    <li> I love how smooth my face is after using these blades they make my face feel great. I will never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Received a free Fusion ProGlide Power razor from Gillette.  Had been seeing these \\&quot;power\\&quot; razors for years but never tried one.  Honestly the idea of the vibrating blades kind of freaked me out.  But I gave it a try, and I will say it was one of the smoothest shaves ever!  Left my skin feel smooth and soft without irritation at all!.  The only thing that i didn&#x27;t really like was the feeling of the vibration in my hand, but I&#x27;m sure with time I will get used to it and won&#x27;t notice.</li>
    <li> Why does this razor vibrate? The blades are sharp and cut well without the vibration. I do not see or feel any difference after shaving with the vibrator on compared to off.</li>
    <li> I own two razors, one for home and other for travel. Several months back I purchased the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for home use. I used the new razor for about two weeks before I had to travel again. The first morning in the hotel, I shaved using the old razor with a fresh blade and instantly noticed that I was not getting as nice of a shave as I did with the Proglide. Up to this point, I thought the old razor was great. My recommendation is, buy the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power with one blade, use it for a week or so and then go back to your old razor. There is no doubt that you will notice the difference and will make the switch. Take the challenge.</li>
    <li> I love the improvement that this blade hase over the Mach3 blades.  This blade provides the closest shave I can get without using a straight razor and the addition of the single edger blade on the back i very helpful.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free blade from Gillette through a promotion, but I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades since they were first introduced, which is longer than I can remember.  These blades always produce a smooth and comfortable shave, even when shaving against the grain.  They also tend to last quite a while, and I only find myself needing to change blades every month or so.  Probably the best part is their interchangeability to fit both a traditional razor handle as well as connect to the Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am someone who hates to shave, because of the irritation factor, if I shave it is typically at a barber. I recently received a free razor from a program run by Gillette and had yet to use it. So I figured I&#x27;d try it out with one of the Powerglide cartridges. It was a really nice shave. No pull during the shave and no irritation after. I am not going to say this will lead me to shave more often, but if I do it is a solid blade and will be my go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note, I am a runner and had terrible shin splints this week and needed to KT Tape my leg - I used the ProGlide cartridges (only needed 1) I did use the Proglide Styler first to trim down the hair and had no irritation. I am not planning to shave my legs ever again, but this did the trick if you ever find yourself in the same boat.</li>
    <li> This free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.  As a long time user of Gillette razors, I have my opinions!  I started out using the Mach3 (3 blade) razor which I thought was ok.  One day, I accidently purchased the Mach3 Turbo.  I discovered they were a significant improvement over the regular Mach3 (could it be the lubrication strip?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this made me wonder if there was an even a better product out there and encouraged me to purchase the manual Gillette Fusion (5 blade) razor.  I was very disappointed.  It had a lot of drag to it which made for an uncomfortable shave.  It seemed like this may have been because the blades were too close together but who knows - I just know it didn&#x27;t feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw that Gillette had a new Fusion Proglide Power razor, I was a little skeptical but I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  After the first shave - I was sold!  I had the most comfortable shave I had EVER experienced!  I know is sounds strange but the vibration of the power made it such that I couldn&#x27;t even FEEL the razor doing it&#x27;s thing.  Now THAT&#x27;S a shaving success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned the power off and it was a very noticeable difference.  I could feel the &#x27;pull&#x27; as is it cut my whiskers (this was still way better than the Mach3 Turbo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned the power back on and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....it just slides across my face like a VERY sharp razor should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close and comfortable - I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I received the razor through a free program run by Gillette.  The cartridge on this razor has extra blades and a strip to facilitate a smoother shave.  It provides the smoothness of a regular blade (with extra concentration) along with the power of an electric razor.  I felt like I was getting a super-close and smooth shave with every use.  Now my only concern is sustainment of the refill blades - seems pricey.</li>
    <li> The Gillette fusion proglide power cartridge stands tall when compared to shaving tools from other brand names. Shaving with the power cartridge is smooth as silk. It is an exhilarating experience.Hats off to the Gillette team. The power cartridge is another success story. Too good.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razor blades for a while now and I recently received a sample of the power razor. Its definitely a plus if you are looking for a close shave with less irritation. Besides the price of the blades, it is a great product that fits in the man&#x27;s grooming collection.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a two weeks now. I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide as a free trial through the company. I was immediately impressed with how light it was, how efficient it was, and how close the shave was. After using it for several weeks now I find the blade is long lasting and hasn&#x27;t lost its sharpness. I am very excited about this because I shave twice a day and not having to buy as many blades is a good thought!</li>
    <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and usually end up with irritation and a not so close shave. But with these Gillette blades, I have a super close shave and absolutely No irritation at all!! All my other razors have been thrown out and replaced with Gillette Fusion ProGlide! This knocks all other blades clear out of the water!</li>
    <li> This blade cuts effortlessly even through the toughest parts of my beard. It gives an excellent close shave with no irritation. It is effortless and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I tried it.  My thanks to Gillette&#x27;s promotional program that gave me the product to review.</li>
    <li> The shave is amazing. I used to use these blades for the longest time until it became a financial burden. They are the best of the best in my opinion. But I recently received a free razor and cartridge from a program run by Gillette and it brought back memories of why I used to buy these and use this blade. I don&#x27;t shave often, maybe once or twice a week since my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow as much. So I my cartridge last me a while. I know that might be a problem with people who have to shave every day or those who have really thick facial hair, but for me, its not a problem. But when it does come time to buy new blades, they price kills it. Its the best shave, smooth, clean and very precise (as I like up my beard), but its costly. But if you can afford it and want an amazing shave, definitely use these. I absolutely love the smooth feeling after shaving with these blades.</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade for free as part of a program run by Gillette.  I was so hopeful to try this new razor.  Unfortunately, it did what all 4 and 5 blade razor blades do to me,,,, leave me red and bumpy.  I was really hoping to not have that happen this time.  Thanks anyways for the opportunity.</li>
    <li> So when I recieved the Fusion Proglide Power cartridge from Gillette I looked at the vibrating battery powered razor, with it&#x27;s MicroComb as little more than a gimmick. Yet at the first downward stroke I knew this wasn&#x27;t like other razor blades. It felt like it was gliding over my face. I have to admit the Fusion Proglide Power cartridge was giving me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten, no knicks, cuts or razor burn.  If the cartridges weren&#x27;t so expensive I&#x27;d definitely switch razor brands and use the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power cartridge exclusively.</li>
    <li> I received the blade as a free sample from a program run by Gillette.  It was a very smooth shave and only required minimal strokes, though a few areas along the jawline required a couple extra passes to get a good shave.  It was very smooth and I had no irritation from the shave.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I am getting a great shave with these blades.  These blades will be part of my grooming collection from now on.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades for free through a program run by Gillette.  I really liked the closeness of the shave but the handle of the razor is just too big and thick to be manageable.  I would much prefer a slimmer handle with all other aspects the same.</li>
    <li> My free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving. There is no significant drag on my skin and the blades don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as most razors I&#x27;ve tried. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received this free via a program run by Gillette. This is the best razor I&#x27;ve used. It gives a smooth shave without all the irritation. Will continue to use for as long as possible.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide Power Blades for free through a program by Gillette.  The blades exceeded my expectations.  They were fantastic.  I loved that the blades fit so seamlessly with the trimmer.  This gave the extra dimension of vibration to the shave and trim.  The blades were precise and sharp.  I was hooked after the first trim and shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I own.  It&#x27;s gets a real close shave and it&#x27;s very smooth.  This is all I use now and will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of an electric razor, but want the closeness of a  blade razor now with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor I have both. It has cut my shaving time in half. I received this from Gillette to try out and I love it.</li>
    <li> To begin I got to try this product for free with a program run by Gillette. I have to say I like the blades better then the trimmer. It glides smoothly and I haven&#x27;t gotten razor burn. I still have to go over it about 2 times but I don&#x27;t think there is a razor out there where you don&#x27;t have to do that. The only con I have is the price for the replacement blades. A lot of times you can get a new razor which usually comes with an extra blade for really cheap if you watch the sales. I would recomend doing that then buying a pack of replacement cartridges which can run you about 20$. Guys keep this away from your girlfriends though. They will use it and will not give it back. My girlfriend said this is the best razor she has ever used! I actually perfer the manual one. I don&#x27;t get why it needs to vibrate.</li>
    <li> Love this version of the razor... Very clean shave.  Along with the vibrating handle, the thin blades give a really close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> The ProGlide Power Blades are working wonders on my face right now. I received a free sample from Gillette and have to say I&#x27;m probably going to replace my Fusion with this blade, as it is so much smoother cut that doesn&#x27;t irritate the heck out of my skin every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to have the opportunity to test out the Gillette Fusion Power Razor.  I have tried various Gillette razors in the past and had issues with having to re-shave. I have a very thick beard that requires me to shave sometimes twice a day. With the Gillette Fusion Power razor because of the agitating blade, I get a close shave each time. It provides the close shave I need and thus not having to re-shave later each day.  I also found the trimmer to be helpful in shaving my side burns and  the area above my lip.  I will be using the Gillette Fusion Power razor daily and also recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I received the fusion pro glide free from a program Gillette was running. These are the best blades I have ever used. Out of the box they give an excellent shave and is noticeable closer. The blades seam to stay sharp after many shaves.  The only down side is that the blades are expensive.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide blade is by far the best blade I have used. This blade lasts a long time. It gives me a smooth, close, clean shave. It also doesn&#x27;t slip and knick either. It also has a handy trimming blade that is use every day.</li>
    <li> Love the Blades It shaves nice and close.. and the single edge blade is great for edges and keeps a nice strait line..</li>
    <li> This razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The shaver is effortless to use. The powerglide does all the work. I received this as a promotion from Gillete, but I would definitely buy one, had I not. very close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> After trying the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Razor I received free from a promotion from Gillette, I can say it does an awesome job at a close shave yet still does great at keeping the skin soft and free from endless nicks and cuts.  The handle has a real manly feel to it and not a cheep flimsy feel.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and he is extremely picky about the blades he uses.  He can honestly say that this blade gives him the most comfortable shave he has ever had!  No razor burn, no bumps, no nicks.  It is great!&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is easy and the blades seem to last a long time which a plus because of the one major draw back and the only reason he didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars...the refills are incredibly expensive!  But if one cartridge lasts a month it may be worth the additional cost.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> This was the 1st time trying the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power (given by Gillette as free sample). The good: I am very prone to razor bumps on my neck and I saw a significant improvement when using this razor. Also love the trimming razor on back side for sideburns. The bad: not terrible, but did not love the vibration from \\&quot;power\\&quot; but can get used to it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this razor, it didn&#x27;t leave any bumps on my neck or face and I didn&#x27;t accidentally have any nicks or cuts because of it either. It seemed to have the right amount of blades, and with proper shaving cream was an overall great shave.</li>
    <li> I received these razor blades for free via a program run by Gillette. That being said there are the best razors ever. I thought the standard 5 blade cartridge provided me with the best Razor blade shaving experience I have ever tried UNTIL I tried the Power version my opinion these are closest, most comfortable blades available today. These blades are very good and last me 3 weeks with a thick beard. I shave my beard and also my head and my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor (which I received courtesy of Gillette) and I love it!  Very close shave - better than any other!  I love it.....</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Blades via a program run by Gillette.  These blades provide an extremely close shave that lasts much longer than with any other razor or blades.  The other benefit that this blade provides is the speed at which it is able to cut through the hair.  Even when I have allowed my beard to grow to a fuller length these blades make easy work of the job.  Having mentioned that the daily work is a breeze by comparison and makes a once dreaded morning job easy.  If there is one drawback to the five close blades is that at times it does get clogged and requires it to be cleaned thoroughly before moving on to finishing the job.  Overall, this is a great blade that does an amazing job of shaving and keeping my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I do think the powerglide I sampled from Gillette is a good shave, but I personally prefer a manual razor. This is a handy product because its power, but I still think I&#x27;ve gotten a better shave from my manual razors. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it is a good close shave. I had a little pulling. Honestly, if you&#x27;re into the powered line, you&#x27;ll enjoy this product. I&#x27;m just \\&quot;old school\\&quot; and do everything the \\&quot;hard way.\\&quot; However, I&#x27;m thankful for the sample and I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a few friends who also like powered razors.</li>
    <li> Got a free razor from Gillete!  It worked awesome and made shaving a breeze.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  It works great in the shower and offers a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was very happy when I got this product in the mail free of charge from a trial program run by Gillette, and used these blades. Areas that are usually too sensitive to get close (the top lip, or the chin)were painless. With most blades I have to give my face a once over, and then go back against the grain. With these blades it was effortless. They were also easy to rinse clean. Guys all know how irritating it can be to hold the razor under water a million times when you&#x27;re in a hurry. This made shaving a breeze. I didn&#x27;t get much benefit from the precision blade on the flip-side of the cartridge, but it was easy enough to detail with the face of the blades. I will definitely be making this my new go to razor.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. There is a lot of diagrams and pictures and claims but I have been pretty impressed so far with these blades! After 3 weeks of use, I am mostly impressed with how long they have stayed sharp and how long the lubrastrip has lasted. They have given a close shave without irritating my sensitive skin. The \\&quot;extra blade\\&quot; trimmer allows me to get real close to edge and leaves a nice sharp line.</li>
    <li> ! recently received free razor was provided by Gillette, for a test run, to see how it feels compared to what I had been using... One word... Amazing! Now, I&#x27;m not saying that just because it was free, I say that because of how well it works, so well that you don&#x27;t even feel it. Sure, I&#x27;ve seen the commercials, and like many, are always skeptical about the claims they make, but this time, they got it right. The feel of the blades is smooth, you only have to go over a part of your face once, and it&#x27;s smooth. The trimming blades makes it easy to to trim sideburns, and the very hard spot below your nose that I sometimes nick with other razor blades. Not only that, but I find that after shaving on the morning, the shave is so close, I&#x27;m still smooth before I go to sleep, and even the next morning after. So the blades will last much longer, because you use it less. Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I was provided a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer with Power Blades by the company and asked to write a review. First let me start with I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, past military with a mustache and goatee. I&#x27;ve almost always used twin blade disposable razors. I&#x27;ve tried the occasional triple blade and that has normally resulted in needing band aids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was it is a bit fancy and the I&#x27;ve seen less scary grilles in a Mad Max Movie than the 5 blades in this. It comes in a very large (and a bit wasteful) plastic box but it fits the hand well and doesn&#x27;t try to slip even when wet. I was not sure the purpose of using the trimmer motor while shaving would add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised! The shave was extremely smooth and close. In two weeks I never had a single nick. At the end of my test I thought I should try a bad case scenario: a few days without shaving, and no shaving cream just a little soap. At first it was pulling a little bit but I turned on the trimmer motor and it was smooth cutting again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative I can come up with is with my Jack Elam eyebrow I have to shave the bridge of my nose so I can have two eyebrows. With it&#x27;s 5 blades it is very large for that kind of work but it can work if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
    <li> I received a new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge through a promotion run by Gillette.  I have been a huge fan of the Gillette Mach 3 razor, and why mess with something that isn&#x27;t broken.  And I&#x27;m cheap and didn&#x27;t feel like spending money on a new razor!  I was hesitant to use the product even after I go it because I still had my old reliable Mach 3, but finally broke down and used it last Monday morning to start off my work week.  Not only was I impressed with the shave, I was blown away!  That is not normal for me.... I have fairly course facial  hair and typically have some areas that are rougher than I would like, but not with this blade!  No need to shave in 19 different directions either!  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  Gillette has gotten me to bite on a new product.  Guess the old trusty Mach 3 is going into the old bathroom drawer for emergency use only!</li>
    <li> i got these blades free via a program run by Gillette and i must say  these are the best blades you can get, if you want a close shave that gets the job done on the first run thru then this is it,you wont find any better glades then this</li>
    <li> I recieved the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge as part of program run by Gillette. I must say that after owning several Gillette products, I was a bit disappointed in the cartridges.  I did not expect them to dull out so quickly, where as others have lasted alot longer.  I think they have the right idea, but might need to tweak the makeup of the blade.  I felt like in atte&#x3D;mpting to get a close shave, i was left with razor burn afterwards.  Not something I look forward to in the mornings!</li>
    <li> I have always been a Mach 3 guy from the age of 18. I am very conditioned to the exact location of the blades since I only shave around my beard so this razor, although similar, took me a few shaves to get used to. The blade quality was very good, the power is a nice feature, although I am not sure how much it actually helps, but it makes me feel like it does. I would recommend this razor to someone looking for a sharp blade and close shave.</li>
    <li> I got this free provided via a program run by Gillette. The end result for me using this razor was a smooth shave without the harsh tugging and pulling I have experienced with other razors. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have used an electric razor for years for the ease of use and not having to worry about nicks in the morning.  However, I recently had the opportunity to try the Proglide Power razor through a Gillette promotion and was actually quite impressed with it.  It not only gave me a smoother shave than my electric unit but I didn&#x27;t have any nicks with it either.  I could really notice the difference if I used my electric razor first and then found how much more I could remove with the Proglide after.  As such, my face remained smoother longer.  My only concern is related to the ongoing cost of the replacement blades running about $10 a month and wish those weren&#x27;t priced so high.</li>
    <li> I was recently provided with a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler from Gillette and figured I would give it a chance and see how it stacked up against my current shave. After only using it 1 time, I could tell this was a superior shave compared to my current razor. The ProGlide Power blades gave me a close shave and left my skin feeling smooth. My significant other even remarked at how close the shave felt compared to my normal appearance. I am definitely a believer and will be using the ProGlide Styler from now on!</li>
    <li> This long lasting close shaving blade is my new favorite razor. the shave is unparalleled and stays sharper longer then my old blade.. For someone who has to shave daily this is a God send.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me the fusion proglide power blades to use as a trial. When combined with the fusion proglide styler, I could create any style I could think of. The trimmer was great for cleaning up messy facial hair and the blades left my face feeling smooth afterwards. There was very little drag on my face because of the five blades and the single blade was awesome for my sideburns. Overall, the product as a whole was incredible and without the power blades it wouldn&#x27;t be complete.</li>
    <li> This razor is better than it&#x27;s predecessors.  I received a free razor to try out through the Gillette program.  I got to admit the razor is better than most razors I have used.  I definitely like these razors because they are easy to clean and it seems like a product that would last.  It is definitely easier to clean than the older Gillette razors.  My qualm always with the Gillette razors is the price point.  cartridge are a bit expensive, but I guess it is expensive because the product last long.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler with Power Blades for free from a program run by Gillette, and I&#x27;ll never go back to regular razor blades again.  My shave is closer and much easier and quicker to execute.  Although they are more expensive, they will last longer and work better.  It&#x27;s an easy decision from here on out.</li>
    <li> *the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette* I love Gillette products and this blade has to be the best so far. I typically get razor bumps, difficulty getting a close shave when I use another brand but this blade did not disappoint. I get a close clean shave with no nicks or bumps. my skin felt hydrated and the blade would glide smoothly thanks to the added lubricant. I had the best shave in a long time thanks tonghe Fusion Proglide blades.</li>
    <li> I recieved this the cartridge as a free trial from Gillette.  I currently use the Fusion Power so my review is a based on the comparison between the two.  I felt that the Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge was a slight improvement but noticable.  I noticed that it did glide across my face a bit smoother and it did clean out better than the Fusion Power.  I can&#x27;t really give it any cons.  As with all the Gillette cartridge replacements it fits on the previous model&#x27;s handles. When it&#x27;s time to purchase new refills i will buy the Fusion ProGlide Power.</li>
    <li> I received these free through a program run by Gillette. I normally use Gillette products for shaving so I knew these would work well. I got a close shave and no nicks. Great product.</li>
    <li> First off, I received free ProGlide Power Blades via a promotion from Gillette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I usually have issues with cuts from previous blades but so far, I haven&#x27;t had any with these blades. They don&#x27;t pull too hard on my skin and truly \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; across my face. I&#x27;ve used previous Gillette razors but I have to say that these are the best I&#x27;ve used so far. I&#x27;ve also had some issues with razor burn in the past, but none with these razors so far. All in all, I&#x27;m thankful for the free razors from Gillette and will be sure to purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free to review through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going on about it so much that my wife is sick of hearing it!&lt;br /&gt;So let me tell you; this razor glides SMOOTHLY, no tugging or pulling and it gives me the closest shave that I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time from a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found my new razor. Thanks, Gillette Proglide.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge Free through a program ran by Gillette. Was impressed with the product. The cartridge shaves really closely, easy to rinse and keep shaving. I have coarse hair and rinsing the hair out is a good thing. The cartridge stays sharp even after multiple shaves. Enjoy shaving with this cartridge. Will continue to purchase more from here on out.</li>
    <li> Received these cartridges as part of a free trial from Gillette, along with the Gillette Pro Glide Razor.  The five blades provided a very close smooth shave.  The gel strip ensured a nice clean , no cuts or nicks, result.  But the issue with these cartridges is the price.  The blades did appear to dull quickly. I feel that one can get a better deal and just as good a shave with disposable 3 blade cartridges for less than half the price.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from a Mach 3 turbo to the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor after receiving a free trial from Gillette and am quite satisfied with the results.  I shave my head and face every 2-3 days and the blades appear to handle 3-4 shaves.  If you&#x27;re only using it on your face I would believe these would last quite a bit longer!  While the price is a bit high, it is worth it for me with the amount of use these blades get and I definitely have not looked back since making the switch!</li>
    <li> I use these cartridges with my Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Styler, and the Power cartridges are a must!  The microcomb helps \\&quot;guide\\&quot; stubble to blades and leaves me with a much cleaner shave. Definitely recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these razor cartridges for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> The best blades ive ever used on my face. So good even my wife swipes them! No razor burn or bumps smooth shave. Great price.</li>
    <li> I love Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades because it gets close to the skin without me having to worry about getting cut. The blades provide a smooth finish and keeps me wanting to keep my five o&#x27;clock shadow under control. Gillette fusion blades do the trick every time especially since I shave more than once a day. They are easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them cutting off too much or to little. I got this product for free through a program that was held by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out this product via a free trial program run by Gillette. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridges don&#x27;t seem much different from other blades just by their specs and look, but I can attest that these blades are actually the best shave a man can get. I used this product on my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler and they worked amazingly. I was able to get a perfect, smooth shave on the first try without any nicks or scratches. I love the way my face feels after using this product. After trying these blades, I know that I&#x27;ll never switch brands ever again.</li>
    <li> I received the blades with my free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.  I love the Proglide blades.  They provide me a really close shave with no razor bumps.  I don&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream.  They are easy to get into those hard to reach places.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette that my wife signed me up for I got to try these for free, and was very pleased. I&#x27;ll start by admitting that my facial hair grows very fast, and due to having to be at work early I should honestly shave again in the afternoon. Thanks to these blades the problem isn&#x27;t nearly as bad, and I don&#x27;t feel like I look scruffy halfway through my work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is nice and close and lasts longer than it normally does, plus I have less irritation and nicks than I had before. The moisture strip is really good, my wife even commented that my face felt softer. Yes, it does get less great as the blades dull, but really, that happens with every razor. Then again, with my thick hair I probably have to change out more often than other already.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have tried by far!  This razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette. In all honesty, there is simply no comparison to these blades if you are looking for a soft clean shave without effort!</li>
    <li> It seems like Gillette comes out with a new version of their razors every year or so, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if anything is really being improved. Fortunately I had the chance to try this razor out through a program that was run by Gillette and noticed a major change in how well it shaved and how little it irritated my skin. My big problem area is under my chin on my neck and right along the jawline. All the other cartridges I&#x27;ve used have left me with knicks and this feeling of stubble I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. When I used this new blade, I didn&#x27;t have any of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also does a great job shaving all the hairs in one pass without the need to go over the same spot again and again.  Also there is no tugging feeling when shaving certain areas; the blade cuts cleanly through the hair in one pass and isn&#x27;t pulling at the follicle.  All in all I would recommend this blade over previous versions released by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge from a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. No pulling what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;Before this I was using a razor with 2 blades. 5 blades make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;A little getting used to such a larger cartridge than my 2 blade, but the pay off is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable, very efficient shave.</li>
    <li> I received this free from from Gillette for a review and I have to say that this is a great product for trimming and keeping your beard in check.  Also I used it to trim my side burns and the back of my head when I shave my head...great product and easy to use.  Highly recommended by me and I have lots of hair to trim...everywhere and this is the tool for that.</li>
    <li> After receiving the ProGlide Power cartridge via a program run by Gillette, I have to say that I am now a convert to the Gillette brand. The razor blade gave me the closest, most comfortable shave that I have ever had. The blades left my skin soft and smooth for days rather than for just one day or even hours with other brand razors. I would highly recommend trying these blades, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> These are easily one of the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used for shaving. What&#x27;s even better is I got these for free from Gillette through a promotion they were running. These blades have next to no pull or drag while shaving. I sometimes shave my head and even for that there&#x27;s next to pull or drag. And while shaving my head I also noticed there was very minimal razor burn or bumps where with other blades my whole head was red. The only downside was the precision trimmer, I&#x27;d like it to be just a little bit sharper and more aggressive. Amazing blades overall.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! These razors were very dull.  I really think I got a set of knock offs.  They barely lasted 1 week!</li>
    <li> These are replacement cartridges for an excellent razor. The only question I have is: Why so ridiculously expensive? (This question is meant for the manufacturer of the product - not Amazon, whose price is competitive.)</li>
    <li> I received the fusion proglide power razors free from a program provided by gillette and I have to say with my thick beard and sensitive skin the proglide styler blades really shaved my face smooth and i didn&#x27;t break out with a rash. I did nick myself a few times but it was minor.  I think this product is a hit! I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> These blades are incredible. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. After my first shave (and every subsequent one thereafter) I had this wonderful fresh tingling feeling. I also was left with the smoothest shave I had yet (in my entire life). These blade slice through your facial hair with such precision, that you can barely feel the blade and only the vibration created by the handle. 5 stars... I would never use anything else!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades were provided to me&lt;br /&gt;free via a program run by Gillette. they are great. gave me a nice clean smooth shave no bumps or nicks</li>
    <li> After careful use of this product and multiple inspections, it proves to be the best on the market. This product produces what is says, POWER!</li>
    <li> I received my powered shaver through a free program run by Gillette.  Having been a Gillette customer for years, and currently using the Fusion, i had an idea for the most part of what i was getting into.&lt;br /&gt;  Before i never really believed that vibrating blades would make that much of a difference when shaving with a razor.  I was wrong, the difference between shaving with the Proglide power cartridge and the regular fusion cartridge is almost night and day.  I found myself not having to make as many passes, especially in areas that normally give me trouble.  The vibration is a little awkward at first when combined with the normal shaving movement but i overcame it very quickly.  I definitely recommend getting this especially if you are already a user of a fusion shaver.</li>
    <li> These may be insanely expensive, but they&#x27;re top quality. They don&#x27;t cut unless undue pressure forces the razor against the skin (especially if your skin is unacceptably dry, or you&#x27;re in a hurry and aren&#x27;t careful. Under normal shaving circumstances (warm, wet, lubricated skin, from shaving gel, lotion, or what have you), and using a reasonable amount of pressure, these simply slice away the unwanted hair, and do so effortlessly, smoothly, and without irritation (and I have VERY sensitive skin). The space in between the blades does clog up with hair, quite badly, if you wait a long time to shave and have longer growth (3-5mm+ of hair really clogs things up badly, especially if your hair isn&#x27;t extremely fine [read:thin]), so unless you have time to waste unclogging it after every full stroke, shave often enough to keep the stubble under 3mm long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real issue with these is the frustratingly short life of the blades...they dull incredibly quickly, considering the cost. These are premium-priced cartridges, and rightly so. But with this sort of cost, one would expect better durability. They should sell them at a far deeper discount in larger quantities (think 64-pack for $99.99), if they want to keep their customers happy, and resistant to switching to less expensive options. We want the best results, but we want good value if we&#x27;re willing to purchase in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum things up, the shaving results of these blades is unparallelled, but the durability is abysmal. Only the top 1% of this planet&#x27;s population can afford these things. But if you can, do; you won&#x27;t regret anything other than the excessive cost!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fushion ProGlide Prostyler with Power-Cartridges and I must say I was really surprised by the gadgets that came with the trimmer, but most of all the cartridges. With the razor I got a nice close shave. I&#x27;m a bic type of person to just get a cheap razor, shave and out the door I go, but that always ends in disaster because I end up nicking myself a bout a bazillion times - I&#x27;ve never really spent money on a higher quality razor because I didn&#x27;t think it was worth it and having a family I&#x27;m kind of tight on money, but now that I&#x27;ve been given the chance through Bzzagent - I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;ve wasted money on cheap $1 pack single blade bics that cut me to pieces when I could have gotten me a razor system like this that actually gives me great results for a longer period of time. I feel it doesn&#x27;t miss spots and I don&#x27;t get cut and the moisture strip does a good job at gliding with my shave gel. Id say this is well worth the price and I&#x27;m now not going to complain about the price even though I think they could be a tad bit cheaper I&#x27;m a new customer of Gillette&#x27;s razors.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a special program run by Gillette I was able to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades for FREE!  The combination of the 5 blade cartridge and the power feature make it seem like your razor is cutting through your stubble like a hot knife through butter.  Other products would leave my face looking like I had chicken pox with all the blood spots, however, the ProGlide Power Blades leave my face saying, \\&quot;Thank You.\\&quot;  There is no reason to purchase any other brand razor blades ever again.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  I received these blades free via a program run by Gillette and I was genuinely surprised by the functionality of the gillette proglide power blades. It was the most comfortable and closest shave I have had outside of a Barbershop.  The blades also work well for that delicate grooming m!en do to look great top to bottom</li>
    <li> This could be one of the best shaves at home I have had in a long time.The blades seemed to hug my face a little closer than other brands.I was able to try these for free do to a promotion by Gillette. I enjoyed this shave. I will be purchasing these from now on.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure up front I received the Proglide Razor as a free trial from Gillette. Also, I have been using the product already for about 8 months before that. With that out of the way I am/was very impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very sensitive face. The true test of a good razor is if it irritates my neck area and causes those red bumps everywhere.  This is one of the first razors I have used that does not do that at all. I typically do not shave everyday and regardless how long between shaves I do not have to put any additional effort to get a clean shave. Usually one or two passes will get it close and smooth. They are a bit more than other heads, but well worth the extra dollar or two you will spend. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I recently got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blade through a program with Gillette. The Fusion Proglide Power Blades have given me the closest and easiest shave I&#x27;ve had in a while. As someone with thick dark hair it drives me crazy my I have just shaved and my wife isn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;ve shaved at all. This time it was very clear, and it was super easy to do. I could power through with long strokes like I&#x27;ve never been able to really do. My hair is generally too thick. Maybe I won&#x27;t have to be so envious of the baby faced men who shave once a week and look better shaved than me.</li>
    <li> Great, smooth,comfortable. I have a heavy beard and this razor glides with ease. It is sensitive and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power since the first time I started using it and I&#x27;ve got it free from a Gillette promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really gives a closer shave compared to my older Gillette cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually get good results with one pass of the blades and it works well on my thick fast growing facial hair.</li>
    <li> The Proglide power razor is a solid razor to say the least. Close shave, no irritation, and no cuts. It works for me and i&#x27;ll be using it again for sure. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got these recently through a promotion from Gillette, though I&#x27;ve used them before. I&#x27;m in the military, so shaving my face is a must, and having a comfortable close shave is important. Gillette really outdid themselves when they came out with these. These are the best blades to ever have touched my face. I love that they last as long as they do as well. Use after use, I get zero irritation and a nice, close shave. Granted, I&#x27;m no Grizzly Adams, but my point still stands. This is the highlander of razor blades. Like my review title says, Last blade ever.</li>
    <li> These blades are great. They get super close to your face and give you a nice clean shave. The blades are a little pricey but if you can afford them they are for sure worth it.</li>
    <li> This are exelent blades, and last alot, depending on your shaving habits.you can us any were.ask my girl she loves them two</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive this razor through a program run by Gillette and have not been disappointed.  I can honestly say I will not be returning to buy drug store brand disposable razor.  This blade is so smooth and I felt such a huge difference as it glided over my skin.  There was not one cut to be seen, and my skin felt refreshed and cool afterwards and not irritated at all.  Using this razor actually makes me look forward to my morning shaving routine!</li>
    <li> I usually use an electric shaver mostly to same time and less messy in the morning but I also use razors from time to time and usually a disposable from a famous pen company. But through a program run by Gillette I was able to get myself a Fusion Proglide for free to try out.&lt;br /&gt;Well the shave was clean and neat and extremely close with these blades in the cartridge. I liked the feel of the handle in my hand and it&#x27;s balance was very good as well as its weight and size.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a splendid shave but as with inkjet printers and the ink cost, razor catridges are not inexpensive and that would be the one caveat I offer concerning this razor and the blade cartridges. So if you are willing to pay this is a great shaving razor/blade</li>
    <li> I received this cartridge free as a program through Gillette. These cartridges are just the Cats Meow, the Bees Knees. Very Crisp. Clean shave, very close as well, leaving very little stubble behind, if any. And it&#x27;s so delicate at the same time that it doesn&#x27;t cut my skin one bit! Definitely a product to Try!!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable blades! Have used dollar shave club and there is no comparison to Gillette&#x27;s comfort and ease. No need to worry about shaving irritation or rash. Having sensitive skin this is a really great product for men.</li>
    <li> 5 blade razor from Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler cartridges make for a very close and smooth shave.  Swivel head makes for easy control of the blades.  Will buy in the future.</li>
    <li> All I&#x27;ve got to say is Wow!  Some time ago, I had a Gillette fusion razor that was powered. At the time, I thought  was the best thing since sliced bread.  It seems they&#x27;ve worked their magic again can came up with a better blade system.  The proglide power blades, mounted to the 3 in one tool, produced an extremely smooth, effortless shave.  This was after several days of not shaving, and it did not clog, easily being rinsed in water.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  The only downside I saw was that the cost of the blades. I did receive this product free from a Gillette program.</li>
    <li> The Gillette fusion proglide power blades shave very smooth, quick and easily.  It&#x27;s very nice when you can get all the facial hair you are trying to shave in one pass.  The one blade on the back of the cartridge is very helpful for making straight lines for things such as sideburns.  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the blades.</li>
    <li> The free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor given to me by Gillette works great. It has the sharpest blades, much sharper than my Mach turbo, and delivers a fast and smooth shave with no pulling.  This is especially important as I have a curly beard which can cause ingrown hairs.  The lubrastrip works great.&lt;br /&gt;  Perhaps the cartridges does not need to articulate so much as I have no problem getting into all the nooks and crannies on my face.  The cartridges are more expensive than any other of Gillette&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I found the razors themselves to be pretty smooth and close. And with the lubricating strip I avoided razor burn completley. And I got it free from a gillette sponsored program.</li>
    <li> Gillette makes great razor blades. They may be expensive, but they last a long time and give a good shave. I use Gillette razors regularly, but was given this one for free from Gillette promotion. It was great, essentially free money since I use this product anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money and length of time I can use these razors, I think it is still a better deal than the razor clubs.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Blades as part of a program run by Gillette. I was excited because I&#x27;ve tried a million and one razors before and most left my skin a little dry and caused quite a few pimples to come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue with this razor is more that it&#x27;s too good. My shave was so close that when the hair started growing back - aka just stubble - it hurt my girlfriend. I tend not to shave every day which means that it could be annoying while the hair grows if it continues to be so coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, the razor is amazing. Easy, simple, and does a great job.</li>
    <li> After receiving a free razor from a promotion Gillette offered I gave these blades a try. Blades give a great close shave, so good I don&#x27;t have to worry about a shadow at 5pm.</li>
    <li> I just received the Gillete Fusion proglide razor this weekend.  It provided such a smooth shave.  Usually I have to trim my beard if I let it go a week before shaving.  This weekend I just shaved with this razor after 7 days of facial hair growth.  It was smooth and I had no irritation or hair pulling.  I would definately recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> They are a bit pricey but wow do they work. I shave every few days so I need a blade that can handle some scruff. These blades glide through my facial forest!! Even on my upper lip there is not any tugging or pulling, which with other blades this is very painful. Just be careful with the trimmer blade on the back it can be bad news if your get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received mine through a free campaign from Gillette but I will be buying these.</li>
    <li> i received this razor via bzzagent.com As part of a promotion from Gillette. the power trimmer is on par with other electric trimmers i have purchased in the past, which says a lot considering it is slimmer and holds only on battery. i had not shaved in a few weeks and for me the best use would be for trimming my beard down and outlining how i want to design it, the blades are not very sharp so do not expect the power trimmer to give you barbershop type of definition, but it is good for its ourpose. the proglide blade is maybe the best i have tried, it cuts clean and precise and you do not have to go over an area more than once. its actually got it all and for the first time in a long time i did not have any cuts and scrapes from shaving. it does just as the name says, it glides over your face. i would recommend the blade to anyone looking for a good smooth shave</li>
    <li> As part of a promotion from Gillette I received a free razor.  I know it&#x27;ll sound like that clouded my review but honestly, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have sensitive skin and no matter what I try (all those new razors with 5-6 blades, the lubricating strips, etc.) I always end up bleeding or at minimum with my neck very red, bumpy and on fire.  Not so with this razor.  I&#x27;m able to get an incredibly close, clean shave with minimal effort and no irritation. Normally I&#x27;ll have to wait a couple days or so between shaves or else my skin is just too sensitive for a shave, with these blades I&#x27;m able to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor pivots so it follows the contours of your face really well without having to pull and stretch your face to get all those different curves.  I&#x27;m not really certain what the power bit does, I guess the vibration must perk up the hairs to get that extra close shave?  Whatever it is it works.  The precision edging blade is a really nice bonus for getting those extremely difficult little areas like right under the nose and for edging the sideburn area nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly smooth, close, irritation free shave, wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge was nice to try but i found it pulled on my skin when I use it with a cold face. When I use a warm cloth to warm my skin up it seem to work better and it got a closer shave then Razors that I tried before.I did appreciate get this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades though a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I had recived this gillette fusion razor as a gift form the gillette company to try thier product. The gillette fusion proglide power razor is simply best razor on the market. The blades are amazing. ANd the power aspect make a very close shave. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a month and its still very sharp.</li>
    <li> Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor gives the smoothest and closest shave ever. I would Highly recommend this Razor to everyone. I received this Razor Free via through a program run By Gillette.</li>
    <li> The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power has worked great.  I have fully transitioned from my old traditional non power blade to this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Smooth shave that leaves my skin feeling great.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I just received a free razor by Gillette and I want to review the Fusion Proglide Power cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge has five (5) blades which is pretty impressive.  It seems to be wider than other razors I have tried which I like as well. I don&#x27;t have to take as many strokes to finish shaving. The finished product (my shave) is VERY smooth.  Better than many blades I have used.  I didn&#x27;t think that the five blades made much of a difference though as I had to go over some areas (my neck) more than once to remove all the hair.  I also found that my hair, like all other blades clogs up in the blades.  There was a blade back in the 90&#x27;s that had a button you pushed to remove the hair between the blades and I wish razors still had that option.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would still buy this blade as it did do a very good job of getting right down to my skin and it has been  about 7 hours now and I don&#x27;t have a shadow yet.&lt;br /&gt;I also think that the blade, like all others is way overpriced.</li>
    <li> I shave my entire head several times a week, so I need a razor that can stand up to the test.  The Proglide Fusion Power gets it done - and keeps it comfortable.</li>
    <li> What a great razor. At first the high price scared me and I wondered if it was worth it. I am sorry I held off. Gillette sent me a free one to try and I can henestly say I was shocked at how well it works. I get a really close shave with no irritation. If you are holding off- take the plunge. It is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor from a program run by Gillette. What a great item, very convenient to use, I have never before used actual blades, first time shaving with a razor that has blades and  did not have any cuts. Very easy to use, would be a great addition to carry when travelling.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from a Gillette sponsored program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the blade a few times, and comparing it to my normal razor I found ProGlide is not just a product name. The blade seemed to glide, with no tugging sensation at all, even on 2 days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was left afterwards with a very smooth shave, and no nicks or burning feeling that I&#x27;ve had with some other blades.</li>
    <li> Just to make it clear I received one blade free from Gillette as a trial and was asked to be honest with my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t shave with a blade because I get ingrown hairs easily and haven&#x27;t found many blades other than the first use to be worth it. I have now had 4 shaves on the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power blade and I have not yet had any ingrown hairs. It shaves smoothly and effortlessly, which is tough on my very coarse bear hair. I did receive a very smooth shave far smoother than my old standby electric and better than most other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** The negatives (the reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5)&lt;br /&gt;I have always thought the lubricating strip to be a gimmick and on this \\&quot;5 week\\&quot; blade the lubricating strip is already wearing on shave 4. I don&#x27;t really think that they do anything anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Price- OMG! $30+ for 8 blades! I know they are suppose to last 5 weeks (which I don&#x27;t know yet but doubt),however that is a lot of money to spend on 8 blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason for the 4 star rating is I am actually amazed that I was able to get 4 shaves out of these blades with out getting ingrown hairs, as I would with any other blade that I have tried. Can&#x27;t wait to see how long these will last.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades.  They were provided to me free of charge via a program run by Gillette.  I expected the blades to work well initially, but what really surprised me was that they CONTINUED to work well even on my most abundant stubble.  Normally all the blades that I have tried before generally dull pretty quickly with just everyday wear...but not these.  These blades certainly cost more than some others, but than I found them to last much longer than any other blades that I have tried....and I have tried quite a few in my time.  Overall, these are my go-to blades right now.</li>
    <li> I received this blade as part of a promotion from Gillette along with the powered handle.  This is just a review for the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade cuts close enough as any blade and slides easily.  The strip along the top I never found very useful as I use my own shaving cream.  I haven&#x27;t found any issues with irritation if I shave with the grain of my hair.</li>
    <li> I received these blades for free via a program run by Gillette, and I am very happy. These are most certainly the best blades I&#x27;ve used. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve gone through a good selection of competing products. I find these, coupled with the Fusion ProGlide Power handle (which I&#x27;ll review separately) to be the best combination for me. Use them with a good quality Shave Gel or Cream (I like Zirh or Anthony for Men). The main blades result in a very close, very smooth shave with minimal irritation, and the single blade on the back is great for cleaning up sideburns or under the nose. The only downside? If you get careless and cut yourself, you&#x27;ll end up with more than one injury due to the amount of blades!</li>
    <li> I really like how it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you are shaving when you use these blades.  I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to make a switch.</li>
    <li> cant believe i got this product for free to try from gillette. blades do NOT tug nor pull at your beard! the give you a clean close to the face shave!!! AMAZING! only blades i will forever use!</li>
    <li> This razor was made for the man who may be tough and rugged but need extra special attention for that sensitive skin. I tried this razor free via a program run by Gillette. Ease of use, no upset skin, and very precise. Would recommend to any one looking for razor</li>
    <li> I received this razor free via a program run by Gillette and I really like it. The blades are good and sharp for a close shave. I can get several shaves out of each blade before it starts to dull. They aren&#x27;t cheap though! The power feature on the razor vibrates the blades while you shave which kinda feels like a massage. I would recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> Just in time for the Rangers to get knocked out of the playoffs, Gillette offered me a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power. So I had no excuses I had to shave. I have been using the Quatro for years always getting a close shave, but always having issues with the blades clogging and them losing their cutting ability quickly. No such issues with the Proglide. Cut close, didn&#x27;t clog and because of that I was actually done faster. Face feels good! So glad I took them up on their offer. No more Quatro, hello Gillette.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor out due to a program that Gillette was running. I loved the blades on this razor. These blades offer a great close shave with barely in razor burn. These are well worth the money and I promise you you will want to invest in these.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades are amazing. They stay sharp much longer than other blades and are great for sensitive skin. They give a close shave and make it easy to shave everyday even for extremely thick coarse hair. They reduce cuts, bleeding and redness tremendously. The blades slide over my face smoothly and quickly and I only need half the time to shave then with other products. I can recommend this razor to either men or women</li>
    <li> Being that I have extremely sensitive skin, I have to be cautious about which razors I use on my face.  I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge through a program run by Gillette so that I may try it out and give my opinion. I could not be happier with this razor!!! I love the 5 blades on the front and the single blade on the back for edging and sideburns.  The 5 blades on the front are extremely smooth and the do not irritate my skin.  The only downside I see to this is replacing the cartridge in the future, as they are about twice as expensive as the competitor, but they last an extremely long time so I&#x27;ll be replacing them less often.  All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin and is trying to find a new razor to deal with it.</li>
    <li> I received these blades for free through a program run by Gillette. Most of my razors have had 3 blades in them for about 10 years I figured that using a razor with 5 blades would be a welcome change, and so, I gave it a shot. I typically shave once a week, and this razor worked wonderfully on the first shot!Most of my 3 blade razors usually clog out pretty quickly, but I didn&#x27;t have that issue at all with this one. 5 blades really are better than 3.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really love the different options this set gives you.  Whether you want a trim, completely clean shaven or just a little touch up, it doesn&#x27;t matter because it can handle it extremely well.  So, do buy this product and trust me when I say you will enjoy it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette ProGlide Power Blades as a part of a program provided by Gillette.  I was somewhat skeptical as to how well the Power Blade would work, but after using I&#x27;m solidly impressed as to the ease and quality of shave these blades provide.  I have a beard and I shave the lower part of my neck.  I do this to keep a more neat appearance, these Power Blades gave me a very close smooth shave.  I recommend to anyone thinking of switching to give this product a shot.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve mentioned in another review for this product, this review was happy to accept a free razor from the Gillette company. The razor is light, ultra thin and feels great going against the grain. I have sensitive skin and I could just about get a clean, close shave without even using any gel (not sayin I should or would, but I could). This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
    <li> Gillette provided me with a free test unit and I am glad they did. I get a nice clean shave, no irritation, and without any hassle. I would recommend this product for people with sensitive skin like mine and also for those who need a quick option for shaving.</li>
    <li> Through a program run by Gillette, I was able to get my hands on free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades.  I tried them for the first time this morning and man was it a nice, smooth shave.  No tugging, no pulling, and my face was silky smooth afterwards.  The only issue I saw was with the razor using a battery and electricity, I felt I had to be very careful not to drop it in the water.  Not sure if this was warranted or not but better safe than sorry.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power free in a program run by Gillette. I thought that the blades rinsed out very nicely. There was little to no hair left between the blades when rinsed. I had a little drag when I hit the thicker patches of hair, but If I took shorter strokes it got much better. I would recommend these blades to others!</li>
    <li> These blades were provided to me free from Gillette, in order to combat my heartiest of beards and retain order on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll focus solely upon the blades of the blades, and boy, are they thin. When I first started out with my shave, I quickly realized that my man-sized beard was too much for these blades to handle. I&#x27;d already shaven off most of the length, but the stubble left behind was much too think and/or long for the thinness of the blades. Clogging quickly became a problem with each stroke, as the 5 blades weren&#x27;t designed for the sheer quantity of hair they were up against. I took the power trimmer to my face and razed it all to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day or so later when fresh hair began to grow in, I gave this product another try. Wow, was I amazed! When up against a clean kept face, the Fusion Proglide shows its true colors. The pivotable head graced along each and every curve, destroying all hair which stood in it&#x27;s path. The lubricant strip was a very nice touch, as it made the process a delight. The five blades cut through my stubble with ease and did not present such severe clogging issues as my lengthier scruff did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even notice it at first, but there is a solitary precision blade on top of the head. My mind was blown! I started zapping lone hairs left and right before graduating to lines and trim. Quite a nice feature to add; it did not go unappreciated by this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are excellent for the regular shaver. If you&#x27;re more of a lumberjack though, you may want to pick-up blades which aren&#x27;t so thinly spaced, and/or a hand axe for better manual shaving.</li>
    <li> I normally have to shave daily and this is no longer true with the new Gillette Fusion it give me a good clean cut that last and I don&#x27;t get the stubble that I use to get from other razors. I really appreciate the opportunity from Gillette to be a part of this program where they sent me a free Fusion to try and I am really impressed.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Blades as a promotion program by Gillette.  These blades are the best ones manufactured by Gillette to-date.  They are super smooth and leave me with a comfortable shave.  I have sensitive skin and these blades definitely cut close leaving my skin feeling soft and cool.  I have recommended these blades to my friends.  Way to go Gillette!!</li>
    <li> I got my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades through a program run by Gillette. With my sensitive skin I was very satisfied with the smooth shave. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get a completely clean shave but not this balde! The overall experience was very good. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a loyal consumer of this product. I have to shave on a daily basis for work. I&#x27;ve tried several razors for several reasons, but I never get the results that this razor provides. Because of my experiences, I stick with this razor, and have even kept to purchasing other Gillette products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion since it first came out and I generally love it. I love the close shave and I love that you use the back to get a close edge on sideburns. I&#x27;ve seen the ProGlide Power for awhile now and was reluctant to spend additional money for a new razor and after trying it, I can understand why. Generally, I can&#x27;t understand what the vibrating function does to enhance the overall shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it&#x27;s still a great razor and the new model feels a bit lighter, which, for what it&#x27;s worth, is something. I&#x27;ll remain a Gillette Fusion user until someone shows me something better. I&#x27;m not sure adding the Power is necessary. Still, overall a great razor. I want to thank Gillette for sending me one for free to try.</li>
    <li> have used my ProGlide Razor for five days and was I ever surprised.  Everything that Gillette says about this razor is true.  The handle felt good when holding it.  They way it glided on the skin I could tell this would be the razor for me.  Other shavers I have used in the past gave me the shave I wanted but------I was always nicking my face.  The Proglide did not nick me even one time.  From now on this is the razor for me.  I would tell anyone that had an imperfect skin to try ProGlide and see for yourself what I am talking about.  Since I do not have any body hair I did not use the other features.  I want to thank Gillette for choosing me to use this razor so that I would become a believer. I bought a tube of Fusion shaving cream and that made the shave even more better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one con that I noticed.  Gillette should make it easier to get into the box that holds the ProGlide.  It took me at least twenty minutes to finally open the box,  After prying open with a screw driver and scissors I got inside.  I found out that there was scotch tape down each side in which I could not see.  Maybe instructions on the box would be of help.</li>
    <li> This was provided to me by Gillette. I love the actual trimmer but the blades that come with it are lacking, for the first couple of shaves they where ok but after that they where dull. The lubricating strips don&#x27;t lubricate long maybe 2-3 shaves at the most. These blades are expensive so you would think they would last longer then that. Sadly disappointed.....</li>
    <li> Great product. I received the product free through a program Gillette. I haven&#x27;t used anything but an electric razor for years so I didn&#x27;t want to pay for a product that I wouldn&#x27;t like. But the proglide razor is really nice. It gets a close shave and leaves your face real smooth that lasts. Definitely better than an electric razor for sure.</li>
    <li> Tried the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on a mutli-day growth before shower.  Great shave!  The five blades did not pull or cause any problems.  The MicroComb seemed to help in getting all the spots on the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the +1 Precision Trimmer Blade. Sideburns cut sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this razor and buy the blades.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to participate in a program run by Gillette to try out their Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge. I was a little skeptical at first knowing that in the past I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between the expensive (gillette) razors and the cheap (disposable generic) ones. So I proceeded with my normal routine of prep and then on to the big moment.....At first I didn&#x27;t like the vibrating cause I couldn&#x27;t hear the razor cutting the hair. (which normally tells me I am getting a good shave) I was running a behind this particular morning so I had to shave in a hurry, and man it did a great job with one pass, so basically cutting my shave time in half. By far the closest shave I have had in a while with no bleeding. The only negative thing I would say is the cost to refill the blades....$20 bucks for four blades. Now that hurts, ouch! Unless the blades can last a month per blade this is very unkind to the family budget.</li>
    <li> The first couple of shaves were smooth and close. It only took a couple of shave before the blades started to drag. For the cost of 4 or 5 cheaper blades I can get a lot more shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve almost always been a Gillette user, but I hadn&#x27;t had the chance to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades until they sent me a free razor as part of a Gillette-run program. In comparison to my usual blades, I felt that the ProGlide Power cartridge provided me with an even smoother shave, and the blades seemed to stand up better of multiple shaves meaning longer cartridge life. I have somewhat sensitive skin and found my skin less irritated compared to usual razors.</li>
    <li> I typically shave with [[ASIN:B001F51QQG Gillette GoodNews! Regular Disposable Razor, 12-Count (Pack of 3)]] which provides a good shave at a reasonable price. Gillette provided a sample for me to try out and I did like the shave it provided, but for the price I don&#x27;t think they last long enough to cover the extra expense for these cartridges. If they were the same price I would definitely take these over the disposables.</li>
    <li> This is a great product the shave is so smooth and the hair never clogs in the razor. It left my face feeling great and I shaved my whole face in what seemed like seconds. I received the (product&#x27;s name) for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I tested the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor that I got for FREE via a program run by Gillette. To be fair I alternated between my Gillette Sensor 3 with a new blade cartridge and the Proglide. I must confess, the Proglide gave a closer shave with less effort. Normally I have to go over my chin several times to eliminate the stubble. With the Proglide 2 passes gave me a clean shave. The rest of my face only required 1 pass with the razor. I tried it with and without the power. I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in the closeness of the shave and really didn&#x27;t like the vibrations. I prefer to use it with the power off. My only complaint is the cost of the cartridges. The cheapest I have found them is about $4 a piece. That is almost double what I am paying now for the Sensor 3. I&#x27;ll continue using it daily to see how long the blade lasts. If I get more use out of it than the Sensor 3, it may balance out.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor along with some cartridges in the mail the other day. Gillette was kind enough to send me the product through a program they&#x27;re running. I love the brand and have used Gillette razors forever (plus I&#x27;m a Pats season ticket holder - Gillette Stadium rocks!), but I&#x27;ve always thought of the \\&quot;power razor\\&quot; line as a bit gimmicky for my taste. I mean, how much better of a shave can you get by adding a battery, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am proud to eat my words, and would wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone. The razor was incredible! I let my beard grow out for 4 days in order to really put it through its paces. The ProGlide Power, which vibrates like an electric razor when you turn it on, took it all off smoothly and painlessly. Also, my wife LOVED how soft my face ended up! It almost felt like I had just come back from an old-timey barbershop, the shave was so close and smooth. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to unpowered razors again. Thanks, Gillette!</li>
    <li> I have mostly used electric razors. The first few times I used manual razors I did not have a great experience. I broke out all over my face, had terrible razor burn, and as a result found that my skin was just too sensitive for using a manual razor. After trying a combination of shaving gels and lotions to the best aftershave for my skin it was just not working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for years I have used an electric razor. I decided to give the Fusion Proglide a chance once I received it through a free program through Gillette. I must say this is a must have for anyone looking to make the switch, or looking to find the best shaving option for sensitive skin. Along with the Proglide handle this product has given me the closest shave I have every had and without the irritation that manual razors normally give me.</li>
    <li> I have been a user of the regular fusion blades for a long time. I got to try the power proglide through a gilette promotion and honestly was pretty impressed. I never thought the power would be worth it but it definitely adds to the ease of shaving on those lethargic monday mornings. the large handle is also nice and i am surprised how durable the whole product feels. overall great experience and still a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> As part of a program run by Gillette, I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler complimentary.  This 3-in-1 tool came with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor blade attachment that made shaving very easy.  The ProGlide Power blades (all 5!) were very comfortable and provided a very close shave - even better than other premium razor blades.  I&#x27;ve always used Gillette Mach3 blades, but I plan to switch to Gillette ProGlide blades for their overall performance.</li>
    <li> I love these razors.  They are so comfortable and gentle on your face.  I was a bit skeptical about the vibration and using it, but it was a lot better than I expected.  I will definitely get these again.</li>
    <li> I really didnt like the razor at all. it didnt give me a nice clean shave. I had to go over the same spot atleast 2 to 3 times. I ended up having razor burn.</li>
    <li> I am a big user of electric shavers. However, once in a while I use a non-electric for shaving. Mainly during short trips or when I want a very close shave. Gillete provided these product for free as part of their own campaign and I have been using it for the last two weeks for a total of 6 times now. so far so good as the blades continue to perform as they did during my first shave. I am mainly impressed by the fact that my skin is not as irritated as it usually gets, the durability of the blades and the close-shave that I am able to get when I use this product. Overall I am very happy with it. I think the only thing I am not very happy with is the price but at the same time I can see why they are priced where they are as the blades are superior than most and very durable. A great product that does what it is supposed to very well.</li>
    <li> Received theGillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge free provided via a program run by Gillette. Decided to try it out. The cartridge was very sharp and held out throughout the entire shave to leave me with a very smooth shave. I dont like to shave all the time so it was a week before i did and the blade was able to cut through my thick stubble and not one knick or cut. I recommend trying this blade at least once you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  I got this razor as a promo from Gillette to try and it is smooth.  No razor burn, because I do have sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t feel the normal tugging of the facial hair as the blade cuts through when using cheap disposable shavers or even expensive shavers.  It&#x27;s a smooth, effortless shave without any pain.  I guess the MicroCombs help guide the facial hair and the super thin blades are extremely sharp for a clean cut.  I like the precision trimmer on top of the back side of the shaver; helps in trimming my side burns.  There is one thing I didn&#x27;t really understand when it came to functionality is the vibration.  I don&#x27;t know if it was to massage your face as you shave.  It felt a bit uneasy.  Used it on one side of the face and the other without and personally, I liked it better without.  The vibration works great to clean off the blade in water, but not on the face... for me that is.  Overall, great shave and I&#x27;m sticking with this razor.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I like these razors. I received the Fusion ProGlide Power free through a program from Gillette. I had previously been using the original Fusion. I like this razor better. I find the moisture strip to work better. When my stubble is short, I find I don&#x27;t have to use lotion before shaving and still don&#x27;t have razor burn after. I definatly will be buying refills for this and recommend the razor to anoyone.</li>
    <li> I received the blades as part of a promotion along with a handle. I did notice a slightly smoother shave with less irritation on my neck. I usually get a razor burn on my neck even with shaving in the shower with a shave foam. This time it was less so.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades as part of a Gillette sponsored trial. I have shaved with it for 2 weeks and I think it works well as a shaver. The vibrating shave is nice. I liked that the razor is the same as my normal razor. All Fusion blades fit all Fusion handles. I have used the Gillette razors for years, and these blades are an upgrade to an already good product.</li>
    <li> As a man with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very choosey when it comes to my razors.  I prefer a close shave, and that&#x27;s hard to get every day without getting razorburn.  I used to space out my shaves, only because I disliked the constant and inevitable razorburn that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.  I received this razor free through a program run by Gillette, and I have to say, this lives up to the expectations and the hype that Gillette has poured into Fusion ProGlide over the years.  A lot of people like to make fun of the increasing number of blades in today&#x27;s razors, but Gillette has been rocking 5 blades for years now, and just improved the Fusion formula with ProGlide.  Full disclosure: I am already a huge fan of the original ProGlide razor,  so I&#x27;m viewing this from the perspective of both the original and the Power.  There are subtle differences in the cartridges, and for now, I&#x27;m going to focus purely on the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the ProGlide and ProGlide Power have much in common, but they hold some big distinctions from other razors on the market, including Gillette&#x27;s own.  I have experience with Bic disposable two-blade razors (butchered my face), Gillette Mach3 (left me with horrible razorburn), Schick Quattro (clogged to unusability after a few uses, or one shaggy shave), and Gillette Fusion (good shave, but occasional tug and pull).  The ProGlide razors have none of those issues.  The first time I used a ProGlide razor, I couldn&#x27;t even believe I was shaving. I couldn&#x27;t feel it at all!  Today, my face has become more accustomed to the razor, but here are things you can expect from it:&lt;br /&gt;- No tug and pull&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to rinse out (no clogs!)&lt;br /&gt;- Little to no razorburn (with the right cream/gel)&lt;br /&gt;- An extremely close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MicroComb is the big difference between the ProGlide and the ProGlide Power.  Your choice should solely depend upon whether or not you intend to use the Power feature.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to give it a comprehensive in-depth analysis, but I will say one thing: buy for what you will use, and stick with it, because they&#x27;re designed to be used based on that feature.  The MicroComb on the ProGlide Power is smaller, likely because the vibration pulls the hair into a smaller, metal comb parallel to the blades to prep the hair.  If you&#x27;re not using the Power feature, you&#x27;re actually paying more for an inferior razor.  Your shave may still be simple, but it likely won&#x27;t be as close or smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other, smaller differences... The lubricating strip is a different color (Power &#x3D; green, original &#x3D; blue), which doesn&#x27;t mean much, but they seem to have a slightly different texture.  I haven&#x27;t see this make much difference.  The surface of the trimmer blade on the back of the Power seems ever-so-slightly larger, but I haven&#x27;t seen it make much of a difference in practice either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you still looking for downsides to this razor?  I honestly tried to find some, and nothing came up.  Everything about it works great.  I really wish I could provide a better overview of the vibration feature, but that will have to wait until I&#x27;ve had more time to evaluate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Fusion, should you upgrade to a ProGlide?  YES. World of difference.  It is totally worth it.  Give it a try once and see for yourself.  If you&#x27;re using another brand, should you switch?  I&#x27;ve tried many others, and so far, I haven&#x27;t seen anything that comes close.  It&#x27;s worth a try.  Chances are, you won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve since had a chance to try the vibration feature.  When I first heard of the vibrating feature, I didn&#x27;t think much of it.  In fact, I used the vibrating feature on the original Fusion and it did nothing for me, which caused me to label it gimmick.  Well, Gillette must&#x27;ve gone back to the drawing board, because this new power razor is a real treat.  To keep it simple, if you&#x27;re looking for the absolute closest shave with a multi-blade razor, here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had trouble in rougher spots, particularly my neck.  No matter which way I shave, I never really get a smooth feel because the hair is so coarse, and it&#x27;s hard to maneuver in that position.  Yet, this razor does MUCH better than its non-power cousin.  Here&#x27;s the magic: the micropulses from the battery-powered handle help guide the hairs into the microcomb that line the bottom of the cartridge, which then feed to the blades and cut the hair as close to the skin as possible.  What&#x27;s even more incredible that my now even closer shave adds no additional irritation... in fact, it seems to have lessened the irritation!  If you&#x27;re looking for an even smoother and more comfortable shave than you already get with the manual ProGlide, you&#x27;ve found your answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle itself, because of the battery and motor, has considerable size and heft compared to its non-powered cousin.  I actually find it easier to grip when approaching those hard-to-reach spots.  It might be a little hard to adjust to, expecially if you&#x27;ve been using a thinner handle for a long time, but it doesn&#x27;t make the task any more cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one big drawback to the micropulses.  The vibration makes it hard to tell where you&#x27;re making contact with your skin, and as a result, you might miss a few spots if you rely more on feel, rather than sight, like I do when I shave.  The pulses are strong enough that you can feel the effects in a radius around where the razor is actually shaving.  You need to pay very close attention to ensure you don&#x27;t miss a spot.  I have done this several times, and originally attributed it to my own laziness, but given that this doesn&#x27;t happen to me with the manual razor, I unfortunately have to say that this razor, though it requires less effort for that close shave, requires more effort for a COMPLETE SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you want to closest shave possible, the vibration is not a gimmick.  It does the job.  Men with a particularly heavy beard will find no better option.  If you don&#x27;t have any coarse spots, you may still find this a bit smoother, but you might not see a concrete benefit outside of comfort, and it might be easier to hit every inch of your face otherwise.  Still five stars, with the caveat that you need to use more care to ensure you haven&#x27;t missed anything.lti-blade razor, here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had trouble in rougher spots, particularly my neck.

    <li> I got this as a giveaway promotion from Gillette. I was super excited because I have a&lt;br /&gt;crazy thick beard and never tried this before. The blades were great. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in like 3 days. The razor worked as a brand new blade and razor should. Smooth skin, no nicks or cuts. But, after 3 days of using it, the aloe strip crapped out and it worked just as well as any other new razor after 3 days. Except it vibrates. Woopty doo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it has 5 blades.  Anything with 5 blades cuts great.  Unless you use a brand new one every single day, I found it to be no better than my old 3 blade jobber.  Also, its really big. It&#x27;s like a snow shovel at the end of a pencil, attached with a floppy hinge. I like to be able to control something I&#x27;m running across my jugular a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I got a great shave for three days. It was weird to use. Felt alien. I&#x27;d buy it if it was cheaper, but its not, so I won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin, a thick beard, and hair that grows in multiple directions.  I try pretty much everything that says it prevents razor burn, and this one actually works!  I really like the new comb on the cartridge - you can really feel a difference.  It smooths out my skin and the hair so that it trims evenly and close, meaning I have to go over it less.  I am reserving my 5th star for that AMAZING product that prevents razor burn all together, but I would absolutely recommend this to everyone - it&#x27;s a great start down that path.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen the Fusion ProGlide Power shavers around for a while, but I&#x27;ve thought that they were probably a good way to make faceburger.  When I recently had the opportunity to try one for free through a program run by Gillette, though, I decided to take my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a longtime Fusion ProGlide user, the cartridge didn&#x27;t have any surprises for me, and while I didn&#x27;t care for the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; aspect of the handle itself, the cartridge was as good or better than what I&#x27;ve used previously.  I particularly like the single blade on the back of the cartridge - it makes shaping sideburns and shaving the tough-to-reach spots around my mouth relatively easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re currently using a single-blade shaver, I highly recommend this cartridge - it is a whole different experience, and far superior, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The blades work great. I got the free razor from Gilette and poped the battery in. It vibrates and gives the smoothest shave I have ever had. Smooth + no cuts &#x3D; :). I alays liked Gillete products but now even more.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for the past week. (Sample razor and amount were provided by program via Gillette.) I will compare this AAA-battery-powered 5-blade razor with the original Fusion Power and a standard three-blade disposable razor. The ProGlide cartridge also fits on the old Fusion Power razor mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide&#x27;s blades are only slightly thinner and narrower than those on the Fusion Power and more noticeably so than my three-blade disposable from the supermarket. The vibration on both power models offers a closer shave than any non-powered version, eliminating the need for me to go over a part of my face more than once. The gap between the ProGlide blades is also slightly wider than that of the Fusion Power blades, so shaved hair is dislodged more easily when rinsing. (In my experience, shaving gel clogs less often than shaving cream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;MicroComb\\&quot; that supposedly helps guide stubble to the blade is nice for the price you&#x27;d pay for one ProGlide cartridge but it&#x27;s only marginally more convenient than a razor that doesn&#x27;t have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the ProGlide is slightly better than the Fusion Power in performance and efficiency, although the cost of cartridge may be the final determinant in whether or not I switch. Also, I&#x27;d probably only use this razor at home. When traveling through airports, I would probably bring a disposable, since the TSA is known for confiscating razors and inspecting anything with batteries in it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Proglide Powerblade from Gillette.  I had seen them in the store but they seemed like a gimmick.  My first shave went well, the vibrating handle took a moment to get used to but I got a great shave.  The MicroComb makes it easy to trim my sideburns and helps when I skip shaving for a day.  This razor really shines when shaving off an extra days growth. After trying the ProGlide I was really impressed and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003983I1S Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge 8 Count]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who switches on and off between a normal razor and an electric razor. Whenever I start with the normal razor I always get really bad razor burn the first couple of times. It itches, is uncomfortable and just looks bad. I got the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide blade for free through a program run by Gillette so I thought why not give it a try. The first time I used it, I did not get any razor burn! Even when I used it dry to get a few missed patches. It was amazing, great shave and my wife loves how smooth my face is. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Yes, the new ProGlide has even more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it also has an even thicker, more luxurious lubrastrip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has even lighter, smoother blades for maximum comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, more is better. I generally do not try fancy new shaving products (have been using the Mach line for some time) but with a special promotional trial, I went for it, and my face is happy and smooth. The only reason that I refrain from giving a five star recommendation is that the feel of the razor + handle is a little lightweight for my taste. But the shave itself, is great.</li>
    <li> really liked the gillette fusion proglide razors it had been a few days without shaving and ProGlide Power cartridges really got the thick growth off leaveing my face super clean and ready for the day</li>
    <li> This following item the Gillette fusion proglide styler power blades is provided by our sponsor Gillette. Warning you should never try to touch the blades to test if it is sharp because I have experienced the pain. The blades are extremely sharp which means that if you are shaving you don&#x27;t have to worry about not shaving all the excess hair. In the past when I shave I have to go over what I shave to shave the part where it does not get a close shave to have a clean shave. With these blades I only need to go over it once. I shave every two days and these blades are a time saver. One I would heavily recommend.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridges are amazing. Sharp, flexible, gentle on your skin... So glad I received this razor as a promotion by Gillette. I will keep purchasing the refills to keep my best shave ever.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free (with just one blade) by Gillette to test it out. Previously, I had been using a Gilette Mach 3 Turbo (so I&#x27;m a fan of these motorized razors) until it died and I switched back to a non-power razor. With all razors, I typically shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion ProGlide Power (wow, a mouthful) is a significant upgrade to the Mach 3 Turbo: it is easier to grip and feels much sturdier in my hand. I think that the handle can continue to be improved, and I don&#x27;t love the placement of the power button as I tend to switch the power on and off during the shave but the placement makes that very difficult. Nevertheless, the razor performs well in the shower and I would continue to use it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blade cartridge, though, is over the top. FIVE BLADES? Really? And nearly $4 per cartridge? I don&#x27;t know about y&#x27;all, but I did fine with a measly three blades on the Mach 3... These cartridges are ~75% more expensive. That&#x27;s probably a deal-breaker for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a shaving geek, always (ALWAYS) trying the newest thing.  Sometimes they work...sometimes....not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say the Fusion ProGlide is fantastic.  Rarely do I find something that I like more than Mach3 Turbo...and this is it.  The shave is very close...but what sets it apart is the \\&quot;slickness\\&quot; of the shaver on your face.  It glides very smoothly...handling difficult spots (under the neck/chin area) very nicely.  I&#x27;m about 15 shaves in with this and it still feels like the first shave...so I think they&#x27;re going to hold up nicely, too.  Which is good because if I&#x27;m making the investment I want something that will stick around for a month or so before I have to change the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice.  You should buy one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(oh, full disclosure, I got this shaver for free in a Gillette promotion)</li>
    <li> They get the job done and they do it well.  I cant use the non-power version of the blades as the strip just dissipates too quickly.  With these I can shave against the grain every day without issue.</li>
    <li> So far so good. No nicks.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, but pricey blades. Did I mention that already?</li>
    <li> Good blades for the first 2 or 3 shaves.  After that the lubricated strip wears off and shaves get a lot rougher.&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive to throw away after less than a week.</li>
    <li> Best razor blades on the market</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed by fewer shaves per blade with this blade.  Other blades give more shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Just what my headline says.</li>
    <li> Ive never had a worst shave in my life. I shave my head every other day. The first day the sensation felt like I was being scalped with every scrape. Im not sure if it was the microcomb or what but it was horrible. When I put the rubbing alchohol on my head when I was done shaving it felt like hell. Not just any hell... the hottest of hells. Like I hopped in a wasabi and hotsauce bath. But I tried it again the second time this time I merely grazed my scalp. Still the razor destroyed it and I had bumps all on my head. Im normally not sensitive on my scalp but im looking for an alternative subscription razor now.</li>
    <li> Like all blades...they become obsolete almost immediately</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say - these are factory blades.  They snap right in and give a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly like the ones I&#x27;d buy at Target, but cheaper</li>
    <li> Good shave every time!</li>
    <li> Got these for the price of a four pack when I used a coupon I found on here so it was a great deal!</li>
    <li> Nice smooth shave. Good product.</li>
    <li> It does not give as many shaves the Gillette blades usually give.. May be quality issues.</li>
    <li> The shave that these blades and razor deliver is smoooooooth!</li>
    <li> Honestly this will be the best price you will ever get for the razor blades, its very expensive everywhere. Both me and my dad uses these, its very smooth and last quite a while too.</li>
    <li> High quality blades that last for weeks, and I shave daily.</li>
    <li> I love these razors! I ordered them on a subscription to keep the cost down, even though each one is good for up to a month (I have a light beard and often don&#x27;t shave if I&#x27;m not going out of the house that day).</li>
    <li> Kelly-K of Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz says it gives you the shave you want and the comfort you deserve at a price you can afford!!</li>
    <li> I tend to like the Shick razors, and have used that for quite some time. I wanted to try this new Fusion, and it worked very well, so it looks like I am back to Gillette because of the improvement.  The blades last a long time, especially if you dry them well after you finish using ... they can be used for quite a number of days at times, so the cost is well amortized.  Very comfortable to use, and I am finding that you can get away with one pass generally, instead of going over the same spot multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;The direction they are going, a couple of generations of design from now, the Fusion 3 will end up shaving you from across the room without a blade touching your face ... laser razor anyone?</li>
    <li> Perfect.  No reason to pay more at a retailer-  I saw a 4pk at Target for $25... so this is a deal!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Very expensive though but I guess that&#x27;s the point.  Give away the razor and charge the heck out of the blades.  It says its for men but women can use them too.</li>
    <li> I think that the Fusion ProGlide blades give me the closest and smoothest shave I have ever had. I had previously used the Mach 3 exclusively as my manual razor, but was able to try out these new blades as part of a special promotion through Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember how much better the Mach 3 was than its predecessors over a decade ago when I first tried that out. I had the same experience when I tried the fusion. The shave is so close, clean and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying  it out if you are curious you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hey these blades are the way to go , they seem to just glide over your face getting an extremely close comfortable shave every time. It&#x27;s lubricating strip works so well, you can even dry shave with no nicks, cuts, or razor burn.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor!  I got a much closer shave than with the razor I had previously been using.  The blade was very smooth across my face - even around the chin area.  My wife even commented on how smooth and soft my face was.  I will be purchasing refilss for this razor - I&#x27;m hooked!  Jeff</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge via a program ran by Gillette. The cartridge did a fine job shaving my face and it left little to no irritation - something that most razors do cause me. I&#x27;ve used the cartridge a few times since I&#x27;ve received it and it&#x27;s already getting dull, which worries me due to the cost. The precision trimmer did an okay job. I used it to trim my sideburns, which took a few strokes, and the hair below my noise. It isn&#x27;t something that I was overly excited about and not sure if it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I tried the Fusion ProGlide razor after using the Mach-3 for years and I can say it was a smart move.  I have tried other brands in the past, but they always feel like they are tearing the hair from my face (no matter how many blades they have).  The Gillette ProGlide did not have that feeling, it was as smooth as can be expected when shaving.  Now that I have tried them, I will continue to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good blades!</li>
    <li> I got this through a campaign run by Gillette. When I first saw it, my immediate impression was how would this work? I&#x27;ve heard of trimmers with battery but I was very hesitant to try out this vibrating shaver, I thought I would end up with more bruises than hair! When I finally tried Fusion ProGlide, it was a very pleasant surprise. It took away the burning sensation that I got every time I shaved. I wait till my hair is long before I shave, which meant burning sensation every time. This product helps reduce that unpleasant sensation and it is still smooth around the edges, including the cheekbone. Now I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else! I really love this product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome a smooth close shave and styles my goatee perfect. My Girl Friends wants to steal it from me.. no way</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Gillette products. So when i was given the chance to experience the style and power of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Style Blades, I just could not wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After using other Gillette products for a long time, i was expecting nothing more then the same. That would be a great shave from a great razor. The blades slide smooth across the skin as if i was not even shaving at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  And so after having the chance to test out this product, for Free, due to a special offer from Gillette. I have nothing more to say except Thanks Gillette for another great product.......</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor over my current one (schick quatro).  This razor was provided free from Gillette.  While I still had some nicks on my face, it was better than when I used my previous razor.  It took less strokes to cut the hair as well.  I felt less pulling and overall it was a smoother cut.  I do think this blade is better, but not sure it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been given Gillette Fusion Proglide Power blades to try for free via a progrma run by Gillette. Theese blades left my face and head smooth with no nicks or rash. wich was real nice because my face is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> The ProGlide Power is a really great razor. It gives you such a close shave you will find your self wil less of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow then normal. A super close shave with less irritation!</li>
    <li> I am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades . There is no significant drag on my skin, and the blades glides easily across all parts of my face...for the first and second shave. I was very pleased, at first. I have very sensitive skin so I try to stay away from razors as much as possible. The first time I used it I had no irritation at all and was so excited, THERES A RAZOR I CAN ACTUALLY USE!!! Then came the second shave that was not as smooth as the first, but nothing to cry over. Then there was the third shave....OUCH!! It was like taking a chainsaw to my face, tore it up. Now this wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal if I wouldn&#x27;t have to drain my bank account to buy replacements....yes,I&#x27;m sure everyone knows how expensive these replacement cartridges are. But I can&#x27;t complain because this razor was free provided via a program run by Gillette. All in All, I really do like the power blades...and I really hate the price of replacements blades. Oh, I forgot to mention the precision trimmer, which is awesome and I think every razor should have one. I can easily say I am not going out and purchasing ridiculously priced replacement blades and I&#x27;m sure there are lots of people who agree with me. Gillette, you need to get together and get a game plan and do something about this!</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor through a special promotion from Gillette.  I normally shave with a Norelco Electric Shaver, but agreed to give the battery aided Fusion ProGlide a trial.  After lathering up and pulling the blade across my cheek, it seemed the razor was dragging through my beard and not smoothly cutting.  It seemed the vibrating created by the razor wasn&#x27;t helping to cut my whiskers.  The last time I had used a blade razor was years ago in the Marine Corps.  We were issued single blade razors that cut more easily than the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After struggling through my shave I found it was a close shave but not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> So I tried the fusion proglide via a program by Gillette and I must say this will be my shaver going forward. I would consider my skin to be sensitive in some areas and tough other areas. The consistent action of the proglide certainly makes life easier. The cartridge is easy to assemble and remove. It seems they put more and more blades on these cartridges and I always wonder when  Gillette will hit the max amount of blades to have on a cartridge. I am surprised how thin and effective these blades are and it removed my doubt on whether I could notice the improvement. I did and that is why this will be my default shaver to use. The shaver design is serviceable. It cracks me up how Gillette shaver design reminds me of japanese sports cars. I wish ol&#x27;GIllette would just make a nice minimal black modern Proglide version. Alas, the only design choice is one that looks like it would pair well with my running shoes. Nonetheless, the proglide works so well for me that I  don&#x27;t care what I looks like really... no snags, great precision, and I look like a million bucks and ready to hit the day. Hope this helps. :)</li>
    <li> I got a free Gillette Proglide Razor thanks to a program ran by gillette and I love it.  These razor blades work wonderful.  They leave my face feeling smooth and soft.  I was able to shave without shaving cream, I just used a little water and got great results.  The blades did not tug or rip on my hair and did not leave any type of irritation or razor burn. I highly recommend purchasing this product to try for yourself I am positive you will love it.</li>
    <li> and the NEW version of the Fusion ProGlide Power blades definitely cut back on the irritation compared to the older Fusion blade.  When the Fusion came out, the blade left me with razor burn and some ingrowns.  It was so bad that I had to switch back to the Mach3 blades to get any Relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a Sample of the Fusion ProGlide Power Blade from Gillette as part of a package including the ProGlide Styler. In the 3 weeks of using ONE blade I have shaved my head every other day and kept a very close line on a sculpted beard WITH NO  IRRITATION!!!!  The closer thinner blades clean easier that the old Fusion blades (I have a thick wirey beard). It also has a lube strip that has changed to help with more sensitive skin.  This blade will easily last a month, but I use really hot water when shaving, so the lube strip only started to degredade - after 3 weeks!  I will defintely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I just got the Gillette proglide power blade and it is a realy nice blade, while shaving it was real smooth and easy on my face. as for the vibration part I  could do without that.but other wise it was a realy good shave I got from it.</li>
    <li> Ok the five blades give a great close and clean shave and Gillette never lets me down BUT the cost to purchase refills is too high for me. Thankfully, I got this razor free from Gillette but I cant see spending so much on a razor my wife is going to steal anyway.  Again the razor is excellent just not worth the price.  I will stick to my cheaper Gillette razor.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor from a program run by Gillette.  So what the heck, I gave it a shot.  I&#x27;ve used manual razors as well as electric razors.  I&#x27;ve always like the close shave of a manual razor but disliked getting cut by manual razor.  I liked the electric razor because they won&#x27;t cut me while shaving.  Well, now I have the best of both.  I can shave myself with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor and get the close shaves without cutting myself.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 1-2 weeks and have not cut myself once.  The razor feels and looks good.  The razor has not clogged up on me, so I&#x27;m happy.  The razor can be soaked in water and used in the shower without problems or danger.  It is water tight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used 3 blade razor because it seems to work better with my coarse hair. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power provided by Gillette for free works good but tends to pull and irritate my skin more so than a 3 bladed razor. The blades do seem to work good when I shave more frequently but that&#x27;s not always the case. Also, hard to shave goatee with any type of precision. Overall, the blades shave good I just have to touch up with my 3 bladed razor</li>
    <li> After using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade that was sent to me by Gillette to try out, I have to say that even small advancements in blade technology can have an impact on the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;Having used Gillette razors for quite a few years, I&#x27;ve tried nearly every new model that comes out, and I&#x27;m always impressed that they can make small improvements to create an easier shave. Shaving is for me, as it is for most people, one of the least desirable activities that has to be done fairly frequently, so anything to make that a better time is a welcome addition!&lt;br /&gt;The new Power cartridges have thinner blades and better lubrication strips for a smoother, irritation-free shave. The blades on older cartridges sometimes clogged up with shaved off facial hair, and rinsing them was difficult. The newer cartridges, while not completely clog-free, do a better job at keeping the hair flowing through and out, and are easier to flush out if they do get clogged up. I try to shave fairly quickly, so this is a definite bonus, cutting down on the time it takes doing something I hate to do!&lt;br /&gt;The lubrication strip is still a nice feature, as is the trimming blade for shaving in those smaller spots the larger part of the head cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;All of these small advances put together make a better razor and in turn a better shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Power from a program run by Gillette and it was one of the best shaving experiences I&#x27;ve had. Most blades take many passes for it to be a close, clean shave but this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge worked effortlessly and resulted in no irritation. I would recommend this to anyone who shaves on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I cannot stop raving about this product! This is the closest shave I believe I&#x27;ve ever had!  I&#x27;m so happy Gillette ran this program and I was able to try it out!  Had I known before how wonderful this product was, I would have bought it a long time ago! Thank you for making an outstanding product!!</li>
    <li> I got these blades for free as part of a Gilette promotion. I have used the Mach3 blades for years and thought those were the best. Boy was I wrong. This new blade is amazing. I get such a smooth close shave that lasts longer than the Mach3. I can now go about 3 days without shaving. Used to go about 1-2 days with the Mach3.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Styler thru a program run by Gillette recently and I must say I&#x27;m very glad I did.  I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to purchase these products because of the cost but after using these blades for a little over 2 weeks now I can say that the price is worth it for several reasons.  First off, they give me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and it even seems like I can sometimes skip a day, second the blades don&#x27;t need to be replaced as often as the disposables and lower cost brands I was previously using.  I certainly know of no other blade that can without being replaced for a month.  Sorry Off The Top Salon, there&#x27;s a new shave in town from here on out for me.</li>
    <li> I fly and travel for a living.  As a result i had to mirror my everyday shave bag.  This became kind of a hassel because not only do i have to have 2 of everything, i have to keep the weight down.  And I do very much like shaving at home with my Labrys, for those of you dontknow thats a double edged battle ax.  Lately though ive just been using a regular double edge wood spliting ax from lowes.  As you can imagine this is very difficult to travel with, as the 50lb weight limit is very hard for me to maintain with my lead boots and chain mail.  However!  since switching to the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power, i have noticed a few small things to my everyday routine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly.  This thing is SMOOOTH.  A small mishave was once a beheading, this makings mishaves a thing of the past!  I never would of thought to take five battle ax&#x27;s and try to shave with them, that would of been Ludicrus, however gillette has seemed to shrink my war ready shave utensils down and put them in an easy to use handle!!  This is incredible!!!  Never ever did i think that my face could be so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the moisture bar.  Usually a hefty pool og saliva jump starts my shaving experience, or the rain water runoff from the trees above.  this moisture strip seems to do this for me.  and its slightly cleaner!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more piles of bloody rags!!  I havent cut myself once since ive gotten this razer.  100% will use again and agian.  Much happier!</li>
    <li> I got this free from a program sponsored by Gilette. I was skeptical that any of the \\&quot;improvements\\&quot; to the razor mentioned in all the ads were really going to make a difference in the shaving experience.  Was I ever wrong!  The first thing to note is that I don&#x27;t really grow much of a beard, but just enough that it looks really silly when I don&#x27;t shave.  I regularly rely on an electric razor, but i like to get a close shave when I go out for a special event, etc.  Because of that, I don&#x27;t have the skin tolerance for blades that other men might if they use a blade every day.  So I really need something that will work for sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 and the Schick five-bladed whatever, but I never tried the regular Fusion.  Both seemed fine, no cuts usually, pretty close, about 36 hours worth before the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot;.  The Fusion ProGlide gets so much closer, it was actually quite a surprise.  I probably get a full 2 days with no need to shave (like I said, don&#x27;t grow much of a beard).  It definitely felt smoother and required fewer strokes, which lessens the chance of cuts and razor burn.  I&#x27;d say this is their best razor yet.  It will probably save money in the long run, too, since I&#x27;ll use it even less often.  Everyone wins!</li>
    <li> Great razor blade cartridge. Got this cartridge free from Gillette to try and I am very impressed. With 5 blades it really does shave smoother and cleaner. With past razors I have cut myself more than I would like and have broken out and gotten razor burn very easily, not so with the Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridge. The razors also last a long time; one cartridge lasts me at two months. Also love the trimming straight razor on the back, great for getting those clean lines.</li>
    <li> After receiving this item for free through a promotional offer from gillette, I figured I would give them a try to see if they would work any better than the current razor I was using. It was amazing. I no longer have to walk around with little balls of toilet paper stuck to my face for 20 minutes later (only to find when I get to work i forgot to take one off! :-/) Definitely worth trying if you want a really smooth, close shave.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a free program run by Gillette, I was given the opportunity to their new Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge, and I have to say I was very impressed. I have very sensitive skin under my neck and this razor gave me a close shave with no irritation. This is very important to me because I shave every day. I was also pleasantly surprised by the power aspect of this razor-- something I was skeptical of beforehand, but turns out it really does make a difference in the closeness of the shave and the smoothness of my skin afterwards. I enjoyed the trimmer that accompanied this razor-- it allows me to take care of all of my grooming needs both in the shower and out. Overall, a great product. I will not go back to my old Schick razor now that I&#x27;ve tried this.</li>
    <li> First off, let me state that I have a beard - not the full-on Grizzly Adams out of control beard, but the tailored medium length beard with crisp edging on the cheeks and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, when I received the free razor through a program Gillette was running, I knew my needs might be different from many men out there. I was looking for a great, close shave on the neck and cheeks and the ability to create a uniform and symmetrical shape to by beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power definitely delivered on the close shave. The light vibration of the razor (powered by a single AAA battery, conveniently tucked away in the handle) is an amazing innovation, and the shave was so close that I didn&#x27;t even contemplate going over any area of my face twice. It was so refreshing that I almost (ALMOST) went rogue to continue shaving my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I held back, and that&#x27;s where the only negative became apparent - the head of the razor is pretty large (that many blades will take up room, no matter how small they are), so \\&quot;detailing\\&quot; around my beard line was a challenge. Nevertheless, I was extremely happy with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - if you&#x27;re looking for a full-face shave, GO FOR IT. If not, look for something a bit more nimble.</li>
    <li> *i received a free razor to try by a program run by Gillete*&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about these blades! It gives me the absolute closest shave possible. I have been using my new razor for about a month and after shaving 5 days a week i have yet to get a nick on my face. My kids and wife have noticed how much smoother my face feels too. my wife has even tried to steal my razor for herself so now i have to hide it!</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillette customer since the 80&#x27;s. I have used the Mach 3 for years and was extremely happy. I received a free razor in an offer from Gillette, so I figured that I would give it a try. I am hooked. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades are by far superior to any other blade that I have used. You get a closer, more comfortable shave, and the blades last longer than what I have used in the past. I have to shave every day, it is nice for this chore to be comfortable.</li>
    <li> My free fusion proglide power cartridge that I recieved from a free program threw gillette worked great. It provided a clean close shave and was easy to use. It is going to replace my current razor.</li>
    <li> I received these razor blades free to try from a program run by Gillette. I was able to try them in the Fusion Proglide Styler and the Fusion Proglide Power. In both handles the blades provided one of the closest shaves that I have ever had. I have sensitive skin and there was absolutely no tugging or pulling. Changing blades was also very easy to do with a quick push of a button. These have become my daily razor blades and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a great close and easy shave.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program from Gillette I receive the proglide styler trimmer and it came with the power blades. The difference with no powered blades is that the pulls and tugs of the hair are way less. Since the blades are connected to the head of the trimmer is a little uncomfortable because the handle is big and heavy compare to a regular blade, but is great as the non-powered fusion proglide, as and addition to the proglide syler power trimmer is perfect.</li>
    <li> These cartridges are really great. They last a long time and are real sharp for a great close shave. Will definitely buy again and will pass on the word about this great product.</li>
    <li> When I got this product I was skeptical as I have been a die hard Mach 3 user for over 8 years now.  Any time my wife has tried to buy another razor they have done a horrible job as well as ripped my face apart.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor was awesome, it gave a nice close shave with out ripping apart my face and no irritation to my sensitive skin!  I am very happy I tried this product as I now have a new razor.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler was provided to me via a program ran by Gillette. I was skeptical to use the ProGlide razor blades at first because I have had issues in the past using razors that had more than 3 blades. The ProGlide razor cartridges have 5 blades and it feels better on my face then the competitors razors that I have used in the past. I have a tendency to use razor blade cartridges until they either start pulling facial hair or leaving hair bumps. I have used the same blade successfully for over a month now and it is still cutting perfectly. Also the styler blade on the back of the razor does good at lining up your side burns, mustache or eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is the best in the business for a close, clean shave. Literally, can. not. be. beat. Also important to note that I received the product free from Gillette to product test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is no reason to pay for the \\&quot;power\\&quot; version of the razor or blades. I&#x27;ve yet to see a singled benefit of the power button on the razor when it comes to actually shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - Blades &#x3D; awesome Power &#x3D; superfluous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for a couple of years, and the cartridges are great for the first few shaves, but then the quality goes downhill in a hurry.  I don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;re supposed to last, but I saw a twelve-pack of these cartridges on sale at my local Target claiming big savings on \\&quot;a whole year&#x27;s worth of cartridges\\&quot;.  That would suggest that each cartridge is supposed to last an entire month, but they never even come close.  I shave daily with these along with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide shaving gel, and I get 5-7 days out of a cartridge.  If I shave with my old Braun electric razor first, I can get the these cartridges to last longer (7-14 days) because it then takes fewer strokes with the Fusion Proglide razor to get a nice, smooth shave, and so the lubrication strip and the blades last somewhat longer.  Still, a month per cartridge is out of the question, at least with my face and/or beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Outstanding shaves for the first 3-5 days&lt;br /&gt;- Rarely get nicks or cuts&lt;br /&gt;- Proglide lubrications strip is better than original Fusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Rarely get more than a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of a cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive at $4/cartridge.  $2-$3 per cartridge would be a reasonable price in my opinion, and even at that price I&#x27;d think they&#x27;d be making billions.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by confessing that I&#x27;ve been a rotary-head electric razor user for the majority of my shaving life. I received the Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge as part of a free program offered by Gillette and was, at first, hesitant to try this product. I had tried other blades in the past and had not had pleasant shaving experiences - often getting nicks, burns and cuts from the blades cutting too close to my skin. Hoping that this product would be different I cautiously began to shave with it and was blown away!  I was getting a smooth, close shave...the blades glided over my skin effortlessly and my fear went away. In the past I&#x27;d found that blades would generally get caught on longer stubble and cause me to react to the feeling, but using this product I had not even the slightest indication of this occurring.  I can truly say that the shave I get from using the Fusion ProGlide Power is easily as good as if not better than my rotary shaver.  Gillette has an excellent product here and a convert in me!</li>
    <li> What a nice razor.  I got a sample from a promotion through Gillette along with the ProGlide Styler.  This is one heck of a nice razor.  After 24-years in the Navy, I have shaved A LOT!!  I&#x27;ve used nearly every brand, disposable, standard and electric.  This is one of the best, if not the best.  There is a very smooth feel as it crosses the neck.  I have hair that goes every which way on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t matter; one stroke one way and one in the opposite direction leaves a baby bottom feel.  It&#x27;s really that smooth.  The addition of the vibration from the styler when turned on makes it feel as if there&#x27;s not motion needed.  The styler has a thicker handle, but not too thick to be cumbersome.  That makes it feel like there&#x27;s better control.  Simply put, this is easily a razor blade that I would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try out the blades through a free program Gillette was running. Initially, I was impressed at the five blades and how well the product glided across my face with ease without irritating it. This being the case, I thought the blades left some hair behind to glide smoothly; It felt as if I was only shaving the hairs where I first placed the blade and by the end of the stroke, only half the streak was shaven. I also noticed that against the grain shaving was difficult for me because all the blades made it a bit painful, at least for me. All of this would be no problem since at the end of the shave my skin does not feel so irritated, but given the price of the cartridges, one would expect more from Gillette.</li>
    <li> Seriously it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll ever use. I only tried the blades because I received them free through a program run by Gillette. I had sworn off 5 blade razors before after trying another brand&#x27;s. They irritated my face really bad and I wrote it off as 5 was just too many blades for my somewhat sensitive skin. These blades on the other hand were great. There was no tugging or puling of the hair at all. Now the real test came at the end of the day when my face didn&#x27;t get irritated. I was surprised to say the least. I used the same blade for about a month before it dulled enough to cause any irritation. I won&#x27;t always shave with a 5 blade razor, but when I do, I&#x27;ll use use the fusion proglide!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillete Fusion ProGlide power blades as part of a promotion run by Gillette.  I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for a while now, and I would say that they are the best razor blades I have used to date.  I do not like to shave, and try to go as long as possible in between shavings, and I can say that I get a very close shave with these blades that allows me to go an extra bit of time before having to shave again.  I also get very few nicks and cuts with these blades compared to previous blades that I used to use.  There were times were I forgot to turn the razor \\&quot;on\\&quot; and I noticed a difference in the shave, so I think the power aspect plays into it as well.  I also liked that the back of the blade is also a razor and can be used to trim side-burns.  (I found this out accidentally when I attempted to use the back of the blade to wipe some shaving cream off and ended up taking off some of my side burn so be careful.)</li>
    <li> This free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. This is the best razor i have used and is the best blade out there on the market right now. It provided a clean and smooth shave everytime. The razor lasted about a month which is the typical life span of the razor. It did not become dull after a few uses so i felt like i got my moneys worth. I have a pretty full beard and there was so tugging or pulling while shaving which made the whole process of shaving alot less tedious. I will be replacing all of my razors with this particular product</li>
    <li> I received this razor sample from a program run by Gillette. In our household we&#x27;ve always been a fan or Gillette items, but this razor is so great, and gives the closest, and smoothest feeling shave ever. Even my girlfriend has taken to using these blades. They really are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample (1 cartridge) of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades through a Gillette Promotion.  I have previously bought these blades, and there is much to like about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The blades are absolutely fabulous at shaving my neckline and my head (bald), without any tug and pull, and little irritation, leaving my head and neck absolutely smooth.  I prefer the power on when shaving my face totally clean, or even my head, but not for precision work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I find the cartridge to be a little bulky when trying to precisely line out my beard area as thinly as I would like, and cannot have the power on to achieve the desired accuracy, and prefer the smaller Mach3 cartridges for the precision I require.  In addition, the 5 blades are so closely spaced that if I shave when my hair (facial or head) is a little thicker, the blades can become clogged after one stroke.  Not a huge deal, just takes a little longer to shave when having to rinse it off after each and every stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate the Fusion Power Cartridges with four stars and would purchase them again.  They achieve the closeness I desire, without irritation.</li>
    <li> I received these blades for free from Gillette to try.  I have sensitive skin and a fast growing beard--not an optimal combination.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the smooth shave they give.  I did not experience the usual razor burn, tugging and discomfort I normally do.  I have not had them long enough to say if they will last any longer than the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; blades, but do see that the Lubrastrip is to turn white as an indicator that it&#x27;s time to change blades.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the price of the refills could be a deal breaker.  Can&#x27;t imagine the wife buying them for me...unless she finds a great coupon!!</li>
    <li> As a participant in a program run by Gillette I was given a Gillette Fusion Proglide to try and this is the best razor I have used. The blades glide right over my skin without any burns or nicks. You want to talk about a close shave? This is the ultimate in close shaving. I use to get a five o&#x27;clock shadow at noon but no longer is that the case. I am not going to lie and say shaving is enjoyable but it sure isn&#x27;t such a dreaded task any longer. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I used Gillette Fusion blades for years before making the switch to ProGlide blades - and admittedly I did so because I received the product through a program being run by Gillette.  However, after trying the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot; for a week, I went out and purchased enough for months to come.  These blades really do give you a very close shave, but that doesn&#x27;t mean more dangerous.  I have very thick and coarse facial hair, and even with the Fusion 5-blade upgrade from the Mach 3 struggled sometimes, causing some tug and pull.  After only a few weeks my Fusion cartridge would cause noticeable irritation, but that issue is GONE with the ProGlide cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first inspection I didn&#x27;t think too much was really different.  The blades are the show when it comes to cartridges, and the other stuff I normally would consider \\&quot;frill.\\&quot;  However, you can tell that so much has changed when you put it to your face.  The shave is much smoother, in my opinion.  I have been using the same blade for 4 weeks and have yet to experience major irritation or major dullness in the blades.  I must admit that this may somewhat have to do with the fact that it is attached to the ProGlide Styler, which I think allows for a more secure grip and even pressure.  That said, I still find increased value in the new cartridges.  When considering the aforementioned \\&quot;frill,\\&quot; the protective lubricating strip at the top of the cartridge is of much higher quality this time around and the \\&quot;Microcomb\\&quot; and the bottom doesn&#x27;t trip hair as easily as the analog found on the Fusion razor.  This combination of improvements definitely contributes to the added comfort when shaving with these cartridges.  For those who have experienced the breakdown of the protective strip on the prior generation of razors, you know exactly what I mean here.  For those that haven&#x27;t, the strip starts to disintegrate quite quickly, losing its protective properties and leaving annoying fragments on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I would fully recommend these razors, even though they don&#x27;t seem at first glance to be an upgrade to the cheaper Fusion razor cartridges.  But don&#x27;t judge this by looks - take it to your face and experience the a much smoother shave.&gt;In closing, I would fully recommend these razors, even though they don&#x27;t seem at first glance to be an upgrade to the cheaper Fusion razor cartridges.

    <li> I was given this product for free from a program provided by Gillette. I have used many razors over the years but I have settled on the Gillette razors. Their razors always seems to give the smoothest shave with the least pulling and irritation. I have tried to use other razors but always am disappointed, in comparison, and keep going back to Gillette, and this product is no exception.</li>
    <li> I was provided this razor with the 3-in-1 Pro Styler for free from a program run by Gillette. It is the best razor I have ever used, it just glides right through my coarse facial hair, and leaves no razor burn nor razor bumps. I used to use other razors but not anymore. This is the only razor I use, and I have already purchased some more! The blades are very thin and cuts hair very easily, til the blades goes dull- about 8-10 uses. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to rid themselves of razor bumps and the pulling of hair that other razor seem to provide.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
    <li> These certainly aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;bargain basement blades&amp;#34; but they definitely are worth the $$$!!! I have VERY sensitive skin and curly hair. No disposable razor provides as close and comfy of a shave as these do... Period! Also if you immediately dry the blades off by blowing on them and gently wiping with a towel right after you finish, they will last longer/sharper! I get @ 4-5 good shaves per.</li>
    <li> Pricey but works as advertised.</li>
    <li> These razors are fantastic. They have really made getting a close shave pretty easy. They are a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades for daily use. I&#x27;d give them a five but I think they are too expensive.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR LONG TIME, THEY LAST ME LIKE ALMOST A MONTH AND STILL LOOK &amp; FEEL SHARP</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this gimmick razor!  Doesn&#x27;t last, doesn&#x27;t do a good job, cheaply made, costs too much for what you get. Gillette has become the symbol of what&#x27;s wrong with this entire industry as they market inferior products to replace what was better products in the practice of shoddy consumerism. Now I need to buy batteries along with my razor blades? Why? A vibrating handle may be something my girlfriend has a use for but it doesn&#x27;t help me shave.  And now that Dorco has come out with a 6 blade I read that Gillette is soon to follow? With blades that only last about 4- 6 shaves?&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the Schick Hydro 3 and have never looked back. The last Gillette product I bought was a pack of Trac II blades and that was the last time Gillette made a quality product worth buying.  Did you know Gillette still makes the original Trac II in Russia and sells them all over the EU? But not in the U.S.  The twin blade and three blade razors are the best all the rest are just over priced gimmicks to separate you from your hard earned money because Gillette knows you&#x27;ll talk yourself into believing their hype just to have something new even though it doesn&#x27;t work.  Sorry for being hard on some of you few last true believers but Gillette has been screwing us since the Mach 3 turbo.&lt;br /&gt;Schick makes a better razor and blades for a better price and gives you much longer lasting blades. Otherwise go back to the Trac II.  It&#x27;s a better shave that anything else Gillette has made in decades. As for me?  It&#x27;s a Schick Hydro 3.[[ASIN:B003BVINRW Schick Hydro 3 Blade Razor]]</li>
    <li> Extremely overpriced product.  Thought I was getting 16 cartridges(2 packages of eight each), instead I got one package of eight with two 4 packs inside.  Won&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these and eventually ended up ditching it for a parker straight razor, because at 4 dollars a cartridge it just wasn&#x27;t worth it. Plus this thing didn&#x27;t come anywhere near the closeness of a straight razor shave. And the blades for the parker razor are only 4 CENTS each. But to be fair this did get a closer shave than other cartridge razor I have used.</li>
    <li> I have a coupon for these razors, advertising \\&quot;up to 5 WEEKS of comfortable shaves from one Proglide cartridge.\\&quot;  This would be true if you shave once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, the first shave off of one of these is amazing.  Smooth and close with little effort.  The downfall is that the weaknesses of the Fusion are also amplified - big and chunky, making it difficult to get into smaller areas such as under the nose.  Like the Fusion, the little razor on the top is almost helpful, but not incredibly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous Gillette installments would be good for a few shaves, then fade out pretty quickly - a handy built-in obsolescence so that you have to keep buying them.  Gillette has also perfected this, in that after 5 shaves you will have one of the worst shaves of your life, suddenly and completely without warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first shave, I considered sticking with these.  After the 6th, I decided never to buy them again.  If the ad was true and it held up for 5 weeks (or even more than 5 days) I would keep buying these.  But not now.</li>
    <li> Blades are AWESOME! I feel like I don&#x27;t have to ever switch the blades, I would recommend them to any friend looking for a good shave.</li>
    <li> I used one blade while young, then 2 blade was popular for a long time, then shifted to 3 blade system and I held onto them for several years. I was very skeptical to go to 4 blade and when 5 blades came, my reaction was What ??? I tried the Fusion Manual one [[ASIN:B004B891MA Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, 8-Count]],  and had burns and was not impressed. I thought of giving up the 5 blade system altogether till I tried this Power model and I am very happy. No burns and smooth shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I am a consultant so I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday so I get some good growth going sometimes.  Other times there will be several days in a row that I have to shave.  Either way I&#x27;ve had no issues with the quality of the shave or with any sensitivity reactions to it (and I have very sensitive skin).  So I am very pleased with the blades overall.  Only reason for the four stars vs five is the price - near the top end of replacement blades.  However since one lasts me probably 12-15 shaves of my relatively thicker growth - not terrible.</li>
    <li> Really great stuff. A little pricey though. The powered razor is amazing with these blades. I will super recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette since I started shaving, and the Fusion ProGlide lives up that reputation. I would highly recommend this product and the brand that is Gillette.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it was just a bad batch, but these do not last as long as the ones I buy in the store, probably a much as 50% less.  If these weren&#x27;t sold by Amazon directly I might be inclined to think they were knockoffs instead of original Gillette cartridges.</li>
    <li> I have tried all of the gillette products but this one tops them all, smooth shave every time,blades cut close even in rough area.I wear a bald head this blade gets right down where I want it, no nicks and it leaves no stubbles.</li>
    <li> Definitely expensive, but easily the best Gillette razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I sometimes use it with power and sometimes without, but it&#x27;s a close, smooth shave either way.</li>
    <li> Helps provide the closest and smoothest shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> ridiculously expensive but probably the best there is out there.I&#x27;m not sure that I would buy them again.  it depends on the pricing.</li>
    <li> Just the way we expected them to be. Great quality at a slightly lower price.</li>
    <li> Worked well the first and second time.  By the third time it felt like I had shaved with one of those throw away razors you buy fro the Dollar store.  This system is horrible and nowhere near as good as the previous k&amp;#34;power fusion&amp;#34;.  Totally suprised by this poor quality. Face was raw after use. Had purchase two from Amazon.  Will be sending one back.  Look for a Power Fusion instead-very smooth</li>
    <li> Best shave I ever had, buy it!</li>
    <li> Saved a few bucks on a product I use regularly.  Now I can have a small supply on hand and not get caught short.</li>
    <li> Best price I have found, but still way overpriced for the product received.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I ordered the refill blades. They fit my razor and keep my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> I buy Derby double edged blades for 9 cents each. WAY better shave and I can pop in a fresh blade every 2-3 days. When I want to go REALLY smooth I follow up with a pass from my straight razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade and razor.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately they are not as sharp as the ones you would buy at Target, CVS, or any other major retail store.    They are cheaper than the ones that you find on these stores but they last just half of the time that the same retail razors would last.    So shaving once a day the retail version razors usually last 8 to 10 days before they become dull while these razors after the 4th day you can feel that is becoming dull very quickly and usually I cannot shave it anymore after the 6th day because it starts to hurt and bleed.     They never felt as sharp as the retail version razors on the first day of use. They are okay but there is a different right off the bet on how sharp they really are.    If you do the math in the end the retail store razor blades end up costing about the same but with the advantage that your face will get less irritated and thank you for it....    I guess is what the old say goes \\&quot;You Get What you Paid for\\&quot;....in this case seems to be true. At least in my experience.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than CVS, and always available. I got sick of going to the pharmacy to find out that they are locked or backordered.</li>
    <li> Best blades out there for my face. Great shave. Good price (no one is ever happy about the price of blades).</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THE PRO-GLIDE SHAVING/TRIMMER SYSTEM AND REALIZED THAT THE MACH 3 BLADES REALLY DID NOT DO THE JOB. I AM NO LONGER ENDING UP CUTTING MYSELF, THE BLADES LAST A LONG TIME WHEN I RINSE THEM WELL, AND I GET A CLEAN, CLOSE SHAVE EVERY TIME.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the fusion power shaver, so I tested it. I shaved half of my face with the vibrating head turned off and the other half of my face with the vibrating head turned on, and there was a marked difference! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve stuck with this shaving choice for years, and like getting the replacement blades shipped to my house via Amazon Subscriptions.</li>
    <li> this is a good prounduct to use i like how it shaved great and was a cool product razor besats anyother razor</li>
    <li> I love these razors! You wouldn&#x27;t think that the small vibration would make the difference but it really does. And last longer too.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette&#x27;s fusion Proglide blades as a promotion from Gillette. These blades give a very close and smooth shave. I highly recommend these blades especially for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> One shave with the free razor I got from the program Gillette was running was all it took to hook me.  Closest shave without any resistance!! Another plus is my skin is super smooth / soft afterwords.  My girlfriend loves touching my face right after I shave, she makes me shave on a daily basis now!  Can&#x27;t go wrong with the Proglide.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Blades from Gillette as part of a free program.  I&#x27;ve used the razor several times and have been very pleased with how comfortable and close the shave is.  My face and neck have felt very soft and smooth with each shave.  I particularly like the blades on the reverse side that are used for edging.</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to try these blades out free as part of a program run by Gillette. I thought these blades worked as well if not better than my current Mach 3 razors. They gave me a close shave with no nicks or cuts I have experienced with new blades in the past. My only problem is that new razor costs keep going up and up, $32 seems like a lot of money for 8 refill blades. It is a great product just a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide Powerblades in the mail due to my participation in a program sponsored by Gillette, and I have to say, these things are amazing! The 10+ times I have used these, I have received no cuts, nicks, or scratches, unlike my other razors, which is surprising! The four blades, along with the precision blade and comfort of the Aloe Vera coating on the top of the blades, make these a sure buy! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have had so many razor but none come close to Gillette&#x27;s own fusion proglide power blades. This five blades razor is smooth on my sensitive skin and leaves no cuts or rashes. The extra single blade on the opposite side of the razor is great as well for my side burns. I have nothing bad to say about this product cause its by far the best in every aspect!</li>
    <li> So about 5 days ago I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor from Gillette for free to give it a try and write a review.  At first I was thinking it would be the same as every other razor out there.  You know a big company saying look what we have - the best out there.  Well after using it for the last 5 days I am very impressed with the blades on this razor.  There are very smooth - it feels like your are shaving with nothing.  If you have sensitive skin like myself this is the razor for you.  This is the #1 Dermatologist recommended razor.  I would encourage everyone to try this razor you will love it like I did.  I have switched to Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor.</li>
    <li> at first I felt like a pack of 8 for 30.00 was overly priced but after using the product myself I see that its basically less than 4.00 per new blade. once I take into consideration that a high quality razor can cost average of 10.00 per I think that this is a great deal when I break down the the quality. I received the starter kit free from Gillette program</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face all the time but I must say with these blades gave me the smoothest shave I have had in a long time. The power blades were given to me to review by Gillette. I have seen these blades before but never realized how good they were. The power blades hit all the hard to get to places on the back of my head. To top it off my wife could tell I had used something different because I didn&#x27;t have the cuts I usually Have on my head and face. I reccommend these a lot.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette and thought why not give it a try. To be honest its a good razor but really the same as a lot of there other products. However i coupled this with there clear shave gel. and the results were night and day i had no bumps what so ever. The shave was close and smooth as well and i will be using this product more. The only real problem i see with the blades is what i see with all them they are expensive.</li>
    <li> I got this razor via a program run by Gillette - and didn&#x27;t hear about it until then.  I liked how the razor worked, and the idea behind it.  It saves me from using two different razors, now I can just use one.  The trimmer is very strong, and came with two attachments for different lengths.  It also is charged by battery, and you don&#x27;t have to plug it in like most trimmers.  It seemed to work better on longer hair than shorter hairs.  One thing i would make different is the holder - add holders for the different attachments.  All in all, very good idea and it works well.</li>
    <li> Gillette asked me to try this razor out and let them know how I liked it. Man, all I can say is that I won&#x27;t ever use another razor out there. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one gives me the closest shave of any without any irritation! Great razor!</li>
    <li> With the power handle the shave is the most comfortable I have ever had. The power blade works very well. The vibration really does help get a closer shave. I&#x27;ve tried with the vibration switch off and on. There is no pull with the vibration on, as long as the cartridge is near new. High quality product. My only complaint is everywhere I have looked the replacement cartridges are expensive and never go on sale at least from what I have seen so far. I&#x27;ve been getting about 4 or 5 good shaves per cartridge. I do not use this every day. I use it every few days and use an electric shaver in between.</li>
    <li> Through a free program sponsored by Gillette, I received a manual razor, battery powered styler and these refill blades.  The razors are great for the price and provide a smooth and precise shave.  The only problem I find is that the refills are quite expensive.  Other than that, there are no cons that I can see.  Everyone has to try it out for themselves, but I find the Gillette products to be excellent.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power Razor free from Gillette as a promotional and as soon I started using it, I knew I was hooked. This is hands-down the best razor I have ever used - Closest, most comfortable shave with no nicks and less irritation; there is no better razor on the market today! Replacement blades can be a bit costly but if you soak you razor in rubbing alcohol after each use an old pair of jeans to sharpen the blades (called \\&quot;stropping\\&quot;) every once couple of days the blades will last a long, long time. Overall this is product is a must have for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for years now. They are the only ones I will shave my face with. I consistently get at smooth and solid shave. I normally get a weeks use out of the blades and do think they are a good value. If you have not tried, do so. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a free razor blades from Gillette. Love them even more now!</li>
    <li> I got it on a free program run by Gillette.  I liked the weight of the razor, it felt a lot more solid than the cheapo blades I&#x27;ve been using.  I think it is a smoother cut than what I have been using, probably because it is a triple blade.  I like to shave the night before work so I don&#x27;t have to get up and deal with the hassle of shaving.  My face felt smoother in the morning and the shave lasted a little longer than normal.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for many years and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve become accustomed to. I recently received a free razor through a program run by Gillette and decided to give it a test drive. I was impressed by the closeness of the shave and the lack of irritation that I was previously experiencing with my Mach 3 blades. The single blade on the back was a welcome addition and really helped when I needed to clean up a few edges here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the gel strip on the blade as it dissolves in one or two uses and feels sort of gimmicky. For all the other features, the blade itself was the star of the show.</li>
    <li> While I usually have trouble with shaving because of my sensitive skin, these blades have made shaving less of an inconvenience by leaving my skin smooth without irritation and I love it! I love it even more because this free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received the Power Blades via a program run by Gillette.  The blades are the best I&#x27;ve used from Gillette thus far.  They&#x27;re smooth on the skin, and don&#x27;t irritate at all.  The longevity of each head is also a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> Honestly, i like the way Gillette introduces innovation in a task which had been limited to blade and a handle and rest was left to the skills of barber. With the level of thoughts which went into making such a blade (microcomb, aloe strip, 5 balanced blades etc), it all makes the shaving fun and simple every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Gillette who provided this to me for free in a program and i got the chance to try it out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor and trimmer. It is a product that cost a little more, but is well worth the money.This product is more amazing than I could have ever imagined!  The Power Blade cuts so clean. It is so easy to use. It would be a wonderful gift for any man. The styler is just something that I want to use on an everyday basis.I do love Gillette as a general rule, but this product tops it all!  The money is just a small investment for such an awesome product!  I will not go back!  The trimmer made my life so much easier!  The product was provided free to me through a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the claims for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge.  I have been using an electric razor for the past few years because of a doctor&#x27;s recommendation for my sensitive skin.  When I received an offer for a free razor to try out the new cartridge, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, I lathered up for the first time in a while this morning, and when I started shaving with the blade, I realized something was different. It felt so smooth. I thought I had left on a cover or something, but I checked and my face was also smooth where I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take a little getting used to how to hold a blade razor again and to make sure I got everything, but when I was done, I was rewarded with that smooth feeling you can only get with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my wife noticed, as well ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product that has brought me back to the blade</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it from a Gillette promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is battery powered and the smoothest shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no tugging or pulling on the hairs or the skin.  Hair comes off your face with very little effort if you are cutting your beard or doing a close daily shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed by how much the technology on these razors has improved since I started shaving in high school.  I feel really bad for people that still use the cheapest, lowest quality blades available.  These blades are more expensive but defiantly worth the extra money if you can afford it.  It makes your morning shave go fast and easier and makes you more confident in your shave.  I will never be able to go back to anything but the Fusion Proglide.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the previous Gillete cartridges with the same satisfactory results. They were OK and did the job just fine. So I was a little hesitant when Gillette offered a free trial of the Fusion ProGlide power razor. At most I&#x27;m expecting the package to be the same as the previous models plus I get to test it for free. I was pleasantly surprised how well this product worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wolf out like other guys and usually shave every two days to give my face a break from the abuse of daily shaving. When I started to shave, it felt like I wasn&#x27;t shaving anything off- each stroke felt almost too smooth to have done anything. There was very minimal resistance and my skin felt smooth with the close-cut achieved with these blades. Another thing that stands out is that the cartridge was easier to clean out/wash away any stubble unlike the previous cartridge models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to retire my previous shaver and place this one as my go to product.</li>
    <li> I have thick/coarse hair, so most shaving experiences leave me wishing I hadn&#x27;t just shaved.  Even if they start off fine, they end up starting to catch and pull before I&#x27;m finished shaving.  Either I use two blades per shave, or I just deal with the burn.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a number of razors over the years, and my best luck has been with a straight razor.  Unfortunately, I never have time to use my straight razor, so I never do a close shave unless I am otherwise obligated.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this blade came with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler set as a promotion from Gillette.  After using the trimmer to cut back on my facial hair(which is normal for every shave), I dove in with the blade.  I almost didn&#x27;t feel it crossing my face, which is how it&#x27;s supposed to behave.  After a few swipes, I went to rinse off the blade, and noticed the open back.  This helped with the water running from behind to clear out any larger hairs that might have gotten stuck.&lt;br /&gt;The swivel head really helped keep the correct angle on my face, while maneuvering around my chin and under my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of neck, this is my worst place to shave.  It&#x27;s much looser skin than elsewhere, and my hair runs sideways instead of up/down direction, which just makes it harder to shave than elsewhere.  But the Power Blades had no issues with this.  Afterwards my wife was impressed with the closeness of the shave.  There&#x27;s almost always a bit of rough and stubble to deal with, but not so in this case, and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By my second shave, I did start to notice some catching.  But considering it has happened for me with less than one blade on every other razor I&#x27;ve tried, I think these would last the longest for anyone else out there.  I wasn&#x27;t able to get as clean of a shave under my neck the second round, but part of that was being pressed for time and not being able to baby it through like I normally have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these attached to the Proglide Styler, my wife asked if you were supposed to run the trimmer with the blade.  I hadn&#x27;t thought about it, and was too scared to try, but apparently it is an option.d if you were supposed to run the trimmer with the blade.  I hadn&#x27;t thought about it, and was too scared to try, but apparently it is an option.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette proglide razor for a while now but have never been able to try the \\&quot;power blades\\&quot; that they have.  Gillette provided me with some blades to try and the results have been just as good maybe even a tiny bit better than the regular proglide blades.  To use the power blades all I needed to do was attach the blade itself onto the attachment for the trimmer and I was on my way.  The shave itself was very clean and offered a much better quality in my opinion to other brands that are offered.  Going \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; was painless and there was no need to go over most areas.  A big plus to me was less skin irritation which I even get when using the regular proglide blades.  I haven&#x27;t had any yet and that to me may be the biggest reason for myself to buy the product!  Cleaning was very easy as hair washes right away from between the blades making for a very easy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any razor, it seems that after multiple shaves the moisture strips have worn down considerably but the blades themselves are still going strong for now. Gillette has created some great blades that in my opinion give the best shave you can get the market.</li>
    <li> I have used my razor now for weeks, I really enjoy using it because it takes no effort on shaving. I had my wife try out the razor on her legs and she was very pleased with the end results, she told me that it took half the time to save. I thought that alone was good enough to keep buying the razors.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is a great product. I actually received a free razor in the mail and gave it a try. I&#x27;ve bought other disposable razors in the past and nothing works quite as well as this razor. I used to get terrible razor burn using other razors because my skin is very sensitive, but now I no longer experience razor burn. I also get a really close shave, which is a big plus. Nothing worse than shaving and feeling like you need to shave again a few hours later. The Gillette blades stay sharp far longer than other traditional disposable blades and are easy to clean. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who wants a close shave with 0% razor burn.</li>
    <li> Received the blades as a free demo from Gillette.  I had long thought that non disposable razors were over priced for the same shave.  Well now I can admit I was wrong.  These blades give me the closest shave ever.  I had to shave daily for my public sector job.  I cant seem to wear them out.  Great job Gillette!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand that I will use for shaving.  There is just no closer shave and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> When I found out that Gillette was running a program to let individuals try out the Gillette Fusion Proglide power cartridge for free, I had to try one for myself.  After using it I have to say that the blades get closer to the skin than any other blades I&#x27;ve ever used before.  Even the hard to reach areas like my neck are a breeze with these blades.  If your tired of having to go over the hard to reach areas over and over to get the hairs then get these Gillette Fusion Proglide power cartridge blades and you will never be disapointed.  All I can say is well done Gillette.......well done!</li>
    <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge for free thanks to Gillette. First of let me say I have been really skeptical as to how this product is any different. Well once I used it I understand. Those blades cause the razor to glide effortlessly on my skin. This makes the pulling of my face noticably less. Usually I have irritation from shaving but I did not this time. I got a super close and smooth shave with NO redness. This is a very unique product and now its my favorite!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s razors were the only razors that would not give me razor burn.  I was sick of stealing hers.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  Life long customer!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler for the past week, and since I am not a particularly hairy person have had no need for the styling features of the razor. However, I do have some comments about the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels good in one&#x27;s hand, is very comfortable to hold and easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Produces a slightly smoother, closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;No need for any beard softening procedure (hot towels, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Reduces shave time slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Can use less shave cream for excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;Reduced chance of nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Assuming a 30 day life to the blades, the razor is twice as expensive per shave as the TrackII which I have been using prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;The cost to benefit ratio is poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Because of the high cost of replacement cartridges, In my opinion, this razor cannot compete with Gillette&#x27;s other products, and when the present power cartridge becomes dull, I will not replace it. I will return to using Gillette&#x27;s Track II razor, which I find more than adequate.</li>
    <li> I received a complementary Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor from a special promotion by Gillette and I was open minded to give it a try even though I am happy with my current shaving routine. I really enjoy this razor and love the smooth close shave that I get when using it. I normally use an electric shaver because they tend to cut closer but this product has made me really change my mind about how I shave and I may have a new favorite. Although I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with the power button on or off, this razor has left my skin smooth and stubble free as longer than my electric razor normally does. It is convenient and comfortable to use. I was enjoying it just fine until my wife discovered it. Even though she has women&#x27;s razors with all the froofy stuff that women love she still prefers to use this one. That alone, tells me something. I think I found a new razor for both of us.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding in store.  This is more convenient because it eliminates having to search for the right blades every time it runs out.</li>
    <li> After seeing this advertised on television recently, I had the opportunity to try the product.  It is a very close smooth shave and the power and pivot motion makes it even easier to shave!  I would recommend this product to use everyday.</li>
    <li> They work well buy are VERY pricey.  So I will be on the lookout for alternatives.</li>
    <li> Description is correct, do not need to repeat it all, nothing bad, fits well, good quality, nothing to complain about... but you better buy an electric shaver!</li>
    <li> It sure is frustrating to try to buy razors and refills these days. I expected there would be a handle included, though obviously by the wording there isn&#x27;t. So I had to go out and buy the Power handle, and, at the store, it was, likewise, an exercise in wading through the hype to figure out what you were going to get. I hate to be a whiner, but I think most people would really appreciate a little more simplicity - like &amp;#34;This item includes the handle and X refills&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;handle only&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;refills only, handle not included.&amp;#34; Instead we are driven crazy by the splashy terminology. Yes, the product is just fine. The marketing is getting in the way.</li>
    <li> I like the razor. I haven&#x27;t got these refills yet. The shave is very comfortable and close. This auto re-order will be interesting. I hope it works good.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE GREAT, VERY GOOD PRICE COST LESS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. LIKE ONE PERSON SAID WAS VERY FUNNY HE HAD TO LEARN TO SLEEP ON HIS BACK BECAUSE AFTER SHAVING HIS FACE KEPT SLIPPING OFF HIS PILLOW...</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get over how expensive these blades are. The winner will be the affordable shaving company.</li>
    <li> These razors work great. There is aloe or moisturizer or something on the pads that prevents your face from getting dry and cut when shaving. It keeps your skin smooth while shaving to prevent nicks. I used a bunch of razors, and this one still gives me the cleanest shave. I used a Norelco razor, the one with 3 heads, but it misses some hairs which I use these blades to clean up. This gives me a great shave and a blade generally lasts me a month with a shave 1 to 2 times per week.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  The proglide feature makes it easier for me to glide it around my chin, especially.  I love it so much I&#x27;m buying another for my son in law, whom I am sure will like it as much as I do.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was the best shave i love these razors they work wonderful definitely will buy more. No Razor Rash, close shave which is the best... Got the Power one which is great the Trimmer is great for the beard to get the fine areas.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail from Gillette. It was the Gillette Fusion Proglide power. I used this product and felt that it was a great product. I did not have any razor burn like i have from other product like the Mach 3. I would recommed this to everyone that desires a smooth burn free shave,</li>
    <li> I received some cartridges free from Gillette!  I have been impressed at the number of shaves I got out of  single cartridge. I was expecting after 6 or 7 shaves, the blade would be tearing me up.  I&#x27;m at about 12 shaves now, and it is still going pretty well and giving a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these!</li>
    <li> good price on sometimes hard to find refills.</li>
    <li> They work and I am happy.  These refills are becoming hard to find.</li>
    <li> They are the real deal, not the cheap ripoffs you find some other places.</li>
    <li> There seem to be a lot of &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; Gillette blades available on the internet from overseas, and they definitely do not come close in quality to the genuine Gillette.  Be suspicious of any blades that too good a bargain to be true. Buy from a reliable source.</li>
    <li> Terrible product, the head falls off every time you apply pressure, while shaving today head fell off 17 times and I was trying to keep it on. It is a worthless product and will just make you mad trying to use it. Gave it one star because I could not give it zero or less</li>
    <li> The packaging looked absolutely right (I have checked 5 times for signs it is fake), but the blades do not.  The have the wrong color plastic holder, and the color of the lubrication strip on the blades is wrong.  The blades are clearly not a good as real Fusion Proglide Power.  Did Gillete put an older model blade in the packaging?  Or is it a fake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real Proglide Fusion Power give the best shave I have ever had, and I have been through all Gillete products (and the competition until Gillete got so much better).  And they last longer (making up some of the price difference), and the trimmer blade is significantly better.  I hate a monopoly and rediculous prices as much as anyone, but in this case I need the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have a heavy beard and very sensitive skin, you might be entirely satisfied with less expensive blades, if in doubt so try them out.</li>
    <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette razors since I began shaving (back then it was the Sensor Excel I think). I have always felt they give a great shave, and these blades are not an exception. They are extremely smooth shaving and give a close shave without nicks or cuts. Recently, I tried the Dorco blades attempting to save money. They did not do the job at all. It is worth spending a little more to get a much better product. I usually get 10 or so shaves from each blade, which lasts me just about a month.  So saving a dollar a month isn&#x27;t worth cuts and nicks on my face. Save your skin and get the Gillete blades. Save some money and check around on Amazon for different listings...some times they have two of the same quantity but with different prices.</li>
    <li> These cartridges were order for my husband and he had no complaints.  He plans to keep using them. He will re order.</li>
    <li> These razor blades give the best shaving experience I have ever had.  They shave super close and it makes your skin feel soft.  Most importantly for me the blades do not cut or nick me.  I am on blood thinners so I would bleed a lot if I got nicked so these blades make my shaving experience very safe.  The price of the blades are higher than other blades but they last very long so the price per day is not that much. As usual Amazon delivered the blades very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great price and delivered to your door</li>
    <li> Far and away the best blades on the market.  Close shave, and never get cut.</li>
    <li> These heads are really great for giving you a really close shave.  I love the additional single blade on the back to touch up my beard and mustache.  The gentle vibration from the razor really helps these blades get the job done.  My only complaint would be the cost but you get what you pay for right?</li>
    <li> best shave i get is always with these proglide blades. They give you an extreamly close shave and it is smooth no pulling or tugging. These are the only blades I use to shave.</li>
    <li> Tried all the subscription blades (Harry&#x27;s, Dollar Shave, etc), and keep coming back to Gillette. You absolutely get what you pay for, and for me, they&#x27;re worth every penny. Even Dollar Shave&#x27;s &amp;#34;Executive&amp;#34; blade (which includes the top &#x27;detail trimmer&#x27; blade) doesn&#x27;t even come close - and in fact, is pretty lethal in comparison. Amazon&#x27;s subscription service makes it easy to manage ...</li>
    <li> Highly recommend these razors, although a little pricey. Unlike cheaper brands these don&#x27;t rust or rip up your skin, especially delicate areas.</li>
    <li> Blades were as expected and so much more economical than buying this amount at the store.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this Razor but hated the price to replace them. This price is great! I have them automatically sent and he never runs out, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love Gillette&#x27;s fusion pro glide power blades, makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after a nice week of growth. I bought this blade in January and i have loved it since. I had a Schick Quattro Titanium before this and it just didn&#x27;t leave my skin soft and smooth so i decided to buy this and have been very satisfied since then. One blade can last me for a month so buying this should last me a while till i have to make another refill</li>
    <li> I received the power blades for free through a program run by Gillette. I have always been a big fan of Gillette blades, but never upgraded from the mach 3. These new power blades made a huge change in my shaving routine. I used to believe that the vibrating motion was a sales gimmick; BUT it really makes a difference and makes shaving a much easier, quicker and bump free.</li>
    <li> Have always loved Fusion ProGlide, but decided to see if I could get it for a better price on amazon and I sure did! Double the amount for a little more than the same price for half the amount from other retailers even.  As for the razors, it is the best shave ever and with my sensitive skin that is saying a lot!</li>
    <li> I love them, when Gillette says it&#x27;s the best a man can get. They aren&#x27;t exaggerating. They&#x27;re the best on the market. They work as advertised. You would have a hard time cutting yourself even if you tried (not advised). And yes, of course, they&#x27;re expensive over four dollars a piece, I would really love to see a huge price drop us! Maybe a special like 16 for $32</li>
    <li> It is still the closest shave you can get!&lt;br /&gt;The 5th blade does anice job on your sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement I would like tyo see is the lubricating strip at the top to last formore than a couple of days; being an exepnsive disposable cartrige, you&#x27;ve think Gillette wolud make this component more durable.</li>
    <li> The product was provided free through a program run by Gillette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Power Glide cartridge is a great product. It provides a very smooth and clean shave. It is an experience  that needs to be applauded for its smoothness and comfort</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades provided by a program run by Gillette work well. I liked it more for the convenience of the all in one trimmer with the razor because i felt it works just as well as a standard Gillette razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used by far.  You wouldn&#x27;t think that a little bit of vibration would make such a difference, but it really does.  My neck is very difficult to shave and often requires several passes in multiple directs.  The result is typically an average shave with a large amount of irritation.  With the ProGlide, I had a clean shave in 1 pass.  I received the blade as a free promotion from Gillette, but I will absolutely be purchasing replacements once this one wears out in about a month.</li>
    <li> I received my free ProGlide via a program run by Gillette.  These blades preform better than any razor blades I have used in the past.  The five blades will give you the closest shave you have ever gotten without the irritation feeling.  With the sixth blade you can shave those tiny hairs above your bead line without ruining the line.</li>
    <li> I first received the free razor from a promotion run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;And let me just say that these are the best power blades I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power blades provide the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. The blades also gave me 2 days full of being shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette has won my heart and that is why I am going to start using Gillette as my number 1 source of razors for forever.</li>
    <li> I use Gillette razor blades regularly, and this product is far superior to their past blades.  I have sensitive skin, and the deal with razor rash frequently.  This razor left my face smooth for 48 hours, with minimal razor rash.</li>
    <li> Just when I thought Gillette couldn&#x27;t do any better than 5 blades they go and put it on a trimmer. I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades via a program run by Gillette. I was skeptical but I tried them and found a closer shave than ever. The blades are thinner but last just as long as previous versions.&lt;br /&gt; I have tried all kinds of shaving products with Gillette and other manufacturers and I think I have found the one for me. I am in the Army and I have to shave everyday. I have been using the blades for a week now and I have found that if I need to I can actually skip a day if needed.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend anyone looking for a closer shave try this one.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as a sample from a Gillette promotion to try and was very impressed.  I will keep this short and to the point.  Hits all the tough spots, close and smooth shave, long lasting,  fantastic.  This product is a must buy if you have sensitive skin or are just tired of cuts and razor bumps.  Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> The blades were all right. I received them through a free promotion through Gillette. While the power trimmer I received worked quite well, the razor worked great, but was nothing above average. They did the job well and that&#x27;s all that should be noted about it.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a campaign by Gillette.  Boy am I thankful that I signed up as I am so thankful for getting this now as it complete changed my mind.  Thinking a razor is a razor is no way to perceive this razor!  Comparing this to any other razor is a joke!  This is the best razor that has a gel to follow up the shave which makes it feel soo good when done.  A pivoting head makes it get in places that is just impossible with anything else!  If you could get a razor, this is the one to choose!  My wife is even tickled pink as its the smoothest she has felt my face in a while.</li>
    <li> For my facial hair Gillette did very well on this one. No pulling, no razor burn, no red spots on my face. I have always used disposable razors and this one has given me a reason to start using these over the disposable&#x27;. Some how my wife signed me up to receive a free one, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an easy smooth shave, this razor did it for me.</li>
    <li> These blades were provided to me via a program run by Gillette.  The blades gave me a very smooth shave, with very little tug and pull.  However, having very sensitive skin, I did have a lot of irritation due to the number of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this would be a great blade for men with average skin.  For those of us with sensitive skin, an option for a razor with fewer blades would be nice.</li>
    <li> Received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades threw a program ran by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Satisfied with the outcome of this product!  Very close shave, no Irritation, no razor burn after shaving.  Also, you do not have to go over the same spot Multiple times unlike you do with the cheaper blades.</li>
    <li> Love it but very expensive.</li>
    <li> I received these blades from a free razor program provided by Gillette.  These blades are excellent.  They give a very close shave and they last a long time.  I normally use a 5 blade, but this is almost as good and a little bit cheaper.  I did not get any nicks or cuts and I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide&lt;br /&gt;is an exceptional razor!</li>
    <li> Excellent blades I get a good smooth shave</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth shave and didn&#x27;t leave any razor burn.</li>
    <li> I buy a pack of 8 of these (I shave 3 times a week), and each cartridge last me about two months.  How?  Go and buy a duster can, I get three of them at Frys for $8, or you can find them at any home office store.  Every time you shave, take the duster can and dry the razor, including the strips at the top and bottom, pushing off any residue to the sides.  Water seems to be the worst thing for a razor, yet using this technique makes my blades last for months!</li>
    <li> I love these blades. I&#x27;ve used them for years and Gillette just keeps making them better every year.&lt;br /&gt;Clean, close, effortless shaving, every time AND....the blades last for weeks not just days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, they are relatively expensive...maybe even the most expensive blades ever.&lt;br /&gt;But they are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These cartridges work great!  The moisture bar stays slick for at least 2-3 weeks with both my husband and I using it, and the blades last well.  Very rarely do we get raiser burn any more, even on the sensitive areas. A+ product</li>
    <li> Maybe it is just me, but these blades seem to pull painfully after the initial few shaves.  Previous blades have not had this problem.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend can&#x27;t go back to regular razors.</li>
    <li> I mean of course the razors work extremely well, that&#x27;s why I buy them.  However, doesn&#x27;t seem to be much in the way of savings</li>
    <li> My fiance tried the proglide last night and was really impressed! Great shave with very little to no irritation. His face was silky smooth!!</li>
    <li> I received this free from the Gillette company to try out. I have owned several different Gillette products in the past but this one definitely takes the cake.  I have used for ten shaves so far and have gotten the same close shave each time and still see no signs of dulling for this blade.</li>
    <li> I usually use a set of clippers to shape up my facial hair art. It&#x27;s true that the trimmer in the electric set definitely leaves stubble and doesn&#x27;t shave against the skin like that of the effects of a true razor blade. So I thought I&#x27;d give the Gillette fusion proglide with Gillette fusion proglide power blade cartridge a try, which was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, the handle is really nice. The plastic looks like it&#x27;s metal, and even has a good weighty feel to it. The flexible rubber accents are nice too. Totally decent ergonomics. However, how crucial is the handle when reviewing a razor blade? The handle works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snapping the cartridges on and off was a cinch. There&#x27;s a big button on the back of the neck of the handle that makes interchanging really easy. It doesn&#x27;t accept a backwards facing cartridge, so it&#x27;s easy to get this right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the cartridge and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most razors are a solid, non technological, stagnant, rock solid piece. Like some other fancy \\&quot;bro\\&quot; inspired razors, this one&#x27;s cartridge pivots and attempts to harness the curves and planes of your face&#x27;s shape. It seemed difficult to cut myself, which is both good/great in terms of safety, but we are talking about a razor here, a dangerous, sharp tool for chiseling facial masterpieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it difficult to edge and shape straight lines with the bulkiness of the cartridges edges. The blades don&#x27;t run to the edges, so I was just scraping plastic against my face, which wasn&#x27;t cleaning up stubble precisely. The size of the cartridge was big, so the area on my cheek was hard to shape because the cartridge was intruding in my eye space, which was scary. The thought of a razor blade in the eye is frightening. So I tried a vertical motion instead of a horizontal one, it did okay, but the swiveling/pivoting feature had me making several passes since the blades just weren&#x27;t taking the hair right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion strip actually works on this cartridge. I&#x27;ve used mach 3&#x27;s and others like it in the past and always wondered what purpose these \\&quot;moisturizing strips\\&quot; actually served. However, because of past failures of this feature, it seems hardly important, if not completely insignificant. Most razor uses don&#x27;t dry shave like I do, meaning that shaving cream and after shave moisturizers are usually in the mix, so what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with some other reviewers that their blades should be replaced with sharper stronger ones. The pivoting action makes you really push down hard to get close shaves, which seems counter intuitive. I want the first pass to cut some hairs, not have me press down so hard that I feel like I&#x27;m going to split my skin open, even then, it still doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for full face shaves and clearing out beard real estate, this razor might be excellent and safe, but I haven&#x27;t done that in years. It definitely kind of \\&quot;glides\\&quot; like it suggests, but I&#x27;d prefer something that cuts more precisely.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion strip actually works on this cartridge.

    <li> I was thoroughly impressed with these blades. I often struggle with razor burn, but that was not the case with these. I received the blades as part of a free promotion from Gillette, and am very impressed! This is the closest and least irritated my face has ever been after shaving. I have no reason to go back to the other brands.</li>
    <li> These blades work great and they even give you a free razor with this special program that is ran by Gillette! These blades clip in and out very easily and are able to reach all of the tough spots. This is a must have for men trying to stay fresh!</li>
    <li> I received these blades Proglide power Blades with by Proglide Trimmer from Gillett. The blades were Great and cut to the chase ,pun intended. They are a bit pricy but I do not shave that often to worry about the price. All in all I would indeed buy them.</li>
    <li> I received a free  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge, but was disappointed. This razor is too stiff and not ergonomically made for your face. The blade does cut good but the handle is too long, and I accidentally turn on the power often while shaving.</li>
    <li> I received a sample Proglide Power System handle and blade from Gillette to try out. I have used a variety of shaving systems, but over the years have generally prefered Gillette. This new system with a power blade works very well. The handle is balanced and easy to grip, and you need to get used to holding it a bit differently because of the system vibration. The blade cuts quite smoothly, though I am not yet sure how long they will last for me. Pricey, but all shaving systems seem to be. Very nice, close, painless shave.</li>
    <li> I recently participated in a program run by Gillette, in which they sent me a Fusion Proglide Styler, and I was able to test it out. My prior experience with Gillette was very limited, I had never actually had a razor by this brand, but I had always seen advertising and marketing for them. After receiving this item, I used it for about 8 days, when I thought to myself that this was the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have very sensitive skin so regular razors always irritate my skin. After using the razor feature one my third day, I felt like I had the strongest skin in the world. Not only could I comfortably shave, but I could also shave against the grain, something I could never do before.  The added moisture and lubricating strip at the top of the razor worked wonders. These lubricants allowed the razor to live up to its name and truly glide on the skin. The five sharp blades work together in order to create the closest safest shave I have ever experienced. The precision edger on the back side of the razor worked like a charm. It allowed for access to those hard to reach areas and allowed for the control of the exact location you wanted to edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, I have seen countless pluses, but only one negative, which would not deter me from the purchase of this item in the future. This negative was regarding the trimmer blade in the back. Although it worked like a charm, after a few days I began to notice some discoloration. I know that these cartridges are meant to last about a month each, so this is bound to happen. Let me make myself clear, that there was no rust, so do not confuse my words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this razor is a great razor that I would recommend to 10 out of 10 friends. Personally, I feel that whatever skin type you have, you cannot go wrong with this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Gilette. I was so excited when I was able to try these free through a program run by Gillette. They are the absolute best for getting a good shave. I love how long they last. It&#x27;s a huge plus not having to constantly buy razors. Every other brand I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t stand up to these razors. I love that it has the vibration that makes the shave even closer. There is no irritation with these either. I&#x27;ll never use another brand.</li>
    <li> Smooth Shave!!!!!!!!!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the action of this razor!  It feels like I&#x27;m running a finger over my face.  Super smooth and long lasting results!!</li>
    <li> I just used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor and I just had to share the experience with the world. I am not a paid actor endorsing this product, just your average everyday man with sensitive shaving needs. I did however receive the razor to try for free via a program run by Gillette, but trust me, that has no bearing whatsoever on this review.&lt;br /&gt;  I want to talk about the cartridge blades. I can honestly say, that I have never had a smoother and closer shave from any other blade (except for a straight edge used by the barbershop). I have tried the other 3 blade systems, the 4 blade systems,and disposables of competing brands and nothing has come close. The extra large lubrication strip,the little combed teeth and the thinner blades made for a closer shave. I also used it to shave my head (I&#x27;m bald by choice, not by nature)and the blades worked like a dream on my scalp. Usually it would take me 3-4 passes to achieve the level of smoothness that I got with the first pass using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.So far I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with the performance of this razor and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I Have been using the Gillette fusion proglide power trimmer for a while now as part of a promotion run by Gillette. andI must say its the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! Never mind the convenience of have a razor head on a body hair trimmer. I give this a 10 out of 10 and there should be a doubt in your mind you will give this product the same !</li>
    <li> At first glance, the concept of this product really excited me. Since \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; became the new norm, I find myself grooming all the time. What excited me the most was having something that would  allow me to use one system for all of my needs, such as a razor and a trimmer in one. Well, that&#x27;s where the problems start. The quality of the blades is consistent with most Gillette brand razors... great! They give a smooth, close shave. That&#x27;s why we buy them and speak so highly of them. However, I find that the handle on this trimmer is just too big. It doesn&#x27;t fit in my hand the same and seems awkward to hold. I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it. The blades gave me the same shave as other Gillette products I&#x27;ve used, but it didn&#x27;t allow me to shave the same way. As men, we have hair that grows in hard-to-reach areas, some of which are too difficult to reach with such a large razor, so this wasn&#x27;t my favorite razor for that purpose. This razor was provided to me though a program via Gillette, I&#x27;m glad I had a chance to try it, but I don&#x27;t see myself buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> as in goldilocks and the 3 bears, these blades are just right. They provide a thorough yet clean shave of my facial hair, and the may just be the best blades i have ever used! The free razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I was offered the chance to try this product out and offer reviews for Gillette. I was very pleased with the product, a great close shave with little to no effort needed! Also, I was done shaving in just minutes. No knicks or anything and left with a smooth clean shave! Unfortunately, $20 is not in my budget (according to my wife) to spend on a product like this! If the price was just a bit cheaper or we had some high value coupons I would buy this product again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Now, all of this is being said I have only used the product once now, hopefully this review is the same after using this multiple times....will update soon</li>
    <li> Gillette provided me a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade as part of a package that also gave me a ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. The blades can be used with the Styler Power Trimmer or with your Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor. I previously used the razor cartridges on my ProGlide razor and found the blades to be excellent, but when I used the blades on the trimmer it took my shave to a whole new level! I have sensitive skin and sometimes get bumps from a really close shave, but while using the blades on the power trimmer the bumps have been nonexistent. I strongly recommend these blades as they provide an excellent, bump free, close shave!</li>
    <li> WHY BUY ANOTHER SET PPL SAY. WELL ILL TELL YOU WHY SO YOU WONT HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER SHAVER AND YOU CAN KEEP SHAVING SO CLEAN AND REFRESHING. AND WHEN PEOPLE SEE YOU THEY SEE A CLEAN AND SMOOTH FACE SO YOU GIRLFRIEND WILL SAY SO SOFT. AND SHAVE WITH CONFADENCE AND LOVE THE SHAVER AND I RECAMMEND ANY GUY TO GET THIS AND OF YOU WONT LIKE IT THEN IM WRONG BUT AS FOR ME I LOVE IT AND I WILL CONTINUE USING IT THANK YOU. SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive, so every time I shave, I cut myself or I get bumps. After trying this blades, provided for free via a program run by Gillette, those problems are long gone. There are no more cuts or bumps, and my face feel really smooth an clean afterward. They also provide the closest shave and  the blades \\&quot;dances\\&quot; gratefully as you get the unwanted hair out. They are a lil. bit expensive, but hey, they are \\&quot;magical\\&quot; and if my face could thank me, it would. I really recommend this to any man who&#x27;s looking for a really clean shave, or have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Before i received Gillettes Power Blades i used the one time use disposable razors with a single blade, they were irritating to my skin and since they were one time use i spent lots and lots of money buying packs of them. With Power Blades by Gillette i no longer need to use my disposable razors. The Power Blades Glide threw the skin and catch all hair in the way , The Vibrating motion of the power blades allows me to get a very clean shave with nothing left over. When i shaved my mustache of using the power blades i was very optimistic about them working well i said to my self \\&quot;well i probably wont get a clean shave,i am probable going to get lots of irritation from using these blades\\&quot; Well i was WRONG The Blades Cut threw my mustache like knife cuts threw butter. I Had No irritation whats so ever,the blades were gliding smoothly threw my skin and picked up all the hair.  Leaving me With one of the most cleanest shaves i had so far. Their is really nothing negative i can saya bout the razor maybe its just me but their are really no problems with the power blades by Gillette. Please note that free GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER BLADES were provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette. When I received the unit it was well packaged and easy to open. I liked the adhesive tape that kept the packaging closed up tight, but was easy to remove. I had the unit out and assembled in less than 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thought was the styler was well made. It has some weight to it that makes you feel like it will last for a while. Attachments come on and off easily. The design of how they attach is pretty neat. With the slide of a switch the attachments come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the trimmer and the razor work well. The razor has 5 blades for a close smooth shave. I have sensitive skin and had no razor burn with the blade. The trimmer does have a little problem cutting when there is lots of hair to deal with. I think it&#x27;s best suited for regular maintenance of your beard and other parts. I would not use it to get rid of your Grizzly Adams look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the unit and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Gilette Fusion ProGlide razor blades are my trusted blades of choice. Although the razors are fairly expensive to refill they last much longer and come far more sharp than bargain brands. The only comment I need to make is about the trimming (+1) blade the razor has. While it is great at what it is intended for, I caught my lip on an \\&quot;up stroke\\&quot; and cut it pretty badly. Definitely user error though.</li>
    <li> Ive always been skeptical about getting new razor blades, they come out so often. Last week I received a new razor from a program run by Gillette.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does provide a closer and more comfortable shave.  Im very happy I had the opportunity to try something new.  Ive never found a blade thats comfortable when I shave under my nose and corners of my mouth (mustache area except I never grow a mustache).  This cartridge is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving the blades in the mail free to try out, I was immediately impressed. When using the power blades, they somehow made my whiskers more sturdy which allowed for a clean shave the first go around. The lubricating strips made the experience very smooth and pain free. Even though they are a little expensive, the saying you get what you pay for comes into play big time here. I was able to shave nick-free and with ease. Great product and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette and they did not disappoint. This razor glides across your face however the 5 razors did seems to add bulkiness causing certain areas left unshaven. However the precision blade took care of all these areas with ease. This one blade is reason to buy the razor all the other features are just added bonuses.</li>
    <li> The Fusion ProGlide is also using slightly thinner blades. If you compare the standard Fusion head to the Fusion ProGlide cartridge you can notice the blades have a bit more space between them on the new razor. On the backside of the cartridge, you&#x27;ll also notice the blades now rest in a stabilizer to help maintain blade spacing. These changes are designed to allow the razor to glide more smoothly over the face with less drag. My shave was noticeably smoother with the Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other changes to the cartridge include a larger lubricating strip, the inclusion of a \\&quot;microcomb\\&quot; to help guide the hair into the blades, and an updated trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge (the new a trimmer blade has a guide comb in front of it). Nice touches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> They provide a close shave with little irritation. I was pleased with them and will continue to purchase and use them in the future. A free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette for this review.</li>
    <li> I tried this blade for the first time the other day.  I received it for free from a gillette promotion.  This blade gives you a really close shave that last the whole day.  I usually use a different type of blade and I always feel like I need to shave again later in the day.  I will defiantly be using this blade from now on.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is a shaver&#x27;s delight. The cartridge (blades) are great for people with sensitive skin. When I shave using other blades my skin hates me for it. It doesn&#x27;t take long for my face to show the signs of blade shaving: redness all over, small nicks and cuts. It&#x27;s no wonder I tend to stay away from shaving with a razor (and instead use my electric). With these Gillette Fusion Proglide blades, I noticed almost no redness and the nicks and cuts were a thing of the past. The blades are smooth at any angle and since they are thinner blades, there&#x27;s less pull on my stubble. These blades are as advertised and that&#x27;s important when there are so many blades to choose from. I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide blades to anyone who wants to revisit blade shaving; especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide power blades from an offer by Gillette.  Overall, the blades work well.  Very smooth on the face and neck.  I did end up getting cut quite a bit more than what I was used to with my other brand of blades.  The blades slip on the styler grip and extend out further than a normal razor so that took some getting used to. Overall, its a decent product but I think Schick makes a smoother shave</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGuide razor through a free product campaign offered by Gillette.  They mailed the free razor to me. I took this with me on a family camping trip weekend and the 5 blades provided for a nice smooth shave.  The razor glided on my face with causing any painful nicks.  I had forgotten my shaving cream so was a bit concerned that I would get cut but the razor worked out well.  The blades were sharp and left my face clean shaven.  Based on using it for 3 days over a long weekend, the blades did not dull.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor provides a gentle shave, its incredible on sensitive skin. Fusion ProGlide glides effortlessly through my beard, providing incredible comfort, even if I shave every day.  I got my Fusion Proglide free through a program ran by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I got the power blade through a program run by Gillette, and I have to say I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I have dark, thick hair and sensitive skin and usually it takes a lot to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;This blade gave me a close, comfortable shave with no nicks. My usual blade from another&lt;br /&gt;company I thought did a good job but the styler blade definitely surpassed my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a great job on all the areas of my face. It made my face so soft. I really have&lt;br /&gt;nothing bad to say about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Blade and would definitely&lt;br /&gt;repurchase!</li>
    <li> This razor is significantly better than any I have used previously. Prior to this one, I use a Gillette 5 Blade, which I was satisfied with but not after tonight&#x27;s shave. My neck is particularly sensitive and I have been trying for months to get it in line with special shaving creams and washes. Tonight was the first time my neck did not burn or bleed after shaving. I did not expect these results . My face and neck have never felt better.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I cannot tell you how impressed I am with these blades!! Such a smooth shave with no irritation afterwards. I have used Gillette for years but this one is by far the best I have used..If you have sensitive skin it is a must try!got the razor free to try as part of a program from Gillette.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide power razor from Gillette as tester for the product.I didn&#x27;t have to apply any pressure to shave my face. The razor did all the work! Will a regular razor I usually get a little razor burn. Nothing with this! Smooth close shave, with no effort! My wife even used it in the shower to shave her legs, and ended up claiming it from me! Great razor! Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I was suprised with how much I enjoyed this razor. Normally I dont bother with \\&quot;disposable razors\\&quot; because I find going and getting a straight razor shave much better.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor through a program run by Gillette. I definitely like this razor and its blades. The blade is very sharp and gave me a very close shave. The blades shaved closely without any nicks or cuts. The blade doesn&#x27;t clog with hair, but rinses clean. The Microcomb makes your shave even closer because it puts all the hair under the blades. The trimmer was perfect for behind the ears and under the nose. I love these blades. I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave. It makes me not have to shave every day either, since the shave is so close.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple blade cartridges for a few years now so I didn&#x27;t think these would be anything special. Boy was I wrong! After receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide free in the mail through a program from Gillette I used it instead of my usual one for a week. The first thing I noticed is that there is no pulling or tugging of my hair as I shaved. My hair is fairly coarse so thats one problem I have always had to put up with while using other razors. The trimmer blade on the back is a great addition, I can now shape my goatee with my razor. It also gives an incrediblely close shave, I can now go an extra day between shaves which is easier on my face and wallet.The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the trimmer blade isn&#x27;t quite as sharp as I would like it to be, I needed to press a little too hard while using.I will be switching to the Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge from now on.</li>
    <li> Honestly this product seemed to be steeped in marketing hype not actual \\&quot;shaving technology\\&quot;. After using this little beast though my opinion has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;1. Smooth Shave with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cuts through a few days of growth easily.&lt;br /&gt;3. Shaving is just one of many functions possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;1. My wife makes vibrator jokes while I am blissfully shaving away.&lt;br /&gt;2. No rechargeable battery to appease the hippie in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the first blade is worn out I have garnered a new respect for \\&quot;shave technology\\&quot;. Before receiving the ProGlide styler as part of a program run by Gillette, my only razor had been an old fashioned safety razor. The ease with which this product cuts through stubble has made my Monday morning shave (after 3 days of growth) pleasant instead of a fearsome ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this as an upgrade from more traditional shaving tools. The addition of a small amount of buzzing has proven to make shaving that much easier for me.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades from a program run by Gillette. I tried this razor and loved it! If you have ever wondered what shaving with heaven feels like, this is it. Seriously, its comfortable, smooth, and perfect for that look you want. I have tried many razors and none can come close, literally and figuratively.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge which was provided to me free vis a program run by Gillette. I have used this product about three times since getting in the mail. These blades left my skins feeling baby soft. This is the kind of blade we all dream about! It did not pull my hair, tickle my neck or nik my skin. Smooth shaving. This is a great blade and I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I received this free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. I had high hopes that my sensitive skin would be \\&quot;happy\\&quot; with this razor. Instead after shaving with it 3 times over 3 days under varying conditions:&lt;br /&gt;1. In the shower&lt;br /&gt;2. Directly after a shower&lt;br /&gt;3. Random time during the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin wasn&#x27;t so happy. On the plus side I did not experience any razor burn which I normally don&#x27;t anyway. The razor and cartridge didn&#x27;t have any negative affects, I was just hoping for a more positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more or go out of my way to use this razor again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something different, out of my comfort zone, when at the right moment I came across a free razor offer by Gillette for the \\&quot;Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power\\&quot;. I was skeptical of using a free product mainly because of the old saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; but let me be the 1st to say That Was NOT The Case Here!I Had been wanting a razor which provided comfort, durability,reliability and effortlessly smooth shaving. Once thought impossible until I tried the Gillette Fusion PowerGlide Power. The MicroComb seemed to guide the stubble while the micro thin blades made clean precise close cuts for the perfect shave. I knew for sure I would have to do some fancy \\&quot;barber type\\&quot; tricks to shave the lower-neck/throat area and under the nose but once again the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power made this feat extremely effortlessly as well with its precision trimmer design. I have fair skin that is subject to redness and that burning sensation after a shave at times but this razor moves with the structure of your face for one clean, smooth, fine shave. Over the years I have tried my share of razors but Hands Down this just may be the best razor on the market today.. You also you have the option of using the razor manually or with power and along with its state of the art design, the comfortable handle grip to the easy snap on cartridge..What more can I say.. Well Done. I recommend all men who shave using a razor or have been curious about this product to give this one a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed I assure you.. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is.. Simply The Best!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades are unbelievable! They are sharp and stay sharp through the entire use of the blade. I have very thick and course facial hair and even after shaving daily, all other blades after the first shave would leave stumble, pull hairs or even just be plain dull after just the first use. I have already been using this razor 10 days and shaved with them each and everyday and still a nice sharp close cut! Gillette got it right this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE* I received the razor free to test via a program ran by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product . It is sharp enough to leave you with a clean shave but does not irritate or tug at the skin .I have experience no cuts with this razor . If you would like a clean shave and a smooth face without razor burn this product is for you . I have also noticed I do not get ingrown hairs with this product .</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor through a program Gillette was running and was disappointed each time I used it. These blades felt like they were ripping my hair out compared to the [[ASIN:B0039LMTBK Gillette Mach3 Turbo Cartridges 10 Count]] blades. The blades did seem to give me a closer shave, hence the 2 stars, than the Mach3 blades, but the ripping feeling isn&#x27;t something I can handle on a daily basis. I will be going back to the Mach3 Turbo.</li>
    <li> Amazing shave, after using a electric shaver for some time now the difference is night and day.  I think the last blades I used were Mach 3 and I have to say this has changed my mind about shaving with a razor.  Super smooth, no irritation.  I&#x27;m glad I received these as a program from Gillette so I could give them a try and give shaving with a razor another shot!</li>
    <li> Gillette blade review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, in the interest of full disclosure, I used to be one of the people who mocked the whole idea of &amp;#34;more blades&amp;#34;. Not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleasantly surprised by the shave I&#x27;ve gotten from this product! It is extremely smooth and shaves very close. I am one of the guys whose beard isn&#x27;t terribly thick or noticeable to begin with, so being able to shave close works well for me. I can go up to 3 days on one shave and the new gillette fusion power blades seem like they are doing a great job for me! As I said, I was a skeptic, but I am now a believer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Gillette, for sending me these blades! I am sure I am going to keep using them!</li>
    <li> I received the free razor via a great program run by Gillette. They even included a free ProGlide power blade!!!! These blades are unbelievable! They are sharp and stay sharp through the entire use of the blade. I have to shave every morning. If any of you out there like me know the razors of the past just didn&#x27;t hold up well, tugged at your hair, and had to be thrown away after a couple of uses. After a couple of uses with my new ProGlide fusion power it is absolutely the best razors money can buy. I can shave every morning now without fear of razor burn, tugs, and cuts. Besides all of that the blades give a good shave. Don&#x27;t waste your money with any other razors, pay the extra dough and get the fusion ProGlide, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I received a blade from Gillette and I was impressed.  It is the closest shave I have ever had with no irritation and I never seem to have to go back over the same area.  I have been using the same blade for a few weeks now and it still seems to be going on strong and I have to shave EVERY DAY!</li>
    <li> I got this razor from a program run by Gillette.  I have to say I do like the razor and it does work better than the Gillette mach 3 turbo that I had.  It gave a smoother shave which was nice.  The only \\&quot;down-side\\&quot; is that I doubt I will get more blades for the trimmer since I have the ProGlide Razor.  Although, I guess the re-fills would work for either one.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors since I started shaving, over 25 years ago. I was given the Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program run by Gillette, so I fugured I would give it a try. I lathered up, turned on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide and started shaving. The vibrating handle seemed to prevent the blades from doing any kind of pulling of my whiskers. This was no small feat, as I hadn&#x27;t shaved for 5 days. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide glided smoothly over my face and left it feeling baby soft. The trim blade was also a treat to use. It made trimming near my ears and around my goatee anything but a chore. I woke up the next morning and my face was still baby soft and smooth.These blades make shaving less of a chore and more of a treat. I am definitely sold.</li>
    <li> This Gillette styler is amazing in every way. cool modern design, water proof, delivers a close clean shave without irritation. all at an extremely affortable prife. very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I got the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge from Gillette . Super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything. LOVE the vibration - it feels like I&#x27;m NOT shaving. No razor bumps. I couldn&#x27;t be happier .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion these are closest, most comfortable blades available today. I have a heavy beard and sensitive skin, so I am always on the lookout for a better shaver. I have tried several electrics and of course they are no match for a blade. I have tried the Schick multi blade shavers and the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power with the vibrating handle is better. The blades really do seem to glide over my skin, and if I re-shave against the grain, I get the closest shave I have ever had. This is an improvement over the older Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free through a program via Gillette. I had heard about Gillete razors before and Ive been very tempted to try them, but new is scary to me. I was very excited when I got these in the mail. I will never use a different brand of razors EVER!!! The Gillette proglide razor has given me the best shave. My face is so soft after i shave! For my prefession i have to look clean with a nice suit and a clean face! Ive gotten many compliments on how clear my face has looked since using them. I would buy them in the future!!!! I also highly recommend the Gillette proglide razors to every guy out there</li>
    <li> These blades do not pull your hairs when you are shaving, they require very little force to pull across your face to shave. Normally. I shave with just hot water and no soapy lather or shaving cream, and these razors work great like that with zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side of these blades there is a standard razor that they call a \\&quot;detail razor\\&quot; that works very well to get those last stray hairs near your face near your ear or nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that these razors are in fact replacements so once you have the shaving handle, there is no extra space taken up for storing all kinds of handles that will end up in the garbage once their cutting surface dulls (like with a traditional razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it seems like these razors will last about a month before needing replacement. I do hone the razor head by running the razor backward in my jeans which makes them seem to stay sharper for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did some of these razors for free through a program that was being ran by Gillette, this did not influence my review in any way.</li>
    <li> These blades were provided to me free of charge with a promotion from Gillette.  These razors are one of the best razors I have used.  The blades cut my hair so close that I do not have to shave my face for an extra day (one more day longer then when using an old razor).  Overall This is a great addition.  The only downfall is the cost of the refills.  But its worth it.</li>
    <li> These blades were provided to me by Gillette as part of a campaign for its Fusion ProGlide Styler. I&#x27;m quite familiar with Gillette blades, and the performance of these did not deviate from my previous experience. For the first few shaves, these blades are second to none. They cut very close, very smoothly, and I have never experienced a nick from a Gillette product. It is, dare I say, a luxurious shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it all goes to hell. Gillette&#x27;s lubricating strips are a pet peeve of mine. They quickly lose all lubrication, and begin to systematically shred after the second or third shave. The blades themselves hold out a little longer, but not much. After a week&#x27;s worth of shaving hair is removed more by friction than by cutting. Frankly, the blades self-destruct in fairly short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this must be considered in the perspective of value. Forgive my miserliness, but these blades are outrageously expensive. Broken down, each blade costs approximately $4 if purchased on Amazon. Compare that with, say, Gillette&#x27;s CustomPlus razors, which are available at your local bulk goods store in a 52 pack for $25 (or 50 cents per), and you have to wonder why these cost so much more. Is the shave better? Perhaps. Better by $3.50 every 3 days? Hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the blades, if only they weren&#x27;t so dear, and their usefulness so fleeting. Until one or both deficiencies are rectified, I must vote against.</li>
    <li> I really like this Gillette Fusion Pro Glide trimmer. The blades were sharp and did not pull or nick. Nice close shave and no rash  after. Good quality product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used these blades for about a week and a half now. I love them. They leave my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I can tell that they are well made and that Gilette really though about the audience that would be using these. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was extremly suprised with Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge. I always felt that electric razors didnt really shave to well so I have been very skeptic to try new products. I was definilty suprised when I got the option from Gillette to try this for free. This proglide power cartridge has been one of the best power cartridges I have used. It does a clean shave, with hardly any knicks and cuts. I would suggest this for anyone who is looking to switch from a disposable razor to power opereated one. ONe thing I wish Gillette would consider is changing it from battery operated to self charging. But as of right now im not making any complaints- seem to hold the juice as long as i needed.</li>
    <li> The blades are really good. They cut every piece of hair that there is and it doesn&#x27;t hurt either so I would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this from a free trial sponsored by Gillette and all I can say is \\&quot;smooth and fast\\&quot;. Amazing razor. Love using it. Definitely recommend this razor if you&#x27;re looking for fast, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I really like the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades. I&#x27;ve used them for a few weeks now (I received them as a free demo through Gillette), and they give a really close shave. The blades seem to be super-thin and sharp, and shave very close with fewer passes than my previous cartridge. The lubrication strip has held up well, so far, and really makes things glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about them is the way they&#x27;re angled with the handle - I prefer more of a right-angle grip than a straight pull-type angle, but that&#x27;s more the handle&#x27;s fault, and not the blades themselves.</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizing blades of the proglide power blades! I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break my face out at all and the shave is so close cut my wife loves to wipe her hands across my cheek where as before she would tell me it was spiky like barbed wire. I only wished the moisture strip lasted a little longer.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide blades are great. I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for awhile, until I got a free trial from Gillette. The blades were smooth, no tugging or irritation. The on;y drawback is price. All Gillette blades are super-expensive. I also think that the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; or vibrating option while shaving is necessary, although it helps when rinsing of the blade, I don&#x27;t use it during shaving.</li>
    <li> I received this free as a sample product from a program run by Gillette. The quality of the shave was actually nice. Normally, my skin become irritated from blades and as a result, I break out around the areas I shave, and my skin becomes annoyingly red. This is more gentler because of how easier it glides (mainly due to the sharpness of the blades). Make sure, with any blade-shaver, to not press too hard onto the skin as you shave, because that WILL cause damage to the skin. If used correctly, the fusion proglide power works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I personally prefer electric razors, but this is still a decent substitute.</li>
    <li> I received this Gilette Fusion Proglide Power from a program Gillette was running. I had seen the power version before but I always thought it was just a gimmic or different just to be different. It really does provide a closer shave and leaves your face feeling smoother and softer. The blades vibrate for the closest shave. They are the same quality blades that Gillette is known for.</li>
    <li> After letting my face go for over 3 weeks I used these blades to give me a nice and smooth shave without irritation....love these blades and worth the money</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in a program Gillette sponsored for the Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge. Gillette provided me with the razor and the Fusion Proglide Power cartridge. I have been using their Mach3 for many years now and have been very satisfied. I have a tough beard and over the years it has gotten tougher (gray hair, LOL). I have always had my doubts about a razor that vibrates...until now. The rows of 5 blades allow me to shave in a short period of time without having to go back and shave over the same areas. It seems the extra blades give me a closer shave on my coarse beard. The lubricating strip keeps my \\&quot;baby face\\&quot; intact while allowing the blades to cut my tough beard. The vibration will take some getting used to, but the Fusion Proglide Power will be replacing my Mach3. That says a lot since I have been using the Mach3 for almost 15 years.</li>
    <li> Got the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER BLADES for free from Gillette to test and I was pleasantly surprised. A close shave without irritation. Smooth faces and baby soft skin like my wife loves.</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor.  It delivered a sharp, crisp, clean shave, one time through.  I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times (so far) but the \\&quot;blade integrity\\&quot; is still fully intact, and hopefully will so for a bit longer.  I just liked the way it felt to my face, and the shave was close, comfortable and clean.  Very minimal razor burn / bleeds.  In fact, none at all this first time, very, very little the second time.  I&#x27;ve loved the performance of the blades (nothing is worse than having to go over the same spots several times because the blade just doesn&#x27;t cut it.).  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor through a program run by Gillette.  I received the box in the mail and liked the packaging of the razor, esp how easy it was to open and remove the razor itself.  I didn&#x27;t need to get a scissor or a blade to remove it.  The packaging was also very colorful and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from the Mach 3 razor to the Fusion ProGlide Power razor...  I was very pleased with the results after my recent shaves.  I found that using this razor, with the power feature, has caused me less pain when shaving, esp when I have several days growth to shave.  After shaving, I feel I&#x27;ve received a closer, smoother shave than before, and fewer nicks/cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Fusion ProGlide Power razor to all men!  Next to a professional straight razor shave, this is the next best thing!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion is a good but not great product. It is battery powered which gives it the feel of a electric shaver. It not as smooth as a shave that I would like and feel that it could have been a little sharper. Its a good companion product but doesn&#x27;t totally replace electric shaver. I like the fact that the plastic package was easy to open and it has a good appearance. If it was a little sharper it will be a great product.</li>
    <li> So I got this FREE RAZOR and HANDLE from GILLETTE and using it the first time was great. When I went to use it several days later, which was actually 4 days. The razor seemed to tug against my skin which is not very tough. I usually don&#x27;t get nicked either, but I actually nicked my chin with this razor. The handle was easy to control ever after it became wet. I don&#x27;t know how much this handle and razor cost, but I would more than likely not purchase it due to the issue. It was worth it being free, but don&#x27;t look for me being in the store to purchase it, thank you GILLETTE.</li>
    <li> I have sensative skin and have been using the gelette trio power for the last year and have had minimal problems with it.  Now that I have tried the Proglide Power I am never going back.  Closer, smoother and most of all absolutley no irritation this razor and blade system are the best i have ever used!!</li>
    <li> I agree that this is the best razor on the market today...although a bit expensive. However I was able to get this razor via promotion by Gillette. I&#x27;m very impressed with this razor. My skin is as smooth as a counter top. I have had tons of razors that did not give me the shave I was wanting and it was not pleasant. But with this razor the blade moves with your structure of your face. I want like to say thank you for creating this razor. The only negative other than price is that it seems to loose its ability to give a great shave a bit quicker than other blades.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Gillette for the Fusion ProGlide Power and gave it a try.  It is a little weird to have it vibrating across your face (and in my case my bald head), but it was also somehow oddly soothing.  The handle was comfortable in my hand and it provided for a very comfortable effortless shave.  What I really wanted to know is how these $4 per cartridge razors stack up against my usual $1.25 per cartridge triple blade cheapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the experiment:&lt;br /&gt;I shaved the right side of my head/face with the Fusion ProGlide Power and I shaved the left side of my head/face with my cheaper blades.  While the Fusion ProGlide Power was a more comfortable shave, it did not really save any time.  After careful comparison, it seems that both sides were equally smooth.  Now it has been about 36 hours since my experiment and I have repeatedly carefully evaluated the growth.  Again, I found that both sides grew out equally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: If you have sensitive skin and need a comfortable shave, this could be for you.  If you think you will somehow get a closer, faster, or longer lasting shave, don&#x27;t bank on it.  I admit I have used it only once and will continue to use it until the blade is used up before i decide if I want to buy more blades.  As of this moment, I think I will stick to my cheap blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I USED IT AFTER NOT SHAVING FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS AND IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE LONGER STUBBLES WITH EASE AND WITHOUT THE BLADE CLOG THAT MY CHEAP RAZORS EXPERIENCE.  I LOVE IT!!  I DO BELIEVE IT IS FASTER AND MORE COMFORTABLE.  Still not necessarily closer or longer lasting though.  Really loving the razor more and more with each use!  If the blade lasts upt o a month like Gillette says it will, I am definitely switching!  I&#x27;ll switch if the blade lasts 10-14 days!  AND I&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THE VIBRATING POWER HANDLE THAT IT COMES WITH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2:  Been using this almost a year now and will never use another razor!  I also realized something unusual... I am balding and shave my whole head.  I often nicked myself with the cheap razors (top of ears and back of head).  Not ONE nick in 11 months!  I am not even careful anymore, I just blast right through the shave without fear of nicking myself.  I have no idea how it avoids nicks, but it does!something unusual...

    <li> I have got this product free from Gillete .first product I&#x27;ve been totally satisfied with Gillette Fusion proglide power cartridge. A blade will last me about a month (OK.I don&#x27;t always shave everyday,but the cumulative amount of growth is the same).Even if I go a week without shaving,it takes my growth off neatly,cleanly,painlessly.I am happy to strongly recommend this Gillete Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge. it&#x27;s great to finally find something that works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was offered the chance to try the Fusion Proglide Power Razor through a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve been a loyal and satisfied user of their Mach 3 model for a while now, and I was curious to see if it was worth it to upgrade to something like this.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out, I will say that the quality of the blade is up to par with Gillette&#x27;s standards. I get a consistently smooth shave without nicks or cuts. The handle is serviceable and provides good grip and maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the vibration is supposed to accomplish, though. I found it distracting and obtained much better results after turning it off.</li>
    <li> I got to try a free cartridge provided via a program run by Gillette. I like the precision trimmer as I hate a ragged line in my sideburns. The lubrastrip in my opinion is to sticky the first time you shave and not adequate after that. I like that the multiblades and microcomb help with preventing razor rash and razor bumps for the hair on my neck that normally become ingrown.</li>
    <li> Let just say wow is it smooth, I have used all of these types of razors before and this one gives quite a smooth shave. Best part no pulling or drag on your skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> i recently received some Gillette razors through a Gillette program and i must say im a big fan.  ive used Gillette in the past and had no idea the difference one little battery could make.  if you haven&#x27;t tried it, i recommend you do very soon!</li>
    <li> I received a free Proglide cartridge through a program run by Gillette. I am used to using cheaper blades and just \\&quot;dealing\\&quot; with the issues and razor burn. I would have to say I&#x27;m sold on it. It is Smooth and shaves quite very easily. After finishing, I had much less irritation and a little after shave took care of that without a problem. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who wants a smooth irritation free shave!</li>
    <li> Buzzagent.com sent me the Proglide power razor with the matching Proglide Power Cartridge to test. This cartridge has given me the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had. I have an average growth of facial hair and I think the coarseness of the facial hair is just a bit heavy.The only issue I have with the cartridge is that the blades seem to dull too fast. With that said it dulls at the same rate as the Gillette Fusion I have been using for several years now. I have been using the cartridge for 1 week now shaving every day. I have decided to keep using these cartridges because of the superior shave it has been giving me.</li>
    <li> I received Proglide Styler through a program run by Gillette. I was a Gillette customer from the moment I started shaving.  I recently switched to the Dollar Shave Club, not so much about cost, but more about convenience. However, the blades pale in comparison. I switch my blade once a week with Gillette, but with Dollar, that left me with unsatisfactory shaves, so they may be inexpensive, but not a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In evaluating the ProGlide Styler, I came away impressed with its versatility, but was immediately convinced I need to switch back to Gillette.  I really missed that close shave.  I was never interested in trying a power blade, but now I get it.</li>
    <li> I really like the Proglide power blades. My husband received it free from a program run by Gillette. He says: \\&quot;I like how the handle is easy to grip and firm. The razor gives me a good close shave that feels smooth. I would definitely recommend this razor.\\&quot; Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillett Fusion ProGlide from a promotion Gillette was running. I had been wanting to try the razor and was thrilled to be selected to try it. The blades give a very clean, smooth cut. There has not been any pulling or cutting of my skin. The only complaint I have is the cartridge swivels very easy, it just seems loose to me but hasn&#x27;t really affected the shave. I just like a little more tension in the swivel. I only shave about twice a week and have only had for a couple of weeks, so i can&#x27;t say how many shaves the blades will give.I habe enjoyed the product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for free as a Promotion run by Gillette.  It was not as close of a shave as I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette pro fusion razor as part of a special promotion offered by Gillette. I&#x27;ve used the Gillette mach 3 power razors in the past but I&#x27;ve gotta say the 5 blade razor head provides a smoother finish cut than the 3 blades or any single blade razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The only real downside is the head is larger and bulkier. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get into the tight corners like underneath your nose as good as I&#x27;d like. They provide a single razor blade on the back side of the head for this exact purpose.  It takes a little more thought and time to shave but the shave is closer, it pulls less and leaves my skin smooth and comfortable. I&#x27;m definitely a fusion proglider now.</li>
    <li> This was a great razor that did not leave a burn at all. I have used the same blades for over a three weeks and they dulled yet. The best part is the single razor on the back that allows for detailed trimming around the ears and nose. I got these razors free through a program with Gillette</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a free fusion proglide power razor to try. I like the way the thin blades gave me a close cut. The handle was easy to grip and very manageable. I did not like the vibration on the razor, it did not help the shave. Overall a good close cut.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades have 5 ultra-sharp blades which give a very close shave. I like the leading edge which pulls up the hairs enough to cut them but does not apply excessive drag. The pivot design of the head allows the blades to glide across the skin while conforming to natural curves. I found that after using the razor for approximately two weeks, that it still remained as sharp as when I first used it. This product was provided to me as part of a program through Gillette and will continue to be part of my daily grooming routine.</li>
    <li> These Fusion ProGlide Power cartridges are fantastic for a close shave, for the first couple of shaves anyways. They do seem to dull out quickly. I loved how close the shave was and the length of time before the stubble grew back but the number of shaves wasn&#x27;t as long as I would have liked. I got these through a free trial that Gillette made available and will probably buy more but I hope they extend the life on future blades.</li>
    <li> In my opinion these are closest, most comfortable blades available today. I have a heavy beard and sensitive skin, so I am always on the lookout for a better shaver. I have tried several electrics [Norelco &amp; Braun] and of course they are no match for a blade. I have tried the Schick multi blade shavers and the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power with the vibrating handle is better. The blades really do seem to glide over my skin, and if I re-shave against the grain, I get the closest shave I have ever had. This is an improvement over the older Gillette Fusion. I also recommend using the Gillete Fusion Thermal Face Scrub just prior to shaving. It heats up the skin and seems to thicken and raise the beard hairs so the shave is even closer. i got a free sample from bzz and when i tried it i fell in love.</li>
    <li> The added vibrations that the razor gives these makes the shave even closer! The manual ones work well, but the power cartridges work even better! I prefer these over the manual. I will continue to buy these, I think I found my new favorite razor! I highly recommend you at least try it - I got it from Gillette to try out. And I am grateful they let me do that!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge for approximately two weeks and I am very pleased with the results! I use it every day and I get a close shave every time. This razor works excellent with the Gillette Fusion shaving cream! It is easy to rinse out and even after two weeks of use is still shaving very well. I recommend this product to anyone that wants to have a close and smooth feeling face after shaving. You will not be disappointed! Thank you Gillette for sending me the razor to try through your marketing program!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide from Gillette free through a promotion. I think this blade is the best I have ever used. I have fairly sensitive skin, especially on my neck, and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide worked great for my skin. It provided a super smooth shave and minimized the irritation I usually receive when I shave.  I feel like this is because the blades are very thin and did not pull on my whiskers and just cut them cleanly. I also really like the Precision Trimmer Blade. It is terrific for cleaning up my sideburns and my goatee. I think the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a free program run by Gillette.  Free is always good, right?  Anyway, after using this razor for a week I found that it does in fact offer the closest and most comfortable shave compared to any other razor I have tried in the past.  I really think the thinner blades help out tremendously.  On the down side, I did find it a bit awkward to use around my beard line.  I did try the single \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; blade on the reverse side of the front edge with little luck.  Although, this could just be me and a matter of getting used to it. Another downfall is the price of the cartridges; not to single out this brand, I think they are all overpriced.  Overall, I think this is an exceptional razor and will more than likely continue to use it (even though they are pricy).</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first on the claims Gillette made about this razor for less tug and pull. I have fast growing coarse facial hair and all razors I have ever used have a hard time cutting without even a little pulling. I have been using a Mach 3 Razor for years now and had to shave every other day in order to get a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First test(daily shaving):&lt;br /&gt;Time to test the Fusion ProGlide Power After applying shave gel, I grabbed the  razor and pressed the button to activate the vibration. As I started shaving the vibration felt like a mini facial massage and the blades cut effortlessly. The only issue I had was on my upper lip where the larger blade was difficult to use and the single blade on the back was not much more helpful. Once finished, I was surprised to have a very smooth and cut free face without pulling of hairs.  My face much smoother than I have been used to while using the Mach 3.  I continued to use the razor daily for another week with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second test(once a week shaving):&lt;br /&gt;Every so often I  do not feel like shaving and want to grow out my beard a little. Once 7 days have passed I will usually shave and start fresh. I once again pulled out the Fusion ProGlide Power razor and popped in a new blade to try out on longer facial hair. This is where this razor struggled and I did have some hair pulling. It slightly outperformed the Mach 3 in this test, but it was NOT a comfortable shave. I would recommend using a trimmer to cut the hair down to a stubble before using on longer facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, If you need a razor for daily shaves and want a smooth comfortable shave, you can not go wrong with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor.</li>
    <li> The blades are the best blades I ever tried. Since I tried them they are the only blades I buy. Very close shave no tugging or nicks.I got this free razor and it was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> What a great blade. very clean close shave. Love the extra trim blade on the back. Cleans out easily and stays sharp. highly recommended</li>
    <li> With the 5 blades I am able to get the closest shave I ever thought possible. I received this from a promotion run by Gillette in return for my opinion. I can&#x27;t believe how sharp they are when new and what a good shave I receive from these blades. They don&#x27;t stay as sharp as long as I would like but they are still better than other blades I have used.</li>
    <li> The blades to my styler are amazing! They provide a smooth and close shave without any cuts or nicks. I got them free via a Gillette promotion but they are definitely worth the asking price! Give them a try for yourself and you be the judge.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free via a program run by Gillette. The cartridge for the Gillette Fusion Proglide is great! Blades are thin and provide a close shave that lasts all day. I no longer get razor burn or any type of irritation from shaving. It&#x27;s also easy to change the cartridge on the razor. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the fusion blades and never had a problem with them except for a little razor burn. I was supplied with the proglide by a program run by Gillette. After two weeks of use I am very pleased with my shave. Goodbye razor burn.The lubrastrip is still intact. Unlike other razors after 5-6 shaves it is gone. The strip leaves my skin feeling so good and smooth. The Precision trimmer works great as well, perfect for those sensitive spots around the bottom of my nose and laying a clean line on my sideburns. I have found my new favorite razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can find is I have a hard time rinsing the hair out of the blades. That can be from my thick facial hair though, still gets a 5 out of 5 from me.</li>
    <li> I tried the Fusion Proglide Power blades as part of a promotion from Gillette, and I have to say that Gillette isn&#x27;t doing anything to lose my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m pretty much only shaving my neck, as I&#x27;ve had a beard on my face for about 3 years.  Needless to say, the neck is a pretty damn sensitive place, and these Fusion Proglide Power blades gave me a really close shave without any irritation.  Now, I&#x27;m not sure that I need 5 blades in one cartridge for a good shave, but I definitely appreciate the single blade on the outside edge for trimming tight lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ve been a fan of Gillette since I started shaving 20 years ago, and I&#x27;m pretty confident that they&#x27;ll have me as a customer for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge from a free trial sponsored by Gillette. Have to say, I continue to be impressed by Gillettes products.  The blades gave me a smooth and close shave, without any cuts or bumps to leave painful reminders.  I&#x27;m a fan now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used disposable razors but no more. There is no comparison, I&#x27;ve had the best smoothest shave ever. These cartridges whitch I got thru a program run by Gillette give me a close smooth shave with no tugging and glides effortlessly on my skin.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.  I had previously been using an electric razor.  I can&#x27;t really compare this to any other blades, but compared to the electric, it&#x27;s no contest.  I haven&#x27;t had a shave this close in years.  Plus, I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for almost 3 weeks and I&#x27;m just now starting to consider getting a new one.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from a company supported by Gillette and I must say it is the best razor I have ever used I will for sure be purchasing this from now on. It makes my face so smooth all day long.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this item as I have been using almost a month have not had to change blade yet I will say gillette has done it again giving me the best shave what will they think of next. ( I am a guy but I logged in under our account and it says my wifes name no idea how to change it.recived this product FREE via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for FREE via a program run by Gillette and was pleasantly surprised at the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would notice a difference in shaving. You see all the commercials on tv about close shave, but I was blown away by the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a clean look. I am sold.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from a Gillette promotion.  I have used the regular Fusion blades before, but these do seem to be even better (less pressure needed and smoother result).  I haven&#x27;t used shaving cream in years (just warm water), and with blades of this quality there really is no need for the mess.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference with the vibrating \\&quot;power\\&quot; feature on or off...this may be just a gimmick.</li>
    <li> Being in the army, guys are constantly complaining about shaving and razor burn. The other day when I was out in the field, I told my friend the best secret to a good shave is the right blade! And went on to explain about how awesome the Gillette fusion power ProGlide works for sensitive skin.  Honestly this is the best blade I have ever had! Being in the military requires me to shave, on a daily bases and the worst thing is a bad blade. I got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide power cartridge and I can&#x27;t stop using them. Here are the pros:  closest blade ever, allow band doesn&#x27;t dry out skin &amp; prevents razor burn, rubber edges prevent cuts, provide smooth and comfortable shave. The 5 blade requires minimal swipes for a close shave. I would recommend this blade to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have received these free razor cartridges  provided via a program run by Gillette.. to say i was very impressed.  They are gentle on my face and moves smoothly over my face with less pulling and tugging from my skin which in return &#x3D; less cuts and nicks!!  Gillette products alway give me a good shave.  After shaving my face feels soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I honestly thought to myself if this really is the The Best a Man Can Get when I first received the razor. My friend informed me of a program that Gillette was holding and I said to myself why not I might as well try it out and that I like free stuff. After signing up for the program I received my Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Styler with two weeks. I really doubted this shaver I even stopped shaving for a while so that I could try every function. I really wanted to test this shaver to it&#x27;s limits. I was a user of another brand and thought my mind was set. I then removed the shaver from a fancy packaging and went to the bathroom to lather my face with shaving cream. I didn&#x27;t understand why the shaver came with multiple attachments but after using it I now understand. The shaver comes with replacement attachments which is nice. I tried the trimmer first and before hand I was thinking that the shaver wasn&#x27;t going to be strong enough, but I got to say I was wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth the shave was. then I tried it without any attachments and again it was able to handle my thick coarse hair. Last but not least is that shaver attachment it was a attachment that took me a little bit of time to get used to because I wasn&#x27;t used to using Gillette&#x27;s products. Again I was surprised. It was a very smooth shave and my girlfriend stated that my face didn&#x27;t feel as smooth until now. So to end this review, yes it is the best a man can get. Thank you Gillette for opening my mind to something that I will be using for now on.</li>
    <li> I have both the Proglide Styler and the Proglide Razor. I noticed that these razors worked much better on the Razor than they did on the styler. It may have been because the styler handle is much bulkier, but there definitely was a noticeable difference. Once I had them on the razor I was very impressed with how close and comfortable the shave was. I would definitely recommend these if you plan to use them on the razor!</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette products before and have been somewhat skeptical. Using a blade generally gives me horrible razor burn. So when I got this razor from a free Gillette trial, I tried the razor I was prepared for the worst. I had never tried a vibrating razor before so I was at least curious. I clipped on the shaving attachment and turned it on. To my surprise my razor burn was not bad at all. With the combination of the gel strip and the vibration I had a close clean shave without the skin irritation. The blades were sharp and worked just fine. I&#x27;m not a fan of the blades because they are to the point where adding more blades doesn&#x27;t enhance the product anymore. The blade is at least interchangeable with the normal Gillette blades and easily replaceable. You don&#x27;t have to depend on buying a special blade that costs an arm and a leg. I definitely approve of this product. I don&#x27;t often shave with a razor, but when I do I use the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide styler. ;)</li>
    <li> I recently received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blade set from a program for Gillette.  After using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade that was sent to me by Gillette to try out, I have to say that even small advancements in blade technology can have an impact on the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;The power glide blades leave no irritation bumps or rash and leaves my skin feeling baby soft.</li>
    <li> I recently had the chance to try out these blades for free thru a program by Gillette and I have converted!! This was the best shave I have ever had. Very smooth on my skin. It glides right over the skin so smoothly that I didn&#x27;t think it was actually removing the hair at all. The lubricating strip is great as well and really adds a nice finishing touch to the shave. I have had no issues shaving with or against the grain and since using these blades I have not had any razor burn or irritation at all!! The shave is so close and so smooth that I do not shave as often as I did before. For me these blades are absolutely amazing and I have replaced my old razor with this! For as great of a shave the price of these cartridges is a great value!!</li>
    <li> I will admit that it isn&#x27;t the smoothest shave the first time over. It takes a few strokes to get the desired length. However, I am willing to sacrifice a once-over shave for not having my hair pulled from my face. This does a great job at not yanking my hair out. Much to my happiness, I got one FREE from a program sponsored by Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfaction, Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really great product that I think is so nicely made for those guys that do not want razor burn. Nice to know that there is a product out there that is geared toward the sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These razor blades are great. I received them through a promotion run by Gillette. They provide a very nice and smooth shave. The lubricating strip is definitely helpful. The mini-comb that is built in, i think, really helps with a nice smooth shave. I would definitely recommend this razor blade. It is definitely work the money.</li>
    <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for free from a program from Gillette. I had purchased the Manual proglide before, but this was the first time trying the Power. I really did not think that the power razor would make much of a difference, but it really did. It took a couple of times to get used to the vibrating, but that&#x27;s to be expected since I am used to a manual razor. Luckily I did not cut myself at all using the razor, so that was a plus. I did feel that the power made the shave closer, and last longer. I did not experience any razor burn or discomfort. I will be using the power razor from now on.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I have very sensitive skin. I received the ProGlide Power Blade for free from a program run by Gillette. At this point in life, I am used to being irritated when shaving. To me, being irritated is simply part of doing it. Before I used the ProGlide Power Blade I was expecting it to be like every other blade. To my surprise, the blade irritated me less than any other blades I have used. Even though as usual I was irritated after shaving, the irritation was significantly less. The ProGlide Power Blade did not perform any miracles, but it did help with  the irritation. I would recommend the ProGlide Power Blade to someone with sensitive skin; but on any other aspect, the blade performed like any other average blade.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving the free ProGlide Power razor cartridge provided by Gillette I was a bit skeptical. The idea of a vibrating razor head increasing the closeness of the shave is certainly a gimmick. Compared to my manual razor cartridges, I noticed no significant different. It provided a great shave, but I can&#x27;t say it was better than  powerless shave. With or without the power, an equally great shave will be achieved.</li>
    <li> I was picked for a program thru Gillette to text out the razor for these blades.  I danced around purchasing this but was unsure about it feeling it was a bit too expensive.  Being able to try for free was smart on Gillettes part, I will never switch now. They only reason I gave it a 4 star is because of the price, I live on a budget and they are a tad high.  But that being said... This is they closest shave I have ever had.  I bought an eight pack replacement a month ago, I still have 6 left, the blade holds up and I shave a couple times a week. Def.ly something you sould splurge for.</li>
    <li> I was able to receive this cartridge through a program run by Gilette, and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: The Proglide power cartridge holds up to Gilette&#x27;s usual high standards.  Despite shaving 5-7 days a week, and usually skipping shaving cream, the blades provide an easy, close shave.  I feel almost no drag even when shaving abainst the grain, or trying to get trickier areas around my jawline.  Razor burn is also a very rare occurence.  The blades are easy to clean for the most part, and stubble rinses out without an effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Although the blades generally clean easily, stubble can huild up at the edges, and needs to be cleaned out manually, which can be an annoyance.  Also, for anyone who does need to shave constantly, the blades have a comparitively short shelf life (4-5 days usually) before noticeably dulling.</li>
    <li> I really like the comfort of these blades. I use Fusion ProGlide Power blades to shave the sensitive neck area under my beard and for my entire head. I have my head bald and it looks like glass after using the Fusion ProGlide Power Blades. The 5 blades and lubrication strip give such a close and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades that I received to try out through a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have used other razors before including the orange fusion razor that came before this and I can honestly say this is the best razor I have ever used. Not only does it get the closest out of any razor I have ever used but it also felt like I wasn&#x27;t even shaving. Disclosure: I am a Bzzagent and got a free razor to try from Gillette.</li>
    <li> Received Gillette fusion proglide razor through a program sponsored by Gillette and was pleasantly surprised. I used the razor and received the smoothest,closest shave I ever have gotten. I couldn&#x27;t even tell that the razor was cutting my beard. I still felt clean shaven at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> After using this product my face never felt so soft and smooth. It did a real nice job getting those hard to cut spots. If you have sensitive skin like I do your in luck, no irritation whatsoever! These blades are easily the best I&#x27;ve ever used, I received these blades for free from Gillette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This Gillette razor has convinced me to change brands.  The vibration may or may not be effective but with or without it the shave was more comfortable and closer than the other 5 blade product I have been using.  Even if the vibration does not help the shave, it still feels like a manly face massage and feels good.  I have found my new razor.</li>
    <li> The thinner....sharper blades a definate plus...was greatly surprised to receive such a great product to try out compliments of a gillette sponsored tryout program. has a nice durable lotion strip and keeps its  smooth shaving sharp edge longer than I figured it would.</li>
    <li> I started using the unpowered version of this razor 2 years ago. I thought that was the ultimate in manual razors, but I tried the Power Glide version and that is even better. I wish they had this 40 years ago, shaving would have been muvh less painful if they had. It gives a quick shave, a close shave and further reduces cuts/nicks. Defintely the best shaving tool I have ever tired.</li>
    <li> I used the Gillette fusion proglide power razor for the first time yesterday.  The razor gave me a close shave with no irritation.  The shave was smooth and very easy.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> First, a little about me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I shave every morning during the week, but not always on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;2) I always shave immediately after taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;3) I use a Noxema foam shaving cream applied with my hands (not a brush).&lt;br /&gt;4) I have a couple of \\&quot;tricky\\&quot; spots that I usually have to go over multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;5) I always take shave first with the grain of my beard, then I take a second pass going against the grain.  I it&#x27;s not recommended to shave against the grain, but this is the method that gets me the close shave I like.&lt;br /&gt;6) I&#x27;ve been using Gillete Fusion Power blades for several years, but I had never tried the ProGlide Power blade before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one of the ProGlide Power blades free through a program run by Gillete, so I tried to pay close attention to the difference between this blade and my normal blade to see if it would be worth buying the ProGlides in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, before I tried the new blades, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see much difference.  However, if you read through my little shaving  bio above, you&#x27;ll notice two things that are less than optimal (1) the tricky spots; and (2) the fact that I have to take a double pass when shaving in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for so long that I can&#x27;t say that either of these things really bothered me too much, but it was nice to see that they weren&#x27;t an issue with the ProGlides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tricky spots by my chin were clean after a single pass with the blade.  I went over it once and it was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall shave going with the grain of my beard was also much closer than with my existing blades, so I decided it wasn&#x27;t necessary to take another pass against the grain.  The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as when I go against the grain, but it was definitely close enough to make me feel that going over it again wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I ended up with a shave I was very happy with that saves me a few extra seconds in the morning.  The biggest benefit, though, is that I expect my blades to last much longer.  Since the ProGlide blade took care of my problem areas and I don&#x27;t have to take the second pass against the grain, I expect that the blade should last at least twice as long as my current blades.  For that reason alone, I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with the ProGlides going forward.econds in the morning.  The biggest benefit, though, is that I expect my blades to last much longer.

    <li> I really enjoyed using this razor that I received as a free promotion via gilette. It worked well, and appeared to be of superior quality. I have used this brand in the past, and have never been disappointed. It is a little more expensive than some other products, but it is a good value. I have thick facial hair and need to switch blades often, but am willing to do so for a good shave.</li>
    <li> I have used many different razors over the years and the Proglide razor is my absolute favorite!  I received my current Gillette Fusion razor through a special promotion from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide blade shaves incredibly smooth, and does not irritate my skin at all.  I used a Gillette Sensor for years (two blades) and had to replace the blade weekly; with the Proglide 5 blade cartridge I can shave for a month without replacing the cartridge.  Even so the cartridges are a bit pricey which is my only complaint at all about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect the ProGlide cartridge to be my blade of choice for years to come.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler by a program ran by Gillette.I must say I was very impressed. The styler had 3 combs to trim your beard, mustache and sideburns. I noticed the styler trimed my beard without the tug or pulling on my face. Then I finished up with the razor blade attachment and it was very easy to snap on and can be removed by a button on the side of the handle. and for the results of the blade...no nicks or cuts glides smoothly over your entire face. I would recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler to anyone who grooms and wants a product that trims and styles all in one.</li>
    <li> I picked up the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for free from a Gillette marketing program. This razor gave me one of the smoothest shaves I have ever experienced. Was always a fan of the Gillette Power series and this razor is definitly a step forward. Blades cut close for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new proglide styler that i received through a program by Gillette. The blades give me a very close shave and leaves my face very smooth. I have never nicked myself so far. I also like that the blades last a while, i&#x27;ve been shaving myself with it for about 2 weeks with the same blade and it is still as smooth as ever. The blades are expensive but with quality comes a price.</li>
    <li> I have been using the proglide razors for years now.  I was always hesitant about shaving against the grain, but with these blades I do not get as bad of a razor burn as I do with other multiblade systems.  Overall great durability also. this was a free program for me to try from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a customer and a fan of Gillette fusion since they came out with this product. It&#x27;s an amazing product that not only allows me to have the smoothest shave without damaging my skin but also allows me the precision of a straight razor to allow me to make those thin clean lines I like so much. Te best part about this product is the affordability. I&#x27;m a chef and I keep a razor at home and one in my knife kit. I&#x27;ve had the same razors for over a year now and each razor cartridge lasts me a long time. Love this product!</li>
    <li> You can find competitors blades of equal quality.  But can you pay more?</li>
    <li> I find the both the razor and the product both exceptionally good products. Clean close shave, with no nicks or cuts or irritation. Would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is an all in one tool for keeping my scruff in check! Close shave when I need smooth skin or a quick trim. You can also use it to trim the beard or stash. I deceived my trimmer free  through a special program Gillette had going on. I would go out and buy one in a heart beat</li>
    <li> I must say, bravo Gillette, my face now feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Gillette user in the past, with mixed reviews, so I was hesitant to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power. I just assumed that it was all show, and nothing else. But WOW was I wrong! I was able to try the new Gillette Fushion Proglide Power as part of a free Gillette promotion, and I was glad I was able to take part in the promotion after trying the product. Although there was a major design flaw in the comfort of the handle, the razor cartridge stole the show. Normally with Gillette razors in the past, I would have to do several passes to get the close shave that I like. After only the first swipe, I noticed this would be different. The finer, thinner razors on the Fusion ProGlide Power makes the shave closer. With only one pass, I noticed that I had the closest shave of my life, saving me time and effort.  Also, I have very sensative skin and I tend to easily get red bumps after I shave, which are quite painful. With the new finer, thinner razors on the cartridge, I have less resistance and I dont irritate my skin, saving me from painful bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I might add, I am not so sure if the constant vibrating, or \\&quot;power\\&quot;, helped the shave or not, but it did make for an interesting shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, a man who loves the closest shave possibe, but dont like the painful bumps afterwards, I recommend you try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors. I loved the shave so much that I am thinking of using them on the most important day of my life... my wedding day.</li>
    <li> I used this blade in the shower and it hardly feels like I&#x27;m using it! It&#x27;s so smooth and works great. Finally a razor that is not overly expensive and works great. I also don&#x27;t have to go over the same area of my face over and over again to achieve my results! I got this product by a program that was run by Gillette. Thank you for the opportunity to use this product!</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as part of a free campaign Gillete was offering.  I&#x27;ve used several shavers in my life and the Proglide razor has consistently given me the closest shave.  Smooth for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I wanted to say that I had been a loyal customer of Gillette for quite a few years until recently.  With the need to think of budgeting my money, I needed to find other brands to save.  I have been utilizing another brand called lately due to the cost effectiveness.  The blades are not of perfection but are doable for someone that may shave twice a week.  I have had a beard now for about 10 years and don&#x27;t need to shave a large amount to square it off.  I felt that the Gillette razors were good as to be able to use them for multiple uses which is a good point but when my 4 pack is finished, I had a hard time finding the money reasonable to pay for the next 4 pack or even more.  Being a Massachusetts native, I would always like to support a previous local company (even though no longer local) but I have to think about cost savings from now on with four young children.  I received a free razor from a program offered by Gillette and understood why I miss using it but not particularly the price.</li>
    <li> The ProGuide Power blades are fantastic. Full discloser: I received a free razor as part of a program run by Gillette, but I have used them prior to the program and will continue afterwards. Even with heavy stubble, these blades provide a great shaving experience with no nicks, cuts or discomfort. Some razors can cause irritation to my face, but these were phenomenal. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I love this, Got a great shave, very close and smooth. Got all the tricky spots without a hitch! The razor was sent to me by a program run by Gillette, I would have been kind of skeptical in buying a \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot;, a vibrating razor but now that I got a chance to use it, I love it, and it really works! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used electric razors and have always stuff with traditional disposable razors.  They&#x27;ve always served me well.  So the notion of a powered manual razor really confused me at first.  Was Gillette trying to basically reinvent the wheel?  After signing up for a program through Gillette and trying out their Fusion Proglide Power razor, I think they did just that!  At first it was a bit strange that the entire razor was vibrating when powered on.  But once I started shaving I found that the razor was just gliding over my skin with ease.  Much less resistance or the tugging feeling that can occur with normal razors.  I feel it gave me a closer shave than I&#x27;m used to.  Also, rising out the razor along the way was extremely easy, no clogging up behind the blades. Yes there will be a AA battery needing to be replaced periodically, but I feel that is not an issue with the results this razor provides.  I do encourage others to try the product out for yourself since you have to feel it in action to truly understand how well it works!</li>
    <li> These razors are probalby some of the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used.  I didn&#x27;t suffer any razor burn and I have rather sensitive skin.  And the shave was very smooth without having to go over the same spots repeatedly.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and well worth the price, been using this for a couple weeks so far and have had almost no irritation.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I use it for shaving and Manscaping and I could not be happier. Close shave with minimal passes. No Razor burn, and Easy to hold on to even when wet. I was a little scared a putting 5 razors hooked up to a power source (AAA Battery) on my face. I had flashes of Saw II going through my head, but after a few \\&quot;Nice Knowing You\\&quot; jokes with my wife I went in and tried it. Hands down the best shave of my life. I have talked 3 friends into getting one. I did receive the razor from a test site Gillette was testing but I love this thing and get my replacement heads from Amazon. The blades stay sharp even with my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used! I love it! No bumps or burns shaves very close and smooth. Thank you Gillette for this great free product. I will continue to buy from you always</li>
    <li> I participated in a program run by Gillette for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades. The blades cut smooth but lacked in giving me a close shave. The single blade was a nice touch to edge everything out but I still did not obtain a close shave. I would recommend this product but with caution.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors you buy! They give you a smooth, comfortable shave and they last a long time. I can go a month or more on one blade and I have a moderately coarse beard. I use mine in the shower and leave my razor hanging there as well and the blades don&#x27;t rust or corrode. They may seem expensive but given how long they last and the comfortable shave they provide, they are well worth it! Definitely try this blade, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I received this as a free promotion by Gillette but I will be buying these blades from now on!</li>
    <li> I am loving the free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor I received as part of their promotion! I have a tough beard, but it was no match for the Proglides 5 razor blades. Shaving was a breeze, and no bumps after too! Would recommend this razor. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor from Gillette and am a fan of the Fusion ProGlide.  I upgraded from the Gillette Mach 3.  I was initially skeptical of the usefulness of adding a battery to a razor, and in fact could not figure out how to install the battery without watching a youtube video demonstration.  It&#x27;s clear why the razor is called the ProGlide.. while the Mach 3 feels like it really is \\&quot;razing\\&quot; your skin, the ProGlide really glides.  You can&#x27;t feel the razing action, but sure enough, it is happening.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s all the extra blades or the vibration, but the effect is substantial.  I would recommend upgrading to this razor.</li>
    <li> Truely amazing blades, I got these blades free from a program run by Gillete. these blades leaves you face soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom,cut your beard effortlessly, and don&#x27;y irratate my skin. I won&#x27;t return to my old blades in fact they have already been discarded</li>
    <li> When I first heard the ProGlide was coming out, I was a bit skeptical on how it could be that much better than the regular Fusion. As is turned out, the ProGlide is better and noticeably so. There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face. It also seems like I&#x27;m been getting a closer shave. The best part of the ProGlide is that your can use your old Fusion handles to attach the blades onto. No need to buy special ProGlide handles. The only bad part that I have noticed so far is that the ProGlide seems to wear down much faster than the old Fusion. I have to replace the ProGlide blades about a week earlier than I used to with the old Fusion.</li>
    <li> I received the Power Blades free from Gillette. The ProGlide blades are great with the trimmer. When attached it doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin as much as it would on it&#x27;s own. I have little irritation after shaving, but it&#x27;s nothing aftershave can&#x27;t solve. Turning on the trimmer does nothing when it&#x27;s attached, but it doesn&#x27;t keep it from making a nice shave.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette shaving products in the past and this has proven to be the most superior that I have experienced thus far. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge blade system allowed me to shave without any irritation, anyone with sensitive skin knows that using an uncomfortable razor can ruin your entire experience with the product and brand all together. I would reccomend this razor to anyone with easily irritated skin. The blade was provided to me for free by a program run by Gillette. Additionally, the blade system was much more precise trimming around existing facial hair compared to other blades I have used in the past. This product gets an A in my book and a new home in my shaving arsenal!</li>
    <li> The razor was provided to me through a program by Gillette.  I can start off by saying that I when I  shave, I had to use an electric and regular shaver.  My beard is very thick...well, I put the battery in the Proglide power and decided to see how well that would go.  I actually got through the shave, without any problems.  Easy glide, smooth shave, no razor burn, and no electic shaver.  This is a great razor.</li>
    <li> I have found my new favorite razor. These blades leave my skin so smooth and do not pull the hair at all. The styler cuts very even and better than any trimmers I have used in the past. I recieved this product through a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was really happy when i received these blades as a free promotion from Gillette. I always preferred wet shaving over electric. I have to be clean shaven every day for work and the blades work great.  I get a very close shave with the blades. The only down side which most razor blades share is that they get dull quick.</li>
    <li> Gillette products have always been some of my favorite styling/grooming products so when I saw they were running this program that provided me with a free razor and blades, I immediately jumped on board. The razor was great, but the blades were even better. The coolest part about the blades is how they fit onto the razor itself. Made so that they had a very snug fit, the blades acted as a part of the razor itself, rather than an extension. And even cooler was that you could interchange them to various lengths giving you a nice fade when necessary. But the coolest part was the standard razor blade attachment that made the styler act as an electric razor, giving me an incredibly close shave. Awesome product and awesome blades from Gillette - wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I was more than happy to accept this razor from the program by Gillette. The battery last forever and the bottom line is that the razor provides a great shave for a low cost. Before this razor I was using disposables and was going through them after 2-3 shaves. I feel like I get a better shave with this razor without no nicks. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a relatively new convert to shaving with razors, as I had used an electric razor up until about 3 months ago.  Since then I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Mach 3 and Fusion razors prior to using the Fusion ProGlide.  I received a Fusion ProGlide razor from Gillette to test out and after one shave I was really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about the blades is the space left between them which makes it easy to rinse and clean.  I personally couldn&#x27;t feel the direct effects of the MicroComb attached to below the blades but it was a nice close shave so those might have had an effect.  The precision trimmer is a nice feature I used to trim my sideburns and seems to be the same at the one on the regular Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close and smooth, and after I was finished I felt significantly less razor burn than I did with the razors I had used prior.  The blades also are advertised as having less tug and pull, which I was surprised to find out was extremely accurate.  The second time I used the blades I let my facial hair grow a little longer to test this out even more, and found that tug and pull was still minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are some of the best out there, you&#x27;ll pay a premium for them but you will get quality for your money.</li>
    <li> I tried these blades out due to a program that Gillette was running. These blades just complete an already amazing razor. It gives one a very close shave while taking no time at all. For the price of these razor I got way more than I expected.</li>
    <li> During a program ran by Gillette I was able to test some free razors.  I was impressed with the results as I can grow a beard rather fast and even after a few days of not shaving I was able to still get a clean close shave without the sticking and grabbing that I have experienced with other razors.</li>
    <li> I received some Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades for free via a program run by Gillette. After I finished my first shave, I could only think that gliding is exactly what it did. It was possibly the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. On most areas of my face, it didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving at all. No tug and pull, no pain, and most importantly, no nicks, cuts, or razor burn. The vibration coupled with the blades made for a unique experience that I haven&#x27;t found in any other razor. I will absolutely be using these blades exclusively in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free provided via a program run by Gillette. This razor has by far the best shave out there. Very gentle and shaves extremely close to my skin. This is a product I will continue to use for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is certainly the smoothest shave I have ever had. Prior razor never got all the hair and I could always see a little stubble but with the ProGlide I have a smooth and close shave every time! I don&#x27;t really know if the vibrating handle does much but it certainly makes for an interesting shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I used to love my three-blade razor. Like I mean loved it. Was not down with going more because I thought it was frivolous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing I am OK with being wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying out the 5-blade cartridge, I was hooked. Not only was the shave much closer, the blades lasted longer and the edge trimmer kept my sideburns like a boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette cartridges for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard and if I skip even one day it can be pretty painful.  I signed up for a free ProGlide power through a Gillette program and was pleasantly surprised with the results. . .a noticeable reduction in the pulling a tugging, just as the ad promises.  Good Job Gillette.</li>
    <li> Normally when Gillette&#x27;s come out with a \\&quot;new\\&quot;version i felt it was to just create a buzz without creating a BETTER product. I have to say that I have noticed a big difference with this product.  It feels like it shaves easier and smoother.  The power of the vibration feels like it is stronger as well.  Overall, I think this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to experience it for free from Gillette and I&#x27;m hooked. I have never shaved my face without having my hairs tugged and pulled.  With the Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridge I experienced an incredible close shave without any of the pain and frustration I typically experience.  I usually have to shave against the grain to get a close shave and I didn&#x27;t have to do that with these cartridges so I saved my face and my time.  This is a great cartridge. The trimming blade was a bit difficult to use, but a great idea.</li>
    <li> I received the blade for free through a program run by Gillette, and I am glad I did! I used to use the mach 3 razor and this is certainly a step up. I used to not be able to shave often because I have very sensitive skin, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with these blades. So far, they are the best blades I have used.</li>
    <li> I typically use an electric razor because of sensitivity, but the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER CARTRIDGE provided me with a smooth and long-lasting shave with minimal irritation.  I Received the razor blade and handle free via Gillette as a test and has done very well for me.  At this point, I can&#x27;t speak to the durability of the blades or the life of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE is also very comfortable and easy to hold with its non-slip ergonomic grip even when your hands are wet.  In addition, if you choose, you can turn the handle on and it vibrates to aid in a smoother and less sensitive shave.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t beleive how close of a shave i get with this. It was very easy to use and control. So far the cartridges aren&#x27;t getting dull. I shave about 3-4 times a week and have been using this for 2 weeks now. Also, just wanted to mention that got to try this free from a program run by Gillette. This was just amazing. I will never use another razor again.</li>
    <li> First off, I received this cartridge free via a promotion run by Gillette.  I have used this cartridge for two weeks now and it has shown no signs of wearing down.  The shave is incredibly smooth and I highly recommend these cartridges.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide from a program that Gillette sponsors. I am not a fan of power or vibration type shaving. However, this was the bomb! I used it today and was done in 10 minutes. Totally smooth and I think the vibration did its job to shave my face baby smooth. I read some of the other comments, not sure why putting this one down. I definitely am now a fan of this razor.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide styler for free by a program ran by Gillette. In my styler Came Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade which I use after trimming up my facial hair. For work I have to have a completely shaven face everyday and these blades help pretty good getting close to my skin without cutting myself.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome!! I got it for free from a program run via Gillette. I was extremely impressed with this product. It was a very smooth shave. I have shaved with it about 6 times and there is no ware on the razor at all. It works perfectly and i recommend it to everyone! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  It gives you the best shave you can get without going to get it professionally done. The vibrating action makes it feel like the hair is just falling off of your face. The multiple blades allow you to shave quickly without worrying about cuts and reduce irritation to almost nothing. The blades last a long time. Although they are a little pricey you can get then cheap if you subscribe on amazon for them.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of a 3 blade Gillette razor and was excited when I received a free sample of the new fusion proglide power cartridge from Gillette. I was disappointed with the shave I got using the new fusion. I found the the blades tugged at my skin with and without the vibration mode turned on. I really liked the single blade they added to the top of the cartridge for trimming my side burns.  I think I will stick with my trusty old 3 blade Gillette for now.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Proglide power blades are just that. Powerful! The smoothness of the shave is the cleanest that I have experienced. The five blades are smooth without the power but then turn the power on and vioula, it gets even more satisfying. Hey guys, if you want one clean shave that will make your lady smile when she carresses your cheek, you need to purchase the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler. No stubbles equals, one happy lady! I have sensitive skin and when shaving my neck, I sometimes suffer from razor burn. I have not experienced such with the Gillette Proglide power blades. What an awesome feeling!</li>
    <li> I usually do not shave 2 days in a row because the skin of my neck is so sensitive, but I received this free blade from Gillette, so I thought I would give a whirl. With this blade, I am able to do so! My only complaint is that when I initially went 3 days between shaves, the blades got clogged up, and I actually cut myself in a few places.  I&#x27;ve actually started shaving everyday with this blade, and my neck has no complaints, so shave everyday!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide blades are truly remarkable I was very skeptical coming from the Mach 3 but I am truly happy that I made the change to these blades, they are definitely ultra smooth and are perfect for sensitive skinned people like myself.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor from Gillette and have to say that this is one of the smoothest shaving blades I have used.  I had no nicks or cuts after shaving off my heavy winter beard as I do each Spring.  I highly recommend this blade</li>
    <li> When using the blade the closeness and comfort of the shave is is Great, But it seems to be equal to the 3 blade fusion blades. If both were the same price I would select the Fusion pro blades, but don&#x27;t think they are worth the additional cost.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It gave me a really close shave. I recommend it to everyone! This company has exceeded my expectations without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I got a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette, now this is the only razor I will use. I use this razor every day and have zero irritation. I get a clean shave with no missed hairs. The blades last me almost two weeks before I have to change them so the price is not really an issue since a 4 pack will last about a month.</li>
    <li> I used these blades as part of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler. The blades are as advertised. I have used each one of the Gillette razors and they all seem to be slightly better than the next. The only difference I can see between them are that the additional blades provide a smoother shave,which is what they are going for. The one thing I can say is, overall, I can definitely tell the difference between a Gillette Razor compared to others.</li>
    <li> I commented on the entire package (handle and blade) over here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B0VYLQX8FRR/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B003987CL0&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to reiterate, thanks to a sample provided by Gillette, I have found what I believe to be the absolute best disposable razor on the market today.  The 8-pack of replacement blades at a reasonable price makes this offer even better (but do keep an eye out for coupons in the paper that can be combined with a local sale - you can sometimes find the blade and the handle for $3-4!)</li>
    <li> These blades work well. The five blades give a close shave, and the precision trimmer does just that. The open back design makes cleaning the hair out simple. The precision trimmer is a bit difficult to clear out, but I don&#x27;t have much in it generally.&lt;br /&gt;I received these blades free via a program ran by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was given this free razor via a program run by Gillette. I already love Gillette and this was no different. Real close and smooth shave. The blades lasts a really long time. The handle feels a little different in the hand but that could be a very minor issue and maybe just for me. Overall I love this product.</li>
    <li> Give a super close shave and the vibrations feel like a massage for your face. Gillette let me try this product for free so they could get my honest opinion.. and boy they got it. I think this is one of the greatest brands out there. Am going to keep using these for as long as i can. A++++</li>
    <li> The blades glide effortlessly over my face, leaving a smooth shave.  The blades are far more advanced than my previous Mach 3.  This is my new favorite razor!</li>
    <li> I received these blades as part of a promotion from Gillette as I must say I am VERY pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades did in one shave what my older blades took 2 or 3 times to do.  These blades gave me one of the closet shaves of my life.  Only thing that tops it was a barber and a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is all the blade I still have from my old shaver are not interchangeable however the money I will save on blades from getting it close the first time will quickly add up and that&#x27;s the only reason I rate it a 4 instead of a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a free program by Gillette.  I actually enjoy shaving in the mornings now since I receive a clean, close shave without razor burn. They are a little pricey but you know what they say, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I opened the package and saw all those blades staked up.  \\&quot;Could this really be different from other blades I&#x27;ve tried?\\&quot;  I had to try it to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor cartridge was sent to me free as part of a program run by Gillette.  The first time I tried the razor cartridge I had not shaved in two days.  Normally this is when I really dislike shaving.  I was happy when the razor cleaned the stubble in a single stroke and there was no discomfort at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the cartridge now for two weeks and it gives a shave so smooth that my skin is still without stubble at the end of the work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Gillette!  This is my new razor.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself seems durable enough, and the shave was close enough without having any after burn. I used some shaving cream to help ease the process, but overall it was a good shave.</li>
    <li> This razor works great - as someone who gets razor burn fairly often I&#x27;m usually looking for a razor that won&#x27;t cause it but that usually means sacrifing a close shave - this razor gets me both a smooth, close shaze and has made razor burn a thing of the past (so much so that I don&#x27;t have to take shaving \\&quot;breaks\\&quot; on the weekends anymore to let my face recover).</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test the new Fusion Proglide Power Handle along with the Proglide Power Blade. The blade seemed about on par with most other top of the line blades, however when combined with the Power Handle, something happens... something good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I was VERY skeptical of the \\&quot;Power Handle\\&quot;. I mean, what is a little vibration really going to do for your shave? The answer is, a lot. I still have no clue what is actually going on that makes this system work but I have not had a CUT FREE shave in years. I shaved off about a weeks worth of growth in a few passes, used the same old shave gel I always use, and viola, NO CUTS, NO RAZOR BURN and I think it even went faster than my usual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blade has the single blade trimmer on the top that can be used if the razor is rotated 180°. This is a super handy feature that my usual razor does not have. I have to say all the hooplah about how many blades we can cram in a razor is getting old. I have not noticed a nice smooth shave like this in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t skimp on razor blades, I use fresh, top-of-the-line blades and power-less handles, but apparently I have been buying the wrong ones. This FAR out performs my setup. I am convinced.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power as a gift. When I got it in the mail, it was about time for me to shave anyway so I ripped it open and tried it in the shower that night. The razor left my skin feeling smooth after the shave. Unfortunately, I have sensitive skin so after a day or so I received minor irritation, but overall the product is a great tool for men who do not receive irritation after shaving with a razor. This product gets 3 starts in my book and it&#x27;s a great tool for both men (and women).</li>
    <li> I just wanted to share my awesome experience with the Gillette Fusion Proglide that I received for free from a program being run by Gillette. I was using Schick blades previously and was not happy with the shave that I was receiving.  The shave was very very close and effortless.  I didn&#x27;t have to worry about being too gentle as to not cut myself nor did I have to worry about going over the same area multiple times to get a close shave. This blade did the trick in one swipe.  I never had this close of a shave this easily when I was using the Schick razor blade. I will be switching permanently to the Proglide cartridges! Thanks so much for a great product and super comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> As far as disposable shavers go the Gillette Proglide along with Fusion Power is on top.  Between the two I did not notice a difference.  The issue for me though is that my facial hair is thick and stubborn which means it&#x27;s no joy to wet shave.  Especially every morning when I&#x27;m in my usual hurry to get the kids and myself ready for another day.  So I&#x27;ll normally use the Brown series 7 shaver that does a decent job even half asleep.  (FYI, I got the Gillette Proglide for review as part of a program by Gillette.  I have owned and used the Gillette Fusion Power a few years before that.</li>
    <li> Love this razor as it doesn&#x27;t nick and is very smooth and does the job right the first time. I would recommend this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my face which is a big plus.</li>
    <li> I had the ability to try this product through a free razor program run by Gillette I would give this a 5 but the powering process is a bit of a disappointment. I expected better. It is a quality product and offers a quality shave. This is not an upgrade to the Fusion, It is it&#x27;s equal with a bit of a pulsating sensation. The blade action is equivalent to the fusion, I have been shaving with the fusion and feel no difference in the blades, They are good but not better. I would recommend this product if you like that little extra in your shave, just don&#x27;t pay full price. wait for a sale and use a coupon and you will get your monies worth.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette. It is safe to say that I would have NEVER purchased a battery powered razor.  It simply seemed like a gimmick to get me to buy batteries. Ive tried many razors in my 35 years of shaving, but seem to alway come back to Gillette products. Everything but the battery powered handles. I can now state that the Pro Glide Power Razor has me pleasantly surprised! out of the package, the handle and blade have great ergonomics and are easy to grip. With the new blade system and the vibration, I get a very clean smooth shave with no resistance.  The blades are very comfortable in the tough spots under my chin and on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette, you made me switch again. I would definitely recommend this handle.</li>
    <li> he Gillete Fusion Proglide razor is awesome and now with the Proglide power handle, it is amazing!  The ergonomic design of the handle gives you ultimate control of the razor, it&#x27;s like one with your hand!  I received a free razor through a program run by Gillette giving me the opportunity to try the product without the financial burden.  The handle is interesting because it vibrates.  The vibrating is supposed to reduce irritation from the blade.  I&#x27;m not sure what it does exactly, but it does feel a little funny at first, but it seems to work great which is really what anyone cares about!  The only downside is you can&#x27;t really submerge the razor handle to clean it, and I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the shower or use it in the shower.  I would recommend this razor and handle to anyone looking for a great close shave!</li>
    <li> I normally use a Braun electric shaver, but I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power from a program that Gillette was running. The blade razor was great and I feel it is an easier cut then anything else I have used in the past. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love Gillette! I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 Power for as long as I can remember. Its been real good to me even though I don&#x27;t shave all that often. You see, I hate to shave. I&#x27;ve grown a beard because of how much I dislike it. So the only time I really shave is when there is a special occasion. Well today I have to go to a wedding. I figured this was a great time to try out the new Fusion Power Blades I got for free from Gillette through this great promo. WOW! These blades are amazing. Smooth shave in a quick amount of time. Goodbye Mach 3 Power, I&#x27;ve fallen for another. It didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving. The best part was I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot to make sure it was a close shave. My tender face is very happy about that. I would recommend these blades to anyone.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving because no matter how careful I am, I always manage to nick my face.  I have often preferred stubble to looking like an accident victim.  When I first tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide system I was skeptical but ended up pleasantly surprised.  A great smooth shave with NO nicks.  And not just for the first shave on the blade, I&#x27;ve found if I carefully rinse the blades between shaves, I can use one blade for a week to 10 days and still have great results.  After that, it&#x27;s time to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it five stars except for the price.  To me a good shave is worth the extra cost, but it is pricey so I watch for sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor free of charge to evaluate through a Gillette program. Since that time I have purchased more blades and will continue to do so as I find them on sale.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with these blades. I received them free from a program run by Gillette.  I never purchased their blades prior to this because i didn&#x27;t think the quality of the shave would warrant the price however,  I like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave. I never get nicked or scratched when using a Fusion blade unless I&#x27;ve been using it too long; the first nick is a sign that the blade is dull and needs to be replaced, which sometimes happens before the lubricating strip indicates a replacement is warranted. I get about two week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of each cartridge and don&#x27;t do anything special to try to prolong their life.  I now know what i was missing and intend to switch over to these cartridges despite the slightly higher price point.</li>
    <li> These blades were amazing.  A close shave with no nicks or cuts.  The new microcomb really lifts the hairs so the shave lasts all day.  The new blades glide over skin so easy &amp; light (no dragging at your skin), the new precision trimmer makes it easy to get the tough areas like under the nose &amp; between the brows.  I was able to try this new cartridge for free through a program with Gillette, but I will continue purchasing these blades, as I&#x27;ve found no better blade to use on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have finally found an all in one product that is amazong. it gives such a close shave and is so fast and easy to use. I have replaced the other brands i was using for this product. conveniently all in one</li>
    <li> These blades are so sharp and so smooth that they should be used by the angels to cut tomatoes in heaven. Instead, I am lucky enough, no, blessed enough to have them trim my lowly neckbeard, thanks to the good folks at Gillette who offered me a sample of their fine product. How long have I waited for a razor that could shave my face so baby smooth and yet give my wife awful razor burn, so that she won&#x27;t steal my razor anymore. I must wait no longer - my time is now.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this razor. Gilette has really over done themselves with this. I received mine from a special promo. Ill never buy anything bit gilette</li>
    <li> I was given this trimmer for free from a program ran by Gillette. The cartridges worked good for me and provided a smooth,clean shave with few strokes. I also had no (or hardly any) nicks and cuts. The only drawback is the cost. These blades are costly. For me, they do last a long time. I keep them out of the shower and keep them clean and dry. But when the time comes to purchase them, it has some zing to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the blades are worth it. I will continue to use this brand. They are above any of the other brands/types out there for right now.</li>
    <li> I got these blades for free through a Gillette promotion and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did. I think the price would have initially scared me away from ever trying them but they are definitely worth the investment. Gillette just does shaving right. The blades are the best I&#x27;ve used. The shave is smooth and comfortable. The blades have a good life span, although I will note I have some what of a \\&quot;baby face\\&quot;. That said I still use the blades every morning and I get a few extra days out of them then regular Fusion blades. I&#x27;d recommend these blades to anyone looking for a smooth and easy shave. Great product.</li>
    <li> Gillette has always been a brand of choice for me when it came to buying razors and specifically the blades for the razors. I was never a fan of disposable razors, because to me they just don&#x27;t get the job done. What I needed was a razor with replacement cartridges that gave me the best shave of my life. I have found it with the Fusion Proglide. i love the blades on this thing. the fact that their are 5 blades, ensures that I get a super close cut when I shave. You can get them in a 6 or 8 pack, but either way, they will give you the best shave of your life. I was given these blades for free in a Gillette promotion, but they will definitely be getting money from me in the future, as I continue buying them.</li>
    <li> I recently received these blades from a promotion run by Gillete and boy I am glad I did!!  This is by far the closest shave that I have gotten from a disposable razor.  It runs smooth across my face and doesnt give me any nicks or cuts like most do on the very first shave.  The great thing is I shave everyday and this razor is still giving me the same closeness after 2 weeks!! I can only imagine how much I can save on blades if I can get 3+ weeks out of one cartridge.  Great job Gillete!!</li>
    <li> I received the blades as part of a free program run by Gillette along with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor. Shaving was very comfortable and I was able to get a close shave. I also like the trimmer for shaping my sideburns. Very happy about the experience and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I received this via a program run by Gillette and the shave is close with no nicks and cuts. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I actually really enjoy these blades.  They are smooth, they cut close and make for a very clean shave.  The only downside to these razors, is that they tend to get dull pretty quickly (3 shaves or less).  With that being said, I end up going through more than normal, which is costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive these products for free to test from a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Razor technology has come a loooong way. I started out with the disposables, and that&#x27;s just junk. With these, although a little more cost at the start, they last and the shave more than makes up for the price. I found these lasting long enough to be comperable to the cost of blades that didn&#x27;t do the job. I received these blades from a free program run by Gillette, and will definately be purchasing replacements once these run out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the microcomb, it really helps lift up so you get the extra smoooth shave and the green strip lays down the smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winning technological upgrade to a normal chore task.</li>
    <li> After receiving the Fusion Pro Glide Power cartridge via a program run by Gillette I figured it would just be another razor like the rest of them, however; I really did notice a difference. first of all the blades are much smaller than other brands so it makes getting those hard to reach spots a bit easier. second, it gives a super close shave. the only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was that my razor went dull pretty fast. I&#x27;m not really one to take care of my razors so im sure if I had put a little effort into that it would last much longer.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Proglide Power Cartridge Blades from a program offered through Gillette and have really loved the close shave that they provide.  I have used the Fusion razor before and the Proglide blades are above and beyond my experience with the regular fusion blades.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the cost of the blades but once you&#x27;ve tried them, it&#x27;s hard to go back to your old blades.  I have also used the Schick Hydro 5 blade system and although it provides a more comfortable shave, it is no where near as close as the shave with the Proglide.  I have also tried generic 5 blade razors but have thrown them out after a shave or two.  I do wish that the Proglide razor lasted longer.  After a week of daily shaving, the strip tells me the blade needs to be replaced.  I usually just ignore it for a while until I can really tell a difference in my shave and then change blades.  When I do, I always wonder why I waited so long to change blades because a new blade makes all the difference in the world.  Overall I would definitely recommend the Proglide blades.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free thru a program run by Gillette This blade is very smooth! I really like the way it feels to my face when shaving.Since I have started using it, I have not had to shave as often. You can definitely tell that it has the lubricated strip. Happy to have had this opportunity and will definitely continue using this for a long time. Did not have any bad results with this product.It works so great.</li>
    <li> The Gilette Proglide cartridges are the best I have ever used! I received a kit from Gillette for trial purposes that included the cartridges and battery powered handle. I have used the razor both with the handle on and off and still get great results. I personally think I get a little closer shave with the handle turned on but my wife cannot tell. I have very irritable skin and have tried many, many different razors from 2 blade to 5 and I am sticking with Proglide from now on. I have not once seen a stray hair or stuble that the razor overlooked and have been using them for almost a month daily now.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Gillette Fusion Proglide razors from Gillette. It is a fantanstic product that allows you to get the closest shave possible. I have tried many different kinds of razors and blades but none have been able to get as close to my skin and with less irritation that proglide razor. I have used electric razors before but those just left my skin dry and red with little bumps. I have also used schick razors before but I felt like they didn&#x27;t get close enough to the skin so there were still little hairs poking up. The Gillette blades however have never irritated my skin and have always gotten close to the skin so there weren&#x27;t any missing spots. I will never use another blade other than Progilde blades.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get this out of the way before I jump into my review: I received these Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades for free as part of a promotional program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a long-time user of Gillette products and typically use a Mach3 razor with the corresponding blades. I have been satisfied with the shave that I get using the Mach3 blades, but was curious to see how the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot; from Gillette compared to what I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as closeness of the shave, the ProGlide blades provided a similar shave to that of the Mach3 blades, but due to the 5 blades I was able to significantly cut down on number of blade strokes and therefore saved a good amount of time shaving. The blade head is flexible and easily moves along the contours of the face and neck. The blades are thin and sharp allowing for a comfortable and smooth shave without pulling your facial hair or causing irritation. The blades seem to be staying sharper longer than my typical blades and the lubricating strip, which really helps with the comfort of the shave, is definitely lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I have about the blades is the size of the blade head. Due to the 5 blades, the blade head is significantly larger than I am used to. This took some time to be accustomed to and was generally not a problem, other than in the areas of shaving my upper lip and chin. Due to the size of the blad head, I felt like I had some trouble comfortably shaving around the fold in my chin and also felt like I had some trouble fitting the razor head between my upper lip and nose. In the end I did get a close shave in those areas, but just felt I needed to take a little more time shaving those areas so I did not end up with cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the blades and will likely continue to use them as I feel like they allow me to cut down on my overall shave time. I am taking just one star off my review for the slight awkwardness in shaving around the upper lip and chin.ound the upper lip and chin.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades do a good job with a nice clean shave and easy to clean after use.  I received them as part of a free promotion with Gillette. I have used Gillette blades most of my life and continue to come back to them for value.  However, in these economic times on a budget, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my shaving to warrant the additional expense. I think it is still a good product, for me, it just isn&#x27;t cost effective.</li>
    <li> This Razor was sent to me for free as part of a promotion from Gillette.  I typically try and stay away from multi blade razors as i have fairly sensitive skin and i tend to get razor bumps/ingrown hairs from shaving with them.  This razor was no exception to that rule, so it wasn&#x27;t a great fit for me.  However, as a razor it did its job very well.  I have a medium to thick beard so usually its a bit of a struggle to shave through all the stubble, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor Had no problem.  It shaves fast, clean, and leaves your skin smooth, and is easy to keep clean while shaving.  Its not a bad product by any means, in fact i really enjoyed using it.  It&#x27;s just not for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Was really excited when i received this free trial razor from Gillette! Having only used disposables for long never really knew how much better these things could be, the price really turned me off in the past... but not that i tried it, i dont think ill ever go back! Slide extremely smooth leave 0 razor burn and really 0 tug. Only complaint it hair gets stuck pretty easily in blades and wish the lostion strip lasted longer but hey? we cant have it all! Def. grab your self Gillette razor best invention iv used since the microwave!</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette razors for years and this is their best one yet. Combining the Fusion Razor with the vibrating head makes for the closest shave yet. The lubricants help soften your beard and the razor takes care of the rest. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades for free as a sample program run by Gillette.  I was pleasantly surprised by how nice a shave they produced.  My face and neck felt clean and smooth, with little razor burn or nicks produced when compared to other blades like the Schick Quattro, which I mostly used in the past.  I have to shave daily for work and this is something that does the trick for a great price.  I recommened it highly to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was provided these blades via a program run by Gillette but that doesn&#x27;t influence my review. I&#x27;ve read a few of the negative reviews here on Amazon, but the blades work great for me. They glide over my face quickly and comfortably and give a nice close shave. I shave everyday so I don&#x27;t get much growth within 24 hours. All I know is I liked them...A LOT, and will continue to use them. Each person experience will vary depending on beard toughness and thickness, beard preparation, shaving habits. My advice is to try it for yourself to see how it works for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these razors (that were provided by a program run by Gillette) for a little over a month now, and let me say they have worked great for me. I used the Gillette Mach3 product before this and I believe that the Fusion ProGlide is a definite upgrade. The razor just goes over the face so well and best of all, no nicks. I will definitely use this again.</li>
    <li> I used to use disposable razors for years and shave once every few weeks because of laziness and never have a great shave.  The hair would grow back unevenly and the process would take quite a while because I would have to be much more careful to not cut myself(sometimes, I even had to use scissors to cut the hair before completely shaving it).&lt;br /&gt;  Now these Power blades are amazing. I got them for free through a program run by Gillette, and I have been using them in conjunction with the Gillette Styler. I switched-up the full shave and try to maintain a nice, fit goatee, and it works great because the Power blades do exactly what they are named for.  The blades simply glide over the skin and in almost no time, I have gotten rid of all the stubble on my cheeks.  In fact, the shave is also so close that I do not even have to re-shave often and not be afraid of having messy facial hair.  With my old razors, I would also have an extremely difficult time trying to get rid of the hair under my ear and behind the edge of my jaw, but with these, I only need a single swipe.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is fine with paying a little extra in order to have an easy and great shave.</li>
    <li> I received these blades from a program via Gillette. I am impressed with these blades. The only reason I didn&#x27;t really enjoy them was because the fact that they are connected to a really weak motor. Once these blades are placed on a normal handle they are right up there with the original proglide.</li>
    <li> Provided to me for free, from a program run by Gillette, it is one of the best razors I have ever used. It just glides right through my thick facial hair, and leaves no razor burn or razor bumps. I used to use other razors but not anymore. This is the only razor I use now! The blades are very thin and glides through the hair easily. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a close sexy shave.</li>
    <li> This morning I opened my mailbox to discover a welcome announcement amongst the clutter.  My Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor Blade Refills for Men, 8 Count would soon be in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a relief.  I am running short of razor blades.  There will be no pending trip to my local drug store to find a clerk with the proper key to unlock the blade display; no interminably long wait in register line while customers fish their purses in pursuit of the pennies required to make precise change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been tempted to cultivate the hairs on my face into a flattering beard.  But I have been married long enough to know that in a few short days of shaveless bliss my wife will register her dissatisfaction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I have tried other blade delivery services; they just never seem to work.  The blades do not fit under my nose; the handles jam and requiring replacement every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, in two short days, the blades will arrive at my doorstep.  No postage; five percent discount, the wife will remain happy: I do not have to think them for another eight weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done.</li>
    <li> Perfect! fits my razor great!</li>
    <li> simply gillette...the best</li>
    <li> Good blades, very expensive, I don&#x27;t find they last as long as advertised</li>
    <li> Yes - the shave is great - close, smooth - you get noticed when someone touches your skin - so good feel good factory - but do they really have to be SO expensive? I feel they fade after about 3 to 4 weeks maximum and that is not using it every day (I often do not shave a weekends). So it costs about $1 a week for this habit!!! Without the Shaving Gel!!</li>
    <li> Excactly what I had in mind.  This is a great razor blade.</li>
    <li> Best good quality. cheap price.......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered razors online and was kind of worried about it. I ordered this with the Gillette styler and was happy to receive on box with both my items resting easy and nicely packed.</li>
    <li> The fusion Proglide blades are some of the best I have found.  Give a clean shave without drag and clean easily.  This is a great deal and free shipping on an order over $25.00 is great incentive to buy more.  Only noted short coming is they do not fit in my Headblade which would be the perfect combination!</li>
    <li> THESE CARTRIDGES COST QUITE A LOT.  THE CARTRIDGES COME IN 2 PACKAGES OF 4 EACH.,  TWO OF THE FIRST PACK OF CARTRIDGES WERE DULL AND CAUSE MY FACE TO BUMP. I BEGAN BUYING THIS BRAND BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN GIVING ME A NICE CLEAN SHAVE.  MAYBE THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PACKAGE. HOW CAN I GET A NEW PACKAGE?</li>
    <li> These blades are expensive so I embarked on a dalliance with a traditional safety razor and blades, thinking they would be as good as I remembered.  Despite three weeks of trying, and numerous cuts to my face, I gave up.  There is simply no comparison.  The modern Gillette blades are far superior (and safer).  The shave they give is much closer, and I never have a nick.  They also last much longer, which helps to mitigate their expense.  Things modern are sometimes not what they used to be--only better!</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge in the mail to test this product, and I just opened it up and recently used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are exactly as what you seem, a functional and useful replacement for your Gilette Fusion Proglide. However, you will quickly go through this entire pack within a matter of a few months as the razors dull after only a few uses. I had to buy these because the razor that came with my Gilette Fusion Proglide Styler dulled out. They will get you a very close shave that will not cut you, however. You are getting what you ask for when you purchase this product.</li>
    <li> There really aren&#x27;t words to properly describe this product. being military, i am required to shave daily in order to maintain professionalism. the years prior to my use of this product have been full of discomfort, cuts, and irritation. those days are now behind me. i am extremely pleased with these blades; the time they save me, the blood i get to keep, and a the smooth finish my woman loves to feel. these things make my [fury] face happy. Thank you so much, Gillette, for hooking me up with a complimentary cartridge. your promotion deal has lead an otherwise skeptical man into a believer. good on ya!</li>
    <li> Blades are OK. I recieved this product through a program run by Gillette. Using the blades with the powertrimmer is very cumbersome and awkward. The blades get clogged if my facial hair is too long.</li>
    <li> Like this alot and it was free from Gillette,a promotional program. Nice close shave without skin irritation, leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette to tryout.  After having tried out the product I want share the pros and cons related to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge styler blades.  The trimmer provides a good shave with an easy to snap on razor blade that will not pop-off like other shaving blades due to an advanced locking mechanism. The razor blades are excellent, high-quality razor blades that I would recommend to everyone.  I have very thick stubble that dulls blades after one or two shaves.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power styler blades last me through a whole work week.  They have five sharp blades that are easy to clean via simply tapping them and the stubble falls out from between the blades unlike with other blades. They have a sixth blade on the top for shaving your neck, what an awesome feature!  This razor has by far given me the best shave of any blade.</li>
    <li> I received this for free via a program run by Gillette. The blades are very nice &amp; left me with a nice, clean shave. I have sensitive skin &amp; am prone to ingrown hair but this seemed to do the trick. The blades are sharp enough to get the smallest hairs, which is nice. Overall, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Razor blade is pretty good, the \\&quot;power\\&quot; vibrations takes some getting used to but does help when the blade is a little used and might normally struggle.  However, I find the number of blades and features a little of an overkill for someone who shaves every day and doesn&#x27;t grow that much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received my test blade from Gilette.</li>
    <li> I was able to try a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer Set through a program run by Gillette. I really enjoyed using this shaving and trimming system. The blades on the razor attachment are sharp and gives for a smooth and clean shave. The head moves along the skin as if it were gliding. The other attachments and great for the times I dont really want to shave but I need a quick trim. It is also really good for body hair maintaining. Overall a really good system.</li>
    <li> I was wanting to try these blades for awhile now. Since I have sensitive skin I was a little nervous that it would cut up my face, but I was deff wrong about that. The smoothness of the blade in my skin was amazing, it first have in a long time where it didn&#x27;t cut up my face. I didn&#x27;t have any stumble afterwards, and the one blade on the end was good for reaching hard places like my nose, and ears. I would mostly liking recommend this to one of my friend, and ill be using it for now on. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received this for free via a program run by Gillette! I use these blades on the pro glide styler - nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I used the fusion blades previously closer to the time they were originally released, and they worked fantastic. The blades gave a smooth shave while the extra blade on the back lets you have more control for precise lines. The only reason why I tried anything different was the very short life of the lubricant strip at the top of the blade. It only ever lasted about half the life of the blades for me. I recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades (the newest version) through a program run by Gillette, and definitely feel like I was silly to switch away. The major concern I had earlier with the life of the lubricant strip is very much improved. I obviously can&#x27;t expect the strip to last the entire life of the blades, but it is vastly better than before, and I DEFINITELY missed the single blade on the back. I would gladly recommend these blades to my friends and family as well as anyone willing to read this review!</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge were given to me for free as part of a program that was run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very impressed with the comfort and the clean cut these bladed give me. They flow over my face with precision and ease. Normally I have to go over a area more than once even with a brand new blade. The blades did not cut my skin or even cause irritation!! The ProGlide blades are like a hot knife through butter! I cant wait to shave again!</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades from a program ran by Gillette. I was just expecting the same old shave that I&#x27;ve always got but when I started to shave I could tell that this wasn&#x27;t going to be like the others. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Blades were different. There was no pulling and the shave was as close as I&#x27;ve ever got and there was no cuts on my face. I was so pleasantly surprised by the whole shave that I&#x27;m going to be buying more of these blades for years to come!</li>
    <li> I received a set of these razors from Gillette free of charge through a special program they had,I must say I am very please with these razors. They get a very close cut without giving you any razor burn or nicks. The 5 blades make a worlds difference also,before I was using the traditional 1 blade razor and I would have to shave the same spot a few times over to get all the hair which would result in extrem razor burn, with the ProGlide only have to go over a spot once and it cuts all the hair. I cant be more happy and I will continue to purchase these razors.</li>
    <li> Having been a Gillette blade user for a while, I had become pretty content using Mach 3 razors. After using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade, I don&#x27;t see how I could use anything but the PowerGlide again. It gave me a smooth shave and left me with no burn. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Recived this as a free promotional item  sponsored by Gillette! Blades still clog on me and I spend most of my time banging it against the side of the sink.  Does leave a nice close shave, but not for me. Too expensive and bothersome for me to warrant buying the refills.  I like the old single bladed razor. Thought I would give this one a try anyway.  After a few shaves the blades deteriorate so fast, I would go through the whole pack in two weeks!!!</li>
    <li> Cant really say much bad about these. These are the best blades I have EVER used. Been using these since they hit the market. Always give me a clean quick and smooth shave. Especially if you are in a rush these blades will get the job done in no time! Combined with the power razor its the next best thing to using an actual electric razor. Personally I never have cared for them and would rather use this product over any other. The blades tend to last some time. i have used one cartridge for nearly 3 months. Just depends on your shaving habits I guess. You can quickly tell when it needs replacing. The blades will begin to pull at your hair and will be very rough. Just like any other razor. Thanx to Gillette for allowing me to take part in a test of this product. The quality seems to only get better with each new improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a top notch razor with excellent blades these are your only choice. Dont let the price fool you. They are worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best blades I have ever used, they cut right through my thick beard with ease, and no more razor bumps!! Leaves me feeling clean and smooth like a barber shave!! Thanks to Gillette for offering me to try their cartridges for free!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Company sent me these power cartridges to try out and i must say that i enjoy the closeness that i got. I also enjoyed the fact that the power fusion helps make my facial hair stand up to get the closeness with all the pull on my skin. Also these blades never left me a razor burn behind, which in my book gives them an A +</li>
    <li> I tried these as part of a special offer from Gillette, but I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased.  The blades are sharp, shave well, and really do a great job on the edges of my sideburns, which was the whole reason for trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are pricey, but you don&#x27;t need to use this every day.  I&#x27;m on week two now, have used it twice...and use my normal razor in between.  Should make the blades last even longer than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I received a pack or Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades a couple of weeks ago for free.  I&#x27;ve been using them the whole time and can&#x27;t really think of switching.  I only shave 2x a week and these blades make is very easy with no razor burn...even when I finish my shave by going &#x27;against the grain&#x27; at the end.  I end up with a wicked smooth shave without any discomfort.  One trick to really help the blades glide on my skin is I use hair conditioner rather than shaving cream/gel.  It really leaves your face smooth and is so much easier/cleaner to work with than other shaving products.  Between these two shaving is pretty simple!</li>
    <li> Thanks to the people at Gillette I was able to receive the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades to try for free.  These blades are the #1 Dermatologist Recommended razor blades.  These razors don&#x27;t irritate my skin like other razor blades do.  These are Gillette&#x27;s most advanced blades.  The blades are really thin which allows for a better shave.  There is a lubrastrip that helps the razor slide easily over my skin.  There is a precision trimmer on the back that helps me trim my side burns.  One feature that the power blades have that the others don&#x27;t is the microcomb.  The microcomb is under the razor blades and helps get the hair in the right position for the razors to get them all.  The blade stabilizer helps the blade conform to my face and get the closest shave.  These are great razor blades that allow you to get the closest shave possible.</li>
    <li> You will regret not buying this, it&#x27;s good to buy this to restock. Good price for a great product. This is a must buy !</li>
    <li> The Gillette fusion proglide cartridge are very good for a long time. They shave very smooth and easy to exchange and easy to clean</li>
    <li> This Gillette Styler Blades were provided via a program run by Gillette.  Everytime I needed to shave I always had tried to avoid doing it.  The razors I have used that were not from Gillette always caused me pain.  It felt as if the blades are plucking my hairs out and irritated the area.  But after using these blades I probably will not use anything else other than Gillette blades.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Power Razor FREE from the my BzzCampaign @ buzzagent.com.  This is one of the best razors i have used in a long time.  I have very rough and thick hair on my face.  The Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Power Razor had no problem closely cutting my unbearable and thick hair.  It also worked great in the areas that my hair is thin.  I will and have recommended this razor to my co-workers.  Who like myself, are not permitted to have any facial hair at work </li>
    <li> I really like this razor. The blades are very sharp and aid in getting that perfect shave. One of the features that I really liked was the moisturizing strips. My skin is very sensitive and is prone to cuts and breakouts. I was able to get super close shave without having to keep going over the same spot. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the handle being really wide, it just didn&#x27;t feel very comfortable in my hand. Overall all I like this product and it was free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the razors on the market and these blades give me the best shave. They leave my skin feeling smooth and very clean. Makes for a nice, clean shave. I would definitely buy again. I received this razor free and was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I previously always used disposable razors, mostly for the quick convenience and cost.  Any time I&#x27;d open a new one, there would be a period of a week where the razor was too sharp and I&#x27;d have little cuts all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it&#x27;s one of the best shaving experiences I&#x27;ve had.  The blades were very soft against my face and I ended up with no cuts or nicks.  That&#x27;s the most important thing for me!  My face is now really smooth.  There were no small patches that the blades missed at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be sticking with this brand now!</li>
    <li> The thin blades of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge provide a close shave that leaves my face smooth.  Even with 5 blades, the cartridge glides around my goatee leaving a clean line - providing the shape I desire.  And the blade edges literally glide across my face with minimal effort.  I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor in a test program sponsored by Gillette and I can honestly say that Gillette has a winner!!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide blades blow me away every time I use it!!  You never have to worry about tugging and pulling... LIKE EVER!!!  And it is so versatile too with the single trimming blade on the back! I love this and will never use any other razor!</li>
    <li> I got these blades through a program run by Gillette. I must say that I am very impressed these blades. I have sensitive skin and these blades gave me a close shave without causing any irritation. I also enjoyed the vibrations from the powered razor that helped lift hairs to get an even closer shave. I would highly recommend this razor to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> First of all I have to tell you that I got this as part of a promotional kit via a program run by Gillette because I have sensitive skin, and was always having problems with razor burn when using a regular razor, but Gillette&#x27;s ProGuide power has completely taken care of all that. It&#x27;s a smooth shave, and even without shaving creme it feels like running thick water down your cheek. I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple weeks now and even using it daily it is still sharp. I read some of the other reviews where they don&#x27;t think its worth the extra money, but in my personal opinion, IT IS!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor and cartridges because I seem to go through a lot of blades and the higher-end cartridges can get pricey pretty fast.  Thanks to a program run by Gillette, I got to try this product for free, and probably the best compliment I can offer is that I&#x27;ve already ordered refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short of a skilled barber with a straight-razor, this thing rocks!  I get an incredibly close shave, no stubble, and as an added bonus, no razor burn/irritation.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that the cartridges seem to last far longer than the cheap ones as long as you put a little care into maintaining them.  Always clean the cartridge after use and never leave it wet - doing these simple things kept the cartridge feeling new after almost two weeks of use.  Even then, it was still going strong and didn&#x27;t snag or stretch my skin, it just took a few more passes to get the smoothest shave possible.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the lubricating strip or the micro-comb (or both) that make this cartridge shave so close and easily, but there is no comparison against the cheaper brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running my hand across my face and feeling no stubble at all is great, and looking in the mirror to discover that the shave didn&#x27;t leave me with a red/irritated neck is also wonderful.  Yes, it costs a little more than some others, but this is one razor cartridge that&#x27;s worth the price and lives up to its promises.  Take care of it and it will take care of you.</li>
    <li> The razors are great; they always have been. I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette power razors for years and love them. I got this new set for free from a promotion Gillette was running and they are just as great. I would say they are very smooth and great with genital skin such as mine.</li>
    <li> I have been using the \\&quot;non-powered\\&quot; version of this for a while now.  I was able to receive a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette to review.  I was always very happy with the close and comfortable shave I got from it...So how would this \\&quot;power up\\&quot; addition stack up??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature of these power cartridges are how easy they are to clean during use and after use.  The vibrations make the hair shavings shake right off under running water, which is important for a cartridge shaver due to the many nooks and crannies.  This is very important as the key to making cartridge blades last as long as possible is to get them as clean and dry as you can after each use.  Making the blades last is crucial to me with this product as the cost of the refills are pretty high in my opinion.  Probably the main downside to this product is the cost of replacement cartridges.  With the added ability to clean these blades with the added \\&quot;power\\&quot;, combined with how great the final shave quality is, I feel that it is worth the extra money as long as I can stretch out the life of the blades as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give a 5-Star rating if the replacement blades were more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge, I would definitely recommend my buddies to \\&quot;Power-Up\\&quot; as well!</li>
    <li> I received the proglide power styler free as part of a promotion sponsored by gilette. The blades are great. No tugging or irritation. I will definitely buy and would highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> WOW! Amazingly great close shave! Having 5 THIN blades in one is GENIUS! Told my dad about it and he was impressed, he has been using the same old disposable razors for years! Showed him the Gillette Fusion Proglide and he wanted to keept the one I had, Srry dad, no can do! My father and I will not  be the  using our old \\&quot;caveman\\&quot; type razors any more! Thnx Gillette!</li>
    <li> Great product but very pricey. Should be a little cheaper wonderful shave though wont buy unless prices go down a little bit.</li>
    <li> I have to give it to Gillette this time for inventing not only a stylish refillable blades but one that virtually lets you shave hair anywhere on your body. Sheek components, ergonomic design, give you a smooth shaving experience, I actually look forward to. No more nicking my lip or skin because I can&#x27;t get to my mustache, especially surrounding the upper lip area and chin, seems so effortless now with great results. Whatever you&#x27;re using now, I suggest you try this product. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received these razor blades thru a promotion from Gillete. The first time I used them it hooked me for life! I usually buy whatever razor blades are on sale when it comes time to buy. No More! I really love how close of a shave I get with these razors. My facial hair grows in different direction in different places on my face so I thought I could never get a really close shave. Boy was I wrong! Because of the multiple blade system it really gave me a close shave and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I really like the single blade on the back for doing close up trimming. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying other blades from now on, I am definitely going to be buying these Gillet blades again!!</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free from a trial program run by Gillette and must admit that these razors are incredible. I am a daily shaver and had yet to find a product that would not lead to irritations due to using on a daily basis. That being said, many times I would keep the scruff instead of creating more irritations but those days are gone. I am able to shave with this product every morning. This provides a very close shave and forms to your face while shaving. I have had no issues with this product and would suggest to anyone that needs to shave. This product has proven to me that you truly do get what you pay for, well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I got this razor free via a program run by Gillette, and it has to be one of the nicest razors i have ever used! I love how close that razor gets leaving a smooth feeling. I also like how the great the stylers work, it is very easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone, i love it!</li>
    <li> I got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a  program run by Gillette.  I have previously only used a regular razor to shave and trim with.  OMG this was the best thing since sliced bread.  I was impressed with how easy and how well the trimmer was to use.  It was so easy  to use compared to just using a razor for trimming and styling sideburns and I felt so much more comfortable using the trimmer for \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; than using a razor.  So much safer and so much smoother than just using a razor.  I will definitely continue using the trimmer over just a razor when shaving and manscaping.</li>
    <li> I use a Gillette Mach 3 most of the time for my everyday shaver. Until I was given a Fusion Proglide to try out from Gillette I didn&#x27;t know I could get a better shave with a five bladed head. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have used five blades on other products before trying out the Proglide but this product has made me put them all down. I get a better, smoother, nick free shave from the Proglide everytime. My only concern is the price, but at least they don&#x27;t wear down super fast either so I can justify paying for it. Over all I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> These razors are the top of the line, I got a free razor from Gillette and it definitely gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve had.  Of course I wish the refills were a tad more affordable, but fortunately I don&#x27;t have to shave every day (yes, I&#x27;m lazy, but my job doesn&#x27;t care), so the blades last longer.</li>
    <li> I loved the blades on the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power trimmer that I received for free from a program by Gillette.  The razor has 5 blades together to get a really close smooth shave.  These are the thinnest blades that I&#x27;ve seen and they made my face feel really smooth.</li>
    <li> I received the razor through a program run by Gillette and let me tell you I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Being a typical male and using what you know and not deviating from that made me nervous.  I shaved for the first time with this razor and the end result was incredible.  I have never got that close without sticking toilet paper pieces to the cuts all over my face.  Extremely smooth shave and smooth end result is exactly what I got from this product.  For anyone that enjoys keeping a neat and clean face with a good shave need try these razors!</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to me via a trial program run by Gillette. And maybe it&#x27;s just my coarse facial hair but these blades made me think I was pulling apart some Velcro as i shaved. However, the blade did its job well, no nicks or cuts. I also like the single blade on the back for areas that require precision. A word of caution, do not use the blade attachment that comes with the Proglide Styler. On the plus side, the blades did their job quite well, but wielding them as an attachment to an already long and heavy trimmer just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty damn smooth shave, just as good if not better than any competing razor on the market. The lubricant strip may be better than the competition however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to shave a lot like me, you need many, many sharp blades and this razor has them in spades. yup, i just said that....what about it?</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power is the only standard razor if have used that comes with a battery.  The razor vibrates while you are shaving.  It gives a smooth, pain-free shave.  I like how close it shaves without irritating the face.  The vibration does feel a little strange when shaving next to your ear, but nothing that would prevent me from using it.  Overall, I would recommend this product for a close, smooth shave.  This razor was provided free of charge by Gillette in order for me to test it out and review it.</li>
    <li> What can I say about the best razor on the market right now? It is simply the best. It gives the closeness of a shave I have been craving for and leaves my skin injury free, EVERY TIME. The only minor negative about the razor is that the refills can be rather pricey, but can you put a price tag on injury-free and perfect shaves? Not really; at least, not to me. I received a free trial through a program ran by Gillette and ever since trying it, I went out and actually bought the cartridge refills. I am budget conscious, but willing to splurge on these cartridges simply because these are the best and I have never used anything that actually came close to the result these achieve. So go out and try one yourself; you&#x27;ll see just how amazing these little things are!</li>
    <li> Great looking razor with a fancy power light and awesome handle. Although with my gangster style of holding the razor I did  not benefit from the grips on the handle. Had a smooth feel and close shave, but I would expect this from any new razor. Overall not as impressed as I thought I would be. But the Razor was free through Gillette!</li>
    <li> Great razor, it worked perfectly, not one complaint! I shave daily and this is my new fav razor. It felt good, no razor burn and id highly recommend this to anyone looking for a clean shave</li>
    <li> The trimmer powered by Braun comes with changeable heads that helps me keep my wild gray hairs that has become part of my beard at bay. They even provided the batteries which was right on time for my first shave. The perfect shave, that&#x27;s smooth and comfortable. The only thing I&#x27;m adding to my shaving kit will be heated foam shaving cream. Another great thing about this product was that I received it free via a program run by Gillette, but it also has me wondering if I&#x27;m receiving such a close shave with five blades will they be making even more improvements by adding more blades? But right now I know I enjoy what five blades are providing me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of disposable blades because I am use to traditional razors via shave clubs, but the convenience and quality of the blades make me want to reconsider and keep an open mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slick shave not only left my skin without razor burn, but I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a very even shave.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion Pro Glider razor from a program run by Gillette and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and close shave this product gave me. As a business professional with facial hair it&#x27;s important to have a razor that cuts in close to my beard giving the appearance of a professional shave. Having the option of a single blade on one side and five on the other makes for convenience and adds to the precision of the razor.  I kept my wife in the blue about receiving the new razor, to my surprise she noticed I had switched blades and asked how I was able to get my face so smooth. Can&#x27;t beat that! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great shave.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for free from a Gillette run program to evaluate its performance. My regular method of shaving is the use of an electric razor and only occasionally will I use a regular razor. This was the first time I have tried a battery powered razor and found it awkward to use, I did not like the blades vibrating, felt as if I were about to slice my face up if I wasn&#x27;t very careful. I made sure to try it out with the recommended Gillette Fusion ProGlide Shaving Gel to try and get the best shave I could get. The blades did a great job at trimming and left a very clean and smooth finish, much better than any electric razor I have used. However it severely irritated my sensitive skin. When i use a regular razor I can expect some irritation that goes away after a short period of time, but this time my skin was irritated so bad it has taken nearly a week for the burn to go away.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades as part of a Gillette sponsored trial. I have shaved with it for 1 week and I think it works well as a shaver. The vibrating shave is nice. I liked that the razor is the same as my normal razor. All Fusion blades fit all Fusion handles. I had gotten away from Gillette in favor of the disposable razors and can honestly say I am wondering why I switched. The Fusion Proglide blades are truly smooth can be used with or without cream and it glides smoothly. Another plus is the fact I am 4 shaves in (every 2 days) and the blade is still going strong!</li>
    <li> As part of a program run by Gillette I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor to try.There are 5 blades in the cartridge and it has it&#x27;s own lubrastrip. The razor comes with a stand and instructions on how to change the cartridges. I found that with using the razor in the shower there was no rubbing against the skin,no nicking, and not much contact,meaning it just glided over my skin.</li>
    <li> A good razor.  The blades are nice and thin, the vibration action of the blade might help (kinda impartial on this one), but the part I like the most is the spacing of the blades.  Other razors pack the blades close together, but I like this one because it spaces them out.  Doesn&#x27;t clog the blade up after one pass and allows it to rinse easier.  Also, the top trim blade is great for those hard to reach nose areas.  Durability I can&#x27;t comment on because I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far.  Also, the spring action of the blade is a bit on the soft side.  Can pose a challenge around corners of the chin to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this blade.  A close shave (with both a few days growth and a next day shave) with no razor burn and an easy shave.</li>
    <li> i used to use gillette 6 blade razors but found a different product for less that did just a good of job so i stopped using Gillette. I&#x27;ve been using proglide fusion for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m BLOW AWAY!  i dont know if its the thinner blade or stubble guides but i get a quick clean smooth shave every time. its like a knife through butter but leaves my face without any irritation. i find the razor works great even without turning on the vibration but when i do it turns into a bright blue light saber that turns my furry face into a handsome self made billionaire (look-a-like) in no time at all. its comfortable to hold even with the larger bottom to accommodate the battery. even the back of the razor head is wide open and cleans easy. even while mans-caping this thing doesn&#x27;t knick it all. truly a superior product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Mach 3 for over a decade at this point, and was never sure if upgrading to a newer razor was going to be worthwhile.  I got accepted into a program Gilette was running to let people try the Fusion ProGlide so I figured I&#x27;d find out if there was really a reason to upgrade or not.  Turns out it was DEFINITELY worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades themselves are uber-sharp. The jump from a Mach 3 (or other 3 blade razor) to the Fusion Proglide is even greater than the jump from a 2 blade to a 3 blade razor.  It was so smooth when shaving I had to check to make sure it was actually shaving my skin, I could not feel a thing, and I have extremely sensitive skin.  You can use this on your face, torso, etc. without worry. You can also shave sooner after previous shaves on account of lessened irritation.  Usually if shaving my chest or stomach I would have to wait a couple days before doing it again, but with the ProGlide I can do it every day if needbe.  The razor head itself is quite wide, which means each stroke covers a greater area of your face or body.  This in turn means it takes fewer passes to complete the job, and again leads to less irritation.  I have tried this razor with varying length stubble/hair and have not gotten cut once, nor have I felt a tugging or pulling a single time with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision blade also does its job quite well, I had not used one before on a razor and got the hang of it immediately. It&#x27;s very sharp as well, and creates no irritation.  My only gripe is that the lubrication strip on it seems to dissolve somewhat quickly.  Not after one or two shaves, but I get the feeling it will be gone before the razor itself is actually dull.  Again though, this is not a huge issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and I will be using this razor from now on.</li>
    <li> This product was provided through a Gillette program. Gillette has made it a lot easier for guys to get the clean shave with the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide Power Cartridge. The blades work best with stubble to little hair and not with a full sized beard, obviously. It provides an effortless yet comfortable experience when shaving. I will continue to use these blades as they are top quality and I no longer will go to a three blade razor!</li>
    <li> After receiving my 3 in 1 from a program run by Gillette, the first thing I noticed was the nice smooth feel. Despite my facial hair being several days old, it was still a smooth shave compared to regular razors I&#x27;ve had in the past. I&#x27;m not quite sure how effective the battery power was. I tried shaving with both the power on and off and could&#x27;t tell much of a difference. The green moisturizer strip was noticeable. I could feel the moisturizer on my face after the shave. This is helpful especially for sensitive skin like mine. My favorite part was the trimmer on the back. I could easily even my side burns and reach hard to shave places such as under my nose. Definitely razor blades I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This has been a lifesaver for me. Dealing with shaving irritation, these blades gets the job done with the least strokes leaving me with smooth skin.</li>
    <li> These blades are superb.  I was provided with the blade from a free program from Gillette.  The blade lasts a long time and delivers a good, close shave with much less irritation than the regular fusion blades.  They are worth the premium and I would not use any other blades.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer and power blade free via a program run by Gillette and while I was skeptical at first on how well the shaver would perform I could not have been more impressed. While in the shower I lathered my face and started to use it. The first stroke was simply impressive I felt absolutely no tugging on my hairs, no nicks and it only takes one swipe! Absolutely thrilled to have this as my new shaver was super easy to clean. I recommend this to anyone and everyone!!</li>
    <li> So I was given the Gillette Fusion ProGlide by a program run  by Gillette to try and asked for my opinion. I have to say I have never used a hand razor that was battery operated. The razor did a great job. I like to shave in the shower and fortunately this guy was water proof, even with the use of batteries. I shaved close and left my skin un-irritated. Im not sure what the point of the vibrating head is but ultimately it does what it says and it does a good job at it. In the end I would recommend the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay too much more then a standard manual blade.</li>
    <li> I received this razor thru a program run by Gillette a few weeks ago and I can honestly say that the blades on this razor surpass all of the others I have tried.  Years ago I was in an automobile accident that left me with some scarring on my chin and this was the first blade that not only didn&#x27;t nick, tear, or tug on that area while shaving but it left my skin smooth after just one pass.  I have been using it now for at least 2 weeks and I have yet to have the need to change the cartridge yet so I am beyond pleased.</li>
    <li> I got to try this cartridge through a Gillette promotion and I was very impressed. My beard is not that thick, but I do get some irritation from the Gillette 3 blade cartridge. Although it takes some getting used to the shave is very smooth. It feels clumsy under my nose and upper lip due to its size but it gives a close shave. I had some irritation by my adams-apple that has disappeared since using this cartridge. Honestly the blades are more expensive, but if you are looking for the closest most comfortable shave this is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used gillette razors in the past (Mach 3, fusion, fusion ProGlide, all with various brands of shave gel. I&#x27;m currently using the Gillette Fusion HydraGel), but this is the first time i&#x27;ve used one of the powered handles.  I received the  Fusion ProGlide Power handle and blade as part of a free campaign run by Gillette and BzzAgent After using for about a week and a half, i&#x27;m definitely a fan of it so far. My skin tends to be a little bit on the sensitive side, and I also tend to get as much use out of my blades as possible, given the price of replacements. Usually after about a week, i really start feeling the difference in the quality of the shave. So far, after almost two weeks, the blade still feels almost new. One reason i&#x27;ve never used a powered handle up until now is that I wasn&#x27;t sure how annoying the vibration would get after using this handle regularly. Again, so far no complaints. The vibration seems to be enough to make a difference in the shave, but not enough to result in any annoyance or discomfort during use. The added battery also doesn&#x27;t add very much bulk to the product, which was another reason i&#x27;ve been hesitant to try these in the past. The product gets a 4 out of 5 due to the high price (which is not unique to this product).</li>
    <li> so i have to say as i am one who truly spends hours in front of the mirror making sure my hair line is in perfect condition.This is so good for people who don&#x27;t have the time to go to the barbershop just for an edge up.I highly recommend anyone try this out if you are anything like me.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor FREE from a program run by Gillette to test the product. I own several shavers (electric and manual) and was really enthused to try this one. My other razors include Norelco Speed XL, Remington F4790 dual foil, Gillette Mach3 and most recently Schick Hyro 5 Power. As with any system, you need to shave with it several times so your beard can condition to it and offer the best results. While rechargeable electric razors offer convenience and efficiency (new foils or head replacement less often; usually a faster shave), no matter how nice the shave, they are never as close as a great manual shave. Despite, the nice feature of a vibrating handle, this review is for the blade cartridge of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMFORT&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so the combination of the new thinner blades and lubricating system worked really well for me. I shave almost every day right after a warm morning shower and I use Edge gel for the main lather. All of this together meant a quite comfortable shave using the ProGlide Power cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the blades and lubricating system are comfortable overall, I still felt just a little uncomfortable (slight scratch feeling) going across sensitive cheek areas with the grain. They don&#x27;t seem noticeably more comfortable than a sharp Mach 3 cartridge, but the lubricating system is better than the Mach 3 lubricating strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CUT&lt;br /&gt;Despite 5 blades, I still made several passes to eliminate shorter stubble and I would rate these only marginally better than the Mach 3 blades. That said, I have always liked the shave of a sharp Mach 3 and while this razor shaves equally as well, it did it with only slightly fewer passes, even with 5 blades. It shaved with top performance for 1.5 weeks of daily shaving. After that time, still had some life in it (2-3 more shaves), but needed to be more careful with concern that blades were dulling and could cause nicks or more pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL PERFORMANCE/VALUE&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridges perform as described. Nothing more, nothing less. I was satisfied as long as I didn&#x27;t get caught up in the hype with expectations that they would be leaps and bounds above other best-selling multi-blade razors (i.e. Mach3). While I received this razor for free, I like to commit to a razor long term and in looking at the price for replacement cartridges, other options provide me with comparable performance at a much more affordable price. However - if you are not on a shaving budget and have sensitive skin, but like the closest shave you can get, this could be a great option for you. If on a budget, consider trying the Schick Hydro 5 Power razor or others before you commit. You may be amazed, especially at what&#x27;s left in your wallet a year later.nicks or more pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL PERFORMANCE/VALUE&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridges perform as described.

    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette, and i love it.  I was getting ready to go to Army Grill one morning and realized i needed to shave, and bad.  I quickly ran to the bathroom and shaved. Usually i have to shave in the shower to prevent bumps, but i was i a big hurry.  I just knew i was going to have razor burn after this, but after an entire day out in the , sun i had no problems.</li>
    <li> I got the blade for free through a program run by Gillette, so I thought why not try it out. I had the old Gillette Fusion Power handle and cartridge, and they worked great, but they were replaced with my new Philips Norelco electric razor which would shave even closer than the old Fusion cartridge. I would say that this new cartridge closes the gap slightly between my Norelco and Gillet&#x27;s line-up of razors. While the improvements in closeness are only slight, the improvements in comfort are much welcomed. My neck used to get irritated by Fusion blades, but these new ProGlide blades don&#x27;t irritate my neck at all. If I didn&#x27;t have my electric Norelco razor, I would buy more of these cartridges.</li>
    <li> Great blade great close shave but expensive</li>
    <li> Man alive, when I find these blades at a good price I buy them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure blades will ever get any better for my shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work better than the other Pro Glides that are all blue, for me anyway and so the orange Fusion is my number one choice. The only difference is that the leading edge, opposite the lube strip, is wider and that seems to make it so comfortable that I can not only do the quick, with the grain shave but also go against, without cream even and turn this mug into the proverbial baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or at least as smooth as....Some babies bottoms might still look prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered these when there has been a price drop, so leave them in your cart and watch for them to drop below $30. Otherwise, Target will have gift card sales pretty often too.</li>
    <li> I love Gillette fusion smooth blade</li>
    <li> They stay sharp for a lot longer than any other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Bought these via Amazon a few times now. Much cheaper here than in the store. These blades are very smooth and last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that the little green strip tells you when it&#x27;s time to swap them out for a new one.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> standard gillette quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that the Proglide Power works better for me than the normal fusion power blade (No others come even close in my opinion). FYI, I shave my entire head and face every single day. So, if you&#x27;re wondering how this will do to take of entire beards then look for other reviews. I&#x27;m constantly shaving stubble and that&#x27;s about it. I would imagine that long hairs may get trapped in the smaller spacing between the blades as opposed to something like a Mach 3. Then again, you do have the single blade on the back (Which surprised the hell out of me when I first tried these out long ago and nearly took off my ear!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this takes stubble out far better and closer than any other razor blade in existence. I also have to stipulate that you should use a gel type shaving cream for best use with these razors as you may want to go back over an area in another direction (I also shave against the grain A LOT). Foam just doesn&#x27;t cut it if you need to go back for a finer shave.</li>
    <li> close shave with no cuts or burns. recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this prpduct for the price, but these blades just do not seem to last through many shaves.  I don&#x27;t have an unusually tough beard, but do shave every  morning.  Maybe I get 5-6 shaves to a blade.</li>
    <li> Used electric and manual razors over the many years. This product exceeds all past razors! The fusion proglide is exceptional in how close it shaves and without the pull. It also lasts a lot longer than other razors as well!&lt;br /&gt;Well pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> Best razor on the market. My husband and I both use these. I never get any cuts like I do with other razors.</li>
    <li> Good product, clean shaves, good packaging. Highly recommended.  A little expensive, but then again, most of these disposable blades are.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I hate that I love these razors.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I always expect some sort of situation when shaving (mostly neck area).&lt;br /&gt;They really are great for me. I can shave in any direction I need to and I don&#x27;t get irritated. They get closer than ANY other blades I&#x27;ve tried, including other Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate them because I think it&#x27;s ridiculous to pay what you have to pay to get them. It honestly makes me angry when I have to replenish them. My wife caught on to this and bought me a Mach 3 Turbo set to try (they are cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;I went through one cartridge and gave all the rest back to her - and ordered these...again.</li>
    <li> Smooth and feels like nothing&#x27;s there</li>
    <li> I shaved with a Mach 3 handle/blade for something like 10+ years.  At some point I finally made the decision to make a leap to something new, and I researched a bit and decided on the Fusion Proglide Power over the Fusion.  I went with the Power option, even though I was skeptical at first, but I figured if I didn&#x27;t want it, I could simply not use it, and I&#x27;d have a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, a few years later, my skin and complexion have improved even further, and I get a killer smooth shave every single time.  It really does guide the hair and the power function greatly reduces drag.  I have a super thick beard (have since age 14); with proper shaving technique and this blade (I do use the Fusion Proglide *Power* blades), my face looks incredibly clear and feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have broken out skin pretty badly when I first started shaving; I since have developed a routine and constantly get compliments on my skin.  Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the morning shower, I begin by splashing my face/beard with warm/hot water repeatedly, to soak and expand the hair.  Then I APPLY [[ASIN:B001E6Q652 Kiss My Face Fragrance Free Moisture Shave, 11-Ounce Pumps (Pack of 4)]] AGAINST the grain (this makes the hairs stand up a bit and easier to guide into the blade); swirl it all over the face to make the hair stand up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then SHAVE WITH THE GRAIN, then across the grain at a 90 degree angle; in other words, you shave from the far side of your cheek towards your mouth, horizontally; this is a common technique used in barber shops, etc, that gives you the smoothness of shaving AGAINST the grain, without the irritation/bleeding involved in doing so (particularly if you have a thick beard; mine is so thick that if I were to shave directly against the grain I would nearly bleed to death).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then lightly towel off (don&#x27;t wash off; this product has healthy oils that should be left in small quantities in the skin). to remove excess shaving cream and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, apply [[ASIN:B00CCAW84W Tend Skin Refillable Roll-On System]] or [[ASIN:B0007RNBPM Tend Skin The Skin Care Solution]] (I prefer the roll-on); this has been the single greatest lifesaver product for my neck in my life.  I&#x27;ve used it, every day to other day, for the past 17 years, literally!  Before this product, I tried EVERYTHING, including fancy ultra expensive products from the cosmetics department at a department store at the mall (a guy called out \\&quot;do you have trouble with having irritation?!\\&quot; and got my attention...  sold me $100+ of stuff but the stuff was junk).  Then I read about Tend Skin in a Men&#x27;s Health magazine and my whole life changed; my sensitive skin + heavy beard &#x3D; irritated neck problem was gone.  This product is definitely the magic ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, Fusion Proglide Power is a big part of the process, and in my experience, is the smoothest and least irritating razor I have used to date.  I also find that the blades last longer than the Mach 3 blades did (they were truly pathetic); so I am spending less on them overall.  The power function is completely worth it if you are wondering; DEFINITELY pay the few extra bucks and get it.  If mine broke tomorrow I&#x27;d purchase it again.s shaving cream and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, apply [[ASIN:B00CCAW84W Tend Skin Refillable Roll-On System]] or [[ASIN:B0007RNBPM Tend Skin The Skin Care Solution]] (I prefer the roll-on); this has been the single greatest lifesaver product for my neck in my life.

    <li> I have used this blade when I had a lot of hair and a little hair. My suggestion is to use it everyday, or it wil pull the hair a little bit. Overall though it is a good blade with a nice smooth feeling afterwards. Thank you Gillette for letting me try this product</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades. The lubricating strip is very helpful so I do not get razor burn and that my skin will remain hydrated throughout the shave. They get every hair off that I want gone. Each stroke is smooth and painless. It is great that you can shave in the shower as well. I was given the item from a program that is provided by Gillette for free. I have found these blades to be one of the closest shaves that I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Styler I use all of Gillettes products.  The blades are the best on the market.  I now will use the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Styler everyday when I shave.  It works well with the attachments to make my beard feel great!  Get yours today, you will never use another shaver trimmer again.</li>
    <li> I would have given five stars but the cost of the blades keeps it at four. I was very pleased with the results from the use of this product. The blades left me with a clean smooth shave. The razor was provided free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> This thing is the bomb dot com! I used to just \\&quot;make due\\&quot; with boring old razors, eventually going for the old school straight razor, but when I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free through a Gillette products program, I went for it. Man, it&#x27;s sensational. It&#x27;s super clean, neat, easy, and non-irritating. It&#x27;s hilarious when you think about the fact you&#x27;re running 5 razor blades across your skin, cutting hair, but it just feels like you&#x27;re rubbing your face with a wet bar of soap :P</li>
    <li> I received these blades for free from Gillette through a program run by them and I&#x27;m glad I did. They give you a close, comfortable shave without the pulling, and scraping that many blades have. Gillette is a very well known and trusted company, so you know you will get a high quality product. I have recommended these blades to several people who agree 100% that they are the best available.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler with 1 ProGlide blade by a promotional program by Gillette. I always found it kind of funny how many blades were being added to Razors. It&#x27;s almost like the never ending sequels to some movies. However, I must say that these 5 blades are no joke. My skin was baby smooth and not irritated at all. While the cartridges are rather pricey I think it&#x27;s worth the money. I suffered no redness or razor bumps. I even dared to use it dry with no shaving cream and the results were great. I highly recommend these blades and the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use as your daily shaver or just to touchup some areas. The blades are great for a soft shave and I was impressed with how smooth my skin felt afterwards. I did get the product for free.</li>
    <li> Great, easy, smooth. The razor is smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It is definitely worth using. Solid performer. Perhaps a bit pricey but worthwhile. I received the razor free through a Gillette program.</li>
    <li> I received mine free from Gillette from a program they were running I&#x27;m glad I accepted now I have a non razor burned face thanks Gillette never thought vibration mixed with blades would help with a close shave I will recommend this too people</li>
    <li> These blades provide a greater difference from the regular blades than I expected.  They improve the feel of the blade on your face, as it lessens the drag on your skin.  However, the blades also seem to lack a bit of the precision found with regular blades, so there&#x27;s a trade off.  I would recommend these blades for someone that has sensitive skin or doesn&#x27;t mind sacrificing a bit of control in favor of improved feel.  I received the razors for free through a Gillette program.</li>
    <li> No tugging, pulling, proding, or anything else. Just a great smoothe shave with no irritation! I would absolutely use this product again</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no doubt I put my razors to the test and thankfully to a program run by Gillette, I got to try out the ProGlide Power Blades for free. Three times a week, I shave my face and twice a week I shave everywhere else but my back. Having sensitive skin on top of the fact that I shave quite often, I require a premium razor. Thankfully the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades lasted about a half month&#x27;s worth of shaves before I felt the need to change the cartridge. Without being classless and explicit, let me just say that the ProGlide Power Blades were very gentle everywhere I used it. Granted one doesn&#x27;t groom their body like taking a scouring pad to a greasy frying pan, but I never felt like I was at risk of cutting myself. BTW, if you&#x27;ve never groomed yourself in the shower, for heaven&#x27;s sake go slowly and be meticulous in your razor strokes. Also get a nice moisturizing body lotion for after the shower because the friction of your clothes against your newly shaved skin can be irritating and be unsightly. I just wish there was some way of making the aloe strip last longer. I also felt the exposure of the Edging Blade on the ProGlide Power Blades was exposed nicely so that I could more accurately groom my sideburns. All without having to switch to different blades/appliances, fumble with cables or worry about wetness. The ProGlide Power Blades are now a required asset to my facial and body hair grooming regimen.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades from Gillette. Yes, THE Gillette. For free! Thanks Gillette! It was a free razor/trimmer provided via a program run by Gillette. These blades (from Gillette) were great! Gave me the perfect shave, without any irritation or cuts!</li>
    <li> I received a free razor was via a program run by Gillette and the package came with one styler blade and three combs for different lengths of trimming. I have to say, Gillette products has never disappointed me. The blades are very thin and sharp that it could get the littlest bits of hair on my chin leaving it really smooth. It also works well to cut my sideburns the very length I want with the different combs provided. Loved it very much, I would recommend this to anyone who loves smooth skin without the uncomfortable poke on their chin or face.</li>
    <li> I received these blades via a promo ran by Gillette. The new blades are thinner and sharper than ever making for a smooth, comfortable shave. The blades attachment is made of durable plastic and attaches and detaches very easily to/from the trimmer. The slot in the storage piece is vented to allow excess water to runoff and to prolong the life of the lubricating strip.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades through a program run by Gillette. After using this product, I have to say it works so much better than my Schick razor.  The smoothness of the shaving is what intrigued me. I couldn&#x27;t feel anything at all while shaving, it just glided across my face. No snagging or cutting during the shave.  I highly recommend this product for anyone. It will not disappoint you at all.</li>
    <li> I thought that a power blade was going to be what I wanted in a newer luxurious shave. I was wrong. The vibrating, at least for me, caused the blades to skip and pull and cause discomfort.</li>
    <li> This razor, though convenient and smooth in some ways, does not rationalize the cost it would require for you to constantly change the head/blades. I received this razor has part of a promotion by Gillette to test the product, and I was not as pleased as I would have liked to been. The razor did leave my face feeling very smooth and clean, but the head constantly got clogged with hair, perhaps even more than my normal razor, because the blades were so close together.</li>
    <li> I received complementary blades through a program run by Gilette and it has given me a much greater shaving experience. There is no tugging and the blades slide right over your skin to give the smoothest shave possible. The lubrication strip at the top is very useful for indicating when you need a new blade.</li>
    <li> These blades are spectacular. I got a set of the blades through a program by Gillette and my first shave, without wetting the blade or warming up my skin went through my whiskers like a hot knife through butter. The rest test will be how the hold up over time. But a few shaves in, they are holding on strong.</li>
    <li> i got the razor free from a campaign ran by Gillette. this blade is great all around c&lt;br /&gt;ouldnt find anything wrong with it&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This razor is definitely a good buy considering it is reusable. clearly it is a bit pricy but all razors are. If you use it enough and buy refills it will eventually be worth the price though. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> free razor was provided via a program run by Gilette was a great find, the Product is as described and gives you clean smooth shave, great product</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor free from a special program run by Gillette.  I tried it this morning and all I can say is, \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit is sounded a little gimmicky - a vibrating handle, a bunch of features on the blade to get tricky spots, etc.  My shave this morning was smooth and comfortable. No cuts or knicks during and no razor burn after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could definitely tell a difference between the Fusion ProGlide Power and my usual razor, a Schick Extreme 3. The Extreme 3 can feel like it is pulling the hair from my face, more than it is cutting it.  The Fusion ProGlide Power glided smoothly over my face and it didn&#x27;t really feel like I was shaving at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4 stars?  I&#x27;m not sure that I get the closest shave possible with this razor.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll figure out how to improve my shave in some of the tight areas, and those that have always been tricky for me, like right above the corners of my mouth.  For now, consider me very pleased and looking forward to tomorrow&#x27;s shower!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how easy it was to get a good, clean shave with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power cartridge.  There was so little tug while shaving and my face felt incredibly smooth afterwards.  I am very pleased with the results.  Just wondering how long the battery will last, but other than that I am pretty impressed.</li>
    <li> The blade on the Gillette fusion proglide power blade are great.  The head of the razor is five thin blade that help get a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the razor free through a program that Gillette had on to see if I liked it more than my current razor, and they won.  I used an old three blade razor in the past and it has nothing on this new razor.  After shaving with it quite a few times, it is still sharp and the protective gel strip is still working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were much better than I was expecting.  In the past after about 10 shaves the blades on my previous razor dulled and the gel strip fell off and my neck would look like a war zone.  With the sensitive skin, this razor does wonders; I would highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I received this cartridge from a program ran by gilette and I can&#x27;t believe the close shave that I got.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and break out easily when I try to get a close shave. This razor exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> Great razor keeps face smooth. buy another in a second. Long lasting but try to keep out of shower will dull</li>
    <li> Okay, so I received the razor through a program run by Gillette and the design is really cool. The razor did a good job in removing the facial hair and providing a smooth glide (which is a plus in my book). However, my disappointment was the missed hairs. You can only press so hard against your face before you cut yourself. The product is okay but I couldn&#x27;t see my self using it more than what I have.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I was surprised at the quality of the product also it is very easy to use. Best beard trimmer available.</li>
    <li> I got the blades from a free program with Gillette. The blades, like all Gillette blades work great! It is the closest shave I have gotten with a razor and it doesn&#x27;t tug or pull any of the hairs. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and the shave it gives my face is awesome.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have tried many different razors over the years including several electric razors.  I always come back to the Gillette razors with the multiple blades.  This is the first razor I have tried with 5 blades.  It gives me the best shave I have ever had.  I can go 2 days between shaves which is pretty amazing for a guy who gets a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day after I shave.  The only thing negative I would say is that the handle is a little slippery after applying shaving cream to my face.  Overall a great razor which I will buy again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I got my brand new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power in the mail a few days ago.  I can&#x27;t lie - I was kinda giddy to even try it.  I&#x27;m the type of guy who can shave today and wake up in the morning with stubble.  Not only is having hair grow that fast annoying, but it forces me to have facial hair almost daily simply because I&#x27;ve never been able to find a razor that makes the job fast, easy, and pain-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power does all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit of an outcast when it comes to shaving in that I don&#x27;t use shaving cream.  I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never used a cream that didn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.  So, I simply shave dry.  I was absolutely amazed at how quick and painless shaving with these blades.  I ended up with the smoothest shave that I have ever had without feeling the \\&quot;tug\\&quot; of hairs being pulled out of my flesh.  The precision trimmer was the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever seen and helped me to shave my with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the razor now for 3 straight days.  I&#x27;ve now used the razor for 3 straight days.  I&#x27;m glad that I finally own a razor that takes the hassle out of shaving and actually makes it something more of a routine like brushing your hair or teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide - not because I think it&#x27;s good, but because I KNOW that you&#x27;ll think it gives you the best shave that you&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I loved these cartridges.  I always have trouble getting a close shave and this razor easily removed the toughest stubble.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  I received this razor free from a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I recently upgraded to the Fusion ProGlide Power razor by receiving a free sample through a program that Gillette was running.  I have always used Gillette products in the past because I think they are the best for my skin.  I have sensitive skin and a thick beard, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get a close shave.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge is very smooth, I noticed that right away.  The Lubrastrip is great and it lasts for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve been using the same cartridge for almost 16 days and still going strong.  The 4 blades provide a close, smooth shave, and my face feels soft.</li>
    <li> As part of a Gillette promotion I recieved m free Proglide razor.  I have used right away and loved the clean and nick free shave that I received.  The new handle was a little larger that my other razor and I am sure that I will get used to it.  The pulsating was something new but because I was nick free, I must recommend this product.  Thank ou Gillette for improving our products.  I hpoe the blades last as long as advertised, but I will have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and this is the only blade I trust do it.  I used these blades for a very long time before buying from Amazon. What happens is I forget to pick up blades as I&#x27;m getting low.  Now having them automatically ship to me through subscription is one less thing I have to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blades. Great service.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades you can buy. The only downfall is the price. However with amazon subscribe and save, you have the ability to save some extra money.</li>
    <li> I normally use an electric but I tried the Fusion and was surprised at the quality shave I got from one blade. Normally one blade does not last on my rough beard but the Fusion was still cutting the hair with any snags at the end of my shave. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received these blades for free through a program run by Gillette. I have been using a simpler 3 blade system for about 10 years, and I figured it would be worth a shot trying something a little fancier. I typically shave once a week, and this razor worked wonderfully on the first shot! The simple 3 blade cartridge clogs up quickly from my one week stubble, but this Fusion Proglide had  no issues whatsoever. Highly recommended. A great value.</li>
    <li> I have tried every type of razor available and no other razor gets the job done like Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor.  I received my razor free from a program by Gillette.  My face is always really soft and the shave is really close everytime without cutting my face up.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge from a program run by Gillette and I have to say this is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gave me a smooth clean shave without the any razor burn and the dry irritated skin I&#x27;ve experienced with other razors.  I will defiantly be buying more replacement blades</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use and electric shaver and do not usually have time to use an regular shaver.  I would make time for this, it was the clsest shave that I have ever had.  I usually NEED to shave everyday because the electric shaver is use does not cut it clase enough, but with these blades i could have gone two days in between, it was that close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice that when I use regular blades i often cut myself, usually on my neck, but not with these.  It was great.  The Fusion ProGlide Power Blades really do the job, and I will be using these  from now on, no more electric shaver.  I would reccommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide power cartridges are the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I received a free sample of the razors via a free program run by Gillette.  They are very sharp blades and last A LONG TIME! I am in the military and am required to shave every day for work. I can use one blade for two weeks or more and still get great results. The Proglide handle is very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slip from your hand like some other razors. I also like the single blade styling trimmer for those areas around sideburns and mustaches. This is easily the best razor I have ever used, and will continue to use it until another company develops something better...Doubt that will happen for a long time though. Go buy it!!!</li>
    <li> I reluctantly switched from my old Mach III to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle and had my first shave with it this morning.  I like the look and feel of it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what the purpose of the vibrating was and it took a little getting used to but it actually felt like my face was getting a massage which was king of nice. At first pass (with the grain) It seemed like I was getting a closer shave but I still had to go in multiple directions (against the grain) to get a complete shave which caused a little irritation. It does seem that I got a closer shave but it still took me the same amount of time as it did with the Mach III.  It&#x27;s been about 3 hours since my first shave with the new razor and my face still feels smooth so that is nice and a change from my Mach III.  Overall, pretty good but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra cost and most of the features included are nice marketing gimmics which I&#x27;m not sure truly leads to a closer and more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades twice now, letting my stubble grown for 2 or 3 days each time to test them out.  I got the blades free as part of a promotion with Gillette and as expensive as any (good) blade is they were worth trying out.  I got great smooth shaves with these blades, no tugs or cuts.  I&#x27;m a little worried that I&#x27;m only going to get another two, maybe three shaves, out of the cartridge at the rate the indicator strip seems to be fading.  Overall, however, I&#x27;m very impressed with the smoothness of the shave, and more importantly, how little it irritated or burned my skin.</li>
    <li> While I typically buy a lower-end razor for shaving, I was excited when I received these blades for free from Gillette as a promotion. Within a few seconds of placing the blade on my skin the difference was easily apparent.  These blades slide smoothly across my skin and felt as if it was moisturizing as it shaved.  In addition, the blades were very flexible and easily curved around my face.  The precision trimmer on the end worked as desired, but it is not something I use much, so it&#x27;s not a feature I care too much about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While cost is higher than I would usually spend, I may switch over if the lifespan is as good or better than my normal razors.  After three uses it is still as good as new.</li>
    <li> I tried out these blades provided for free through a program run by Gillette. I alternate between being bearded and clean shaven, with the occasional man-scaping as well. But even when bearded, I still have the need to clean up my cheeks and neck. Normally I use and old-school double-edged safety razor with some shave soap and a brush. When using the ProGlide Power Blades I got a very close and smooth shave, admittedly better than with my old-school razor. Also, the edger blade was very useful in getting nice clean lines for my cheek and neckline. If you&#x27;re a cartridge-shaver, these definitely hit the mark.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, Gillette is running a promotion and gave me a trial version of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades. Having said that, I would have purchased the product anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and you have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon, then this razor should be a big help to you too. I&#x27;m only 25 and I&#x27;ve already been shaving for about 11 years. Now that I&#x27;m required to be perfectly clean and professional for my job, there&#x27;s no other razor I&#x27;d rather use to get the job done. There&#x27;s nothing I hate more than razor burn or cuts in the morning shaving before work. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and every single time it feels like a brand new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I have a little discomfort around my chin and lower neck during shaving, but the vibration from the power blades works so well that it feels like it lifts the hairs up that much more so the discomfort goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, very happy with the product, will continue to use and support the brand for my entire life I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> Great razor blades that cut through days old stubble with ease leaving no nicks, no razor burn, just a baby-smooth face.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I found these replacement razor blades to be superb. They last a long time and create an extremely close shave. I found these to be very smooth on the skin and not rough (and no razor burn). I have only used one blade so far, but it is lasting a long time. I recommend these blades and the whole fusion proGlide system. I like it overall and it makes daily trimming easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free from Gillette as part of a trial program, and I am so glad i got it. It works awesome! I will be buying the replacements when I need them!</li>
    <li> When I first heard of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge I figured it was a way for Gillette to get more money out of me and it really would be no better than the Gillette Fusion razor that I had been using for years. Well I could not have been more wrong. I received a free razor from Gillette and since I had nothing to lose, I would give it a try. Talk about a smooth shave. It glides over my face like butter and left my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. There were no tugs or nicks and the power feature really improves the overall quality of the shave. I have always been a Gillette guy and the Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge makes shaving quicker, easier, smoother and just plain better.</li>
    <li> I started using Gillette Fusion razors a few years ago, but have been really hesitant to try the \\&quot;power\\&quot; version because the idea of not having complete control over my share was, honestly, weird to me. I recently tried the ProGlide Power through a program run by Gillette, and it put my fears to rest. The blade is just as well-balanced as the manual blade, which is great, and the Power made for a closer shave for me. I have very thick, dark facial hair, but often get bad razor burn when I shave daily, as I do for work, but this really alleviated the burn and \\&quot;rash\\&quot; that I get. I will definitely be switching over. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor free from a promotion from Gillette. I already owned a Gillette Mach 3 razor and love it, so I was excited to try this razor. I have to admit I love this one as well. The power blades were just as good than my old razor. The blades gave me an even cut with no razor burn or nicks. I liked that it was waterproof and I could use it in the shower. I would definitely recommend the razor and the blades, one of the best out there.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power for free from a program ran by Gillette. I was skeptical at first as some multiple blade razors are havoc on my skin. I must say that this razor gave me one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had with no irritation. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> WOW!  I got my sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor in the mail yesterday and it is SUPER COOL.  Not only is it made to fit and comfortable in my hand (a lot of rubber grippy stuff) but the vibrations let it ride over my less-than-perfect skin.  I think the best thing though is whatever they did to the blades.  They are a bit lubricated (?) and manage to get the hair/stubble closer than any other shaver I have used (with exception to the straight razor at my barber).  My only complaint is that they do not offer a blade cover for protection so I do not have to keep it in the plastic \\&quot;holder\\&quot; that came with it.  I travel a lot and this would make it more portable.</li>
    <li> As usual, Gillette has made an awesome razor blade for use on any skin type.  I got these blades free from a program run by Gillette so I was anxious to try them out and see if they worked as well as previous blades I have used.  These blades fit in the usual Gillette tradition and give you a very close trim with minimal irritation.  You really cannot how wrong with these blades at all. The only issue I have with them is the cost, which makes me cringe each time I have to break open my wallet to buy new ones.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used. I have always suffered from skin irritation after a close shave but not anymore. These blades are so thin that it really feels like it is gliding on my skin. I cannot go back to any other blade after this one. It is the best blade and razor out there.</li>
    <li> So I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide from a Gillette program the other day to try for free. I waited a little longer to shave to see how this razor would perform. I could not believe how smooth the razor was. I usually get really bad razor burn on my sensitive skin, but nothing. This razor actually allowed me to shave in a relative short amount of time without the irritation. I found the razors to be very smooth and the precision blade on the back helped me keep my beard lines the way I like them. I know other reviewers stating that they get dull too quick, but I find with Gillette that their blades actually last longer then I would expect.Kudos to you Gillette.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor cartridge, provided to me by free in a promotion by Gillette.  Although it&#x27;s not light years ahead of my old razor, it&#x27;s better, plain and simple and that&#x27;s all I want.  I love the trimming edge on the back to making nice and neat lines, esp. since I shave my own head and I like to look nice and tight.  With my sensitive skin, the quicker and fewer strokes required to shave, the better my skin feels at the end.  I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide from BzzAgent, which allowed me to try this great product.  What an incredible shaving experience!  When you push the power button on the handle, which lights by the way, the razor lightly vibrates.  When you start to shave with the power on, it almost feels like the razor just glides over you face...it moves so smoothly, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re shaving.  When you are done, your face is so smooth, its the closest shave I&#x27;ve had yet and comfortable to boot!  It&#x27;s a great product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these blades for over a week now and I must say I&#x27;m impressed how the blades continue to stay as sharp as they were when i first used it.  Blades that I&#x27;ve used in the past would lose their sharpness after a couple uses. The shave is very comfortable.  I&#x27;m thankful gillette provided the blades to me for free as it has opened up my eyes that real durable blades exist.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a free promotion through GIllette. I just used this blade with the power handle and it was an interesting experience. I waited a few days over the weekend to shave and I grow a pretty thick beard. There was definitely some tug by the razor by my cheeks, but under my jaw wasn&#x27;t bad at all. There was no real irritation to speak of which is great. I am coming from a Schick Quattro Titanium and this might be a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with this and I can&#x27;t wait to try it with a shorter beard, maybe a 2 day beard.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge for free through a program that Gillette was offering.  I must say I am very pleased with the razor blades for the most part.  It gives a smooth cut without pulling on your hairs.  It also gives a nice line when countouring the chin and neck area.  The only downside, which is what I have always felt with Gillette brand, is I which I it had one more blade as the edging on the top of the beard is much more challenging and doesn&#x27;t give me the ideal line I am looking for, but overall I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razoris shaves very closely.I was fortunate enough to try it out for free through a program run by Gillette. Even after the first time using it, I was so pleased, that I will use it from now on.  It is for use in or outside of the shower.  I tried it both ways, and was very pleased. It has an easy grip and is very easy to handle.  The blades can be replaced and the motor makes it very convenient to use.  I can definetely recommend this.</li>
    <li> A program run by Gillette offered me the opportunity to test and review the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;A very close shave!&lt;br /&gt;Five blades + one on top for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;The gel \\&quot;strip\\&quot; is larger than most blades.&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head swivels more than most blades, allowing for an easier/quicker shave.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly less razor burn on my neck than with most blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The larger handle takes a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;The gel strip wears a little quicker than I&#x27;d like for a blade this expensive. (Still lasts longer than most strips though)&lt;br /&gt;The single trimmer blade is a little hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;Refills are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as getting a good, close shave, this is easily the best blade I&#x27;ve used. With most blades I can go over my face many times and I still get rough spots where the blade just doesn&#x27;t cut close enough. With these blades, I shave a spot maybe twice and it&#x27;s perfectly smooth. That&#x27;s a huge difference compared to what I&#x27;ve gotten with other blades (Even other Gillette blades) The gel strip wears a little quicker than I&#x27;d like, but it does last longer than any other blade I&#x27;ve used. For the price, I&#x27;d like to get more than 4-5 uses though. The handle does take a little getting used to, but the size and rubber grip do make it easier once you&#x27;re used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great razor, as long as you don&#x27;t mind the price of the refills. The price alone is why my rating went from 5 stars to 4.</li>
    <li> After my first use of this cartridge, the first thing that stands out is the closeness of the shave.  I had been using the Mach3 Turbo, and grew tired of what seemed to be decreasing quality in the cartridges.  The Fusion ProGlide provided a great, close shave with no skin irritation.  My only complaint is that the MicroComb sometimes seemed to drag through my stubble, making it feel like it was tugging on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Gillette razor cartridges but always thought of the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; versions as a more expensive gimmick, and avoided them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, acne prone skin. Shaving is never something I look forward to - I do it because I have to. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried compares to the latest Fusion razor cartridges from Gillette. They provide the most comfortable, least skin aggravating shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced - and believe it or not, the Power fusion takes it up another notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that 5 blades in a cartridge is overkill, but I think this is one of the keys to getting a very close and comfortable shave. It prevents you from having to continually go over the same area. However, even with 5 blades, I still have to be somewhat careful, especially if I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not the case with the ProGlide Power cartridge. The vibrations in the handle literally cause the blade to glide over your skin in a way I&#x27;ve never experienced. Not that I&#x27;d recommend it, but I have no trouble with a \\&quot;fast\\&quot; shave against the grain with this razor - it&#x27;s that good. It gives me a perfect shave with no irritation whatsoever. There is no tugging or pulling from the blades either - something I also attribute to the micropulses and the microcomb only found on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lubrication strip will wear out before the razor needs to be replaced if you&#x27;re careful about drying the blades after use. I find that the cartridge still outperforms any other razor, even without the lubrication strip and using a high quality shaving soap/cream/gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge is the end of razor burn for me. The price per cartridge can be a bit difficult to justify if you&#x27;re buying only 4 at a time. If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll be sold on this razor the first time you shave with it - stock up at wholesale clubs or wait for a sale and coupon to buy in bulk - the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridges are worth every penny.he Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridges are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I received these blades for free through a program sponsored by Gillette. They provided me with an excellent shaving experience. I used them for several days. I have pretty sensitive skin but theses blades caused no irritation whatsoever. They are definitely an upgrade from what I&#x27;m used to using and I will continue to use them from now on.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge free thru a program run by Gillette.  I was highly satisfied with the product.  While shaving, I barely even felt the blades on my skin.  With the battery-powered vibrating system, I merely had to guide the razor over my skin while applying minimal pressure.  With the MicroComb, it took only 1 or 2 strokes to get a clean, smooth, feeling.  The supension system contours to your facial structure without effort.  It handled difficult areas, such as the neck, with ease.  Normally these spots require 4 or 5 strokes while still feeling rough afterwards.  With the ProGlide, I felt smooth with no irritation.  Also, the blades rinsed well and there was no excess shaving cream buildup.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program from Gillette.  I shaved everyday in the shower with this razor and the first 4 shaves were great.  After the first 4 I could tell the blades were getting a bit dull and had to re-shave the same areas 3 or 4 times to remove the hair that used to be removed in one pass. I would continue to use this razor if the blades would last a whole week.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge (that I received for free through a program run by Gillette) on my neck every morning for the past two weeks (I have a trimmed beard). I have definitely seen a decrease in razor burn/redness on my neck (especially in the areas where my hairs grow in different directions). While not necessarily a \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; (since I shower after I shave), but for some reason more shaving cream runs down onto my chest when using this razor. And while I could use the precision trimmer for my beard, I am probably using it for what it was not intended: to eliminate unsightly random hairs on my shoulders and upper arms (it works great!).</li>
    <li> This is the shaver you have been waiting for! I was provided a free razor through a program run by Gillette. I always find it hilarious that the razor commercials show guys who have baby faces and dont need to shave but once a month because they dont grow hair and make it look like their blades are amazing. I must tell you though that this razor has done it! The blades are unbelievable! They are sharp and stay sharp through the entire use of the blade. I have a very thick beard and it grows at an extraordinary rate, i have to shave every morning. If any of you are out there like me the razors of the past just didnt hold up well, tugged at your hair, and had to be thrown away after a couple of uses. After a couple months of use with my new proglide fusion power it is absolutely the best razors money can buy. I can shave every morning now without fear of razor burn, tugs, and cuts. Besides all of that the blades give a me a good shave for a minimum of a month and a half. Again being a guy with a thick beard this is a godsend! Dont waste your money with any other razors, pay the extra dough and get the fusion proglide, you wont be sorry.</li>
    <li> Love these blades! Leave the skin feeling smooth. Would recommend to anyone looking for a better blade! Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free via a Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Power Razor  promotion by Gillette. This razor gives a very close shave without the irritation like other razors I have tried. The size and weight were perfect and the design nice and sleek. It seems to have stayed sharp throughout several uses thus far.</li>
    <li> With sensitive skin, finding a blade that minimizes skin irritations can be a chore.  I think Gillette has done it.  With 5 blades, you can shave around all the corners and bends of your face and neck with ease.  No worries about nicks and cuts, with little to no irritation.  The replacement cartridges are a bit pricey but the results speak for themselves.</li>
    <li> I have used many razors and Gillette Fusion Proglide Power lives up to its name. It has a great smooth shave that made my shave very easy. I enjoyed the Microcomb and felt that it made my shave feel alot better then a normal shave. My only concern was that it was a little harder to get to the tricky spots on my face. Overall I would give it four stars and would use this razor again.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for free to sample via a program run by Gillette. Even luckier, the razor arrived in the mail the day before I left town for a 4-day trip, so I brought the razor with me. Simply put, the cartridge on the ProGlide Power gave me the closest, easiest shave I have ever had. It made my face super smooth with just one pass, and it really did glide across my skin rather effortlessly. The shave was so close, in fact, that I really needed to use it only once every other day. So, why only four stars instead of five? Well, by using the five-blade cartridge, while you do get a superior shave, you seem to sacrifice a bit in terms of control. I like the increased control with a more simple dual-blade such as a Sensor Excel or even a disposable to target a smaller region of your face. I wouldn&#x27;t call the Fusion ProGlide unwieldy, but it also isn&#x27;t as targeted. That said, it does provide an indisputably fantastic shave. It is also super easy to clean, as the hairs seemed to fall right off the blade under just a touch of water from the sink. Overall, I would recommend the Proglide blade without reservation, especially for less experienced shavers and those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette blades since I first began shaving almost 25 years ago.  I had been using the Gillette Fusion Manual blades for years and I was perfectly happy.  Recently Gillette provided me with the Fusion Proglide Power to try and it&#x27;s an amazing shave.  The shaving experience is great, smooth and close with no tugging.  The microcomb has a bit of exfoliating feel to it (in a good way) and it helps with lifting the hairs to.  I don&#x27;t usually use the trimmer on the reverse side of the blades, but I liked the other features so much I gave it a shot and it worked great and I got a very straight cut on my side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t intend to go back to my Manual Fusion.</li>
    <li> I routinely get a rash/skin irritation after shaving.  I have used both traditional and electric razors, three blades, four blades, always with the same result.  I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge after receiving a free razor from Gillette, and was pleasantly surprised - No rash/irritation!  I am a believer!</li>
    <li> It surely gives a clean shave. It felt very smooth and silky! I would surely recommend this product to use!</li>
    <li> After receiving my Gillette Fusion ProGlide (free) through the Gillette program I put it right to work.  For a guy that has to shave constantly I am always looking for the best of the best...this is it.  This blade has done for my face what no other blade has been able to do...show that I actually shaved.&lt;br /&gt;The razor blade did not grab or pull...smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several razors &amp; blades over the years, but this one gives the best shave of them all. Well balanced, easy to clean, and fits in the hand very well. Thanks to Gillette for providing the razor for me to review!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge has really impressed me. I used to use a different razor for years and I really didn&#x27;t think of trying anything new. I mean, hey, if something&#x27;s not broke, why fix it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge because I came across an opprtunity to get a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I tried this razor. It feels very comfortable and smooth and has provided me with one of the best shaves I have experienced. I will switch to this razor because with its design and function, trimmer blades, and vibrating power handle, I&#x27;m hooked on this razor!!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades free through a trial being run by Gillette. I have never used the ProGlide Blades before and had been using a 5 blade razor from another company. I have extremely sensitive skin around the bottom of my neck and get serious razor burn in just one shave. I used the Gillette ProGlide Blades in the shower and found it to be a very smooth shave. The most important thing to me is minimizing the razor burn and they did that better than the blades I am currently using. I will be making the switch.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide Power cartridge from Gillette on a free trial. After a few shaves, I determined it wasn&#x27;t a bad razor but was not anything to write home about. While it ran smooth across my face, it still produced the same amount of irritation as a lower cost razor would. Because of this, I would not go out of my way to purchase a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power cartridge (especially if there was a lower cost blade available) but I would not complain if I had to use one.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a razor blade product. I normally use electric. The Proglide blades did move smoothly over my face and felt very little resistance. Not a huge fan of the battery operated handle, didn&#x27;t think it made much of a difference. All in all it was a good product and shaving experience. The blades kept my face smooth and stubble free for a good amount of time. Not bad for a free offer that I received from Gillete. If I preferred razors over electric I would definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Tried this out as an upgrade from my Mach3 and my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Proglide Fusion.  I think it&#x27;s much better than the proglide fusion, but not much better than the Mach3.  I know it doesn&#x27;t make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think once these blades wear out, I&#x27;ll go back to the Mach3.  I don&#x27;t think the Mach3 heads will fit this handle unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette. I normally use Gillette Fusion razors due to problems with ingrown hairs. This shaves so smooth and close that it minimizes the amount of my ingrown hairs. I only have to go across an area once and the hair is gone. I am able to get 5 uses out of the cartridge before I have to change it. I will definitely continue to use this razor in the future.</li>
    <li> I was provided a free razor via a program run by Gillette, and before this I was using the unpowered ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can absolutely tell the difference between the powered and unpowered versions.  It seems like it takes less passes to get that clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Fusions before ProGlides and the Fusions seemed to either wear out quicker or was harder to keep the blade clean.  With the ProGlide I am able to use less passes to get a smooth shave which keeps my blade from wearing out.  It is a great all around razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is the smoothest shave I have ever had. It glides smooth on the skin, it cuts the hair very close and does not irritate the face. I love the rubber ridges that raise the hair. I only wish the moisture strip lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge. I got it for free through a promotion Gillette was temporarily running. The blades were great on this new razor. No cuts, no pulled hairs, no razor burn for me. I could go rather quickly, only took a minute after applying same brand shave cream (which I did purchase). After trying this, I&#x27;m not likely to ever go back to off-brand disposable again. I have a beard, but I use a razor to shape and clean it up- neck, upper cheeks, around the lips and upper chin. I liked how it had mineral oil on the lubrication pad, made for a smooth shave. The price point seemed a little high after I looked it up online, but I reminded myself- people see my face everyday, so investing in keeping my face neat and clean is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used blades and I&#x27;ve used electric razors.  Blades dull in a day or two, causing razor burn by the end of the first week.  Electrics are big, clumsy, and leave a lousy shave far from close.  This blade is BY FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever found and will be the one I use until Gillette replaces it with something better in another decade or so.  It glides smooth and effortlessly, staying sharp and cutting flawlessly for almost two weeks since I started using it.  Unless you shave in your car while driving to the office, this is a better choice than what you&#x27;re using today.  I can&#x27;t say enough.</li>
    <li> I have had many different brand razors and types.  From electric to the conventional.  This is great!!  It is keeping my face smooth, which my wife loves.  No more razor burn for her.  I thought the vibrations of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge helps to get the blade through a thicker beard.  Yep no pre-cutting.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this cartridge and Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor Handle from Gillette and am happy to say that this cartridge is miles ahead from the original Fusion blades or competing blades from Dollar Shave Club, which I switched to after a poor experience with tugging and pulling on my original Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades no longer tug or pull on my chin hair and that is worth the premium that I will pay for them. As an added bonus, I have experienced much less irritation after changing to this blade and would recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or rigid chin hair.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge as part of a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve used the ProGlide cartridges in the past, but being a recent post grad and balling on a budget, decided to downgrade to store-brand razors.  Now, while those things worked, they would often leave me with significant razor burn and various nicks and cuts all over my face.  Not the Gillette blades - quite the opposite.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades provide a close, even shave without any irritation.  Great stuff here, and I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide Razor and Cartridge from Gillette, and was asked to review them.  I have been using the Mach 3 Turbo for years, and have been happy with it.  But I must say, I really like this new razor cartridge.  I get a very smooth shave in less time that I used to need for the Mach 3.  I think it&#x27;s because the blades are cutting all my stubble in one pass, so I don&#x27;t have to go back and reshave to touch up. Once my supply of Mach 3 cartridges runs out, I think I&#x27;ll be switching to this Fusion Proglide permanently.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to try Gillette Fusion Proglide power via a program ran by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with Fusion proglide was great.  I don&#x27;t not use shaving cream as to I have sensitive skin.  I found that using the Gillette Fusion Proglide power it has 5 thin blades w/moisture strip. Found that I have close smooth shave every time, no nicks, razor burn or irration like I usually get with the generic brand razors. I really like using the razor and getting ready to go purchase my refills.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion proglide power blades free from Gillette as part of a promotion to try it out. I found the power blades quite useful, I would use them to touch up my beard or to trim down my sideburns. It was very simple to use, worked great and is useful because of its size and the amount of blades. What I really liked the most about the  power blades was that It was faster to shave an i did not have to pass multiple times to catch each hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan and even though I the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I have used Gillette Fusion razor blades for years now. They provide a close shave, I hardly ever get any nicks or cuts with them and they last a long time unlike others that you have to throw away after a couple of weeks. Can only recommend and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Close clean shave that lasts! I&#x27;ve replaced my old items with all new Gillette ones. Even the shaving gel. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Blades through a program run by Gillette and I am very pleased with their performance so far. I have only been using them for a few days, but so far, I have noticed less irritation on my face, and my skin is sensitive. I cannot report on their durability yet, but I am hoping that they do last about a month, as that would definitely help me keep my blade costs under control.</li>
    <li> Closest shave with the sharpest blades! Will defiantly buy again... And you can even shave against the grain! And the reverse side to shave sideburns works great! Thanks Gillette for the awesome cartridge to try!</li>
    <li> I was initially pessimistic about a battery-operated razor, and whether that would make a difference in my shave.  But I have been a huge fan of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide brand, so figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, especially after getting the ProGlide Power through a free program by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried it, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  First, the battery-operated razor makes for an easier, cleaner shave.  I felt as smooth a shave as if I were to use a more expensive electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the battery fits easily inside of the razor, so it&#x27;s very light to carry.  A plus considering that I throw it in my gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I can use this razor in the shower as if it were a non-electric shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trouble I had was getting the cap off the bottom of the handle to pop the battery in.  It wasn&#x27;t intuitive for me to use, and took 5 minutes for me to get the battery cover removed.</li>
    <li> I received a free Proglide Power razor through a Gilette program to test out, and I really enjoyed the closeness of the shave.  Other razors tug and pull at my skin, but with the power option on this razor it felt very smooth and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I like the new Gillette Fusion Proglide better than the other Gillette products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I find it a smoother to use for shaving and fun. I personally like the handle which feels very comfortable conforming to my face very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the upgrade of the new power Proglide</li>
    <li> I love these cartridges!  I started using them because Gillette shipped them to me to test out for free.  I&#x27;m able to achieve a nice, close shave without irritation due to the thinner blades and \\&quot;lubrastrip\\&quot;.  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ll never use less than 5 blades on a razor after feeling how close a shave I can get from them. With the ProGlide Power Blades, I never feel any tugging or pulling and there&#x27;s no irritation afterward. The close shave allows my skin to stay smoother longer, extending time between shaves, and the precision trimmer helps get corners and sideburn areas with ease.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Power cartridges were given to me for free through a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;m however under no obligation to post positive or negative reviews - just honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cartridges aren&#x27;t noticeably improved or more effective than the Fusion cartridges.  The difference comes, in my opinion, through using the battery-operated handle. That is, through handle vibration, the razor requires less passing over the same surface area to remove any hair or stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cartridges are interchangeable (tested this theory) there is little reason that I can see as to why you&#x27;d wouldn&#x27;t want to use the less expensive Fusion cartridges over the Proglide ones with the battery-operated handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only issue I have with these razor cartridges.  They work great and if you exclude the cost factor, the functionality and effectiveness is unparalleled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally will continue to purchase the cartridges for the original Fusion and attach them to the Proglide battery-operated handle.</li>
    <li> So, Gillette offered up the  Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge for me to try for free and I was pumped to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using the original Mach 3 blades since they came out and have tried all of Gillette&#x27;s blades that followed. I have a very thick beard. How thick is it? I was a grunt in Army&#x27;s 82nd Airborne Division and was forced to shave twice a day. Luckily my job now doesn&#x27;t require me to shave every day, but i do every other day...or 2 days. I tried out this razor after not shaving for 2 days and it yanked the S&amp;*^T out of my face. Every stroke was painful, but the end result was the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve every had. I&#x27;ve used the same blade for about 5 shaves now and it&#x27;s still painful, but the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to have worn; thus the 3 stars. This is a razor for someone who shaves everyday or doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; 3 hours in advance.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get selected for a Gillette giveaway, and was able to try these Proglide Power Blades out for free.  The blades work great with the trimmer, allowing you to catch those hairs that might have been missed by a manual shaver.  Leaving you a smooth face with fewer passes. I was able to create great lines with this product. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> Gillette? Huge thanks for being so gracious and accepting me in your test program for the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Power Blades! I&#x27;ve been a Gillette man for years, but am a stubborn mule who kept refusing to upgrade from the old, yet reliable, Mach 3 blades. I could never beat the price, and the performance never lacked. So why change? Uhm...what? Free blades, you say? Price beat! So I gave them a whirl.... After my first shave, I couldn&#x27;t help but tell everyone how awesome this bad boy is! The handle has amazing rubber grips; much better than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I haven&#x27;t slipped once! It&#x27;s compact, it works wet or dry (I&#x27;ve used it under both conditions), and my skin is super soft when I&#x27;m done, to the point where, even for dry shaves, I don&#x27;t need aftershave moisturizer! The edging tool took me a minute to get the hang of...but it makes shaping up my beard with precision a breeze!!! I can&#x27;t give a full 5 stars since I haven&#x27;t gotten to the point of seeing how long one blade will last before going dull, or pricing replacement blades. But I think I&#x27;ve been upgraded!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide from Gillette and I am very impressed with the shave I get from the blades.  Nice clean, smooth shave without any nicks or cuts.  The only drawback is that replacement blades are $4-5, which I thought was a bit steep.</li>
    <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try this razor during a free program run by Gillette. I must say this is the only razor I will buy anymore. I have very sensitive skin and I did not get razor burn like I do with others, and I got a very smooth shave. Thanks so much Gillette, I will definitely be buying this razor again!</li>
    <li> I was able to try out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge free of charge through a program ran by Gillette. I really like these razor blades. They cut close, don&#x27;t pull, or leave behind any razor burn. The lubrication strip on the top of the razor also does an amazing job at making your skin feel great and refreshed after shaving. The only complaints that I have about these blades is that the seem to go dull pretty quick and the lubrication strip fades quickly as well. Other than those two things, I loved it.</li>
    <li> these cartridges are the best ever!! gave me a really close comfortable shave I will buy these from now on. I have recommended these to all my friends . I have never had a better shave!! Great product And to think Gillette gave me free to try!!</li>
    <li> If you want that barber shop shave without the hassle then this is the product for you. I received a free razor from a program ran by Gillette and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  These blades are great and inexpensive.  They cut through the toughest of beards to leave your face ultra smooth.  Definitely giving this one five stars.</li>
    <li> These are great blades, especially for skin as sensitive as mine.  It&#x27;s a smooth shave, and with any shaving cream/gel, it feels like butter.  smooth without nicks.  You can&#x27;t best it and I have bought so many blades over the years.  I&#x27;ve had mine for weeks now and and it is still sharp.  Great blades and my review would be the same even if I didn&#x27;t receive these from Gillette free as part of their sponsored program.</li>
    <li> My husband received his package of cartridges for free as part of a campaign run by Gillette.  He loves the power razor, and how well it works on his course hair.  However, he says that the blades get dull after about four uses, which can get frustrating.</li>
    <li> I truly love these blades. I always suffer with razor bumps and there are very few if any when using this product.</li>
    <li> I traditionally use a t-edger to shave, which gives me a tremendously close shave without very much irritation.  However, when I received a powerglide razor through a free gillette promotion, I decided to work up a lather and give it a try for old times sake.  While the shave itself was pretty effortless and smooth, it wasn&#x27;t necessarily the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I did appreciate the moisturizing bar though.  I have very sensitive skin, and I got out of it without razor burn or cutting myself, so I definitely consider it a victory for me.  At best, I might reconsider my shaving habits, at worst I&#x27;ll keep these around in case the lights go out one day and I need a quick shave.  Decent product, gets the job done, but could be better.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette razors ever since I first began shaving, and when offered the chance to review the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blade through a program run by said company.... I jumped on the opportunity. These razor blades have always been more than adequate for my needs, whether they are being used for all over shaving or just to trim up my face using the precision trimmer. The result is always a smooth shave with little to no tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all good things, it must have a drawback. And for this it is the fact that they dull fairly quickly. I admit I dont always replace them when they do so because of the price of replacements, but eventually I do. The blades are everything I have come to expect from Gillette. Overall, if they lasted a little longer they would have gotten five stars. Regardless I will continue to be a user of the Gillette brand as they havent let me down yet.</li>
    <li> The  razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. Gillette razors may be pricey, but keep in mind you get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;and they work great! You can use them more than once depending on your shaving habits. The blades are thin and&lt;br /&gt;give you a close shave, using shave lotion would add to less irritation. Great blades period.</li>
    <li> One of the best shavers I&#x27;ve used. I tend to stick to this brand and is a great product. Close shave and extremely smooth. Also got it free through a promotion Gillette is running.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette, I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor. I have very thick facial hair and have tried many razors, both electric and manual. I was impressed with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power, it gave me a soft, smooth, close shave. The thin blades glide nicely and put an end to the tugging and pulling you get with some blades. An added bonus is the durability of these blades. I used it daily and got a close, clean shave for a month using the same cartridge. I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette&#x27;s powered Fusion ProGlide razor as part of a trial program through Gillette for free and was very excited to try it out. This  razor is 5 bladed and is very light weight. The razor makes for a very close, clean, and precise shave. You can also flip the head over and the single razor makes ease of getting straight edges on sideburns. It glides over skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to pull or hang up on my face. The blade has a strip of mineral oil which helps to condition your skin.  I got about a month of use out of the razor before I felt it was time to replace the blade, and I shave every 1 to 2 days. I highly trust the Gillette brand and believe I have found my go to blade with this one.</li>
    <li> I am a longtime Gillette Fusion Proglide user.I got a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power cartridge through a program run by Gillette. I found this cartridge to be no better and no worse than the regular Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridges. I got a good shave and it was a bit quicker due to the vibrations, but I got just as good a shave with the regular version. It&#x27;s worth the money if you like a good power shave but I think I will be sticking to the regular Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridges.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this razor so much that I had to let everyone I know that I got to try it for free through a Gillette promotion. Absolutely Gillette&#x27;s best shaver ever. With re-engineered thinner blades for effortless glide, leaving you feeling silky smooth and no stubble from the closest shave possible. The new unique design will show you it&#x27;s greatness immediately with less tug &amp; pull on your face and less likelihood of you cutting yourself as a result. It even has a new Microcomb (available exclusively on Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridges)which easily helps guide stubble to blades for a more effortless shave no matter how tough the job you have had shaving prior. All of this coupled with a Streamlined Comfort Guard that has channels which clear away excess prep meaning a faster and more convenient shave, efficiently saving you time and effort. Day after day can experience incredible comfort, even if they shave every day of the week. If you are looking for a way to love shaving and a razor that will never let you down, then i think you will look no further. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power will end your search, because it is the miracle worker for your face.</li>
    <li> I could have not asked for a better product. These least so much longer than any other leading brand. It is also a great price for these products. Thank you Gillette for the free sample.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion from Gillette. The razor worked well for me. It gave me a nice smooth shave. It was comfortable. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using them. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I recieved these razors free from a promotion from Gillette. They are one of the best I have ever used. I have a very coarse beard and the give me a really close shave with just 1 pass. I love them and I am going to buy more!</li>
    <li> As much as any guy likes to shave, these blades are a semi relief to the issue.  I don&#x27;t have a full beard and never will thanks to my genetic code.  This makes shaving a little more manageable, especially with these blades.  Until recently I had been using, trying and adjusting to several different blades.  These are good in my book.  The only thing that I wish could have been better is the aloe strip lasting a little longer especially since I don&#x27;t shave as often as most.  Gillette ran a program and I was able to participate and would definitely do it again.</li>
    <li> When I got it I was super excited to try it my wife and I read over the stuff the product had and got even more excited about trying it. The thing I thought was pretty cool about this razor was that it has the little touch up razor on the flip. I wouldn&#x27;t have even noticed it though if I hadn&#x27;t read the packaging. I love this razor it has replace the one I was using before!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Cartridge for free through a program run by Gillette, and just in time since I needed a new blade.  The blade shaves super close and smooth, and the precision blade at the top is perfect for under your nose.  Looks like Gillette has my business for the foreseeable future!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Gillette ProGlide blades. They work really well and give a clean, even shave. although my one major concern would be the cost of the blades. They are rather expensive. that is the only thing that would keep me from purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS ITS ALL I NEED IN ONE SHAVER ITS CONVINIENT AND WORKS GREAT ON MY SKIN NO STUBS OR DRY SKIN AFTER FEEL I REECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR A DAILY USE FOR ALL MEN</li>
    <li> These razors are awsome would have given 5 stars but the price is a little much razors last longer than any other I have used.</li>
    <li> Cuts great.  The vibrating handle is nice, though I am not sure it adds anything to the shave.  Overall it is one of the best razors I have used.</li>
    <li> I got this product in a program gun by Gillette and decided to give it a try. I always used Gillette blades to shave, but this one are the BEST. Precise and easy shaving, leaving no stubs behind. I was really happy with it and will without a doubt continue buying this cartridges.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide that was provided via a program run by Gillette and really liked it. The blades are costly but coupons and sales could bring down the price. It provided a good close shave and the blades didn&#x27;t rust as quick as some of the other blades I have tried.</li>
    <li> The 5 blades offer a smoother shaving experience than the 3 blade cartridges I was using previously on a manual razor. I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the actual closeness of the shave though. It has a single blade on the back designed for precision trimming of sideburns, which I tried, but don&#x27;t personally see much use for it. If I could buy cartridges at a lower price that didn&#x27;t have that, I would.</li>
    <li> I received these blades from Gillette in order to review. I liked the power razors and thought that they gave me a good shave. I haven&#x27;t priced these compared to the regular-non power blades. I have used both and if one was cheaper I would go with that one. I like the closeness of the shave. I will check how much these are at the store. Thanks Gillette for allowing me to try.</li>
    <li> While I received a sample of this product for free as part of a promotion run by Gillette, the cost to buy replacements is definitely prohibitive for an average product.  While the shave it provides is fine, I don&#x27;t feel that it did anything better than my trusty Mach 3.  Hairs got caught in the blades fairly frequently and it was difficult to clean them back out.</li>
    <li> I recently was able to try out the new ProGlide Power Blades thanks to Gillette.  It was a great close shave that I didn&#x27;t expect to get from a Styler razor that has the ability to put on clipper guards on it too.  The five blade design are easy to put on and take off and have their own compartment for storing in the case.  There is a great feature with these blades and that is the extra edge blade on the backside.  It gets the sideburns just right and that hard to reach spot under the nose.  I no longer have to make funny faces to reach all the hair on my face, this razor can hit them all.  I never see a great advantage in the lotion strips, but my face is nice and smooth after I shave with this Power Blade.</li>
    <li> The Gillete Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge provides a very close shave that I just haven&#x27;t gotten from other comparable razors.  I received the Gillete Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge from a program that&#x27;s run by Gillete so that I could test the product.  The cartridge was used with the Gillete Fusion Proglide Styler and it provided a nice and clean shave.  My face was feeling very smooth after I used the razor and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good razor!</li>
    <li> I got a package of these through a program that Gillette was running.  For the first few usages it&#x27;s great; close shave, minimal pulling.  But once the blades get a little mileage on them the pulling increases exponentially.  I&#x27;m usually able to get about 4-5 usages before I need to switch out the blades.  All in all these are pretty good, but they do tend to go pretty quick.</li>
    <li> Normally use an electric razor, but was provided with a complimentary product from Gillette so tried it out. Actually, in the standard (non power) mode it provided a very close shave to my generally difficult stubble. Both with and against the grain. However, when using the blades in the power mode, it resulted in quite a few nicks. I&#x27;ll be using mine in the non power mode.</li>
