    <li> This conditioner works great for me, I like it because it can be used on a daily basis and not gunk up your hair. You should really get all three steps as labeled on the bottle for best results.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner but I recommend washing it out. I will not use this as a leave in anymore. This weighed my hair down tremendously and I might as well have sprayed a bunch of oil sheen on it. Dont get me wrong it is good but NOT as a leave in. Too much oil to leave in. Great scent and I would recommend it but again not as a leave in!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have tried so many products and this seems to work best for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;The leave in is very slippery and moisturizing without residue build up the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with the twist and define plus the hair Milk!&lt;br /&gt;A little more expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Wow, this really works great on my hair.  It makes it so soft and well conditioned.  8 hours after use, my hair still feels soft.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair feels tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product....It de-tangles my relaxed hair like a charm! I also use the shampoo, Humecto Conditioner &amp; deep conditioner (every 2 weeks). I would definitely recommend these products.</li>
