<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping and have always wanted to try it. I wanted to buy the Konad nail stamping items but they were just to expensive! So I ordered this set I was a so so pleased when they came and was worried because it was so cheap and came so quickly. They were shipped so fast and when used them I was so surprised. They work just as good even better then I thought ! I&#x27;m so happy and definitely will be ordering more !!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of nail stamps. Have had a blast with them. They come with a paper backing to prevent sharp edges from cutting fingers, and have great detail. Excellent value, love the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my mash plates. Love the designs and stamp well. I am very happy with my purchase. Would buy there products again.</li>
    <li> If you have experience stamping, the set is nice with many cool designs. For beginners though, it is hard to use and takes lots of practice to get good at it. Almost impossible to use on yourself.</li>
    <li> These work very well with the stamping.  The designs seemed deep enough to get the whole picture.</li>
    <li> This plates have good images  it was my first time trying mash and i absolutely love my plates and will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome worked better than my cheeky plates and for a better price than konad or bundle monster plates I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice quality, especially for the price. I have no issues with them.</li>
    <li> Love love love Mash products. And these stamping image plates don&#x27;t disappoint. I am very happy with the purchase of them. I recommend these and any Mash products.</li>
    <li> Most of these are too short for my long nails without double stamping and some of the images were lame. Over all though I like them and they work great on my grand daughter&#x27;s shorter nails. Favorite and most used are leopard spots and zebra stripes.</li>
    <li> A family member had this on their Christmas wish-list,feels very heavy-duty and imagine she will more than enjoy using them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted konad stamping stuff, so I decided to try these out. They&#x27;re much cheaper, and the reviews were good. I have never tried any stamping plates before, so when I got these in and my konad stamper I was so excited. I sat down and played with different images and color combinations for hours. The plates are nice and diverse and offer some really fun and pretty images, and they stamp over just like I&#x27;ve seen in all the youtube videos. They are sharp on the edges, so I definitely suggest handling them with care, but thats the only down side I can see to these awesome little fun plates.</li>
    <li> I am very well pleased of this particular product. Images are crisp on the very first try. Very nice plates.</li>
    <li> The plates were excellent condition when they showed up ... I have played around with a few of them and they all stamped fine in dark colors but when it came to light colors like white they are almost transparent ... the cut doesnt seem deep enough for light colors ... all in all its ok</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried nail stamping. This is a great value kit, as you get so many plates in one bundle. Most of the images I&#x27;ve tried come up clear and are easy to clean. Nice variety of images. COuld have done wihtout so many tip stamps, but I knew what I was getting when I ordered.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the variety of designs. So was my niece. Look forward to designing fun nail art.</li>
    <li> Love all of the designs on these cute things! Makes my nails look all unique and awesome! Gotta love it!</li>
    <li> This product had many images that are too shallow and won&#x27;t work even with really good polishes.  I was super disappointed because I really loved the images they have!</li>
    <li> Most of the designs are cute. Some of the larger patterns will only work for people who have the nail size to accommodate that style. But that&#x27;s pretty much standard with bulk buys.</li>
    <li> order came quickly! very nice designs.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I am a cosmo teacher and I have turned all my students onto it. Super easy to use, FAST shipping and cheap!</li>
    <li> I have tried again and again to get it to work, but they dont. The polish doesnt transfer to the stamper well enough to stamp a complete design.</li>
    <li> Love it very much its very helpful when design my nails.Great produce and for a good price :)!!!!!!!!! BUY IT</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this purchase! The plates are great quality and make stamping a breeze! I messed up and bought the as seen on tv version instead of the konad system and these stamping plates, and WOW! What a difference! These plates work amazingly well in comparison. I can&#x27;t seem to put into words how well these work! Definitely loving these plates so far!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, very happy with that. Good selection, no duplicates and actually got a couple that I love. Can&#x27;t wait for the rest of the things to come in so I can start playing with these things.</li>
    <li> I really think this is a quality product and I would buy it again. Really good!! Loved IT! So happy I got this!</li>
    <li> These work well and the designs are pretty.  The designs are also deep enough to accumulate enough polish to transfer to the stamp.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This Item is different than other brands i have bought. Instead of the plates being in a tight box, they are individually wrapped in plastic. this was unique! I thought the plates would be easily scratched due to the close contact with the plates. Some of the blue plastic on top was scratched but the plates were perfect, so don&#x27;t worry! Some images are unique, such as the full nail plaid print. Out of all my 120+ plates that&#x27;s the only plaid design I have! I recommend this to anyone who loves nail stamping and would you look at the price?! great deal.</li>
    <li> I received my plates in a timely manner and tried a lot of them and they all worked, would recommend this item to others, came covered up and protected, had no problem, and I use any kind of nail polish.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend says I acted like a kid in a candy store today when I got these, lol. I practiced with a lot of them and everyone one of them I tried picked up GREAT, and I tested all different size images and they&#x27;re all good to go. Will buy this brand again for sure!!</li>
    <li> I bought a Konad nail art kit for my daughter and wanted to get her some more images. I saw the reviews on these and the price and thought they&#x27;d be perfect! Every single image plate I&#x27;ve tried DOESN&#x27;T WORK. They aren&#x27;t engraved deep enough. Even though the price is good, you will be very disappointed if you buy these. It&#x27;s not worth the price for a product that isn&#x27;t usable. BUY KONAD instead, it&#x27;s more money but it WORKS.</li>
    <li> I love doing nails for a hobby, usually my own nails. I&#x27;ve bought this because I was tired of trying to do free hand nail art. I experiment with different brands of nail polish you don&#x27;t have to buy special nail polish for this, and with a creative mind your nails would look so awesome, I always get compliments ,all of the patterns prints very clearly. I dont use the scraper that were made for it because it scrapes the plate very bad so I use an old credit card.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy I bought this I think I would be giving some nail techs some competition.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and so many were good that I figured the bad ones were just flukes or maybe the etching didn&#x27;t work on a couple of disks.  Nope, I opened four different disks and tried a design on each one and not one worked.  Which is a shame.  I&#x27;m printing out my return label tomorrow and sending it off to UPS for a refund.  Ridiculous!  I think Amazon needs to take these sellers off as they are obviously a sham.  Stick with the more expensive ones that definitely say they are &amp;#34;konad&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> I got these after trying some friends. For the most part they are good BUT there are several on the discs that I dont think are deep enough so they dont come off onto the stamper. But some of the bigger ones are great. I do think to make this better you do have to buy the stamping polish...some regular ones just arent that great to use with these.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product and stamps fairly well. There was no problem with the shipping, although the plates came earlier than its due date. Which ofcourse I&#x27;m happy about!!! However, the designs on the plates would work a little better if they were deeper. Overall, it is a great product and I recommend you buy it!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd set of plates, the first set being Shany and I was not very impressed with those. MASH on the other hand offer great plates with images that transfer with ease and are engraved deeply enough to ensure a good stamp. I also like that each plate is packaged individually. I wish I&#x27;d bought these the 1st time.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the animal designs ultimately, but I love so many more! I have found so many designs that go well together and I feel like the possibilities are endless! Very fast shipping and the product is great! They pick up so well, although some of the more intricate designs take some practice to get them to pick up!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I was so happy to try stamping but nothing worked when I tried to get the polish on the plate. It would all smudge off when I tried to remove the excess polish.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchased this set of plates. Very very disappointed this time. Out of the 25 plates, only 18 are unique, the rest are doubles and triples. I didn&#x27;t have this problem the last time I ordered this set. Will be returning the set.</li>
    <li> I love this set!! There are so many designs on the mash, I did not know where to start. This is absolutely fabulous and saved me a trip to the nail salon, though I still go for pedicures.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the nail stamping deal for a while I&#x27;m a avid nail artist for my own personal hobby/enjoyment. And I&#x27;ve been reading reviews and watching youtube reviews/tutorials on all different plates and accessories, and I saw that next to Konad, mash is second, which seemed acceptable to me considering I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money. Also I&#x27;ve heard and saw that the salon express kit is pretty good, I am also waiting on one of those to come I will leave a review on that product also. Hopefully this one is helpful to a stamping newbie like myself. These plates I&#x27;ve been playing with them for a few days now, and I LOVE THEM! They are actually veeeerrryy easy to use. I recommend a nice squishy/flexible stamper and an old credit/gift card instead of a scraper it works much better. But other than those two things the plates are actually very detailed, and the designs come out great every time! Easy to clean even the tiny lined designs. Also a great variety of designs. Very cute! They full nail designs are a pretty good size, I&#x27;d say little less than a inch in size but easy to double up on a longer nail....the tip designs are like for natural nail tips but also very easy to double up if you need to cover more tip. So all in all a great product! And price is great.... on mash website they are like $30 bucks for this set! Or $4 for one plate! So this is a steal! So hope this helps!</li>
    <li> The first plate that I decided to try was one of the full size designs. I absolutly loved it. These plates work just as well as the more expensive Konad brand, and they fit into the konad holder as well.  I have not tried the smaller designs yet.</li>
    <li> Good images, some similar to other brands. Size compared to my nail beds are a little small but workable. They&#x27;re ok.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all.  The designs are not deep enough so that when you scrape the excess nail polish off from outside the design groove it takes ALL of the nail polish off even that which is in the groove.  This was a waste of money because they are complete unusable!</li>
    <li> I love most of the designs! I was so excited to get this, and have not been disappointed. The only Negative I might have is the symbols, and some of the other designs, are rather small. I cant get the dolphin to take. But the bigger designs work like  a dream. I had a wedding to go to right after getting this, and I did my nails in black with the white top coat, everyone thought I had got them done and wanted to know where they could go.</li>
    <li> I bought this with another item as a gift set and the recipient loved the variety! It was an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> what can I say? Quick Shipping. Great Product. I am very pleased. I would give it a 4 Star, but I got 24 instead of 25, which isn&#x27;t a big deal but still I paid for 25. Other than that they are PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Beautiful styles even when with some of them I need to use a special laquer, cause normal ones are too liquid to hold the design, I love these plates! And the best is that I can do a beautiful manicure mixing designs from plates to make a whole fashion look and do it in minutes! Cause when I have to draw them I spend hours and if something goes wrong even more, but now I can do whatever mani within 15 minutes and it looks good and if I damage one nail it&#x27;esay and fast to remake it and have good-looking again! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Using these stamps is not as easy as it looks. This stamp set has a large variety but I rated low due to the inconvienece</li>
    <li> I love it  they look perfect,I bought them compare with  Image plate Nails Art totally different ,don&#x27;t buy any items from Image  stamp they sent to you the old and reused it ,all of them scratch it.just want tell all of you the true</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool if you have the stamper.  They imprint cool designs on your nails and there are so many of them on each wheel.  Sturdy and good quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect condition and just as good as if I would have bought these from the MACH website, awesome part is.. I saved SO much money! I&#x27;m so happy I found these! My clients have never been so happy with their nails!</li>
    <li> These plates have a lot of the whole nail stamps so that you can create snake skin, leopard skin, plaid etc designs over the entire nail.  They also have a great variety of single images so you can put a single butterfly or flower etc on one or all nails.  They do have some too cutesy for me but perfect for my teenage daughter designs like Christmas trees, cat faces, etc but these are kept to a minimum.  Depression is fine for transfer as long as you practice and keep patient, it takes a little finesse and has a learning curve as some designs require more or less polish to come out right.</li>
    <li> practice goes a long way. i really like the designs doable on short nails like mine. fancy enough to make it seem like an artist but simple enough to do yourself. i have such weird schedule that its just easier if i do it my self and when i use these it just makes me feel like a pro. I also got these in 3 days!!! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Worth the price.  Nothing extremely new or special about these designs but I&#x27;m a collector so I had to have it.  And they do stamp.</li>
    <li> I cannot speak enough praises about these plates.  They are SO cute and have stamped great so far, but my favorite part outside of that is the packaging: MASH plates are packaged in individual plastic baggies, making storage a breeze!!!  I would definitely recommend MASH image plates to anyone looking for affordable, well-packaged, adorable and fun nail art image stamping plates.</li>
    <li> This set has some very unique designs that you&#x27;re not going to find in other plates. Also they are of a very good quality and most of them will cover all your nails in one try. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love my set!  (Which came earlier than expected.)  I got lots of images that stamp perfectly for less than half the price of other brands.  The edges are not little razors, and the paper backing is great!  One plate came with a scratch across an image, but the rest were just fine.  These make nail art cute and easy!  I would recommend them to anyone that likes nail stamping or wants to try it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite set of stamps yet! So clean, easy to use, come out clear  every time. Easy to care for too.</li>
    <li> GOOD DEAL FOR A VERY GOOD PRICE, I RECEIVED ABOUT 30 OF THESE CIRCLES AND EACH ONE HAS AT LEAST 4 DIFFRENT DESIGNS</li>
    <li> I love the mash plates sooooooo much! the deigns are so pretty because they are really neat. I love how you get a variety of  laouts like french, full, or a little design like an emoticon or a dog&#x27;s head! Luv it!</li>
    <li> I just got started on nail art stamping earlier this year. I ordered these about four months ago and have worked my way about halfway through the set. I also got the MASH stamper from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a really good bargain for the price- you will notice that some nail art stamps are pretty pricey. For anyone who wants to get started on stamping, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to get these plates. I had no issues with the quality of the stamps. They all stamp clearly. You can buy special stamping polish, but you don&#x27;t really need to. I use quite a few regular polishes, like China Glaze or Sally Hansen, to stamp with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this set is that it doesn&#x27;t have a few images I consider to be basic nail art images, like lace or damask. But MASH does have other sets- maybe they did those already in the previous set they did. And there are definitely stamps out there that are more creative, but this set has a wide range of images to where I haven&#x27;t gotten bored with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great value for the money, especially for beginners!</li>
    <li> It is fun to have a lot of patterns to choose from for nail stamping.</li>
    <li> Mash image plates are my favorite next to Konad.  They&#x27;re all pretty clear and I have no issues transferring the image from the plate to the nail.  I already own a few collections by Mash, and several of their other products.  I will continue to purchase Mash products.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. They work very well.Will purchase more in the future. Love them. I would recommend this product to all people who love painting your own nails and creating awesome design!!</li>
    <li> These plates  have fun and playful images that stamped beautiful and clear. My girls loved them and there are so many possibilities. I would order  Mash plates again. It was so exciting to go through all the plates. These are a great product for the  money. I bought the first plate for  Five dollars but you get more for your money to buy the set.  Two thumbs up on these.</li>
    <li> There are so many patterns, pictures, and designs on these stamp discs, I will never run out of options!  Great set!</li>
    <li> I saw these advertised and just had to play! The quality of the set seems very good and no sharp edges like I&#x27;ve seen in other sets reviewed. My only complaint is a few of the designs just don&#x27;t seem quite etched deep enough to grasp the fine detail very easily. However, with how many images come in this set for the price I hardly think that would be enough justification to not buy them. My daughter and I are having fun playing with these. My son (19) even said he might let us put the spiders, webs, and skulls on his nails for Halloween LOL!</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this purchase? Lots of usable designs. I received them on time and use them often. I love my mash plates!</li>
    <li> Plates very resistant material. The 25 dishes I received are different models. I am very happy because I have many cartoons to do on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;To clean is super handy, pass a cotton swab moistened with acetone and ready. Very good buy!</li>
    <li> This was perfect to keep my plates safe and organized. Fits multiple brands of plates.  I would certainly recommend to others in the future.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received my package, I was very pleased with the durability of the product. They designs were well made, and the ease of using the product excited me. i have been using them again and again. these are a lot of fun, you will not get bored :)</li>
    <li> They came in just as estimated! I love the designs on these, very good price for what you get!</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these! I will have to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t got the chance to try it out but my daughter has and she loved it.</li>
    <li> So much fun! Great product.</li>
    <li> my 2 daughters have spent hours painting each other&#x27;s nails with these fun plates. they want to redo their nail art every 2 or 3 days to try a new design. even my 8 year old daughter is able to use it! my 13 year old has been having &amp;#34;nail parties&amp;#34; to paint all her friend&#x27;s nails. super fun- i&#x27;ve even been using it! :)</li>
    <li> LOOOOOve my mash plates....so many designs it is hard to decide which one to use....they are just gorgeous....glad with my purchase...</li>
    <li> So many designs!  There is definitely something for everyone in this set!  Absolutely worth the price, when you could be paying 5-6 bucks a plate if you get them individually.  I have used probably 50% of the plates so far, and have not encountered a problem with any of them!!!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t not work like advertised. very hard to work with. looks simple. not simple at all to work with.will not purchase form buyer again</li>
    <li> This set is wonderful. Inexpenive and high quality. I got all of the plates promised and no doubles. Not so with the second set i ordered.</li>
    <li> Great value for the cost.  Some images are repeats of other manufacturer&#x27;s image plates but there were also some great additional images that are great for any Nail Art collections.</li>
    <li> I ordered on Feb 1 and got it on Feb 6 which is fast where Im from. Im very new to stamping so when I finally got to trying the MASH plates today I was very pleased.  Used a regular black nail polish and it came out clear on the first try (just don&#x27;t put too much polish and don&#x27;t press too hard). Im so happy because I was worried that I would have a hard time after reading some of the reviews. Good job and thank you so much MASH I&#x27;ll be sharing these with my daughter and nieces</li>
    <li> I purchased these as my first adventure in nail stamping. They are extremely easy to use, easy to clean and fun!  There are a few images that are juvenile but I have nieces who enjoy those.  I use them with the Konad stamper and regular polishes.  You just have to experiment to see which polishes work best.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this item for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t even work.  I would never recommend buying it.  I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> This is a late review...sorry! I received the product and it comes with a ton of designs and they all work perfectly with the Konad Staming Nail Art Stamp &amp; Scraper Set Ii that I purchased as well.</li>
    <li> I love all the designs, and the images are a little bit deeper than other brands, which makes stamping easier.</li>
    <li> I admit, I&#x27;m too cheap to spend the money on Konad plates.  These have turned out to work quite well, with a wide variety of patterns and images.  They&#x27;re easy to clean, stamp well, and have a lot of Konad dupes. Definitely recommend for the budget-minded nail amateurs out there.</li>
    <li> these stamping plates are really fun. there are some really nice designs, but there are some that I would never use. takes some practice to know how to use it.</li>
    <li> Imprints don&#x27;t seem deep enough</li>
    <li> The designs are cute and the plates are really too many. But I must say that it only works with thick paint may be old and have to clean it with acetone you whenever you make a design. You have to practice to go right nail designs.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new set of MASH nail plates.  I ordered them for my birthday and to spend more time with my daughter.  We enjoy doing nails once a week.  I have tried several of the images and they are very crisp and clear.  It did take a while to figure out which polishes give the best color.  The technique of stamping is very easy to learn and it does not take a long time to do all 10 nails.  Also it helps to seal in the design with the Seche&#x27; Vite Top coat.</li>
    <li> Wonderful images, deepset for great pick up on the stamper and image deposit! SO HAPPY I ordered these!! I just ordered direct from their site their stamping polishes, they are way cheaper then Konad with a wider range of colors and wonderful viscosity for a wide array of looks.. $44 for 14 colors? Great pricing and free shipping to boot!! Thank you MASH for giving Konad a run for their money!!!</li>
    <li> A gift for someone. Very excited and happy with it.</li>
    <li> I loved this stencil set. There&#x27;s so many cute patterns to try out! My only complaint is that the stencils aren&#x27;t big enough to completely cover the width of my thumb nail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping.  I bought this set and the Red Angel set.  I could not get the red angel set to work at all, but, these work fabulously!  They worked well with the Konad special polish, stamp and scraper.  I definitely recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Great quality and variety.  Don&#x27;t forget to remove the blue plastic or they won&#x27;t work.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Hello all. Avid stamper here. Own Konad, BM 3 sets, Shaney, RA, Cheeky 5XL plates, and dozens of Fauxnad. This set ia an amazing product, completely and totally worth the investment as a superior addition to your plate collection. 13mm X 15mm full image dimensions, which are pretty much standard, and the size of BM set #2. I&#x27;ve tested every image and they stamp dark, crisp, and clear using WnW Cream Black, (which is a super saver over Konad special polish), a credit card scraper, and any one of my stampers.&lt;br /&gt;I love the design assortment because it covers so many different styles from geometric to flowery, but realize that plate design preference is very individualized. Also, the designs are not as intricate as Konad, which to me is a good thing. I like being able to use almost any polish and get a good stamp with minimal user error. Soguesswhat11 on youtube reviews these plates up close and personal, and definitely influenced my purchase, which I am soooooo very happy with. I purchased on Sat. afternoon and received a perfect package in Monday&#x27;s post. Order and enjoy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Update: In five days, I&#x27;ve done 2 manicures for my daughter, 3 for myself, and one for my grand daughter using these plates and I&#x27;m soooo happy about these plates. They are totally amazing!!!! I can&#x27;t believe this inexpensive set is so good. I think I might have to use the word, \\&quot;perfect!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have had several types of nail plates, but this one is comparable to Konad Quality. When I got the newest version of MASH Plates I thought they were very cute. I was a bit surprised that they came with a paper backing. All the images are crisp and clean and stamp that way too. (I used both Konad Special Nail polish and Sally Hansen Insta-Dri)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wells on the plates are not too deep or too shallow. Some Red Angel plate are too deep and I can&#x27;t use the image. I had also ordered some nail plates on ebay and they were too shallow and the image was very distorted, so trust me when I say these MASH plates are perfect (especially for the price). Can&#x27;t wait for the next set. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I wasn&#x27;t able to purchase the old MASH plates. I really would have liked to have tried them out.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of nail stamping plates. The images come out clear, and there is a nice variety to choose from-definitely something for everyone.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them all.... There are so many beautiful patterns. My clients are going to live them. I couldn&#x27;t wait for mail to come.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used all but what I did use worked great.  I used different types of nail polish and it still work great.</li>
    <li> These are my first nail stamping plates, and I am blown away by the quality for such a great price. Some of the designs I will likely never use, but most of them I will and they are even better looking in person than the photos lead me to believe. Each and every design I have tried has stamped perfectly with regular nail polish, so I could not be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These plates have many original and beautiful designs. Very well manufactured, the designs are perfect. Very good quality and very good price.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying stampers and i love all the options with these slides.  Very glad i read the reviews before buying and glad i went with this brand.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, works great and is exactly  as shown in the picture. I would definetly order from this seller again! But I would recommend using Konad special nail polish because it&#x27;s thicker and works much better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these plates. Really cute designs and the images are clear and lift off with ease. These are worth it!! I am new at stamping but can tell you this is a quality product. Has the paper backing so you don&#x27;t cut yourself. Came in nice individual clear packages so I can see what I have at quick glance and can store them in same packaging. The plates were flawless with a no scratches. I would definitely recommend and am looking forward to more from Mash.</li>
    <li> VERY FAST SHIPPING, TOOK ONLY 3 DAYS, LOVE IT, THEY ARE VERY PRETTY EXCEPT FOR NUMBER 34 IS THE ONLY ONE I REALLY DONT LIKE IT! BUT OVER ALL IS  100% RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> Awesome plates! I wish 1-26 plates were available through amazon! These plates are great and the images come out clear and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I I I love this nail stamp plates so much. I cant wait to use different patterns and buy more</li>
    <li> All I need and more.  Wish the set came with a solid french tip but there is more than enough to keep me happy.  Everyone loves the bow when I use it.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Takes a little practice but they work fine.</li>
    <li> Love love love would recommend. Fast shipment. Endless amount of options for nails. I use these so does my daughter and daughter-in-law....love love love</li>
    <li> I am SO happy about this set! There are many different designs. These plates are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require the Konrad stamping polish.</li>
    <li> Bought these as Christmas stocking stuffers for the girls. I liked them, think there great.  I recommend them and you get so many of them for the price, that&#x27;s awesome.  Also purchased the Mash stamper and the Mash holder for the plates.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed good product.</li>
    <li> Package came on time and as advertised. Personally half of the images are a bit too girly/ cute-sy for my tastes but that&#x27;s just my opinion. Quality is great and when used with the Konad stamper it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> The individual patters provide great detail on the nails.  Very easy to use.  It took me a bit to get the &#x27;whole nail&#x27; patters to cover the whole nail... you must come to not fear leaving patters on your skin around your nail if you want a complete cover pattern.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT USING THE SCRAPER included in the set - it scratches the plates.  I have found that an old hotel card key or credit card work the best and do not scratch.  my daughter and I have really enjoyed these.</li>
    <li> I love my konad plates. Looking for a cheaper brand I foud this. With all its great reviews I thought I hit the jackpot, only to find out that the images we not cut deep enough therefor they were useless and I was out $20.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them, yet, as I haven&#x27;t gotten my stamper yet, but the plates look amazing! I&#x27;m so excited to play with them. Ridiculously fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love these plates-- so many options and with the right tools, they come out beautiful! Easy to clean and definitely worth their weight in gold.</li>
    <li> You should buy this! its amazing! I only gave it four stars because I dont use the  special nail polish. You have to get the hang of it at first.&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love all the designs. I know when I got this I wasnt too sure of all the designs so I was plesenty surprised by them when they came. I will put up some photos of them when I get a chance. They work great!</li>
    <li> This is a great set to get! I bought it at the beginning of the month when amazon had them listed for 9.99. I&#x27;m a bargain shopper and for that price there was no way I could say no lol. The quality is great. They stamp nice and clear. I&#x27;ve very happy with my purchase and I would recommend them!</li>
    <li> Love these plates. Really great quality. Doesn&#x27;t scratch, where as my konad plate scratched on the first use. Plus the images are cut a little deeper- so you get more color in your stamp. LOVE.</li>
    <li> Fun, easy to use, endless manicure possibilities. I love doing manicures with my little girl. We get quality creative fun time together and its a great reason not to pay $50 for a salon mani.  I give it four stars because some of the stamps aren&#x27;t cut right and will not come off the plate complete.</li>
    <li> My 3 star rating is based on the fact that most of the images stamp/transfer to the nails really well. The very detailed/smallest images don&#x27;t transfer as well as the Konad brand plates do. I&#x27;d buy again for the price &amp; very fast shipping/delivery.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about trying these stamps out.... when I received them I tried them right away, and needless to say it just doesn&#x27;t work.  The stamps need to be carved deeper in order for it to work... I also e-mailed the company to ask if I was possibly doing something wrong and a month later no one has gotten back to me.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this product.</li>
    <li> This is perfect ;) save me a lot of money I don&#x27;t have to go get my pedicure or manicure done every other week I can do it at home by myself.</li>
    <li> Love these designs. Some of the more detailed ones don&#x27;t come out as clear as I would hope, but I&#x27;m willing to admit it *could* be operator error.&lt;br /&gt;They work really well otherwise.</li>
    <li> All designs on plates are nice but I used then with my Konad scraper and it scratches the plates. Other than that these are great plates.</li>
    <li> Bought these and want to do my nails almost everyday just to try new designs. like being able to do these at home and not pay someone for art on my nails. This is my second set.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my Mash plates.&lt;br /&gt;But when they arrived my set was missing plates and duplicates were included.&lt;br /&gt;Please check your order when it arrives as not to have this happen to you....&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping a reorder will be correct.</li>
    <li> Beautiful designs, great etchings that transfer over perfectly. I had two duplicate plates and haven&#x27;t gotten it taken care of yet, but other than that, no complaints.</li>
    <li> These plates are a great deal for the price! They arrived packaged well in individual bags with protector sheets on each plate. They are etched very well and provide great detail in their designs. Everything was exactly as promised, and was shipped and delivered in a very timely manner. I ordered them tuesday morning and received them thursday with my mail. Excellent product and excellent seller.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> love all the designs in this pack!! so easy to use and fun too!! great for bday parties or just lazy sundays</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering this brand and I was a bit skeptical as Konad is always the recommended brand, I am so glad I ordered this set, i have not used all the patterns, but the ones that I have used came out PERFECT, I know the ones I have not tried yet will yield the same results as I have passed my fingers over them to check how deep the etching is, and they are all deep, you can feel the deep groves even with the protective blue plastic over them. Love them will definitely get other patterns from this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I lovvvvve these plates. Each image transfers perfectly......couldn&#x27;t be happier.... Looking forward to purchasing more of these plates......absolutely perfect for my nail designs!!!!</li>
    <li> arrived on time, was packaged nicely, &amp; these stamps are so cute! thank you!</li>
    <li> OK selection. Cannot soak in polish remover due to paper backing. Double sided stamps would be better so they could be soaked.</li>
    <li> This is just the neatest thing I could&#x27;ve ever purchased.  There are bunches of designs that can be used in many different ways.  I&#x27;ve been practicing using the Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear polich and the Konad stamper and have been getting excellent results.  I&#x27;m going to purchase the double-sided stamper to have a smaller stamping surface for more control.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Work as they should. Will buy more MASH products :). . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Some of the designs aren&#x27;t the super best when transferring over to the nail, but that&#x27;s not a huuuuuge issue for me. This set works for me but there are a few plates I won&#x27;t use. ( Just because I don&#x27;t like the designs to much ) I would recommend this to a friend. But next time I am in the market for stamping plates I will choose plates that &amp;#34; I can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> they are so cute and they all work so well</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these!! i love doing nails and these make it so easy and fun. everyone who sees my nails after ive done these everyone thinks that i&#x27;ve gone to a salon to have my nails done.</li>
    <li> I now have 4 sets of plates, including Red Angel, Bundle Monster (2), and now Mash. I love this set!! All of the designs I have tried have stamped wonderfully--clear and fully. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on these and so far three other people I know have now ordered them because they love the designs and were also able to easily stamp their nails with these. You will not regret purchasing them, especially at this price!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of these plates and am anxious to start stamping, unfortunately the rest of the order was shipped separately so I have to wait impatiently to start.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking it would be something new and cool for my daughter and myself to do in our spare time. We are still trying to get the stamping part down, but we were both excited to see all the cool designs that were sent to us. We havent tried them all yet, but are working on it. I would recommned these to anyone who wants to experiment with different types of quick nail designs. Sure beats going to get airbrush at the nail salon!</li>
    <li> This Mash set (26-50) is the third set of stamping plates I&#x27;ve bought off Amazon. The first was a Bundle Monster pack and the other was the Jumbo Nail Art Z4 2012 set By Cheeky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite set so far. The designs are lovely. And they stamp beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full nail designs are larger than those in the Bundle Monster set I got back in October 2011 but they&#x27;re smaller than the Cheeky Z4 set. Since I had little luck stamping with the Cheeky set no matter which polish I use (even the special Konad stamping polish), I prefer this Mash set over the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had absolutely no problem stamping with any of the four plates I&#x27;ve opened since I got this last week. They work with every polish I&#x27;ve tried (though I haven&#x27;t used any fast dry polishes for obvious reasons).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;d highly suggest this to anyone beginning with stamping or to anyone looking to increase their collection.</li>
    <li> I received these plate about a week ago and immediately tried them out.  I had been having issues with the Red Angel plates and read good reviews on these.  So far they have worked alot better then the Red Angel.&lt;br /&gt;It took some time to find the right polishes that work well for the stamping.  I also bought a Konad stamper to replace the MASH stamper and that is also working better. It is still new to me and need to keep practicing but it is definately better.[[ASIN:B0080GV0Z0 NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates 26-50 Accessories Set Kit]]</li>
    <li> The plates are wonderful. They are easy to use and all the image are deep enough to get by the stamper. Design issue, some are so childish, I dnt know just my opinion.:P</li>
    <li> Love this product, all the images come out very clear and detailed . Wide variety of images and easy to use!!</li>
    <li> I had these in my cart for weeks before I actually decided to buy them. I&#x27;m so glad I did! They work great. I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the stamps not transferring right or anything. I&#x27;m a beginner so I was worried! I LOVE the designs!</li>
    <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
    <li> I bought these as a birthday present for an eleven year old, and she absolutely loved them! The images were great, with a good mix of fun and young pictures but also a decent amount of mature pictures. I would definitely find somewhere to store them though, because they can get scratched easily. (I used a wallet sized picture flipbook) overall, I was super satisfied.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product online thinking that it was going to be a good product, almost all of the reviews were great. Also, When I ordered it I got two day shipping, it came a day late. I was waiting to get them and when I finally did, I was very dissipointed. I used multiple nail polish brands and colors, and none of them worked. The images needed to be carved deeper into the disks for it to transfer onto the nail. I have tried almost all of the disks and none of them work. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just got this set and love it so much already. There are a nice variety of designs and so far all that I have tried worked really well and got lots of compliments. This would make a great starter set and is just as high quality as the Konad plates but has a much better price.</li>
    <li> I use my Konad stamper with these plates and it works great.  Any old nail polish will do and there&#x27;s some greate shapes in this set.  Some not so much, but overall postive.  The only issues I have is the full nail set doesn&#x27;t completely cover my nails and I have very thin fingers.</li>
    <li> This is the firs set of plates that I have bought, I&#x27;m still getting the hang of using them. But after I got the first stamp done correctly i was so excited! I will probably be buying different brands next to compare quality. But as far as these go they are very nice in quality.</li>
    <li> There were only a few stamps I actually would use, and it was way overpriced for the quality. It&#x27;s a bit too complicated to use regularly...maybe if I wasn&#x27;t a mom and had a lot of extra time on my hands I would enjoy this better!</li>
    <li> so many different designs i dont know what to do with them, for the ones with tiny lines you have to be fast because the polish dries quickly, but they are awesome</li>
    <li> the variety is great, a little bit of everything for everyone. in order to get really good at stamping, you have to practice and with a variety of colors too. i don&#x27;t use the konad special polish to get the stamp to show up, use really opaque colors or those that are holographic. they show up nicely. easy clean up too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these plates  The full nail plates are a tad short for my acrylic nails (med length) but fit better than Bundle Monster plates.  The stamping is even and consistent.  I would purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the quality and performance of these stamps. Very comparible to Konad and Bundle Monster. Great Value!</li>
    <li> Love all of them and it&#x27;s so fun to make up new things to do all the time. Work great and have lasted perfect even in a salon setting being used tons a day.</li>
    <li> love these what a Pretty easy way to do your nail art. Love the choices and colors that are available</li>
    <li> I bought this set for one particular plate and overall, I could live without most of these designs. Ironically, there is one design that I didn&#x27;t anticipate loving!! There are gingham checks on plate 50. They are absolutely amazing!! They stamp so detailed and crisp, and the design is so unique. My clients are going crazy for it. The only thing that stinks is that it&#x27;s a little small...can be a problem for thumbs and/or long nails. I&#x27;ll probably post a pic.</li>
    <li> I love to do nails, so I bought these for something different to try. It takes some time and patience to get them to be perfect on your nails, and its easier to do them on someone else, than yourself. A little time comsuming because the plate has to be cleaned each and every time between nails. But still a fun little nail project.</li>
    <li> The more detailed designs don&#x27;t transfer well. There are a lot of designs that I probably will never use like the smiley icons and astrology symbols.</li>
    <li> They are not as good as Konad. They sent me 5 of the exact same ones and it&#x27;s missing the ones I really wanted.. I have used a few patterns from this Mash set. But, overall two thumps down. My 8 year old gets more use out of these.</li>
    <li> Really fantastic plates. With so few reviews on these, I was hesitant about ordering these after getting burned by the high rated Red Angel bundle that turned out to be garbage for me, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. This has turned out to be one of my favorite bundles. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands of image plates and these rank right at the top. I&#x27;d easily put these up against my Konad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been playing around with a lot of the images and can&#x27;t find anything to complain about. There&#x27;s a good variety of designs. Of course, in every bundle of this size there&#x27;s going to some images that don&#x27;t appeal to everyone, but overall, I thought the selection was really good (as you can see from the images Amazon provides). They&#x27;re along the lines of any of these bundle packages. I like the full nail designs best and there are a lot useful ones in this bundle. There&#x27;s some immature designs (like unicorn, horse, dolphin, ghost, kitty, rainbow,etc), but a good selection of more sophisticated ones as well. Since I use these for myself and my young nieces I&#x27;m really happy with the selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent. There are no rough edges. All the images are well defined and transfer polish very well to the nail. These plates are worth a lot more than the $12.99 price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into nail stamping art, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these. As I stated, the quality is really good, and even if you&#x27;re quite picky and don&#x27;t like all the images, at the $12.99 price, I can&#x27;t see anyone being upset with these plates, unless they don&#x27;t know how to stamp (it takes practice and experimenting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can&#x27;t believe how fast I got these (sold through ProSource DisCounts Inc, MASH Nails). I have the two day shipping and shouldn&#x27;t have gotten them until Tuesday (ordered late Friday night), but they came on Monday. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased all 50 of the MASH nail plates. They are lovely, nicely packaged, protective film comes off cleanly.  I&#x27;ve used them with the MASH stamping polish and they work very well.  Very nice designs. My only complaint is that the full nail images are too small for people (like me) with wider nails.  1-25 are very small.  26-50 are slightly larger.  Hopefully the next set will be even a bit bigger (pretty please). I will definitely be buying more from MASH!</li>
    <li> Great quality, smooth, finished edges, crisp designs.</li>
    <li> MASH has done a wonderful job this go around, the image plates are excellent quality. ALL of the full nail images are equally sized and work great! I like that each plate was individually sealed in a package and also had the blue film on the plate as well as all plates were then in a larger package. There was NO WAY the plates would arrive scuffed or scratched kudos MASH.</li>
    <li> Order received when promised. I think my daughter will enjoy these, I cant wait for her to &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; on me. Bought these as part of her &amp;#34;nail&amp;#34; gifts for her 12th b&#x27;day</li>
    <li> Love the plates and I bought them at a great deal.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as KONAD stamping plates and they are so much cheaper, i will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I just received this today and got to work on my nails. I also have monster stamping plates and these worked better than those. Very cute designs, pefect for valentines day. I will be ordering more from Shany Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This set is a lot more affordable than the Konad plates.  A lot of the designs I&#x27;ll never use (the emoticon faces and dolphins for example, quite juvenile...) but the patterns are pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the konad stamper.  As for the polish, just make sure you use a thicker polish, the thinner ones won&#x27;t show up well regardless of plate brand.</li>
    <li> I really love the selection of Images you get in Mash&#x27;s Nail Art Image Plates Set (26-50) - The amount of Manicures you can create with this one set is endless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All images stamp beautifully&lt;br /&gt;- The quality of the image plates is 10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely recommend these plates to any experienced or beginner stamper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A massive thumbs up from me mash - Well-done!</li>
    <li> Love them! and at such a great bargain you cant lose! all the designs are really detailed and amazing makes doing my nails a fun new experience every time!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried konad so I can&#x27;t compare but I do have the red angel and salon express. I really do love the designs n these are as good as the red angel one I have. I would definatley recommend these for the price.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, these plates! After my user error passed they have been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one gripe... I don&#x27;t like all the designs. There are some plates where I don&#x27;t like any designs, but I guess that&#x27;s what buying in bulk is all about! My daughter (4 yrs old) liked some weird ones so, eh, I&#x27;m sure she will get a kick out of these for years to come... even those weird smiley faces :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Do not push down too hard. I was having trouble getting the designs off (using Konad Special Nail Polish) and I was pushing down so hard trying to pick up the design but it was not working. I finally got mad and just put the stamper (Konad, as well) on top and pulled it off gently and the whole design was there perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates have worked great on myself and my daughter and I would not trade them for anything, especially since the one Konad plate I ordered, did not work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love These Plates!!!</li>
    <li> So many designs to choose from and they are so easy to use! I&#x27;m having so much fun mixing and matching!</li>
    <li> The wells dont seem to be deep enough or something... I can press the stamper into it but it doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up enough</li>
    <li> This is a good set. They work just as well as the konad ones I have. The plates are a little thinner and can have sharp edges.</li>
    <li> AAm very pleased with this product...only thing i found was there was a couple i wanted to use but wouldn&#x27;t work due to the engraved was deep enough soooo wouldnt let me use those but there is a ton of designs to use!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical ordering a brand other than Konad, but these stamped pretty well for the images I have tried so far. great images and they DO have a paper backing, unlike some off brands out there. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My first set of nail plates, pretty happy with it. cute pattern, good quality, can&#x27;t beat Konad, but still very cost efficient.</li>
    <li> Okay so im new to stamping. I read most reviews and they said that these stamps are easy to use and come out awesome...well the first part is true. These or any other stamps are easy to use but the overall product could be better. The stamp on my nail appears faded and not as \\&quot;popping\\&quot; to the eye. Like you have to use light colors for a base and a really dark top color just for it to be seen. The patterns included in this pack are pretty and patterns most people would use. Its still worth the buy..buy like the title, it could be better.</li>
    <li> I could never get these to work. 2 friends of mine tried neither of them were able to get these to work either.</li>
    <li> B khb high hbjh bib khb khb jhj hbj hbjh bib khb khb khb khb khb khb khb khb kh bkj bkj bkj b</li>
    <li> The set is a great value for the amount of stamp images you get. Also the plates provide a clear crisp image and plates are not cheaply made. Very happy to have in my collection.</li>
    <li> Every image is engraved crisp and well detailed. One of my favorite sets due the images stamping so pretty. I hope your next set has more full nail images</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product are already very good, so I don&#x27;t have anything new to add -- I can just confirm that a lot of these plates are well-etched and transfer perfectly. There are a few designs that seem shallow and problematic as far as retaining the crispness of the design, but they&#x27;re vastly outnumbered by the rest. Quite a few good staple designs here, and something of a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> These are great quality... The designs come out clean every time and the assortment of designs is very nice. l</li>
    <li> I have the 2012 set, and absolutely love all of the plates. The backing has paper now and the edging of the plates is smoother, no chance of injury :) The designs are great, and all different sizes which makes it so much easier with long or short nails. All of the designs went on my stamper with no issues. You wont be sorry if you purchase this set! I did my 5 year old nieces nails and she loved them too!!!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous, fun, and work just as well as the name-brand. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently that&#x27;s not a long enough review, so I&#x27;ll just put in some more words to say it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my wife and she was absolutely ecstatic about the plates. She owns a set of Conrad ones and was really surprised of the variety and quality of this set for the price...in fact she found these easier to apply and liked the designs much better. No problems on the service or shipping end and it arrived a day earlier than anticipated. All around great purchase.</li>
    <li> I was happy with these plates. They worked as well as the Konad plates and I found that they worked very well with OPI nail polish.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail art for my daughter. She LOVES to do different types of nail art. Lots of different stamps.</li>
    <li> Received 4 days after placing order!  Have tried a lot of the designs, not all.  Most are well etched, although I have had come across a few of them that are not quite as deep as most.  The full nail designs are a bit larger than those of the BM set I also purchased, which is great for me!  They are wide enough to cover all my nails, although the length is not quite long enough for some of my nails.  I am quite pleased with the variety of designs in the set.</li>
    <li> There are some very fun pictures to put on your nails, but a bit over much of the sort that tries to go over your entire nail.  since my nails are not shaped like little squares, these I find useless.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out nail stamping and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s really easy to use (Sally Hansen Xtreme long wear) works very well for stamping in my experience. All the stencils work perfectly. I need to get more</li>
    <li> I am a nail artist who lovesssssssssss nail stamping. These are great plates. fast shipping</li>
    <li> Wonderful discs.  The collection of art on these discs are perfect for doing a wide variety of nail art. Thank you</li>
    <li> I do not understand how there are so many great reviews for these.  I tried about 8 different plates and NONE of them worked even half as well as the Konad brands.  The designs were not grooved deep enough to hold paint.  For the record, I AM an experienced stamper and I was using very high quality (Konad) stamping polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the high reviews, but whatever they got was not what I got.  I had to return mine...</li>
    <li> Love love love them! They&#x27;re great. I love that there are so many to choose from. The designs are neat and unique</li>
    <li> The etchings on these are a little more shallow than I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;ve mostly been able to overcome this by using metallic polishes instead of stamping polishes.</li>
    <li> i got my plates a few days ago and tried out the leopard print on my nails. i think their good designs are nice and don&#x27;t come out blocky or blurry. some of the plates i have seen the images are not very clear and look clunky. with a good polish even a first time user would do well, just remove the blue plastic and the plate is ready to go.</li>
    <li> I have used mostly Konad plates until now and these work just as well.  The full print plates are a bit small for my whole thumb.</li>
    <li> Excellent plates. The designs are very crisp and the product comes protected from scratches in transit by blue film on the front (which you need to remove before using). I have used two of these plates so far, and they work very well. The images are engraved with sharp edges and come off very cleanly. The size is also pretty good, and will fit most nails which are average in length/width. I have medium-long length nails (1/8\\&quot; past the tips of my fingers with long nail beds, totaling about 5/8\\&quot;) and found the length of the stamp to be perfect on all of my nails, and with careful application the width was perfect for all but my thumbs and even that was close enough that I did not feel the need to stamp again at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend any MASH plates for nail art lovers.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my wife/kids for xmas. They really liked the designs and its a great add-on to their existing collection. They have used them a few times now and I have yet to hear a complaint which is a great sign!</li>
    <li> I checked reviews for all the different brands of image plates and thought this one would work well for me. I got the product a few days ago along with one of the Konad plates (m57). The konad image plates worked flawlessly but the Mash plates do not transfer images at all. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product. I&#x27;ve even tried filing the stamp to rough it up a bit and it still isn&#x27;t picking up images off the Mash plates.</li>
    <li> As a beginner nail stamper this pack is great. Still have not opened all the disks. Came with no instructions so i just researched how to use them best.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this set of plates mostly for the all over nail designs.  There are quite a few of that style.  They stamp great.  I use regular polishes but I look for thicker formulas or metallics.  I like the variety of images.  It&#x27;s a good purchase for those that love their nail stamping or even those that want to get started.  If you do have trouble stamping I recommend searching for videos on tips and tricks.  Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s so much fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mess when it comes to doing my nails. I get polish all over the place, unless I really take my time. So I figured that using these would be a disaster, but with so many fantastic plate designs for such a great price, why not? I used a Konad stamper and scraper and bought these plates. They&#x27;re really, really great. I used my own nail polish and got a pretty perfect stamp on my first try! I played around with it for awhile to get a system down, but the plates are really easy to use. And so pretty! I&#x27;ve got one Konad plate (the M60), and have no plans to buy anymore. This MASH set is all you need! I couldn&#x27;t possibly happier. And I can&#x27;t stop looking at my nails!</li>
    <li> I own a couple of Konad plates but honestly I think MASH plates are just as good and a better deal for your money.  No scratches and images come out nice and crisp.  Sally Hansen Instant dry nail polish seems to be a great substitute for Konad polishes and much cheaper.  My daughter really seems to enjoy the smiley face design plate so there is something here for everyone.  If asking for preference I like these more than Bundle Monster design plates but even those are a pretty good deal for starting out.  I actually use Cheeky, MASH,  Bundle Monster, and Red Angel plates more often than my Konad ones so if your looking for a good deal go to you tube to check out the reviews and closer looks to see what brand has more designs that you like.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for girls night and it was definitely worth it. I have no tried Konad before but I think this worked just fine. I wouldn&#x27;t want to pay 10 dollars a plate so this set was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many complements on my nails. I really do like most of the patterns even if some are a little silly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set. It works amazingly. It might take a few tries at first and working to keep your hand steady but this is an awesome set. Just remember to peel the film off the plates.</li>
    <li> These were just okay. They don&#x27;t stamp the best and I always make a mess out of my nails. I don&#x27;t have the patience either to sit around and wait for my nails to dry and then go back in and do them again.</li>
    <li> I have some Konad plates. But as most reviews state this are good to. It has some designs that I don&#x27;t like but most of them are really nice. Also the plates are thick enought that there is not risk to get a cut. Nice set and affordable price!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second set of MASH plates and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. Great quality and selection of images. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Also the price is much more affordable than other brands on the market.</li>
    <li> This product is so great! This is my first time using a nail stamping art anything. It takes just a little nail polish. Cotton ball with a little bit of naile polish remover gets it cleaned pretty quickly and pretty good. This exceeds my expectations! I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> My wife really enjoys painting her nails so I bought here this as a gift, it made me a friggin&#x27; superhero in her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically you get 25 steel plates with designs etched onto them.  You put some paint on the design you want, scrape it flush with the plate, and use a special dauber (not included) to transfer to your nail.  I put instructions here because I honestly didn&#x27;t know what the heck they were when I ordered them, I knew she wanted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the designs, there&#x27;s plenty.  At about 4-6 per plate, you get almost 100 things to use.  I&#x27;m half jealous as it looks like fun to be honest.  I may even appropriate a couple for designs on model cars or adding to action figures that may or may not be mine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy painting your nails with designs, or even have nail design on your Pinterest, buy these.</li>
    <li> Great plates and great designs and they actually work.  Seems to be the problem i have with a lot of the other plate sets i have bought is that none of them work.  The plates are the only ones i have bought that DO work!  Very happy with them!  Definately recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying stamping my nails recently and love the designs on these cute plates! I can&#x27;t get enough of them!</li>
    <li> I love these nail stamp plates!!! I will definitely be getting more they stamp perfectly with regular nail polish the engraving is nice an deep I get a crisp clear stamp every single time the designs are beautiful and the price for so many plates is AMAZING compared to konad I will get Mash anytime!!! I am a fan GET THESE PLATES!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these stamping plates! Shipping was quick and I found no problems with the packaging. It took me a while to get used to scraping and stamping, but when I finally got the hang of it, I was able to make beautiful designs. Clean up is easy, and the edges of the plates aren&#x27;t sharp, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my hands. So far, I&#x27;ve received TONS of compliments from my friends about my nails. If anyone is looking for a quick way to get beautiful and eye-catching designs without the messy hassle, I recommend purchasing these plates!!!</li>
    <li> The order came right on time, the product was everything it said it would be. The plates work great and are not sharp on the edges. I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this set. I wish the first set was still available for the same price so I can get those too.</li>
    <li> First, you get a TON of plates (and if you go to most sellers, you are getting a good price). Second, the image quality is really great. And tons of images. Lots of fun patterns and images. You&#x27;ll probably want to try out a different one on each finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: for first time users, if you want crisp images each time, make sure to clean the plate with nail polish remover in between each stamp. You will regret it if you do not.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I&#x27;ve used the Konad brand but wanted to try a less expensive option.  So far, these have worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The plates are very thick&lt;br /&gt;The patterns are pretty sharp and distinct&lt;br /&gt;The patterns have always been large enough for my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There are a few patterns that don&#x27;t seem to pick up well.  For instance, the three hearts have quite a bit of negative space and I can&#x27;t get the polish to fill the whole area evenly.</li>
    <li> Okay so I am a complete, COMPLETE newbie for stamping!! I bought the konad double stamper from amazon and this set of plates, I just used the polish I had on hand, which double as nail pens (the other end screws off and theres a brush) anyways, it took me a LOOONNGG while to do this accuratley, first painting all my nails, waiting to dry, then painting my plate and scraping for 20 minutes wondering why nothing is showing on my stamp. There is a plastic FILM on it! Remove first!! These plates are not BLUE but silver. Yeah I&#x27;m stupid I know, but if your new to stamping like me and have no clue, make sure you take the plastic off, and also watch some youtube videos too. It took my friend who got her stamp like an easy 2 minutes, it took me 2 hours (waited for polish to dry and then the plastic snafu oh and did my toes first! Disaster lol) BUT I know how to do this now so now it should only take me 2 minutes as well. Anyways lots of great designs, lots of full nail options and cute little ones. Fits my nails fine, my nails and hands are pretty small, so I was worried that the designs would be too big but nope showed up on ALL my nails beautifully. The pictures you see attached are mine, with OPI shower together (blue) and the white flowers over. I am officially OBSESSED :)</li>
    <li> I was very impressed that this was not at all messy or sloppy prints. they leave beautiful little pictures on my nails and I just love it</li>
    <li> These apparently are dupes for konad which means nothing to me as I just want the image I am looking for when I want it. Mash always has it.</li>
    <li> These plates are very nice, especially for the price paid. Each plate is individually wrapped and initially comes with a peel-off cover on each one to prevent scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used two so far, and I absolutely love the plate with the unicorn on it :) They work and clean up well. Just make sure you have a stamper and scraper that work equally well. I use an old plastic school ID card to scrape these with, because my Konad scraper scratched one of my plates.</li>
    <li> This set of stamp plates were okay, I liked that it had a lot of stamp choices to choose from. The only thing that bugs me is that the full nail stamps was still too small for my nails. It did not cover my whole nail at all and my nails are normal length, not too long either. I would suggest for full nail stamps to be a little bit bigger to cover the whole nail. Other than that, everything works pretty well. Just remember to use a thicker polish than normal when trying to stamp!</li>
    <li> Great images in this kit.  I like the amount of full nail designs included as well as smaller images.  Worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for quality stamps for a while, and read reviews on many different brands throughout amazon. Eventually, I chose this set because of the high reviews as well as the interesting and unique designs. I definitely made the right choice! These designs can take a few times to get right, but it requires nowhere near the amount of effort it would take to do these freehand. In minutes, my manicure is transformed from normal to extraordinary. I&#x27;ve had many people ask me who does my nails, which I consider to be the ultimate compliment. These are very well priced, great quality, and arrived merely days after I purchased them.</li>
    <li> Each plate comes individually wrapped, the designs are nice. What I really like is the price, the Konad plates cost around $6 or so. Buying this set of 25 is a good deal for me. Now I can do designs on my nails that not even the lady in the nail salon will do.</li>
    <li> the item i recieved was not plates 26-50 they were the 51-75 set that i already had and there were many multiples</li>
    <li> Patterns are small. Having a hard time transfering them.</li>
    <li> Its ok but I would love if they had better designs</li>
    <li> Grear product! I&#x27;m having fun using this item. There are so many stamp images to use I have been able to get to them all. Great quality item and would purchase again if they came out with more.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a little skeptical to use something other than konad. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find I like the quality and ease of use of these plates better than my konad plates. The engravings are the perfect depth and look great every time. Many of the designs are a little more immature, but I found quite a few I would use myself. I use these mostly for my young nieces anyway, and they especially love the wide selection of cute full nail designs. These plates are well worth the small price!</li>
    <li> First day they arrived, I was so excited! I couldn&#x27;t wait to apply them to my nails. :) I haven&#x27;t used all the stamps yet, but the ones I did use worked just fine. Looking forward to buying my next set soon. I recommend this product - MUST BUY NOW! lol.</li>
    <li> At a mall, inoder to buy one is like more than $5 a piece or something. so for 25 for this price is really good. the product is also excellent. they are individually wrapped in their own original package. there is no sharp edges around to cut your hands, the images comes nice and most of all you have a so many designs to chose from!! I really love this! Its a must if you are into nail art!</li>
    <li> Stamping has recently caught my attention, in that \\&quot;oh wow I need to learn how to do that RIGHT NOW\\&quot; sort of way.  I started to research different designs and plates, and after doing a little math and realizing I could get 3 of The Big Name in plates for the same price as this whole MASH set, I figured I&#x27;d give the MASH set a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these plates.  Obviously the big draw is you get a huge selection - yes, buying in bulk means there are ones you may never use, but I could easily see myself using 75% of the designs, so it&#x27;s still very worth it to me.  I&#x27;m especially a fan of geometric designs, and there are plenty of circles, squares, plaid, swirls, and squiggles to keep me happy.  They&#x27;re also ridiculously easy to use, to the point of laughing gleefully when you lift the stamp and have a perfect design on your nail.  That cool design was really THAT easy to do?  Yes, yes it was.  I use these in conjunction with the Konad scraper and stamper, which works very well in transferring the polish from plate to nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the plates there seems to be just one design that wasn&#x27;t etched perfectly - but since it&#x27;s a) a design I wouldn&#x27;t really use anyway and b) still looks pretty cool despite the flaw, I&#x27;m not fussed.  More than 99% of the designs seem to be perfectly etched which is great quality control as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Also, the designs don&#x27;t seem to be quite wide enough for a thumbnail - but really the bigger issue is that I&#x27;m terrible at stamping my thumbnails, so I should address that first.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict - even though it&#x27;s hard to see exactly what you&#x27;re getting from the pictures, this set is well worth it with many options for everyone.  It has been a great intro to stamping for my beginner self, and I&#x27;m excited to continue adding to my collection - not that I need to anytime soon, with so many designs at my fingertips right now.  The quality and great designs has put MASH on my future \\&quot;must buy\\&quot; list.</li>
    <li> This set is a great &amp;quot;backbone&amp;quot; set to have! It has so many super images that can be used in so many different ways. If I had to purchase only one set of nail plates, this is the set I would buy!! MASH plates are always high quality!</li>
    <li> I have used these a few times. I am an amateur but these plates work great, they don&#x27;t cut my hands, they&#x27;re sturdy, they fit in the Konad plate holder and I get A LOT of compliments on my nails. These are easy to use and clean up well. I have only one complaint, the full designs don&#x27;t fit my thumb nail so I have to use a design that doesn&#x27;t make my thumb look like it has a partial design which is only a few designs (that I like) out of 125 designs. My hands are not huge, they are a medium size but my thumbnails are wide. This is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT because the reason I purchased these plates were because of the full designs. I don&#x27;t really care for the designs that are meant to be put on the tip of your nails or the smaller designs. I bought these plates because you can spend 5+ dollars just on one plate so they are a good value. Also just as a side note, my advice is to buy polish meant for stamping. I tried stamping with nail polish that I already had but ended up ordering the Konad Nail Art Stamping Polish which works really well. If you don&#x27;t want to buy the Konad Stamping Polish you can use regular polish but it takes some time and experience to figure out which ones work. I did not want to take the time to experiment. If it weren&#x27;t for my thumbnail I would rate these a 5 but because of my thumbnails I am rating them a 2, otherwise these are fantastic plates for people who don&#x27;t have wide thumbnails.</li>
    <li> So as many have stated, these arrived VERY fast. The variety is very good, ranging between several varieties of full nail designs and individual stamps.&lt;br /&gt;My original stamper was the salon express. The stamper had to be scuffed up a little more, and the technique altered a little for the bigger designs, but it still worked. The holder was a little smaller than the stamp plates, but I rarely use it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;There were a few scratches in my brand new plates, but gain, not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;I find a lot of these designs very dainty so I pretty much just sat down with a stamping paper and worked on the technique. Specific polish didn&#x27;t seem like a problem until I got to some of the more detailed designs.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was deeply saddened there was not one frog stamp. Despite this I felt overwhelmed by the stamping selections and may be changing my nails every hour.&lt;br /&gt;For as much time as I put into nail art, I am very happy to have these stamps to make the process a little quicker.</li>
    <li> The images come out clean and solid. They also cover my whole nail, and I&#x27;ve been told by professional manicurists that I have long nail beds. The edges of the plates aren&#x27;t sharp, and they are pretty scratch resistant when using the scraper. Would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I used these plates with the Konad brand double ended stamper.</li>
    <li> I was nurvous reading about people cutting their fingers I was exceptionally careful about taking them out of their package and getting the foil off but I have not cut my fingers at all and since I have received them I have used them multiple times I love them. I wish they came with instructions but after a few tries I got them working.</li>
    <li> As an avid stamping nail art fan, these MASH nail plates seriously exceeded my expectations! I love all the fun and quirky designs on these plates, especially the cute animals. Another plus is that the all over nail prints are also longer than Konad plates. You can&#x27;t beat the value of this set! I love it!</li>
    <li> Good quality, they stamp great so far. Have done one full manicure so far and everyone loved it. Happy :)</li>
    <li> Since I received these plates in the mail last week, I have used them almost every day.  They&#x27;re easy to apply and clean, and the designs offer a great variety of sizes and styles.  My friends come over all the time to use them!  This was my first nail stamp purchase, but I love them so much I&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
    <li> Art plates have super cute designs and are in great condition. Exactly as I hoped they would be. Can&#x27;t wait to use them all.</li>
