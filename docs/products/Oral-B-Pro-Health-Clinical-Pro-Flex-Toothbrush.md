<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great toothbrush. Already bent the bristles though. I brush hard.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re toothbrushes, for crips sakes.  They don&#x27;t make me do a song and dance.  But they brush my teeth withought coming undone in my mouth, which is a good thing.  I&#x27;ll continue using them as long as that remains so, and as long as the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Don&#x27;t forget to floss!</li>
    <li> I like the new Pro Flex Oral B..it just seems that my teeth get cleaner! Highly recommend. Getting this through Amazon is a&lt;br /&gt;plus as well. Good price.</li>
    <li> Clean Teeth. Well done brushes.</li>
    <li> I like the design - it offers more coverage. But a little big in size.</li>
    <li> I definitely like the new design of the brush head. It seems as though with this toothbrush it is virtually impossible to apply too much pressure to the teeth and gums. That alone is worth the price of admission.</li>
    <li> I have always used an Oral-B toothbrush.  I was intrigued with the new design so I purchased and tried it out.  I visit my dentist twice per year for cleanings and have always received rave reviews on how clean my teeth were going into the cleaning.  This last week was the first time in at least 10 years where my hygienist gave me negative comments about my teeth and about the plaque buildup.  I will never use that brush again, but will switch back to the Oral B complete, which has been a great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought them since I thought they were a new variant on my favorite Oral-B toothbrush the Pulsar. They aren&#x27;t. Though after using them I was more than happy with the mix up on my end. They&#x27;re just as good and you don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries dying before the head show excessive signs of wear or having it accidentally turn on since you didn&#x27;t press in the button hard enough.</li>
    <li> Not so soft not so hard brushes. cleans nice and firm.</li>
    <li> They work very well, and last long.</li>
    <li> Love having this available on Subscribe and Save!  I&#x27;ll never go to Costco again!</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush, however the bristles do not last very long. Subscribe and Save ever 2 months for one person.</li>
    <li> Neither here nor there. Not completely sold. Might cancel subscription. The head of the toothbrush is just too small. I have a really big mouth.</li>
    <li> Love Oral-B products and it&#x27;s no exception for the pro-flex toothbrush. I have a toothbrush in every bathroom in my house. I work hard to brush my teeth after every single meal and these are wonderful tooth brushes. They were reasonably priced and they arrived very quickly - packaged up nicely with the rest of my order, and they have a nice feel to them but they&#x27;re not too soft. Just perfect for that after-meal brush. Brush your teeth at least 3x a day if not more!</li>
    <li> My favorite toothbrush, if there&#x27;s such a thing! Firm, but not too firm.</li>
    <li> Product and price were a good bargain and happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> tooth brushes like we have liked using - we do irrigate our teeth - like to brush ourselves - these are firm, yet not hard - dislike soft ones</li>
    <li> I am honestly not an expert when it comes to brushes... that said I know what may feel better than the generic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve purchased before. These are quite effective and leave my mouth feeling great. So in my opinion these are great.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping exactly as described</li>
    <li> I Love my Pro-Flex Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush, what else can I say about them?</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes :)</li>
    <li> This is the closest I have used to and electric tooth brush!</li>
    <li> These are very nice basic tooth brushes that are designed well.  You can get to the back of your mouth with no problem...behind those molars.  &amp;#34;Flex&amp;#34; is a good name for these.  Good grip with just the right amount of give.  Nice handle grip too.</li>
    <li> The edges don&#x27;t connect the whole length of the bristles and this causes toothpaste to get stuck and harden.  Would be a good tooth brush if it weren&#x27;t for that</li>
    <li> Cleans well,  but bristles are a little too wide apart.</li>
    <li> The set came in open. It looked like someone returned it and they stuffed back into the container. Since those are toothbrushes, I had to throw them out...who knows why they were open.</li>
    <li> Buy these all the time.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is AWESOME! Perfectly rough and gets in all those nooks and crannies that you&#x27;ve never reached before. 0.0</li>
    <li> I only use Oral B toothbrushes. Always have, after trying a ton of different brands and types. Oral B just always seemed a better quality brush, reaches more areas, and feels better overall.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums and the medium brush really helps with that.</li>
    <li> The product has come in as advertised, on-time, and in good condition (all though package sealing had started to work loose).  As a side not to Oral-B in general, my girlfriend noted that using this brand has helped get the clean feeling back in her teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for twice. I am going to buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand of toothbrush!</li>
    <li> It does its job of cleaning and i like the medium bristles (cant stand soft) but after each brush paste seems to settle within the bottom of brushes more than other brushes i used. You need to consciously wash the brush thoroughly after each use.</li>
    <li> I use them every day to brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best manual brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Interesting flexible head, everyone seems to like it. I will add this to my subscribe and save order.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. It was worth getting the subscription.</li>
    <li> Having the right toothbrush does make a difference in dental hygiene, and if you&#x27;re not brushing at least twice a day or preferably after every single meal, you are doing your teeth plenty of harm. Love Oral-B and love using a bigger toothbrush - not those throw-aways that you get on airplanes - and completely clean all of your teeth. I like the positioning of these bristles and also the larger handle. It&#x27;s a great travel toothbrush since I don&#x27;t take my electric one with me on travel, and great that it comes in pairs, so you can switch it out every so often (at most, every 3 months, if not sooner.).</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, big brush heads - which I enjoy - and good grip. They don&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d like for 3 bucks each (or 6 for the package), but I&#x27;m sure it is cheaper than in store!</li>
    <li> These brushes work for me</li>
    <li> best way to clean your teeth</li>
    <li> Great price for good item!</li>
    <li> parents love this.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it works well, lasts long, and doesn&#x27;t hurt their gum.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> Good brushes, but they do not last long</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be as good as they are.  I&#x27;ve actually been using these instead of my battery powered toothbrush because I think they&#x27;re doing a better job.  The insides of my teeth have been a problem in the past with other toothbrushes, but I haven&#x27;t been having that issue with these.  I just bought these when they were a lightning deal, I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations and am really pleased with a spur of the moment purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a bit now and like the firmness/feel. Really a matter of opinion on whether you would like them I guess.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned.  Cleans extremely well and it&#x27;s no gimmick.  Highly recommended, just one of those good quality, excellent products.</li>
    <li> Good Price, good tooth brushes</li>
    <li> Without much effort, this toothbrush allowed me to remove gums, and the extra long bristles on the top of a head effectively help clean the last molar. I purchased this toothbrush multiple times.</li>
    <li> This is a nice tooth brush. Does the job. Very easily used. Nice angles on the brush. No complaints from me.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The ingredients in our products are FDA approved.&lt;br /&gt;There is no BPA in the Oral-B toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;Commonly found in “clamshell” and “blister” packages, Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) has been a widely used packaging material across much of the consumer goods industry for many years. PVC has also been the source of recurring controversy regarding its disposal to household solid waste incinerators, and its compatibility with plastics recycling. As a result, P&amp;G began to avoid the use of PVC in its packaging in the early-1990s.&lt;br /&gt; It is a challenge to find technically effective and affordable alternatives to PVC for some applications. However, in partnership with our packaging suppliers, we have overcome many of these barriers.&lt;br /&gt;  Today, PVC represents less than 1.5% of the Company’s total use of plastic packaging materials.&lt;br /&gt;  We expect to eliminate all remaining uses of PVC in our packaging within the next few years.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had such clean teeth!</li>
    <li> medium still to hard for me, after the first use i was bleeding.</li>
    <li> I drank a lot last night, so now I need a toothbrush. Fortunately, I had ordered this toothbrush. My life is magical.</li>
    <li> Perfect, delivered just as expected.</li>
    <li> The way the handle and brush are angled the water on your brush flows right down the handle all over your hand and it becomes difficult to grip.  Won&#x27;t buy this style again</li>
    <li> With the great price for these Oral-B brushes, I don&#x27;t need to wait for a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; toothbrush at my next dental visit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush. I bought it because it looked a little fancier and had good reviews, but it&#x27;s just a big toothbrush with stiff bristles. Works fine.</li>
    <li> They always seem to add to the design of the simple toothbrush, but this new one seems actually better.  What do you know?  It has a little spring to it.</li>
    <li> I feel like I get a good brush with this toothbrush. I do agree with some other reviews stating that the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; is pretty big as far as toothbrushes go, but I don&#x27;t have a problem getting the back of my mouth. Not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Cool toothbrushes. My teeth are clean.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothbrush that gets the job done. What more of can you ask from a cheap brush...?</li>
    <li> This is currently my favorite toothbrush on the market. The bristles are strong, the grip is comfortable. Good value and cleans my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> Works better at cleaning between teeth, compared to others products, but doesn&#x27;t last long. The bristles can be a bit harsh initially.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, you get 2 in this package and the bristles are not to stiff and not to soft.  Oral-B is the best brand around.  They seem to flex from the bristles, they are a bit raised and feel comfortable when brushing I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> really like these brushes</li>
    <li> great quality and subbed for a steady supply. thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Lovely toothbrush, does the job well! Great that it comes with a 2 pack so you can give one to the misses or keep a spare!</li>
    <li> Very groovy. I really like the cantilevered head as it keeps brushing gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll happily order more when these are used up.</li>
    <li> A high quality product. What else can you say? Comes with two toothbrushes and I did not get an option of color... so of course one is pink. But hell, for such a good toothbrush I will man up with pride and use it in the future (right after the manly one runs ragged).</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo27OSE15WV5J0Y]]I think it&#x27;s a classic MEDIUM toothbrush. I know well because if it&#x27;s too hard I&#x27;d feel it and see the blood in mouthwaters. And if it&#x27;s too soft - it would not massage enough. So, this one is just perfect for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always good to have a extra toothbrush.  These toothbrushes will do a number to my teeth every time I brush them.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. Its cheap, its effective, and really, what else can you want from a toothbrush</li>
    <li> I like how they have packaged two together. I use one in am and a different one in pm so that they dry thoroughly and can be more effective in brushing. And Oral B products are consistently great.</li>
    <li> I have a subscription for these. They seem to do the job quite well.</li>
    <li> I am happy to see these in packs of 3. I can stock up on them and not worry about having to get a new toothbrush every 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, the price was good, I had no chance to try this product yet, but it looks like it has an interesting concept, the brush head has a bouncy system</li>
    <li> When comparing to the Colgate 360, found this to generally be not as good of a toothbrush. Crest/Oral-B throws around clinical meaninglessly sometimes these ideas and this is another example.</li>
    <li> Love these tooth brushes. I set up subscribe and save to automatically shop new ones so know need to remember when to replace ours!</li>
    <li> Great, flexible for hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Great value for the product. Hard to find the same toothbrush twice in stores. Subscribe and save makes it easy for these every day things.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are the best manual brushes I have found. They are a bit more expensive than some, but well worth it in my opinion</li>
    <li> I like these toothbrushes, but honestly not sure that they do anything better than any other manual toothbrush out there.</li>
    <li> It does all the things that you would expect a toothbrush to do. When you put toothpaste on it and rub it around in your mouth it makes things cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it would take for me to give a toothbrush five stars. It would probably have to go above and beyond what a normal toothbrush would to and extend it&#x27;s list of uses into the realm of the magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 4 stars.</li>
    <li> These are firm, but soft enough not to damage my veneers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them &amp; would recommend them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B makes great floss &amp; the only one I consistently carry around in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy &amp; will definitely buy again &amp; again &amp; again!</li>
    <li> The best manual toothbrush out there. Especially,  for kids who don&#x27;t floss as they should!</li>
    <li> This device will clean debris off of your teeth with small polymer bristles.  It is essential to your dental health.  Proper use of this product is essential to a healthy life.  If you don&#x27;t use this product YOU WILL DIE.</li>
    <li> We subscribed it monthly! It never disappoint us. Very good quality with cheap price. I highly recommend it to you!</li>
    <li> This product was better than i expected. A very good quality tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it. Not as good as electric one but very good manual tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for the price. Very comfortable to use and gets the job done effectively.</li>
    <li> I do have an electric toothbrush that I use morning and before bed, but I brush my teeth about ten times a day (pretty much any time I eat or drink anything... I&#x27;m a little OCD about it) and I&#x27;m not always in the mood to use the electric toothbrush- it&#x27;s got a visual timer on it and I feel obligated to brush my teeth the whole two minutes every time I use it (personal quirk). And you can&#x27;t really stick it in your mouth and just brush it around without turning it on- mine has a small head and I feel like I&#x27;m trying to brush my teeth with a marble on a stick when it&#x27;s not turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these Pro-Flex are my go-to toothbrushes because they are the only manual toothbrushes I have tried that makes my mouth feel (almost) as clean as the electric toothbrush does. I like the super firm bristles, and the way they are situated on the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the toothbrush is that it&#x27;s got a lot of grooves and openings on the design of the handle, and if you don&#x27;t clean the toothbrush thoroughly after using it, toothpaste and stuff builds up in the crevices on the handle and it the toothbrush looks kinda gross. Again, personal quirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are the best manual brushes on the market, and I have tried MANY of them. My teeth feel super clean and my gums aren&#x27;t sore. I love these toothbrushes. I wish they&#x27;d take the head of these brushes and make an electric head from them.</li>
    <li> By far probably the best toothbrush I have used in a while. I would not go back to my old one.</li>
    <li> I got such a great deal and its not too strong or too soft it is perfect. I just took braces off and my teeth are sensitive.</li>
    <li> I started traveling for my job and I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to use my electric toothbrush on the road.  I have been using these brushes five days a week for two months.  A few weeks ago I had a dentist appointment, my dentist said that my teeth were as clean as they had been when I was using my electric toothbrush exclusively.  No cavities and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Nice product from Oral B</li>
    <li> Cleans teeth perfectly. Nice pressure on the brush and it is comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean the small gaps between teeth, I will recommend you get the oral-B floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00240UWGG/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00240UWGG&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;nealo10a-20</li>
    <li> Not bad toothbrushes. Bought these due to the value. Nothing crazy special about them, but they&#x27;re just toothbrushes. Good value if you&#x27;re looking to save a buck.</li>
    <li> Best Oral-B toothbrush</li>
    <li> I am a cheapskate, look at my reviews I buy stuff on the cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, buying this was an effort, I wanted to not know what I didnt know.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush does the best job I have experienced in a toothbrush to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That either says I use cheapo toothbrushes and this is an easy one for Oral-B, or it is actually great enough for me to bother posting 5 stars on a toothbrush, take your pick!</li>
    <li> I have this toothbrush on subscribe and save.  The bristles are strong and help me to fight plaque build up.  They bristles are strong and the overall design is comfortable to grip.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product and I have to say this as to be the best toothbrush that I have used and for the price there were at made it even better</li>
    <li> I like them a lot , I try too brush 3 times a day so I know they are good.</li>
    <li> This is currently my favorite toothbrush on the market. The bristles are strong, the grip is comfortable. Good value and cleans my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to most other brushes but it works great, really gets your teeth nice and clean.  I also find the bristles to be just about right for me, not too soft and not too rough.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums and most hard brissled (sp?) brushes will make my gums bleed a little. These are very nice and you can tell the difference between the clean that these give and the cheaper brushes. If you&#x27;re like me though, I&#x27;d suggest trying to find the soft version.</li>
    <li> If my wife were to mention one of the \\&quot;quirky\\&quot; things about me, she&#x27;ll say that I always have to try the latest &amp; greatest toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of toothbrushes over the years and unlike some people, I don&#x27;t skimp on them because what you pay is what you get in terms of tooth-brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never tried a toothbrush that costs over $2, I suggest you give them a try. You&#x27;ll be surprised how well it cleans not only the main surface of your teeth, but between them and in areas you can&#x27;t reach with a generic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this particular toothbrush (I got the medium bristle), I&#x27;m able to get a clean feeling all over my teeth. YOu know when you run your tongue over your teeth, you feel that grimy plaque? Not so with this toothbrush. It&#x27;s almost as good as going to the dentist. The multi-angle bristles really do get down in all the cracks &amp; crevices between your teeth. The head \\&quot;flexes\\&quot; a little bit (I assume this is to keep the pressure off your gums) and the grip is great.  Also, I&#x27;m SUPER SUPER glad that this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have a broad base.  This is a HUGE problem for me when putting my toothbrush in the toothbrush holder.  Some toothbrushes (like some Colgates) have a base thicker than a drumstick, so I&#x27;m not able to put the toothbrush in my holder.  Not so with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and to save a bit of cash, clip a coupon on Amazon (if available) and use subscribe &amp; save. I did and the 2-pack only cost me $4.68. :)</li>
    <li> Oral-B has been a leader in toothbrush design for some years, but I was always skeptical about an &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; toothbrush being any more useful than a regular old toothbrush and a little bit of elbow-grease.  Well, I&#x27;m now a believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this brush head is configured in such a way that no matter which way you are brushing, there is always a bristle scrubbing, rubbing, massaging, or penetrating those hard to reach areas in your mouth.  The first time I used this brush, my teeth felt foreign to me afterwards, as if I had just removed braces (but without the slimy feel).  I have fairly nice teeth, but this brush actually does a pretty good job of cleaning your pearly whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is on a flexible float-like pivot.  I assume this allows it to conform to your mouth and reach those hard to reach places, regardless how you have your hand oriented.  Often, at least according to my dentist, people hold on the front bristles against their teeth and fail to really get in-between their teeth with the bristles, where most of the food and gunk resides.  This brush pretty much takes care of that.  I&#x27;m not saying this is the best brush out there - but as far as brushes I&#x27;ve tested, this is now my new favorite until I find one that can do what this one can, plus some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional note - I purchased this pack because it is recommended to change our your toothbrush every 3 months - so with Amazon Subscribe and Save, I have a set of two (two members in house) sent to me every three months.  Great way to ensure you always have a clean toothbrush ready to go and not put something teeming with bacteria in your mouth.</li>
    <li> This new design of brush proves to be more effective in cleaning teeth. Effectiveness means similar strikes achieve better cleanness, or less strikes for thorough cleaning job.</li>
    <li> Good brush for teeth.thanks</li>
    <li> Just as described. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great price, clean teeth, super</li>
    <li> I used to purchase cheaper brushes in bulk but wanted to try out this brush.  I am glad I did as it works very well and is worth the additional cost.</li>
    <li> Pretty standard toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These made me switch back from electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week or two, this brush stays very strong and seem to hold up very well. The wear is rather quick, but they definitely are stronger and more efficient when it comes to cleaning your teeth. They don&#x27;t damage my gums though.</li>
    <li> I only recently started using this toothbrush and have been very impressed with it. The handle is has to be the most comfortable I&#x27;ve experienced on any toothbrush. The toothbrush has an extremely light weight to it, but at the same time, it feels very strong and well made. The bristles also are very comfortable during brushing and it seems to be excellent at cleaning your teeth. Definitely have become a fan of these toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Ordered the wrong item!! I thought I ordered a rechargeable oral B, should have returned it, not happy with it, actually tossed them&lt;br /&gt;M. D. Samkoff, DDS</li>
    <li> Good reach, feels comfortable in the mouth</li>
    <li> The handle is too thin and it becomes slippery and difficult to hold when wet. Also, the gap at the top of the handle accumulates toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This oral b pro health clinical... medium toothbrush has been perfect in terms of bristle strength and durability ( none have been pulled out yet) and lasts long.</li>
    <li> Good but wanted to know what will be the one that has like rubber in the middle of the toothbrush. Hard to find by name</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is rated medium but feels more like hard, which is not always a bad thing as it might last longer but also not good for your gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s really ignoring about this brush from getting another star is some toothpaste would almost always get under the orange hip line that&#x27;s flex&#x27;s the head. And is a pain of wasting water to flush it out to keep this toothbrush clean!</li>
    <li> I only bought these because I needed a new toothbrush.  I spent 30 seconds picking this out and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to review Oral-B toothbrushes....they are excellent from an excellent Amazoner at a reasonable price....what else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Comfortable and does a good job of cleaning my teeth.  In my last couple of trips to the dentist, the hygienist commented on how good my home care was.  I attribute this to these brushes, as well as frequent flossing.</li>
    <li> My husband and I try out new toothbrushes every month, and we both like these a lot.  The bristles are wide enough that they cover all of the tooth all the way to the gum line.  The pointy part is helpful for reaching all the way to the back.</li>
    <li> It is very comfortable to hold and it feels like a very good quality toothbrush. The shape and the grip fits into my hand like a jigsaw puzzle, and I think this is one of the best designed toothbrush I have ever used. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth because this is so fun to use.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brush. To the best of a tough, fairly flexible. Perfectly cleans between teeth. A pleasure to use it. And re-buy for the whole family.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> great brushes. I got a pink and a blue</li>
    <li> legit teethbrushing capabilities</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for about six months now. It may be weird to get excited over a toothbrush, but this may be the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I floss after brushing my teeth and after using this brush I very rarely pull out plaque. It is able to pry plaque and bits of food out of my teeth better than any other brush. Furthermore, I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation with my teeth or my gums since using it. Unless my dentist tells me otherwise, this is going to stay my toothbrush of choice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like any other toothbrush didn&#x27;t notice anything omg about it. Either you buy it or you don&#x27;t i guess.</li>
    <li> These brushes feel great and really get into the hard to reach places</li>
    <li> The pack was opened when i recieved it.I had to throw it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30+ male and have only had one cavity. Toothbrushes and toothpaste are important to me. These are great toothbrushes. I&#x27;m going to order another pack.</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> The flexing feels amazing! Many people complain about the gaps on the toothbrush, but I believe they need to rinse/replace their toothbrush more often. I accidentally ordered medium, so I will be ordering soft bristles next time!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go wrong with Oral B. they&#x27;re colorful bristles full of promises really convinces me that the rubber is somehow making my teeth cleaner. Or is it the fact that I floss, pick,  and brush for 3-4 minutes ( 10 minutes in real time, why does time slow down when we brush?) nonetheless, you got me Oral B, I love the psychological effect of your advertising . Seriously, it&#x27;s a decent toothbrush, pricey but it will last.</li>
    <li> Good Toothbrush... Gets to places other toothbrushes can&#x27;t. This is a pretty good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I must say, these are the worst-designed toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used.  As others have stated, the gaps in the flexible head parts are ideal spots for unused toothpaste and gunk to accumulate.  For a hygiene product, this is rather unhygienic.  To make matters worse, the side bristles are so far separated from the center strip that it creates rather uncomfortable high-pressure areas.  The first few times I used the brush, my gums were sore and bled, not from lack of prior hygiene, but from being shredded by the stiff bristles.  After a month or so of use, the bristles softened enough that I now get a decent clean mouth without injuring myself, but I still have to spend an extra 1-2 minutes cleaning the brush after each use.  Oral-B Pro-Health is a great brand, but I really think they missed the mark with these Pro-Flex brushes.</li>
    <li> great product at a great economical price</li>
    <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes. They leave my mouth feeling so fresh and are the right firmness. Dentists recommend soft bristles but they never leave my mouth feeling clean enough so I prefer the medium. Amazon has the best price on these particular brushes.</li>
    <li> More than meets expectations</li>
    <li> Hard to wash the toothpaste out of the crevices on the brush head.</li>
    <li> Good but if it had a tounge scrubber it would get 5 stars</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome! My gums felt stimulated, clean, and my mouth felt fresh. In addition my teeth even looked whiter. The rubber tips massaged my gums and seemed to make them look healthier. I received this product free to provide my review. These opinions are mine only.</li>
    <li> toothpaste keeps getting stuck in the crevice of these brushes, I waste a lot of time cleaning the outside of the brush after using</li>
    <li> I did see a lot of good review when I made this purchase. Obviously the best review is from when you use it and try it out yourself. The brush felt very solid and strong. I could use it is different positions and felt that it was cleaning better that my previous brush. It is important to select the medium bristles as it allows you to put enough pressure when you brush without hurting the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth giving it a try as it only costs slightly more that what you would normally spend for other brushes.</li>
    <li> Instead of the bristles being mounted directly into the handle, these are mounted into a flexible base that mounts to the handle. I have been using Oral-B products since a dentist recommended them to me, some twenty years ago. This one is, by far, the best one yet for cleaning ability and comfort. I have not seen this type in local stores yet, Amazon scores again ;)</li>
    <li> Hard to believe it works this well. Looked like it could be a gimmick but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Excellent product quality, fast delivery, and accurate product description. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and recommend buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush, and I will buy again. I am glad to get something that I feel gets my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> OMG it works! It just took of all yellowness from my teeth in just one strike! I have one of my incisors on upper jaw dug in. So, the canine adjacent to it remain yellow when I use regular tooth brushes. I am a heavy coffee drinker and have my teeth partially stained yet they look pearly white except for those two teeth - sunk in incisor and canine. My smile looked so tainted. It used to be so embarrassing. I tried different whitening solutions like five-minute bleach, Colgate optic-white whitening mouthwashes, toothpastes like crest whitening, even oral-B&#x27;s electric brush. When everything failed, I slumped back to using the cheapest toothpaste (99 cents per tube) I could find, so at least I&#x27;d stop wasting money on expensive whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;Then I thought I&#x27;d try Oral-B-Pro-Health clinical, only cuz, it was so cheap on amazon. And like I said, it worked in just one strike. I didn&#x27;t even use any whitening tooth paste. Just that cheap tooth paste worked very well with brush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has kept my grin deep cleaning fresh for over 3 months.</li>
    <li> I bought these two times already and I really like them. I am a freak about changing my toothbrushes so I wanted something I can purchase online so I don&#x27;t have to go to the store to purchase. I am considering on putting these on subscribe and save for once a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been switching the type of toothbrush we&#x27;ve used in our house every 3 months.  Either it&#x27;s too soft, too firm or too narrow.  This one is just right.  It doesn&#x27;t have a tongue cleaner (which I&#x27;ve never liked much, anyway.  The toothbrush head ALWAYS works better).  It&#x27;s not complicated and loaded with a bunch of fancy pants options (like said tongue cleaner or pulsing or whatever).  But it works great.  It gives a comparable clean to my Oral-B Electric Toothbrush</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  Each side of the head is on a free moving rubberized piece which acts sort of like independent suspensions for each side of the brush.  The result is a nice even clean as it moves around your teeth, and adjusts to the shape.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this product.  It does the job.  The price was okay.  I don&#x27;t have a major gripe just that I&#x27;ve use better brushes and worse one.  These will do until I find one I like better.</li>
    <li> we didn&#x27;t like was way too hard.</li>
    <li> they work very well, and so far have lasted pretty well. they dont wear out as fast, and it feels like is cleans large areas at a time</li>
    <li> Good toothbrushes, will buy again. Really not a lot you can say about a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrushes.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this toothbrush.  I bought one for myself and my son.  My dentist always gives us every six months a Oral B toothbrush, but, the length of the brush is shorter and the bristles aren&#x27;t different lengths.  It might be my imagination, but, I feel it gets my back teeth better.  I will buy it again in another 6 months.  I will ask my dentist what he thinks of it and get his pro and cons.  If he thinks it&#x27;s a waste of money then I&#x27;ll just keep useing the free toothbrush he gives me (if he is really convincing)!!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
    <li> The tooth brush do a excellent job getting your teeth brushed.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes I ever had.</li>
    <li> These are truly high quality toothbrushes. They come in his and hers colors. The best part is that they&#x27;re easy on the wallet.</li>
    <li> Perfect combination of firm/soft.  Been using it for a few weeks and holding up well. There&#x27;s an odd air gap between the bristles and handle of the brush that gives a bit of cushion when applying pressure.  I was concerned this might bet difficult to clean over time but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.  Always like to keep spares around for any &amp;#34;1 night guests&amp;#34; that stay over and this is a perfect solution to have laying around.</li>
    <li> Its okay I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush at a great price!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> the quality is high, and wont hurt your teeth while using it. I think it is better than other toothbrush which are more expensive.</li>
    <li> The best tooth brush I have ever used, and it will keep your tooth cleaned completed. Definitely would recommend it!</li>
    <li> great brush even though I have not used it before but will soon. However, I have used a similar brush from the same brand before and it was pretty good.</li>
    <li> If you get these be sure you don&#x27;t brush as hard as with soft brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent technology and great for people who need plaque removal due to diet, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH GENTLY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You go gorilla, don&#x27;t be surprised if you remove your enamel.</li>
    <li> It is a little unconfortable</li>
    <li> These are fancier than Colgate toothbrushes or the beige colored Bob Barker ones with the hard bristles that&#x27;s really thin and made out of plastic so you can&#x27;t shank someone with. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> nice brushes, like the amazon ease. #clean teeth</li>
    <li> A little firm for my teeth and I will try another products next time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always buy a new tooth brush. but the change in the brush was nice, it&#x27;s a different thickness and stuff too, but i like it. feels cleansing.</li>
    <li> I like the flex of the toothbrush head and so dose my husband.  It was nice to get a 2 pack because we just changed our toothbrushes at the same time and we&#x27;ll remember to do it together.</li>
    <li> this item is just what i wanted when i was ordering it. I got to me on time and works great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Cleans teeth as advertised.</li>
    <li> I really like this two pack. Great value, and they seem to do a great job cleaning my teeth. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel noticeably cleaner from switching to this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s bad for your gums in the long run, I&#x27;m not sure but my teether feel much cleaner than my electric toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Very good tootbrushes</li>
    <li> the brushes are little bit hard</li>
    <li> They are comfortable on my teeth</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re toothbrushes and they work. I&#x27;ve used other manual toothbrushes that I prefer but they get the job done well.</li>
    <li> Lasts for more than a  month on twice daily use..</li>
    <li> No tongue scrapey on back.</li>
    <li> Excellent tooothbrushes. They shave all around the teeth and below to the gums and work great. The brittles are able to reach part that other toothbrushes are not!</li>
    <li> These brushes for your teeth, colloquially referred to as &#x27;toothbrushes&#x27;, are mainly used to keep your mouth from being a dump hole. Pair it with toothpaste for a special surprise.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrushes. These are the best. Ideal brush their teeth. Well thought design. Perfect price. Easy to clean hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> I am pretty picky about toothbrushes. I don&#x27;t like the bristles too soft or if they fray. These are tough and do the trick.</li>
    <li> The Oral B Tooth brush does all that it says it does. Great Idea. I will continue to purchase it in the future</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush ever made!</li>
    <li> Bristles are too hard and they don&#x27;t move, as advertised. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It seems like an old fashioned toothbrush.</li>
    <li> what can I say? its a toothbrush... but this one works great for me.. not to hard and not too soft and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it in a good amount of time but the packaging was open. I think it might be thin packaging that caused it to open because the brushes look unused but I can&#x27;t be sure someone didn&#x27;t open it and tamper with it.</li>
    <li> This gives your mouth a very nice clean feeling. I feel like I get a much cleaner mouth in the same amount of time as other tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I regret is getting the medium version. I don&#x27;t have sensitive gums and after brushing 3-times in one day I found my gums to be extremely tender. I suggest you go with the soft bristle version of this brush.</li>
    <li> I loved the edgy design. The head has three different shock absorbers to regulate pressure while your brushing your teeth like a mad man. The design is visually pleasing! You will have the coolest (non-Battery) toothbrush with this choice.</li>
    <li> great item. will buy more</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was okay, not going to lie I was definitely expecting more from it. I think it definitely would be better if it had one of those tongue cleaners on the back and I just didn&#x27;t feel like the &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34; part of it did anything. Like I said in my title if you&#x27;re not too picky about your toothbrushes then this one is just fine.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush from Oral B. You can use this toothbrush for relatively long time compared to a normal toothbrush.</li>
    <li> One of the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothbrush.  I love the shape and the flexibility.</li>
    <li> I love the Oral-B brushes.  They really get into hard to reach places.  Very good quality brush.  Would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a Tooth Brush?  It works!</li>
    <li> I like these tooth brushes. Comfortable and effective.</li>
    <li> It was a pack of toothbrushes. Two count. My teeth were brushed. The job was done.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush&amp;#34;s</li>
    <li> I have bought these numerous time, i love them. Mouth health is underestimated. Dont, get a good brush and use it ofter and replace it often.</li>
    <li> did not like the gaps. not very sanitary.</li>
    <li> I have been through 2 electric toothbrushes, and I&#x27;m one of those weird folk that actually prefers non-electric toothbrushes. My husband was happy to inherit my electric toothbrushes (of course with a new head!).&lt;br /&gt;This is great and teeth feel super clean. Not much more to say about a great, effective toothbrush. Mouth feels clean, and although I&#x27;m not sure how much the two bristle &amp;#34;tracks&amp;#34; move up and down, my teeth feel good and probably some what better than a regular toothbrush. For the price, would buy again.</li>
    <li> My two-pack contained a defected toothbrush. One toothbrush had bristles covered in that orange plastic (the same stuff you see on the bottom of the bristles in the picture). I assume it was a manufacturing defect that an inspector missed. At least I noticed before I tried to brush my teeth with it, probably would have broken my crown.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. The handle fits your hand nice the bristles are situated diffrent ways so when you brush they cover more surface area and the head of the brush flexes so you can push a bit to get into the hard to reach places. I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Brushing my teeth for 43 years now and I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all, including electric... this is the best I have used, PERIOD.</li>
    <li> One of the best toothbrushes i have used of ever. I bought 2 pieces first and then i bought more. Will keeep buying this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this just as an interim toothbrush while I continue to shop for a new electric one, and have to say it&#x27;s a nice little manual brush.  It has a funky design and while it&#x27;s a medium brush, it doesn&#x27;t feel too harsh on my gums.  The head has an interesting design to make it more flexible, and it&#x27;s actually smaller than my last toothbrush so it has an easier time accessing harder to reach teeth.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will purchase these again for travel use without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once and already I am happy with it. I was told \\&quot;...20 seconds for each quadrant for good dental care...\\&quot;, so to me it is an effort. I hate brushing my teeth, but it must be done.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, when I saw this toothbrush advertised on t.v., I couldn&#x27;t wait to order it because my local stores did not carry it. (thank God for Amazon) The minute I began brushing, I noticed that I did not need so much effort or the \\&quot;20 second per quadrant count\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush not only assists in removing the &#x27;yuck&#x27;, but the effort in accomplishing the task as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to the lazy brusher AND the dental conservative.&lt;br /&gt;18 JAN 2013&lt;br /&gt;I had to amend my 5 star rating because it occurred to me it is NOT THE PERFECT TOOTHBRUSH! The only thing that would have made it the \\&quot;perfect toothbrush\\&quot; is if it had a tongue scraper on the back of the bristles. IT NEEDS A SCRAPER. Otherwise, I am VERY happy with my new found toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These bristles are very good and flexible. They help to keep the teeth clean with ease.It is one of the best i have used</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush that seems to get right in between the teeth.  The bristles are firm but not too firm that it hurts your gums.  Form fitting handle.  All you want in a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  Makes my whole mouth feel clean.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with these toothbrushes.  I&#x27;m not sure that I could have &amp;#34;gone down a notch&amp;#34; in Oral-B quality and saved myself some money.  $3.00+ for a toothbrush seemed too expensive.  I will keep  both of them and use them.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes--don&#x27;t shed bristles!</li>
    <li> My favorite kind of toothbrush</li>
    <li> You know... gingivitis is the number one cause of all tooth decay!  That&#x27;s why you should do your face a favor and purchase these tooth brushes.  Hands down, the longest lasting I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I hate the new &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrushes; I was overjoyed to find these that seem to do the job so much better for me.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. I prefer a slightly harder brush but these are very gentle on my gums</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe there was a practical difference to one toothbrush over another...until I bought this toothbrush. It&#x27;s as if they didn&#x27;t bother to test it out after designing what they thought was a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; new design. Toothpaste gets stuck under the bristles 100% of the time. The diagonal slant in the shape means you actually have to alter the way you brush, but you&#x27;ll have to try it to understand. But don&#x27;t try it. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I like these having good angles per the shape of teeth. Covers alot of teeth in one go and able to reach area which my original brush wasn,t able to before</li>
    <li> My only gripe with this toothbrush is that when you place it down to put toothpaste on it, it won&#x27;t stay on its back. Kind of annoying to hold the toothbrush while you put toothpaste on, then stick it in your mouth, and then put toothpaste back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they seem to work well.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush, great price.</li>
    <li> Good product fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> i got these for me and my boy since he stays the night whenever he comes over and would have to leave in the morning with me with stank crusty breath. he loves it i love his breath and so they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a f***ing toothbrush.  It cleans your teeth.  Why are you reading toothbrush reviews?  Don&#x27;t you have something better to do with your time?</li>
    <li> Brushes teeth. Exceedingly better than the wooden sticks my ancestors used.</li>
    <li> Good purchase.  Fast ship.</li>
