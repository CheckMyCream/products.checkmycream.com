      <li>They exfoliate your skin and leave it feeling smooth!</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to use lotion</li>
      <li>I love these gloves to help exfoliate.</li>
      <li>Perfectly fine and good, but nothing special.</li>
      <li>These are great just basic scrub gloves for the shower - nothing special or exceptionally remarkable about them, but then again they price reflects this.</li>
      <li>I always use these as a good body exfoliant, very needed tool for my beauty regimen!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term quality, but so far they&#x27;re great.</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t used to scrubs or loofas go easy on your skin.</li>
      <li>color is more of a light coral than pink, but otherwise these are great.  </li>
      <li>Because I am a cheap bitty, I bought these on a whim.</li>
      <li>These are cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>I bought these because I wanted to keep my skin smooth throughout the winter and reduce bumps on my arms and legs from ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>These are a bit scrubbier than the ones I&#x27;d gotten at a local box store, and I think they&#x27;re great.</li>
      <li>Elbows, knees, and arms are bump free.</li>
      <li>These gloves came in a sealed package (so I know they are new/clean), and easily fit my hands</li>
      <li>I like a rougher fabric to exfoliate my face &amp; body, so I ordered 4 different brands of gloves hoping to find one that would do a great job at exfoliating my skin.</li>
      <li>Use a good moisturizer after bathing and your skin will be so soft.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed it very much so when I got these</li>
      <li>they are amazing and arrived super fast.</li>
      <li>This one is worth the extra 3 bucks, plus its great for cleaning your face and body well.</li>
      <li>i feel nice and soft after!</li>
      <li>I love how much texture they have</li>
      <li>I have also used multiple types of body scrubs and &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; lotions and body washes without good results.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re good enough because I didn&#x27;t feel like going to the store to by scrubby gloves.</li>
      <li>These are great for exfoliating and removing dead skin.  </li>
      <li>,just right.</li>
      <li>They clean deeply and leave your skin fresh and smooth after use.</li>
      <li>Can be used for the face too if you do it very gently.</li>
      <li>I love having multiple \\&quot;scrubby</li>
      <li>These gloves look exactly as shown in the picture and the package came intact without damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I even use them on my face (gently!)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many body gloves, they are an essential in my shower</li>
      <li>so the first days you use them, they squeeze your wrists.</li>
      <li>The hanger is why I purchased these because they dry better that way.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them consistently for several weeks and my skin is notably smooth.</li>
      <li>they are NOT the good quality scrub gloves that I have purchased from a real Body Shop store in the past.  </li>
      <li>These certainly do the job.</li>
      <li>Great product, slightly expensive, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Swissco was the only brand that did a great job and really reduced the red bumps on the back of my arms (Keratosis Pilaris).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
      <li>They are very texturized.</li>
      <li>Pairing these gloves with some moisturizing body wash make my skin incredibly smooth, especially after shaving.</li>
      <li>I felt it&#x27;s very helpful when i take bath.</li>
      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t really regenerate like it should</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not, they just don&#x27;t require as much effort.</li>
      <li>They work very well with my body scrub.</li>
      <li>Really like these.</li>
      <li>I no longer use my pouf because these gloves make me feel so much cleaner and gives me smoother skin.</li>
      <li>but, to be honest you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday..</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not stellar, but they&#x27;re not terrible either.</li>
      <li>I used them before using a self-tanner and my skin was so soft and smooth, it hasn&#x27;t felt like that in ten years!</li>
      <li>maybe just 1-2times a week with your regular bar of soap~&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with trying different soaps and alongside with these babies</li>
      <li>They are more firm than most others and keep that firmness for about the duration of a typical bottle of body wash.</li>
      <li>but I exfoliate with cheap Walmart Dishrags, roughly since I have kp and these gloves feel nothing like a wash rag.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these. I no longer use my pouf because these gloves make me feel so much cleaner and gives me smoother skin. And I love exfoliating too. Can be used for the face too if you do it very gently. I mean GENTLY.</li>
    <li> Great product, slightly expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Smooth skin!!! I bought these because I wanted to keep my skin smooth throughout the winter and reduce bumps on my arms and legs from ingrown hairs. These certainly do the job. I&#x27;ve used them consistently for several weeks and my skin is notably smooth. It has never been smoother. Elbows, knees, and arms are bump free. The gloves are easier to use than a loofah/exfoliating towel. I have also used multiple types of body scrubs and &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; lotions and body washes without good results. These are awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these gloves for a few weeks and love the results.  My skin feels very smooth afterward.  Works with a bar of soap or shower gel.</li>
    <li> I was bummed that I had to pay shipping on these, but actually it was totally worth it. I bought 5 pair to give away as little gifts and everyone has reported back how much the love them.  Gentle enough to use on your face but tough enough to stand up to dry winter feet!  Will test out how they hold up in the washing machine, next!</li>
    <li> I like a rougher fabric to exfoliate my face &amp; body, so I ordered 4 different brands of gloves hoping to find one that would do a great job at exfoliating my skin. This was no better than a wash cloth, my skin felt the same after as it did going in. Swissco was the only brand that did a great job and really reduced the red bumps on the back of my arms (Keratosis Pilaris).</li>
    <li> I bought these exfoliating gloves after thinking my current two pairs of gloves were not enough for me. These gloves work well enough, though I was getting two pairs of gloves, and not one. They are rough enough to remove dead skin and are pink, so of course I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them, but you can find a better deal on Amazon for two pairs for WAY less than these gloves!</li>
    <li> I use these to scrub my face and then soap my body. I can wash them on delicate and dry on ex-low. Very good scurb, effective but not harsh/irritating.</li>
    <li> I love these gloves! I bought some at the drug store and they just weren&#x27;t the same quality as these. They exfoliate your skin and leave it feeling smooth!</li>
    <li> These gloves were made, probably by, and for, people with little hands. Probably made by Asians, basing size on their hands. They also developed a hole at the point of where they were stitched, after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I always use these as a good body exfoliant, very needed tool for my beauty regimen! helps slough of kp bumps!</li>
    <li> These are a bit scrubbier than the ones I&#x27;d gotten at a local box store, and I think they&#x27;re great. They really suds up the soap, so a little goes a long way. My skin feels especially smooth.  YAY!</li>
    <li> Great quality and i feel nice and soft after!</li>
    <li> Great gloves. They clean deeply and leave your skin fresh and smooth after use. Just be sure to use lotion</li>
    <li> I love these gloves to help exfoliate. My skin doesn&#x27;t really regenerate like it should so I am constantly needing to exfoliate. These help keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many body gloves, they are an essential in my shower but there are none like the ones for body shop. I&#x27;ve tried cheap ones from Target and Walmart and they don&#x27;t get of dirt and dead skin like these do. I replace then every 3 - 4 months and don&#x27;t mind because they do a great job.</li>
    <li> Love this. I saw some reviews of people saying it was a bit rough, but I do feel like that&#x27;s the point. After using it in the shower my skin was feeling so soft. Really like these.</li>
    <li> These work great. I use them fir when i want a really good body exfoliation with scrub of course. It also works well for pedicures.</li>
    <li> I love bath gloves and these ones are great. The only &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; is that they are very stretch so the first days you use them, they squeeze your wrists. I guess the elastic will last ages!</li>
    <li> Lovely color and perfect size! They work very well with my body scrub. I really love this pair of bath gloves!</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve purchased a cheaper one before and it was so poorly made. This one is worth the extra 3 bucks, plus its great for cleaning your face and body well. Gets all the dirt off, love it!</li>
    <li> These are great for exfoliating and removing dead skin.  Use a good moisturizer after bathing and your skin will be so soft.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as an add-on to some self-tanning products purchased and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Unlike another review, they&#x27;ve held up nicely and the price can&#x27;t be beat. I leave them in the shower and use almost daily. There&#x27;s just enough roughness to exfoliate but not irritate. Yep, these are keepers!</li>
    <li> I love all of The Body Shop products!&lt;br /&gt;I use alot of their things.&lt;br /&gt;These gloves at first touch, I thought they would be horrible in the shower. They felt too soft. Once, however, I got in the shower and used on my face with my facial scrub, it felt rejuvenating!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars, is because I don&#x27;t like how it is a glove style, so you have to put each finger in it&#x27;s separate place. I wish they had these where you just pull on and off hand, would be alot easier.</li>
    <li> Because I am a cheap bitty, I bought these on a whim. They&#x27;re pretty good! I don&#x27;t expect them to last forever, but have been using them rigorously and they do the job well. Want some more.</li>
    <li> Great product, I loved it</li>
    <li> I love shower hands. ...they are amazing and arrived super fast.</li>
    <li> This is not THE BODY SHOP gloves, it is a fake!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for getting dead,flaking skin off.Would recommend.Would buy again if needed.Not rough or too soft,just right.I love the color. Great buy</li>
    <li> These gloves came in a sealed package (so I know they are new/clean), and easily fit my hands (I have long fingers but slender hands). These are great just basic scrub gloves for the shower - nothing special or exceptionally remarkable about them, but then again they price reflects this. Perfectly fine and good, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> They do the job, I like the color, no complaints here. I am happy with my purchase I made on here.</li>
    <li> Just what you see, they are a pretty pink too</li>
    <li> Bought these for use with Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub Coconut Lime.  Works great.  I use them 1-2 times a week and would recommend it.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Best body scrub gloves out there! I love that they have a loop to hang up in the shower. These gloves lather body wash perfectly. Some other gloves I&#x27;ve tried almost repel body wash but these do the trick. Will order these again and again.</li>
    <li> I use these gloves in the shower about 2-3 days a week to help get rid of dead, dried up skin cells and just exfoliate my skin. I figured for $5 it was cheaper than buying another sugar scrub. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they worked! They are more &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; than a regular wash cloth, but not enough to do any damage by actually scratching your skin. Plus, you can&#x27;t go wrong with coral pink!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good enough because I didn&#x27;t feel like going to the store to by scrubby gloves. They are rough, but I like that for a mild exfoliation. They&#x27;re not stellar, but they&#x27;re not terrible either. The only thing is that they&#x27;re probably not worth the price on amazon.</li>
    <li> color is more of a light coral than pink, but otherwise these are great.  very durable (has my last pair for years) and they have loops for hanging</li>
    <li> I love having multiple \\&quot;scrubby gloves\\&quot; so that I can switch them out and wash them regularly.  I especially like the designs with the hook loops on the gloves so I can hang them with little fuss and easy drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had more colors so I can order multiple and my husband and I can differentiate whose is whose. We both like this brand glove better than any other we&#x27;ve bought because it actually scrubs thoroughly, yet is not too stiff/painful. Love it. Make more colors The Body Shop!!</li>
    <li> The gloves I received are NOT from The Body Shop as they claim to be- they are NOT the good quality scrub gloves that I have purchased from a real Body Shop store in the past.  The ones I received did not even have the hook on it to hang them in the shower.  It is deceiving and a MISREPRESENTATION that these are The BODY SHOP BRAND- the tag on them say &amp;#34;Skin Vitamins&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very unhappy and only got a &amp;#34;partial&amp;#34; refund from amazon since I am not going to go to the trouble of returning.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that a quantity of 1 means 1 pair, silly me. I ordered a quantity of 2, so now I have 4 gloves. Oh well! Because I&#x27;ve just received them I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term quality, but so far they&#x27;re great. They are very texturized. They look a bit small at first, but they stretch out no problem. These gloves look exactly as shown in the picture and the package came intact without damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After three uses in the shower, there are already 4 holes in each glove, where the fingers meet the hands. Also, the gloves seemed small at first but I was pleasantly surprised when I put them on for the first time and they stretched right out. However now after three uses they are permanently stretched out, so much that they struggle to stay on my hands when they&#x27;re wet. I love how much texture they have and they do definitely make my skin softer, but I am very disappointed in how quickly they&#x27;ve begun to come apart.</li>
    <li> These are cheaply made.  After 2 uses the loop made to hang the gloves ripped!! The hanger is why I purchased these because they dry better that way.  So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Does wonderful job to loofa skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these but they&#x27;re extremely scratchy. Honestly they hurt to use and I do have sensitive skin but I exfoliate with cheap Walmart Dishrags, roughly since I have kp and these gloves feel nothing like a wash rag. They feel like sandpaper. Ouch. Exfoliation doesn&#x27;t need to hurt to be effective. Much too rough for me.</li>
    <li> Love The Body Shop gloves. I&#x27;ve been using their brand exclusively for years. They are more firm than most others and keep that firmness for about the duration of a typical bottle of body wash. If you aren&#x27;t used to scrubs or loofas go easy on your skin. My husband uses them now too.</li>
    <li> and I love it !! I used it everyday~ but, to be honest you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday.. maybe just 1-2times a week with your regular bar of soap~&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with trying different soaps and alongside with these babies it was the best experience of my life. Thank-you soo much for these amazing gloves and never stop making these gloves ever... !~EVERRR!! thank-you to all the people in the world that helped manufacture these gloves; human and robots~ thankyou!! &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I had never tried exfoliating gloves before I ordered these but I couldn&#x27;t wait for delivery so I got one from the Dollar Tree. I enjoyed it very much so when I got these and they were very stiff and rough, I was a bit worried they&#x27;d be too harsh. They&#x27;re not, they just don&#x27;t require as much effort. I used them before using a self-tanner and my skin was so soft and smooth, it hasn&#x27;t felt like that in ten years! I even use them on my face (gently!) and it feels great! I&#x27;ll keep using them both, these when I use self-tanner or scrub my face and the softer Dollar Tree one for in-between. My daughter loves them, too!</li>
    <li> I bought this pair of gloves when I was in Hong kong. I felt it&#x27;s very helpful when i take bath.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and work great! Pairing these gloves with some moisturizing body wash make my skin incredibly smooth, especially after shaving. I highly recommend these!</li>
