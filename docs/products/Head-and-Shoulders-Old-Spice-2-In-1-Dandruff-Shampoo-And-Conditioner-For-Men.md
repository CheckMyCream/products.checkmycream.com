<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s not specified on Amazon or on the actual bottle, but it is the same scent as Old Spice&#x27;s &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; scented shower gel, which I personally use. It&#x27;s great not having to layer on 2-3 different scents. Above that, Head &amp; Shoulders has always been a great shampoo for my hair, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands.</li>
    <li> I suppose this is my mistake, but I did not realize the &amp;#34;old spice&amp;#34; name wasn&#x27;t just branding. The smell is not too strong, but is noticeable and not my personal taste.</li>
    <li> I had seen the commercials for this product.  Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo with Old Spice scent.  The product arrived in perfect condition, with an extra interior plastic wrap to minimize the risk of leaking during shipping.  Great product, perfect shipping.</li>
    <li> Great value. Smell is OK. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best product to fight dandruff. If you&#x27;re hair is susceptible to dandruff like me, you know how annoying and embarrassing it can be to see tiny snowflakes resting on your shoulders. Thankfully, Head &amp; Shoulders usually do a nice job of getting rid of dandruff. So far this lineup has been my favorite. Not only does this bottle pack a 2-in-1 shampoo+conditioner combo, it will last you several good weeks. I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair.</li>
    <li> smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last long....</li>
    <li> When you are a player in the game, you can&#x27;t have flakes.  Ever.  It is never acceptable to have flakes.  So if you have flakes, step your game up and get rid of them by using H &amp; S.  And if you are a man, smell like a GD man while you&#x27;re doing it. Old Spice keeps is real.</li>
    <li> Smells great, working well so far!</li>
    <li> love it, only use this product ever since</li>
    <li> Best way to clean up your head and shoulders etc. in the shower for men</li>
    <li> Old Spice or not, Head &amp; Shoulders is an epic brand for haircare. This is the only one that removes dandruff from my hair 99 percent of the time. Use this ALL THE TIME to see the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long term customer of the H&amp;S old spice for men shampoo. But my latest experience with the product had since turned 180 degree. The best feature of the shampoo, lots and lost of bubbles, they are gone. Has the manufacturer changed recipe? What&#x27;s more, I used to consume 1 pump per shower but now I have to use 2-3 pumps to achieve the same cleaning effect, causing me to spend more money eventually. This is overall a disappointment experience I have to say. I hope someone will see this and do something before customers lose faith in the product and switch to other brands.</li>
    <li> smells good works great</li>
    <li> It  has a very strong Old Spice smell.</li>
    <li> So glad I can order this item via subscription.  Head &amp; Shoulders works and smells great.  My husband never smelled better.</li>
    <li> Chick&#x27;s dig me when I use this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the smell, would recommend!</li>
    <li> It showed up with some built up pressure that resulted in some of the shampoo forcing itself out of the base of the pump, other than that it has been fine.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Head and Shoulders is the only shampoo that legitimately feels like it cleans my hair. It seems to also be quite harsh on your hair and scalp to compensate though. It seems to really dry my hair out and I use a very small amount, mind you. As a result I use this shampoo once a week and use an all natural shampoo (Everyone 3in1 soap, sold here on Amazon, which also works great as a face wash) for the rest of the week. The downside to the natural shampoo is it simply doesn&#x27;t clean well enough and if it&#x27;s all you use then your hair begins to gradually get greasy. So this shampoo works perfectly with the other shampoo to balance and keep my hair clean without drying my scalp out.</li>
    <li> I always liked the idea of Old Spice&#x27;s scents being used as a shampoo. So when I heard that Head&amp;Shoulders were creating something using the Old Spice brand I immediately jumped on the wagon. Gives you a fresh, gentleman-like scent.</li>
    <li> Works like regular Head &amp; Shoulders and smells good. Good for dry hair!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, cleared up my flakes in about two weeks.  Used it on my beard too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m glad this shampoo came in a bag, as the bag was a mess, small issue though for this wonderful shampoo. I mean what else do you expect when you buy shampoo via mail? This shampoo leaves me dandruff free, with shiny and silky hair, and smells pretty good too from what I gather. I don&#x27;t know how long the smell stays there, but it smells good in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great value! Have ordered it a few times now for my boyfriend. Will def order more!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, even better scent! Does anyone know what kind of old spice scent is it (there are a lot of varieties)?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell and it&#x27;s making my hair a little stiff.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have 2 preteen boys who fight me tooth &amp; nail about hygiene. Since changing to this for them I no longer have to argue with them. They like they can use just 1 product instead of two &amp; like the smell. I love the smell &amp; that they are both now clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this product. It smells just wonderful when you&#x27;re showering with it. The smell also persists even after you&#x27;re out of the shower and all, which is great. I don&#x27;t go around asking people to sniff my hair, of course, but I can smell it on my own a while after I&#x27;m out of the shower and all :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its dandruff-fighting effectiveness, it seems to be getting the job done, too. You have to be consistent with using it, at least in my case, for it to be effective. It&#x27;s a large bottle at a great price, will certainly last you a while.</li>
    <li> I have suffered flaking and a severe dry scalp requiring daily hair washing just to try to keep it under contol. If I went more than a day and a half with other shampoos my scalp and face would begin to break out or scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Head &amp; Shoulders I no longer have these problems of dandruff, scaling and flaking and the Old Spice fragrance is pleasant without being too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is so effective I am able if I should choose to, to go two days between shampooing with no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other 2 and 1 shampoos this is the best out of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for dry scalp and dandruff.</li>
    <li> Very nice and cool on the scalp. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> It works, but use too often and it&#x27;ll frizz the hell outta your hair</li>
    <li> BIG bottle of the good stuff - nice shampoo for guys - leaves hair soft and smelling nice. Won&#x27;t need another one for at least 6 months to a year! Definitely saves the dough when compared to the smaller bottles.</li>
    <li> The Pompeii-like ash no longer rains from my scalp.</li>
    <li> My teenage sons love this shampoo. It works great and leaves a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I used to use Old Spice Pure Sport body wash, but ended up having to give it up due to sensitive skin.  Now I can at least get a little bit of that smell back (though not nearly as potent as the body wash) when shampooing my hair.</li>
    <li> I have always used head and shoulders... not so much for dandruff but because I like the clean feeling it gives my hair  The light fragrance is not overbearing and never enters the room before I do.</li>
    <li> In my husband&#x27;s words, &#x27;no more flakies&#x27;, so in this case... Happy husband &#x3D; Happy life.  Smile.  Smells great too. Love Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save shipments, super  convenient! Buy with confidence. Hope this is helpful!</li>
    <li> I firmly believe a lot of shampoos cause dandruff.  We keep this on hand at all times.  Leaves your hair and scalp clean - no more dandruff drippings in my house.</li>
    <li> great shampoo - don&#x27;t want to do without</li>
    <li> Cheap and does the job.  Smells decent too.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  It does help to control my slight dandruff problem, however I find it a little hard to rinse out completely so that&#x27;s the reason of 4/5 stars.  It seems to want to stay behind on your hair/skin and takes some work to get it rinsed thoroughly.  It&#x27;s probably the conditioner aspect of the 2in 1, but other than that, I really like this combination, especially the huge pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I love head and shoulders, and this is the best one with such an awesome smell. Leaves hair feeling clean, smelling great, and H&amp;S is the only shampoo that helps me keep the dandruff away. Recommend this shampoo. Has plenty of shampoo for one person.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance in a great shampoo. Now everything I use to clean up matches - shower gel, shampoo, deodorant, aftershave, and Cologne.</li>
    <li> Combine the great scent of Old Spice with the fantastic effectiveness of Head n shoulders.  A winning product. Definitely my main choice now when it comes to shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great size, value, and scent. Also the pump is easy to use with just one hand (which is nice because I broke my finger and have a cast haha).</li>
    <li> Dont Buy if you never used conditioner and shampoo togather..... i purchased only bcoz of old spice perfumed shampoo. but i have to say bcoz it has conditioner togather with shampoo you have to wash your hair twice in order to complete clean..... i will not purchase this item in future. I love head and shoulder shampoo only products and i will keep buying it... but this one is BIG NO.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is exactly what i want !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i had use dandruff shampoo from rite aid, it was suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but this one is soooo great!!</li>
    <li> P&amp;G and Old-Spice charge way too much premium for the brand. It is a decent product, but the wax built-up seems to be slightly higher in recently purchased.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell, flake free hair when used, and a lot of shampoo in the bottle. I don&#x27;t have terrible dandruff only light, so I cannot tell you if this will work for you if you have heavy dandruff.</li>
    <li> Solid product. Works best for my hair. Head and Shoulders user for life. Tried other products, and none came close to what Head and Shoulders did.</li>
    <li> The odor is just a bit strong but used to it now.  It is a large size and will last a good while.</li>
    <li> Yep, this is definitely what I was looking for.  A large size with a pump dispenser and a good smell that leaves my hair smelling fresh and clean.  Definitely would buy again!</li>
    <li> Good scent for good price.  Was on sale and has a good Old Spice scent.  Would buy again if a good deal</li>
    <li> My man 46yrs old. Love this  and my son who 11yrs old. Start using it. He love it too!,,wowwww&lt;br /&gt;U should try.</li>
    <li> Love the way this shampoo / conditioner smells. Gets the job done for sure!</li>
    <li> There is nothing to be awe with wonder with this shampoo and there is also no reason to dislike it. It works as it should...While taking bath, our hair needs some shampoo for cleaning and it serves that purpose. Average quality. Size is big so it will serve for a relatively long time.</li>
    <li> Great product, first time I&#x27;ve used anything from Head &amp; Shoulders.  The medication in the shampoo not only got rid of my dandruff but also cleared up how generally unhealthy my scalp had apparently been.  Plus the classic Old Spice scent is hard to hate.</li>
    <li> Only place I can find the pump bottle head and shoulders old spice for men</li>
    <li> Since I use Old Spice after shave, I love the fact that the shampoo has the same fragrance and works just as well as any other Head &amp; Shoulders products.  Great Idea!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for as long as it&#x27;s been on the &amp;#34;Market&amp;#34;. I will continue to use this product and can recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> The soap part works great. My only issue is with the bottle, which is functional but very large. I knew that was what I was getting into, however, and I really like the pump. Sadly, due to the size it&#x27;s hard to transport this without closing the pump, and let me tell you... closing the pump is not easy and results in soap spraying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend actually removing the lid, closing the pump while disconnected, and then putting the lid back on. That is, if you&#x27;re transporting it. I suppose not many people are actually going to relocate themselves with their shampoo.</li>
    <li> Its old spice. What else to say. Love the smell!</li>
    <li> This is a great product with a nice smell that is not too overpowering. The 2 in 1 is perfect.  Enjoy using this!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair so brittle n dry, its like I lit it on fire. Horrible</li>
    <li> I live in a household of all boys. The love the scent and I love that it&#x27;s a 2n1 so it cuts down on shower time and it&#x27;s easier to make sure they are conditioning their hair because, hell, they are dudes.. they don&#x27;t have time to condition.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for without the price of a sams membership --- highly recommended --- will buy more when I run out</li>
    <li> So I tried many other shampoos for dandruff. and also multiple conditioners. and then I met this guy. and I realized he has the best of all other individuals in one package!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Smell is great but doesn&#x27;t smell as strong or linger as long as the original scents of Head &amp; Shoulders. One major benefit is that the scent seems natural, the original Head &amp; Shoulders scent leaves a strong chemical smelling odor in the bathroom after showering.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby and he only uses Head and Shoulders.</li>
    <li> Never Disappointed by Head &amp; Shoulders and the Old Spice smell is nice.</li>
    <li> This is probably my new favorite shampoo. Works great, smells great, and makes me feel great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders for decades and really like Old Spice after shave, so I was looking forward to this new scented shampoo.  Unfortunately, it has the same problem reviewers have noted of other new H&amp;S formulations.  It leaves your hair feeling very sticky, like you had shampooed with sludge!  To make matters worse, Amazon does not permit this shampoo to be returned, which wasn&#x27;t made clear up front.  So now I am stuck with a huge bottle of shampoo I don&#x27;t want.  More trash for a landfill...</li>
    <li> I have used head an shoulders for a while now. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this scent and I can honestly say I have no intention in buying any other kind or brands. Works great. Smells great. Makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> My husband started having problems with dandruff. So he switched to head and shoulders and the problem is gone. He likes a lot of the different scents. The old spice is one of his favorites. He also likes the pump bottles.</li>
    <li> Cheaper then local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo is awesome is you have a dandruff problem, and now it comes in an Old Spice scent!  What a bargain.  The value is great for such a large bottle of shampoo.  If you&#x27;ve short hair this will last months.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very  convenient squeeze with this bottle</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the smell. I also don&#x27;t see any decrease in dandruff.</li>
    <li> BTW it smells AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give the feel of that regular original head and shoulder. Not as strong</li>
    <li> Great smell and refreshing to use.</li>
    <li> Personally, I am not too picky on my shampoos.  I want one that will clean my hair and also provide a nice fragrance that will last throughout the day.  It&#x27;s also a big plus when my shampoo functions as conditioner, talk about a time-saver!  I have probably over 5 minutes cumulatively just by using this shampoo/conditioner combo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I noticed that my scalp started producing dandruff the first name that came to mind was Head and Shoulders.  I also am a regular Old Spice consumer and thought that this product would definitely be a surefire success.  I was not disappointed.  It knocked out my dandruff, it smells good, and you cannot beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for all of your cranial hygiene needs</li>
    <li> My son was bemoaning the fact that his small bottle of Old Spice scented Head and Shoulders was gone. Only one local store seemed to carry it, and their price was ridiculous. I wasn&#x27;t too optimistic about finding it online, guessing that it was a limited time promotion. Happily, I found this listing after some searching, and was quite pleased. Good size bottle, good price, and it qualifies for Amazon Prime. We received it two days later (love Prime!) and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next order will be for two bottles, so I can have one too!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  The price/value is very good when a coupon is available.  Smells a LOT nicer than your standard dandruff shampoo.  And I LOVE the dispenser!!!!  SO much easier to use than the standard Head &amp; Shoulders bottles!</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM! exsact same smell as the one I get in a store. This was a great price. All the reviews sayting it was harsh and the smell was bad are way WRONG. this smells like great old spice no chemical smell at all. Works great hair is very soft. No dryness at all. Dknt listed to the bad reviews this is the same great product head and shoulders always is plus a great smell! Same product for years! Will order again ! Buy this !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update**** 6/15/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for almost 8 moths now and keep getting a great price. I have had zero issues with the packaging. No issues with the product. It smells great keeps your scalp happy. Keeps your hair soft. Other  brands make my hair feel like straw when I run out of this. Subscribe and save and Egnor the bad reviews I hate using any other shampoo and conditioner.  Use this and go back to you old soap. You will run back to this. Is 6 starts a option ! ???</li>
    <li> Great price for its quantity.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo for whole family. always keeps flakes away!</li>
    <li> Thank you AMAZON supplier for this great product. I love Old Spice scent and Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1 is the only shampoo that works for me. Can&#x27;t get this at my local stores.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. The bottle has lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;It does it job and great price.</li>
    <li> H+S is better than before with Old Spice, my hair is so great and smell great, good product, it&#x27;s A+</li>
    <li> Smells very nice and goes very well with my men&#x27;s body spray and shaving scent after shave. I love it for washing my hair in the shower and I love the original smell. Just like the deoderant</li>
    <li> Good as usual, does what it is supposed to do however,&lt;br /&gt;This particular bottle design does not lend itself well to be shipped.&lt;br /&gt;The pumphead on mine arrived broken.&lt;br /&gt;I dont use the pump so returinging it wasnt really necessary for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it, the pump on it is an added perk.</li>
    <li> This was such a great buy.  The Old Spice version has a very appealing scent that stays with me but not in an obtrusive or feminine way.  For many years, I just wasn&#x27;t a fan of the original scent.  Works great on dandruff, and smells great.  Not much more to expect!  I liked this so much I subscribed to receive this every three months.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smell good and works great! what more can I say? Its the best at keeping the hair clean and soft</li>
    <li> head and shoulders always works well for my scalp</li>
    <li> Not real fond of the smell, Old Spice brand should be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my sons, and they cannot remember how they liked it.  They used it a while back.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is stinky and very pungent; therefore I can&#x27;t give it a higher rating.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about the push nozzle. I like it because it&#x27;s very easy and convenient. But one push gives out too little shampoo and two pushes gives out way to much.</li>
    <li> Great idea to combine the two!  Now my husband&#x27;s hair not only is flake free, and looks good, but smells good too.</li>
    <li> This version has a strong, aggressive smell — like Abercrombie cologne. Not a classic Old Spice scent by any means. Throwing it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my previous dandruff shampoo, Selsun Blue, dried out my scalp, which obviously did not help the dandruff problem. This shampoo certainly does the job a lot better and doesn&#x27;t smell like menthol. In fact, it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few uses before I saw proper results, but it&#x27;s definitely a step up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fat and lazy, so Amazon kindly brought this to my house. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good price. Works exactly like regular Head &amp; Shoulders, but smells like Old Spice after shave. I&#x27;ve never seen this product in stores - Amazon is the one and only place I can find it. There is literally nothing special about it, it is exactly as advertised: Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner that smells like Old Spice. That&#x27;s it in a nutshell. Performs exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I like Head &amp; Shoulders, and I&#x27;d rather smell like Old Spice than cucumber melon, or whatever else shampoo companies are putting out these days. So this works for me. I buy a bottle every time I need an Amazon &amp;#34;add-on item.&amp;#34; Just as cheap as Walmart, but of course you can&#x27;t really get this at any Walmart I&#x27;ve been to.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo.  I do not have dandruff but I still keep using it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing, not only is a shampoo but has a conditioner as well. It&#x27;s also mixed in with old spice to enhance the fragrance in your hair. Good size for a good price.</li>
    <li> A good product that needs no compliments it is just a good staple in our home. We just love the convenience of receiving it affordably at our home.</li>
    <li> Been using Head and Shoulders for years and something about this Old Spice one really sits well with me!  The wife likes it, so it&#x27;s good for me!</li>
    <li> Bought it to fix dandruff; didn&#x27;t help. However, felt very cool when applied to hair.</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting a good deal on the size with the added pump. So I purchased it. Like the new scent. Great Combination. Washes well and rinses easily. Would purchase again. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo my husband will use. Great dandruff control and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves the 2-in-1</li>
    <li> Good value for the price</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am an Old Spice guy. This has a great scent and cleaning power. I use it after I get out of my pig barn. I leave with the fresh scent of Old Spice and not pig poo.</li>
    <li> My boys like this product</li>
    <li> Love it. The smell is nice and the pump is very useful.</li>
    <li> I love to use old spice deodorant and head and shoulders so I was like why not. It turned out to be surprisingly great. The scent was not only good, but it does the same job as you would expect a regular head and shoulder shampoo would do. The smell of the shampoo is manly so beware of that. I really like this product because it gets the dandruff out of my head and is a very effective product. Definitely try this product out because it does the job that it claims. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my dandruff away like the classic Head and Shoulders with a nice new touch.</li>
    <li> My son like the combo of shampoo/conditioner in one. He has not complained about it, so I assume he likes it.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great price. Really like this larger bottle with pump action. Love this scent for my my husband, great addition for the H&amp;S men&#x27;s line.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, love the new Old Spice scent and the convenient pump-top. Head and shoulders makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just as good as the hair endurance I used to buy but this has a great scent to it.</li>
    <li> smells great, the pump is convenient - no dandruff!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this 2 in 1 shampoo and it works great for his dandruff. It smells amazing and leaves his hair looking and feeling so soft and healthy. I love that it has a convenient pump and that it gives us a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend suffers from dandruff white badly and this is the best product we have found which both smells great and stops dandruff. Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I love this, I have been waiting for years for something like this, My wife loves my nice smelling clean hair.</li>
    <li> I thought I would like this... it smells kinda mediciny... I used it though bc of dandruff.  I would get regular scent if I had to do over.</li>
    <li> great and reasonable price</li>
    <li> We bought many times- men in my family use only this shampoo and are always satisfied with the result.</li>
    <li> great deal smells good</li>
    <li> Toxic but it gets my hair clean!</li>
    <li> Woo love that spicy smell.</li>
    <li> It is great! I love it!</li>
    <li> Feels good great price!</li>
    <li> This stuff works and smell nice for men.</li>
    <li> This is just as good if not better than any of the H&amp;S 2-in-1 Shampoo + Conditioner products I&#x27;ve tried in terms of quality. And the smell is invigorating. Note: if you&#x27;re not a fan of the Old Spice scent, this is not the product for you. The pump and squirt nozzle is a big convenience over the traditional, turn upside down and shake until you accidentally end up with 10 showers worth of shampoo in your palm.</li>
    <li> Happy with this, it works well, it cleans well, it smells good.  It does burn if you get it in your eyes.  More than normal shampoo.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, lathers just right and smells great.</li>
