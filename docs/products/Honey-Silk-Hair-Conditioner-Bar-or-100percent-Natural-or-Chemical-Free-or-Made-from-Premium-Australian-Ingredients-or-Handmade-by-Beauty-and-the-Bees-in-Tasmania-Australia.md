      <li>Seems like a great product but my long hair needs a little more moisture, awesome for traveling though.</li>

      <li>Thanks Beauty and rhe Bees for such great products across the board!</li>
      <li>Rich and smooth.</li>
      <li>Not sure I&#x27;ve quite figured out the best method for applying.</li>
      <li>The product description emphasizes beeswax and honey (&amp;#34;crafted from the precious beeswax and honey&amp;#34;) and &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34;, and it has the feel and smell of beeswax and honey.</li>

      <li>thank you for such a wonderful natural hair product that out</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;the bar got really soft and lost it&#x27;s shape more and more.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend this conditioner to anyone with fine hair!</li>
      <li>I dye my hair so it needs serious conditioning and this product is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I saw this brand and thought why not?</li>
      <li>It might be too soft for hair that is very fine</li>
      <li>I wasnt expecting a bar to be able to condition my wild, dry, frizzy hair, but...........i was pleasantly suprised.</li>
      <li>I liked the solid bar form.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and that its natural.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>The only thing I liked about this product was the tin can it came in.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve changed to a lot of different shampoo and conditioning bars because they are free of all the harsh chemicals (which was the best thing i could have ever done!)</li>
      <li>I also love how simple, compact, and travel friendly this is.  </li>
      <li>I have very straight hair, and this works very well!</li>
      <li>Really like this product, makes my hair feel very soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>It is exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>For the first time in forever, I walked out the door with my hair as-is, after washing my hair last night and using this stuff, no product needed :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yikes, it smells funny and makes my hair sticky.</li>
      <li>It has made my hair bouncy and eliminated most of the frizz, which used to be a very big problem for me.</li>
      <li>I consider more of an occasion deep conditioning treatment.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this conditioner</li>
      <li>This conditioner bar smells great and it works well, but it did not last as long as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time this afternoon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product.  I switched to bar shampoo about a year ago, and even though Beauty and the Bees bar shampoos are not my favorites (I think I like J. Liggets&#x27;s products better?)  I love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner bar is Amazing! I used it yesterday and it made my hair super soft and added shine to it as well!  It also left my hair detangled and easy to comb qnd blow dry.  I&#x27;m ecstatic about this shampoo bar.  I didn&#x27;t need much to feel the effects of its saturation throughout my hair.  I still have most of the bar for many more uses.  Thanks Beauty and rhe Bees for such great products across the board! Don&#x27;t change your formulas for any of your products.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for me. I liked the solid bar form. A lot of the ingredients are natural. It was fun to use and had a great honey smell and beeswax feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I bought it because I was taken in by the hype. The main ingredient is Behenalkonium Chloride, which is a quaternary ammonium salt (quat). It is a chemical, synonym BENZYLDOCOSYLDIMETHYL-CHLORIDE.  Quarternary ammonium salts are a common chemical used in many hair conditioners. Dove Hair Therapy Daily Moisture conditioner also uses Behenalkonium Chloride. According to the Skin Deep website it is not considered to be toxic to humans but potentially toxic to the environment, although related quaternary ammonium compounds are toxic to humans (see Wikipedia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company claims this product is 100% natural.  Does this mean that the BDC is extracted from plants, or that it is made by chemical processing of plant materials?  It&#x27;s still a chemical made in a factory even if is chemically processed from botanical sources.  Some jet fuel is made from plant materials like corn or coconut oil, and by that logic it could be said to be 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The justification for saying that Behenalkonium Chloride is a natural, non-chemical botanical may be that it is found in small amounts in plants. The same thing is true of trans-fats which are found in small amounts in natural animal products,  yet the trans-fats in our foods are chemically produced and a serious health risk.  The presence of a substance in small amounts in natural plants and animals does not mean that the substance is safe, especially when it is chemically produced and in much higher levels. Another example of a substance found naturally in small amounts in food that can be artificially produced in large, unsafe amounts is arsenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whole Foods Premium Body Care Standard does not allow Behenalkonium Chloride in products, although it does allow some gentler quats like guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride (WFM-Premium-Unacceptable-List-Dec5-2013_0.pdf).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to make a good hair conditioner without using a chemical quat because of their unique cationic properties. This quat is not the most unsafe, but it is also apparently not the gentlest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not the most gentle quat, it seems relatively harmless compared to its relative, benzalkonium chloride, which is often used in conditioners as well. However it seems to me to be somewhat deceptive to advertise the product as &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34; if it contains an ingredient that is chemically produced, even if present in very small amounts in some plants, artificially produced and not something humans have been using for thousands of years like olive oil or beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fooled. The product description emphasizes beeswax and honey (&amp;#34;crafted from the precious beeswax and honey&amp;#34;) and &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34;, and it has the feel and smell of beeswax and honey. But those are minor ingredients, number 7 in the list. The main two ingredients are the same sort of artificially produced chemicals found in most hair conditioners. I give it four stars because I enjoyed using it and it worked very well, it uses a safer chemical quat than many other conditioners, and doesn&#x27;t have an artificial preservative. However I only bought it be because I was fooled by the hype and did not yet know about the chemicals used in conditioners. I won&#x27;t be buying it again because I am looking for a truly 100% botanical conditioner that at least meets Whole Foods&#x27; premium body care standard, but for most people it is a far safer product than most other commercial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a truly 100% natural conditioner.).

    <li> Seems like a great product but my long hair needs a little more moisture, awesome for traveling though.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural hair conditioner which was very hard to find! Well what I found in this bar was that it left my hair soft no frizz,  moisturized my prone to dry hair without dulling and weighing it down. I love the convenience of the bar it lasts so much longer than those big bottles of cheap low quality conditioners I am a buyer for life thank you for such a wonderful natural hair product that out does its own description. Worth every penny this was exactly what I was looking for very pleased with the results. I don&#x27;t have to waste money looking and trying so many products like I have in the past now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the other conditioning bar and the sample shampoo pack which I&#x27;m looking forward to trying. :) bonus points having these when traveling no heavy bottles no spills during transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing I want to add is I think this is also a great option for men as well as women. It&#x27;s been good to my scalp harsh winters or extreme heat its such a light smell and leaves almost no smell once hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and am very pleased with the results. Leaves my hair soft and moisturizer for at least 3 days at a time. Love the smell and that its natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. I have very thin hair thats about mid back. I normally don&#x27;t use a lot of conditioner bc my hair being thin oily naturally. I was worried I would look like a grease ball after all the reviews I read, that only a little was needed...def not the case for me. I lather this puppy up and still doesn&#x27;t coat my hair. I keep it in the shower to loosen from the hot water...nothting. Very disappointed, I wanted to love this and get rid of plastic bottle for good. I will try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is the best conditioner I have EVER experienced.  It is exactly as described.  I have very long, medium coarse hair.  It made my hair silky and I could run a comb through it in the shower, which is really unusual, as usually my hair is very tangled.  I love the scent and it lingers for a few days.  I used very little, just lathered in my hands and applied, so I think the bar will last quite awhile.  I am really impressed with this great product.  I also received a note from Beauty and the Bees and I really appreciate their follow up.  You can tell it is a company with real integrity, which is rather rare these days. Give it a try.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> LOVED this product.  It also helped with static problems that many organic conditioners don&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I wasnt expecting a bar to be able to condition my wild, dry, frizzy hair, but...........i was pleasantly suprised. my hair is so unmanageable that i have to condition and comb my hair out before i rinse the conditioner out. with honey silk hair conditioner, I was able to comb through my hair with my fingers-no problem. awesome. thanks</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have hair to the middle of my back, and I live in a dry place, so keeping my hair happy is tough. This stuff last forever and keeps your hair healthy and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I know the price could be a but outrageous, but I have to say I&#x27;ve spent far more on bottled conditioners that didn&#x27;t deliver as well as this does.  I ONLY use this on the ends of the back of my hair, unless I&#x27;m going for a ponytail then I will massage my scalp also.  It smells good, its so creamy and makes my hair feel like silk!!  Just a little to heavy for my scalp but like I said its nice to use all over for scalp moisture when you don&#x27;t plan on wearing your hair down.  Hair is soft, bouncy and manageable.. my brittle ends are doing really well and I haven&#x27;t had much breakage, if any,  since using this product.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t set off my allergies.  My hair is silky soft.  Nice to not use chemicals!!</li>
    <li> Yikes, it smells funny and makes my hair sticky. Dislike.</li>
    <li> Until I found this product, I almost gave up on the natural shampoo bar.  I have long curly fine hair but a lot of it. The shampoo bar alone gave me crazy Rozanna Rozanna Danna hair !!!! Remember her from SNL??? I tried apple cider vinegar but that dried my hair due to the acidic nature of it. Plus, I pretty much need to wash my hair daily. Not due to extreme oiliness, but because I can&#x27;t just brush out the &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; because my hair goes frizzy.  This conditioner bar is amazing and saved the day!!  I&#x27;m 45 and wanted something more natural for my hair because you lose the natural oils as you get older.  Using a very little amount after my shampoo bar allowed me to get a wide toothed comb through my wet hair which I could not do with the shampoo bar alone.  My ringlets came back, much like when I was in my twenties!!  I would highly recommend this for anyone, especially those who think a natural shampoo bar is not for them.  I also love how simple, compact, and travel friendly this is.  The bar seems small, but it will go a long way. Just make sure it stays dry in the shower or it will melt!!  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Maybe I did it wrong?  I have long thick hair that was so tangly after I used this I wasn&#x27;t even able to get a comb thru. Felt very unconditioned.  I have been using a Sebastian conditioner that left my hair tangle free.  I&#x27;m going to give this bar a few more tries because it&#x27;s possible I didn&#x27;t use enough?  It felt like I used quite a bit though and I was worried abo it using too much as it is supposed to be concentrated.</li>
    <li> Not sure I&#x27;ve quite figured out the best method for applying. This stuff is great but it&#x27;s easy to get too much, or not enough, in your hair. I want to love it because it&#x27;s biodegradable and works well, but it&#x27;s a bit unpredictable when it comes to greasiness on fine blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have been using the bar for a month now and I have really long hair.  I still have a lot of the bar left too.  I bet I can go, at the least, one more month using it.  It conditions my hair very well too.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this product along with the honey, chamomile bar shampoo and my hair is wonderful now. Goodbye bottle shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. It barely conditions my hair at all, and is awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, my hair is long, thick, and curly, but can&#x27;t handle as much conditioner as many people with curly hair (it&#x27;s fine and gets weighed down easily). Might work for someone who doesn&#x27;t need much moisture, perhaps with very thin and fine hair.</li>
    <li> Did not lather or rinse well....would not recommend for the price.  Left a residue.</li>
    <li> Rich and smooth. Makes your hair feel soft, and very managable.</li>
    <li> Great product but since using Beauty and the Bees Voodoo bar, I really don&#x27;t need to use it. I consider more of an occasion deep conditioning treatment. It also is great on troublesome rough dry spots on your skin. Rub a little on and rinse.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about 2 weeks. It is a little small, so I&#x27;ve been rubbing it in my hands first and then applying it to the ends of my hair. It has made my hair bouncy and eliminated most of the frizz, which used to be a very big problem for me. For the first time in forever, I walked out the door with my hair as-is, after washing my hair last night and using this stuff, no product needed :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a little wishy-washy on this product.  I LOVE the smell, and the way it made my hair feel.  More silky than it had in years.  However, after a few uses, the bar got pretty squishy and pale colored, and just didn&#x27;t smell or feel as good on my hair.  And, I&#x27;m going through it VERY quickly.  I bet I won&#x27;t get 20 uses out of it, which makes it quite pricey.  However, I think the fault may be partly mine, as I leave it in the shower between washes.  Perhaps I&#x27;m using it wrong (too much, shouldn&#x27;t leave it in the shower).  I&#x27;ve contacted the company to see if they have any suggestions, because I&#x27;d love to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I used it for the first time this afternoon. You need to use a tiny amount of it, which leads me to believe that it will last a few months. I have very long, thick curly hair and it worked for me. The only thing I feel needs to be pointed out is that you need to use something for detangling your hair after using this, so I mixed a bit of apple cider vinegar with water and bicarbonate of soda, and washed my hair with it .It really worked. It smells very nice. Just make sure your hair is soaking wet when you apply this, or you won&#x27;t be able to rub it in properly.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This little bar of magic is awesome!  I just rub it in my hands 2 or 3 times when they are wet, and that tiny bit conditions all my hair, it is amazing!  I work it in to the ends of my hair first, to spread it around.  My hair is shiny, smooth, and more manageable.  Regular shampoos and conditioners dry out my hair and scalp and leave my hair slightly static when it dries. I have very straight hair, and this works very well!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was looking for all natural ingredients, no-plastic packaging and easy to travel with (great for carry on luggage). This conditioner is all that plus it makes my hair really soft and smooth and easy to comb without being heavy at all. I dye my hair so it needs serious conditioning and this product is wonderful. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Gobs in your hair.  NOT for fine hair.  Thick, dry hair...yes.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and they seemed to like it and the product was received on time!!😊</li>
    <li> Really like this product, makes my hair feel very soft and easy to manage. I still have more than half left and will consider ordering again.</li>
    <li> i was curious to see how this would work. I&#x27;ve changed to a lot of different shampoo and conditioning bars because they are free of all the harsh chemicals (which was the best thing i could have ever done!) and seriously TOTALLY changed how my hair felt ....this conditioner bar Literally made my hair feel like silk! so excited love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I stopped using shampoo and conditioners for environmental and health reasons, because I was not happy with the results that I was getting from them. I decided to try this Moroccan Mudd Shampoo bar with the Honey Silk Conditioner Bar to see if there will be any difference on my hair. This is the best hair healthy/eco-friendly conditioner I have tried so far. The results are amazing!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about trying a solid conditioner; my hair is fried from monthly highlights and damaging well water so normally, I use a deep conditioner or mask every time I wash my hair. After just one time using this conditioner bar, my hair is as soft as it was when I was a kid! I seriously can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair. I didn&#x27;t notice any scent, but I don&#x27;t mind, just the way it makes my hair feel has me sold. The price tag is hefty, yes, but it&#x27;s like putting my hair through a time machine so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I was ready to give up on Shampoo and Conditioner Bars. I travel a lot so I really wanted them to work. My hair is very thick, but very dry and damaged from hair dyes. I didn&#x27;t want to look greasy or too dry as other bars made my hair. Luckily, I saw this brand and thought why not? This truly conditioned my hair without weighing it down. It is the best conditioner I have tried, bottles or bars. I will be repurchasing this conditioner as long as they sell it. Thank you for making such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have medium-coarse thick hair and was hoping this would soften my short strands but found it didn&#x27;t make a difference.  It is definitely not worth the price for hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave negative reviews, but I was so unhappy with this conditioner.  I have purchased a shampoo bar from Beauty and the Bees and it&#x27;s great, but this conditioner is not wonderful for my hair, especially for the outrageous price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner, like other reviewers have mentioned, weighs your hair down.  It&#x27;s very thick and hard to wash through your hair.  The bar also doesn&#x27;t last as long.  The only thing I liked about this product was the tin can it came in.  I was very disappointed with my purchase and I don&#x27;t feel like it was just not well for my hair type.  The product did not seem like a good product for any hair type.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it daily with this company&#x27;s shampoo bars for a few weeks &amp; no longer have to use additional styling products. I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and have shoulder-length hair that is greying, getting more fine &amp; more wavy as I&#x27;m aging. Now my hair looks shiny &amp; healthy. Humidity still causes my hair to curl, but the frizziness is gone &amp; curls are more defined. Also, these products take up much less space in a travel bag than bottles of hair products.</li>
    <li> I was wary of this, because I have very fine hair (a lot of it, but still) and conditioners tend to weigh it down.  I am also have fragrance allergies and not smelling something before I buy it can result in disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am really happy with this conditioner so far.  I shampoo with Liggett&#x27;s old fashioned bar shampoo, which does not strip natural oils, but can make my hair very flyaway, and in humid weather I get unmanageable frizzies.  So far, I have heeded the warnings in the other reviews here, and used the conditioner VERY sparingly.  I towel dry my hair (with an Aquis towel, a great invention) and then just stroke the conditioner bar on the bottom ends of my wet hair, with a tiny bit on my bangs, and then brush it through all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eVoila!  I now have what I call &amp;#34;French&amp;#34; hair - you know the type - Jackie Bissette, Sophie Marceau, Laetitia Casta.  Their hair behaves and swings in one movement.  I absolutely recommend this conditioner to anyone with fine hair!</li>
    <li> I cant really rate it because I bought it as a gift for my daughter. It is a VERY small bar I hope she loves it!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very soft. The scent is light and earthy and i love it. I have long thick hair and it didnt take much to work it in.</li>
    <li> We love this conditioner. A little goes a long way and it makes my daughters&#x27; hair incredibly soft. I have a 2 year old with baby hair still and a 7 year old with much thicker hair. Works great for both of them. A little pricey, but well worth the money for us.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky and manageable. I have color treated hair and it&#x27;s usually oily, but this product doesn&#x27;t harm the color or leave it limp or lifeless. I will certainly reorder this one.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this conditioner. A little bit goes a LONG way. I have very thick hair that goes about halfway down my back, and I only rub the bar in my hands once or twice and put it in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting any in there but I notice the difference when my hair dries. I also put it in about half my hair at the ends because putting any near my roots makes my hair feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Very nice complement to natural shampoo bars.  Small but lasts a long time.  No more chemically created conditioners for me.</li>
    <li> Small. Really small but seems to work on my hair well enough.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
    <li> I have used many conditioners. I recently decided that I would like to remove silicone and sulfate from my hair care routine. I used some conditioners without silicone but they did not give me the desired result I was looking for. The first time I used this conditioner I knew I had hit the jackpot. I was able to COMB THROUGH my WET hair! I have NEVER found a conditioner without silicone that allows me to do that. For reference I have naturally blonde and straight hair. It is long enough to reach past my shoulder blades (to the bottoms of them) and can tangle very easily. My hair literally looks and feels like silk thanks to this conditioning bar. I will never use another conditioner again. Thank you Beauty and the Bees!</li>
    <li> This product takes longer to use than your average liquid hair conditioner. However, in my humble opinion this is an excellent all natural hair conditioner, leaves my hair feeling silky soft after I blow dry. For whatever reason, if I do not blow dry, I do not get the same silky feeling. It also does not have a perfumed after scent. The scent is barely noticeable. If you have long hair and wash daily, I have found this small round bar does not last long, maybe a month. For reference my hair is 24&amp;#34; long.&lt;br /&gt;(Just a few inches above my waist.) I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewer have stated, this container and product is very tiny.  It does seem like it will last for awhile because you only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> I have extremely frizzy hair and this product really works it made my hair soft and manageable!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner bar smells great and it works well, but it did not last as long as I thought it would. After a couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;the bar got really soft and lost it&#x27;s shape more and more. It&#x27;s been about 3 1/2 weeks now that I&#x27;ve been using it and it&lt;br /&gt;has become quite flat and almost completely used up. It&#x27;s also expensive. I will not buy it again. I have used other conditioner&lt;br /&gt;bars that were more inexpensive, lasted for months, and worked almost as well. I say almost because the Honey Silk bar does condition really well. It&#x27;s just more than I want to spend given how long it lasts. Plus the other bars keep their shape, which makes them easier to use on my hair.</li>
    <li> perfectly soft and no fly aways or fuzzy</li>
    <li> I bought this for an upcoming backpacking trip where I am trying to conserve space and weight...gave this a test run over the weekend and  it works! Helps untangle, hair is soft and conditioned. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this on all my trips and maybe even at home sometimes.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. My hair is so soft and manageable. I&#x27;ve never had a conditioner that I liked this much! I have medium texture hair. It might be too soft for hair that is very fine but otherwise I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product and all I can say is it is amazing. Best hair care item I&#x27;ve ever purchased. After switching to shampoo bars my hair has been wanting something more... And this is it. It leaves my hair smooth and tangle free. Even if it&#x27;s a little pricey it&#x27;s totally worth it. Will buy again and try more beauty and the bees products. They seem quality made and good customer service.</li>
    <li> Actually, they sent a different product.  I didn&#x27;t realize until after I stuck my finger in it, so I don&#x27;t think I can return it.  I received a wax instead.  It&#x27;s great for a wax! I probably won&#x27;t use it though.  I wanted the conditioner for soft hair, not waxy.  Boo.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am a cosmetologist for 20 plus years. I have fine, thin hair that I color so I was very skeptical about this conditioner being &amp;#34;too heavy&amp;#34;. Ladies, I highly recommend this conditioner! I have spent thousands of dollars on salon products that really just strip your hair or weigh it down. My hair looks and feels better than ever!! I have more volume, it is soft, shiny, very manageable hair. I should also mention that I use a hair dryer, flat iron and curling iron to style my hair. I also use J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as most of the bar soaps have left my hair waxy feeling (granted they were shampoo bars), but this left my hair soft and silky. I wish the bar was bigger though as I have long hair and it is going fast.</li>
