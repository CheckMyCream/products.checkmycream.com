<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product. My second bottle! Light, soaks right in. Mixes well with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Perfectly wrapped and of high quality!  Very safisfied!</li>
    <li> 1st time purchase. Arrived quickly and this product is awesome.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My boyfriend and I use this for massages and for lubricant. Works great for both. For sec, it doesn&#x27;t become sticky. For massage, it absorbs perfectly.</li>
    <li> I use it with my Doterra oils.  Much more reasonably priced that the Doterra coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great to mix with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil! It worked well with my roller bottles of essential oils.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed/ordered &amp; received it on time. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for herbs and fabulous for diaper rash. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Works very well with, or without, scented essential oils.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent as a carrier oil for essential oils. I also use this as a good lotion for my sons eczema in the winter.  There are tons of uses for coconut oils.  And having some fractionated in the bedroom is never a bad options either! Works great! I&#x27;d buy this again</li>
    <li> Good size. Great price. It&#x27;s basically the same as other fractionated coconut oils I have used. Feels great on the skin. I use it to dilute essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it works just like I want it to. I use it with my essential oils and I use it for a great way to condition my hair once every two weeks. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am always happy with my purchases from Plant Therapy. This Fractionated Coconut oil is great. As always they ship quickly and the cost is not outrageous.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product. It was everything I expected.  This product was referred to me my another customer who uses it also.</li>
    <li> Very good price.  Lots of uses.  Absolutely no odor so you can use it in anything.  Highly recommend for cutting essential oils.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil and I will probably be ordering it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Very good price.  Great Oil</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> use this oil for making my EO blends and/or moisturizer</li>
    <li> i am experimenting at home with making massage oils.....i was looking for a coconut oil that didn&#x27;t have an over powering fragrance and this is it. this very lightly scented oil is perfect for my needs. blended with a few essential oils or on it&#x27;s own it is lovely to the touch. i am very pleased indeed. thank you.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick and safe.  This is my first experience with this formula but so far I have used it as a carrier oil with satisfactory success.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner. It is just what I needed. It blends well.</li>
    <li> first time buying  like that it has no smell bought to mix with essential oils. was packaged well  came on time will buy again. very happy with product</li>
    <li> Great product - fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Very happy with plant therapy products!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very dry skin and the store-bought moisturizers don&#x27;t seem to provide enough nourishment to my skin. So, I mix these ingredients to make my own shower body mist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1% Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;1% fragrance or essential oil (optional)&lt;br /&gt;8% squalane (Amazon purchase)&lt;br /&gt;90% fractionated coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;These are all non-staining oils so you can combine them how you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix together all the oils, then pour into a 2 oz. spray bottle. Use liberally after bathing or showering. This particular fractionated CO is non-greasy and gets absorbed very quickly. I love it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturizer mixed with vitamin e oil...  So far i like it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> The bottle leaked everywhere on my other stuff, good thing they were all packaged seperately and wrapped well, nothing was damaged. Just be aware that the product may leak when getting it.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and great value!</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Works very well for making your own cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Always prompt, great product.  Mix it with essential oils, use it everyday.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Nice, big bottles! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> product arrived  on time, just what i wanted, will definitely order again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use after his shower. He has used baby oil his whole life so I was trying to get him to use something better for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;We bought it and the was no smell but as soon as it touched skin or fabric it smelled rancid.&lt;br /&gt;Being new to using coconut oil I thought it need some essential oils added so I added a lemongrass  scent hoping it would help.&lt;br /&gt;Now it smells like rancid lemons.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  A great carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this easy to use oil to mix my essential oils in.</li>
    <li> I use it in a body butter that I make and it is fantastic.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a great coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This was my first carrier oil purchase, and I am very pleased.  I will purchase again and I also plan to try some of this seller&#x27;s other carrier oil varieties.</li>
    <li> Great value! Seems to be nice quality &amp; love diluting essential oils with it!</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is excellent with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll wrapped. On time delivery. Quality product</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil. Scentless &amp; absorbs quickly into the skin. I&#x27;m very pleased. Also my package arrived two days earlier than expected- woohoo!! Will certainly order from Plant Therapy again</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Works great with my EO&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well for massage. I would buy again</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful  I mix with yl oils, I do oil pulling with it. It&#x27;s good for your skin and hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much.....</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it to dilute Young Living essential oils. It is odorless and feels great on my skin. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been ordering coconut oil from all the different sources here and so far this is the one that seems to come most often with the safety seal in tact and not leaking. It is worth the few pennies extra to get from here and not have to deal with cleaning all the bottles up when I get it.</li>
    <li> Nice oil, stays slippery for awhile. It does have a very slight smell so it is best mixed with essential oils. I would buy it again though.</li>
    <li> Great, good quality, cost-effective and relatively easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I wanted the best and I believe I have it..love that I can pour or drip it out!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful oil to transport essential oils into the body, the bridge to carry the healing qualities of essential oils to maintain my health and that of my family.</li>
    <li> Fractional Coconut is the way to go!  Normal coconut oil changes with the season or temperature.  This blend is really working for being ready and ready for anytime that you want to use it.</li>
    <li> Item just as described, great packing and great product.</li>
    <li> easily absorbed into skin. no smell. works well with my doTerra oils for mixing blends into my roller ball bottles and spray bottles. no leaking. all pieces fit well.</li>
    <li> Great Coconut oil thank you</li>
    <li> Great for ALL uses!  Carrier oil for essentials and all purpose lube.</li>
    <li> A terrific product to use with your Doterra oils.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you intend to use it in beard oil. Smells pretty bad after the essential oils have evaporated and lingers on your mustache all day smelling sort of rancid. Took me a while to figure out it was this coconut oil making the smell because I had to experiment with leaving out different carrier oils until it stopped (the bad smell is very faint, odorless if you are just smelling the bottle). I also had packaging issues where the top broke during shipping. Giving two stars only because I&#x27;m sure it works well for other uses.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist and very picky about oils, especially coconut oils, I love this one. Its very smooth, clean and fresh. It also mixes well with essential oils for topical administration</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it daily as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  It is perfect.</li>
    <li> Just a few drops distributes essential oils perfectly. Absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  No smell to it at all.  Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> This is perfect. I use it to dilute essential oils.</li>
    <li> great product highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this as a carrier oil !!!</li>
    <li> sure you can use this for aromatherapy, but why not try sex?</li>
    <li> I am using this as a carrier oil and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> mixes very well with my oils</li>
    <li> This oil is nice quality and works well as a carrier or alone as a moisturizer.  I recently got a bit of a sunburn and tried aloe vera and it was sticky and didn&#x27;t do much, so I thought I would see if the coconut oil was helpful.  Very comfortable on sensitive skin and my burn has gone away much more quickly than I would have expected.  You also don&#x27;t need much, so the size/price were really good value.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I mix it with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Very nice high quality oil. My wife uses it in a variety of ways for her personal skin care, as well as aromatherapy. This oil has virtually no scent so it works well as a carrier base. Seller is good, shipping was reasonably fast and we would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great purchase; prompt shipment.</li>
    <li> This oil is light and soaks into the skin well.  Item came fresh and well packaged.  Would recommend this brand and seller!</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the oil as a carrier for my essential oil blends.  It is much easier to work with than virgin, non-fractionated, coconut oil.  It says on the bottle that the container is uv protected.  The price seemed right compared to our natural market.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know it&#x27;s effect on my skin.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping is always a plus ...but the product speaks for itself. OMG what I paid for this compared to what I have paid for the same product (did brand) elsewhere ...is staggering. I will order again when needed!.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is great! I think I will go through it really fast. I should have bought a gallon. :)</li>
    <li> Works great absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Love love love coconut oil. Doesn&#x27;t smell (fractioned so it shouldn&#x27;t) Such a smooth glide for massage and great for adding essential oils</li>
    <li> Good oil for massage.</li>
    <li> Love this carrier oil!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for diluting essential oils!</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for essential oils. Doesn&#x27;t stay greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality FCO that is perfect for use with essential oils.  No smell, it has a perfect consistency.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! Just LOVE this product.. It leaves my skin feeling silky not oily. And ever so touchably soft... I have used lotions so not to have that oily feeling, but; I am quit impressed with this product.. Will be buying more of this product.... I am VERY HAPPY with my purchase..</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  The top could be better, leaks a little, but the oil is great!</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Used as carrier oil for essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> Only had for about 2 months now, but I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier oil for a few essential oils and blends with no issues so far. Will update if things change, but I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> My favorite oil. I use it in lotions, etc. Very light and quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> Works with my oils perfectly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for mixing with essential oils for roller ball blends.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 16 oz and I got the 4oz. I have ordered before and it was correct. I love the oil but I will have to find another one, I have to mail this back and get a refund. When I just wanted the 16oz sent to me and then return the 4oz.</li>
    <li> Great carrier with a non greasy feel!</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous to use with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Good quality, product is as described.</li>
    <li> Love it! Soaks right in and leaves my skin moist all day.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE! WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Great for use with the essential oils I&#x27;m becoming acquainted with</li>
    <li> Very happy with order.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for deluting the essential oils.</li>
    <li> As expected. First received the damaged item (leaking.) The seller offered to send another one right away. Received another as expected. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, definitely we will buy more from you in the near future :)</li>
    <li> Amazingly fast service.  Great product. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this coconut oil!  I use it daily to mix with my essential oils to safely apply topically to my skin.  Its lightweight, fragrance free and so silky.  It goes on nicely and is so nourishing.  It is a great carrier oil for my oils.  I haven&#x27;t had this long but have already used 1/4 of my bottle!  I will definitely be ordering more again :)  Thank you Plant Therapy for making such a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Will order more when I run out, which may not be for a while!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected &amp; on time</li>
    <li> Nice consistency, using for mixing essential oils</li>
    <li> Would give higher, but bottle came damaged. Had to buy a new bottle to house the oil in. :(</li>
    <li> thanks alot.....Perfect!</li>
    <li> Dosen&#x27;t moisturize as well as coconut oil in its natural state, but it&#x27;s great as a face wash.</li>
    <li> Great scentless oil for using as carrier oil for essential oils. Not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well. Not greasy</li>
    <li> the BEST oil carrier.  hands down.  :) I use it to make vials of hand sanitizer by adding Four Thieves (Eden Gardens) or On Guard (DoTerra)--it is also great for swishing in your mouth each day with a drop of peppermint oil.  Especially if you have dry mouth.  :)</li>
    <li> This is good, it goes right into the skin, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great deal, I use to dilute my doTerra Essential oil mixes and many other uses</li>
    <li> perfect for blending with essential oils! thank you</li>
    <li> Not organic and doesn&#x27;t say expeller pressed so keep that in mind. I should have. No odor and works fine with my oils.</li>
    <li> Excellent carrier oil to mix essential oils!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Delivered super fast! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love using this oil on my skin and mixing with my favorite essential oils.  I highly recommend it as a carrier oil!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this oil. It absorbs well and is unscented. It is ideal for essential oils. The value for the price is great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Coconut Oil mainly as an all natural massage oil and it works great for this. A very small amount is all that is needed for a great feeling massage, of course the use of too much oil at once will make the massage very oily/greasy as the oil will not be all absorbed by the skin. It works well on just about any part of the body one would like to use it on from the back to those more gentle areas. Essential oils can be added to this, but if you are using this for a sensual massage of delicate areas then probably the oil itself is fine. And yes it has only the slightest scent (of coconut) which is perfect for its use.&lt;br /&gt;Also this oil can be used (in a very small amount) to be massaged into hair for a silky smooth rejuvenation of dry hair.</li>
    <li> Very good for adding to your therapy oils - no scent at all and does not absorb too quickly. I like it.</li>
    <li> the oil is alright did not smell like coconut though it is kind of pricey would look for other oil would try to find one it smells like coconut</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and was just as described. I used this as a carrier oil for my Young Living Essential Oils. It works great. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is my go to FCO for making my essential oil blends in roller bottles. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff! I use it for all things skin, to clean my face, to moisturize after my shower, for my kids. And this time it came with a pump. I&#x27;m so happy about that!</li>
    <li> I use this oil in combination with another oil as part of my daily facial cleansing regimen.  I also use this as a carrier oil when applying essential oils.  This product gets an A+ across the board.  The bottle has a built-in barrier that protects the oil from light exposure.  The oil is high quality and at such a great value.  I highly recommend this product for year round skin hydration too.</li>
    <li> This amazing oil is a gift to humanity from the God&#x27;s themselves. It&#x27;s great for foreplay and massages and leaves the skin feeling smooth without the residual heaviness left by other oils. This oil is the best on the market. Great for stocking stuffers and wedding presents.</li>
    <li> Coconut (Fractionated) Essential Oil by Plant Therapy is a very good product. I originally purchase Doterra fractionated coconut oil (is also good)but, Plant Therapy costs less and the amount I get is more. I will purchase again in the future.[[ASIN:B00BFZFVW6 Coconut (Fractionated) Carrier Oil. A Base Oil for Aromatherapy, Essential Oil or Massage use.]]</li>
    <li> good quality. I use it with my Essential oil. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily after application</li>
    <li> Bought this to help our dry skin from winter and we are feeling so much better.  This oil doesn&#x27;t soak into your clothes and it makes your skin feel silky soft.  Our daughter had given us some with essential oils and we hadn&#x27;t tried it alone for skin care but we will continue to use it now as it stops the itching and dry flaky skin problems.</li>
    <li> Feels good on the skin</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product and packaging. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping...  Item as described.  This is a great price for fractionated coconut oil.  Virtually no smell.  Great for diluting essential oils.  Great massage oil.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted in a carrier oil! Absorbs quickly, no scent (that I am able to notice), moisturizing and a great value for money.</li>
    <li> This is a clear liquid that has been processed from solid coconut oil. Both are excellent for skin care plain or with several drops of essential oils in a tablespoon of oil. I mix this with Rice Bran Oil (avail at amazon) and essential oils for my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin type. Rub on face, neck, and chest. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> great with lavender essential oil for body lotion</li>
    <li> Very helpful company and went above and beyond in making me happy!</li>
    <li> Love the item however I gave only 3 stars because the bottle was delivered with the clear plastic cap shattered off and the seal underneath it was pierced causing oil to leak out everywhere. When I tried to get a replacement bottle it wasn&#x27;t an option. I could only get a refund after I shipped the item back. But it&#x27;s kind of hard to ship a open bottle of oil since I didn&#x27;t have a cap. So j just cut my losses and put the oil In a different container to store.</li>
    <li> Great for using with my essential oils! Will re-order!!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> A great lotion and carrier oil. I put off buying this for so long and made do with regular CO but not having to worry about grease stains definitely makes this worth while. And a little goes a long way so my bottle is lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> Does not stain my massage sheets.</li>
    <li> So very soothing. Added this with essential oils and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Will reorder again.</li>
    <li> This oil was exactly like other more costly fractionated coconut oil we&#x27;ve purchased; however, this oil cost a fraction of the price and we were able to purchase a much larger size.  Assuming the price and quality remain consistent ... we&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This  oil gives a really nice smooth feeling for back rubs but the bottle design is very flawed because it is too hard to open with oil on your hands. Furthermore, I put it in my gym bag and it opened under the pressure of my shoes and leaked oil all over my gym clothes I had in my bag.</li>
    <li> great product and great value for the money. Pleasant smell. Feels great on skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet but it looks nice and I like plant therapy products.  I am going to make my own roll-ons so I&#x27;m using it for that so I am optimistic for its uses.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to go with my essential oils.  It works great as a carrier or alone.  I love this product</li>
    <li> I use this Fractionated Coconut Oil as the base of all of my essential oil blends! It massages well and then soaks into the skin without leaving it greasy feeling. I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> A+ Coconut oil. I use it to dilute essential oils, and also in my hair in place of argaan oil (I prefer the coco oil)!  And sometimes it&#x27;s simply a moisturizer for my skin!</li>
    <li> Good product. Came very well packaged (almost excessively) and product is exactly as described. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Perfect carrier oil to add essential oils to and use for therapeutic purposes.</li>
    <li> The oil is lovely. I wish the bottle sealed correctly so it didn&#x27;t leak oil everywhere. It leaked during original shipping, it leaked when I flew to Ireland for an essential oil demonstration, and when I moved, the packers placed it in the box on its side, and a lot of it leaked out (I had it sealed in a ziplock just in case, but I&#x27;m disappointed in how much product I lost).  If you&#x27;re just buying it to keep on a shelf, it&#x27;ll be fine. If you&#x27;re traveling, get a different bottle - I wish I had.</li>
    <li> I bought this for massages and it works great. It does not leave a sticky residue like a lot of other oils. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product for mixing with essential oils. I received it in excellent condition. I love my products from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product and the timeliness of the delivery!</li>
    <li> SOOOO EXCELLENT! Thank you for such a GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily in my EO rollerballs. It has a lovely texture and doesn&#x27;t compete with the smells of the oils</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase!  There is a lot more for my money then I can get through other essential oil companies and so far so good with my satisfaction when mixing and using with topical oils.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I was expecting but the bottle came with a crack in it &amp; it leaked in the packing box &amp; now I have to keep something under it or it will make a mess</li>
    <li> great carrier oil love it</li>
    <li> Works great as the base ingredient for a homemade pre-shave oil.</li>
    <li> Light, unscented, uncomplicated. It gets the job done and it gets it done right. Finally!</li>
    <li> Very good product for using as carrier oil for essential oils.  Why require more words when this says it all?</li>
    <li> Great, easy to use product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL!!! I love how my skin absorbs the oil and the fact that it doesnt have a strong overbearing coconut smell. It leaves my hair so shiny. Its perfect for whatever you may want to use the oil for i even added some lavender for a scent for my home its great!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is only oily when applying but absorbs quickly. Perfect for use in my rollers and perfect to dilute some of my stronger (hot) essential oils. A little goes a long ways. Came on time and was packaged well. I&#x27;ll definitely order this again and have been recommending this to my friends who have also ordered already.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect carrier oil for for the abhayanga oil I prepare.  It is fragrance-free so the essential oils I use are the only scent and the coconut oil absorbs nicely.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. I received it very quickly and just love it.</li>
    <li> I received the bottle of oil but have not done anything with it.  It looks fine and I am sure that it will meet any expectations I have.  I am familiar with the oil so am not concerned with your product at all.</li>
    <li> Good light oil. Great for message</li>
    <li> Love this product, I like to use with essential oils. The choice to order several size containers is a nice option.</li>
    <li> Great quality! I am very pleased with this product and will order again for blending with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth texture. No scent whatsoever (as expected). Perfect if you want to add your own fragrance. Also, great merchant to deal with. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> We had never used anything but doterra, but this oil seems to be a great value at the price and of great quality also.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Shipped super fast.  Packed really well: lid taped closed and bottle inside of a ziploc type bag in case of possible leaks.</li>
    <li> Picked it up at PO .  Well packed and great product.</li>
    <li> great product! I got this for my dog&#x27;s sensitive skin, put a couple of Tbls in the oatmeal shampoo, cleared up an itchy rash almost immediately! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used this product to make just about every blend imaginable it smell great and as everyone knows coconut oil cure everything!</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin and doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Which is better than having one that smells bad or weird.</li>
    <li> I love this oil to mix with my essential oils.  Since I am new as an independent product consultant, I wanted to be&lt;br /&gt;sure not to directly mix something on skin that I shouldn&#x27;t, or at least, spread it a bit thinner in the beginning stages&lt;br /&gt;of my learning.  This works well, and isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fifth star:  My only advice is to research making a non-leaky type top.  I always find after pouring it, it&#x27;s leaked down the sides and onto&lt;br /&gt;my counter top.  And I&#x27;m only using less than a tsp. at a time!  I&#x27;ve been a masseuse for 22 years, and have never had this issue with other oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I can easily add a fifth star to my review!</li>
    <li> very good massage oil.....</li>
    <li> Received as described.</li>
    <li> I used this product in a recipe for moisturizing body wash using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap, sweet almond oil and bergamot essential oil. The result has been a luxurious solution to dry skin. I believe this high quality fractionated coconut oil to be a much better alternative than melting the solid type for this application. I would recommend and definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and as described. is was the best deal on amazon and works wonderful. I used this in lotion and also in baby wipes. would recommend</li>
    <li> Fast shipping - love product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is very moisturizing and quick-absorbing! I love it by itself or mixed with other carrier oils!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need to dilute my essential oils.  Great product.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells a little funny, maybe it needs to be mixed with something else. But it clings to the skin a little to well and hard to wash off skin</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my DoTerra oils.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Great product but a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I really liked the price of this oil and it is the perfect carrier for my essential oils.  I also use it for homemade beauty products.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. It&#x27;s better than I expected.  I use non-fractionated coconut oil for cooking and baking as well as for moisturizer.  I love the coconut scent but I was worried about using coconut scent alongside several of my oils. The great thing is that there is no scent to this oil, so you keep the scent of the oils.  It is also great for moisturizer and I&#x27;m planning to use it as a base to make some deoderant and face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend and would absolutely purchase a second time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for diluting doTERRA oils! Unscented, easily absorbed, perfect texture! Will purchase this oil again for use with doTERRA oils</li>
    <li> I use this with my doTerra oils since it&#x27;s such a better value. Great quality oil, would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was a little leary since I hadn&#x27;t used this product before but it is a great carrier oil for massages  and I use it as a filler for my weight loss capsules and I love it.</li>
    <li> Ordered Coconut (Fractionated carrier oil) to use with my Essential Oils. This is the 1st time using this product. So far it works just fine. I pour about a quarter size spot in middle of my hand and then put my Oil of choice usually Clove/Peppermint combination (1 drop each) to use for pain in my hip. I was impressed with the large size and know it will last me a while. I had read up on carrier oils and found this oil has a infinite shelf life. It is also antiseptic and a disinfectant. It is not hypoallergenic though so wise if you test a spot on inside of elbow 1st to see if redness or itching occur. I have not had any reactions. This would be rated a 5 if I had been using this oil longer but since a newbie stayed with a 4 star.</li>
    <li> This oil makes a perfect carrier oil for essential oils.  It soaks into the skin rather quickly and is not greasy/oily.  A little bit goes a long way.  Very happy with this purchase and I will certainly buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> This is what I needed to use in order to dilute some essential oils.  I am very pleased with the quality of this brand and the price was right for our budget.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Excellent price! Thank you! Will definitely order from this company again. I&#x27;ve been using this as a carrier oil for my doTerta oils.</li>
    <li> i use as a carrier oil for all my essentials. awesome product and it lasts a long long time</li>
    <li> I use this product as an after bath all over body moisturizer. I apply this product while I&#x27;m still wet from a shower. This product makes my skin feel supple. I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers and other oils (including, extra virgin coconut oil, etc.) in the past with varying results. For me, fractionated coconut oil when applied after a shower makes me feel comfortable in my own skin for 24+ hours unlike any other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past. My only regret is that the processing of this oil removes the coconut fragrance which I love.</li>
    <li> This oil is light, smooths easy during massage, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. It also is non-irritating to the skin. A VERY good product!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice coconut oil. The oil pours out quickly, so you need to pour carefully into your palm. It is light and blends into the skin quickly. No stickiness. I&#x27;m now using the coconut oil, not only as a body moisturizer, but as a facial moisturizer, a hair conditioner for shine, or warm it as a deep hair conditioning treatment. It takes off makeup beautifully and leaves your skin very clean feeling and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave the product four stars instead of five, was because the cap on the oil arrived cracked. I had to transfer the remaining oil that hadn&#x27;t spilled all over my shower floor into empty bottles I had not recycled yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product, speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchase of fractionated coconut oil. No smell and that makes it perfect if you want to make your own perfume. Great as a moisturizer by itself if you are bothered by perfume add-ons.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Would have given it 5 stars, but the oil comes out of the dispenser a little funky. I wish it was easier to pour--but the product itself is awesome.</li>
    <li> Love using this in roller bottles for all my CPTG essential oils! Definitely recommend this FCO to others.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this oil so far.  It does not have a smell to it which is what I was looking for to mix with my essential oils</li>
    <li> Order came as promised</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a great price. I use fractionated coconut oil as a carrier oil for my essential oils. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am using this to dilute essential oils.  I like the convenience of not having to wait for coconut oil to melt, makes mixing easier.  I love that I can use this to pul blends in to the rollerballs.</li>
    <li> Great fractionated coconut oil for a great price.  I use it to make body butters, sugar scrubs, etc &amp; it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This was just what the doctor ordered for my thirsty skin.  It absorbs quickly, leaves my skin soft and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Use it daily.</li>
    <li> I use this fractionated coconut oil along with my essential oils and it&#x27;s great. Would highly recommend this brand of oil.</li>
    <li> excellent product...excellent service!</li>
    <li> If you like aroma therapy then this is the oil to buy. It is smooth to the touch and the massage. It is a real joy so wonderful to the touch.</li>
    <li> No scent, beautiful slip. Keeps oils fresh. Price is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Very happy.  Great quality!  Clear appearance.  This is the first time I have purchased fractionated coconut oil so I have nothing to compare it to but I am beyond happy.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was wanting for use with my Essential Oils as a carrier oil!!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. Fast processing and shipping!</li>
    <li> Has blended well with my essential oils as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> quick shipment and exactly how described</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great as moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a very good value.  I ordered a couple of items to qualify for free shipping.  The oil doesn&#x27;t expire.</li>
    <li> This FCO is  great stuff. Worth the money. I&#x27;m not a carrier/massage oil expert, but I am very happy with my purchase and will buy it again. Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  This is the second time I have ordered it and will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  It does the job nicely.</li>
    <li> Received this product on date you said it would be delivered.  Very good product and I use it almost every day for something...</li>
    <li> Have used this oil in capsules with my EOS. Easy to take, no upset stomach or &amp;#34;oily burps&amp;#34;. Arrived very well packaged. Will buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I use Coconut oil for myriad things. Mostly for my essential oils. This has been a great carrier oil. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just started using essential oils and this product is a great carrier oil and priced very reasonably.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> As this is the first time I have used a fractionated coconut oil,I have nothing to compare it to, but it seems to serve it&#x27;s purpose very well. I have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product for anyone suing essential oils. This product is fabulous for use with essential oils.  Makes a great base.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for my essentials! Will order again</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, seems to be what it says it is, blends well with essential oils. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I am giving this an excellent rating as it works! I mixed a few tablespoons of Coconut Oil with vinegar for a mixture to repel spiders and it works! I have never tried the natural organic methods for everyday use until now and this worked great. I also use it in a mild filtered water/vinegar with coconut oil rinse for my hair instead of the usual clarifying shampoos and it worked really good. Most clarifying shampoos have some form of sodium laurel in them and I don&#x27;t use hair products with sodium laurel in them anymore. Excellent alternative!</li>
    <li> Love this product. This is the first time I have used fractionated Coconut oil. I just recently started using essential oils so I use this as a carrier oil. I really have nothing to compare this too since I&#x27;ve never used it before, but it is working great for what I need it for. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil that comes in a decent size for the price. There is no smell to it, although coconut scent wouldn&#x27;t be too bad. Although it does pick up scents pretty easy (don&#x27;t use this after you hit the gym before you shower! Eew!). Not sticky at all. When it spilled on the sheets it evaporated a few hours later without a stain. Washing it off is a bit tricky, but after a shower using a dry towel we felt like our skin was silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time on my dry skin.I add a few drops of essential oils in with a teaspoon of oil and put it on different parts of my body.perfect carrier oil and great by itself.</li>
    <li> Great product! Glad to have finally gotten it. Service was awesome too. Alot of product for your money. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It is silky smooth. clients love it. Does not leave an oily residue.  Met all my expectations.  fast shipping</li>
    <li> Is exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great to use as a carrier oil for dottera oil&#x27;s!!!  Also there are many use&#x27;s such as a massage oil and use with lotion for dry hands!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My issue is more with the quality of the packaging than the product itself. The coconut oil itself is excellent, great for blending with essential oils, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and I know this because I bought the 4 oz. size previously. When I attempted to buy the 16 oz bottle, it was delivered to me in a box literally dripping with oil, everything else inside the box was damaged, there was a HUGE grease mark on my porch where the box was delivered, and there was no oil left in the bottle- simply because the lid had cracked horizontally in half. Not at the hinge, mind you, but literally in half across the middle. I could see the lid had been taped and it wasinside a plastic bag that was inside a box that had plenty of air cushions to protect it. That, to me, says cheap packaging. Fortunately, AMZ discounted/refunded the rest of my order, but in the future, I would hesitate to buy this product and definitely would NOT order it with any other items lest the same thing happen again.</li>
    <li> Packaged well, came wrapped in a plastic bag as well as boxed well.  No leaks or issues.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for massage use.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Ofcourse there is no scent...Helloooo !!! It is writen nicely that is carier oil, which means you use it to dilute other fragrant oils.&lt;br /&gt;Excelent product by the way👍</li>
    <li> This is so great. I put it in with my doterra oils and it works great.  Makes inexpensive wonderful gifts when used with rollerballs.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good packaging.. Great product and a good price! Use it as a carrier oil fir essential oils. Will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Had this oil delivered last week and have been using it ever since.  Very nice carrier oil.  Would recommend this product to anyone who likes using essential oils.  Leaves skin feeling wonderful.  Just used it by itself on my skin after shaving my legs.  Nice!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this oil and the bottle.  The bottle is clear but it is photo proof preventing damage from the sun.  It&#x27;s nice because you can see the nice color of the coconut oil without it being damaged by light.  Definitely use this carrier oil more than any other.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered quickly, and was packaged well. I use this for mixing with essential oils. It absorbs quickly and was great value for the money. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love using it by putting essential oils in it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a larger size bottle of Fractionated Coconut Oil (FCO) so I&#x27;m quite pleased with this. Other than that there isn&#x27;t more to say, FCO is FCO is FCO....</li>
    <li> On time, just right. Use to dilute Essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great product I love thanks so much</li>
    <li> This oil is great quality and is perfect for my essential oils! Very silky and it absorbed quickly, left my skin nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil. No reaction. No odor.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to be mix with essential oils to make your own perfume without chemicals or additives. great base oil.</li>
    <li> great product for base of essential oil blends.  Use it on a daily basis.  great price and will buy more soon.</li>
    <li> We use essential oils and this is perfect for creating roller balls of whatever concoction we may need.  It seems to last a lot longer than one would think.  Also great for other uses, too...</li>
    <li> I will continue to purchase this oil for massages and as a carrier oil for essential oils.  It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Product was better than advertised! Great value; great product.  Worth the money.  Mixes well with aroma therapy oils.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells great and user friendly I like to use this one the most for the carrier oil with my essential oils</li>
    <li> Very therapeutic, not to oily, lasts along time, scent is ok! I do prefer cold pressed. This one stays liquid at room temp...Not solid when cool.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This Fractionated Coconut oil is exactly what I was hoping it would be. I use this with my Essential oils as a base oil. It&#x27;s absolutly perfect, love it.</li>
    <li> I Got this coconut oil and it is Very nice !! I use it in my massages, used it to make oil blends !!</li>
    <li> We bought this product to be used with our home remedy essential oils kit. Thus far it has lived up to expectations and we will continue to use Plant Therapy&#x27;s Coconut Oil.</li>
    <li> and I&#x27;ve used a ton of it. and it looks like I haven&#x27;t used any. Lasts a long time, works just great for roller balls with EO&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The Coconut Fractionated Oil is a great way to help you not to use too much of your Essential Oils topically. Love it!</li>
    <li> great buy and what is needed to carry the other oils. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love!  I use to dilute essential oils and clean my dog&#x27;s ears and genitalia.  Shelf life is longer than other oils.</li>
    <li> Excellent, quick service. Great product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Product as described with nice fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s nice good for making roller balls with oils or things like body scrubs but not good for straight application it leaves a oily residue I have a better quality more expensive brand and it absorbs right in to the skin this one takes a little while and is greasy but it&#x27;s great for the price and adding to things.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the quality this product.  I mix it with either lavender or peppermint essential oils and use it as a massage oil.  It shipped fast, as well.</li>
    <li> Thank you!  The bottle did leak a bit in shipment.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND DISPENSES WELL FROM BOTTLE.  NO MESS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this four times. Three for myself and once for my mom.  I use this as my carrier oil for my essential oil blends.  I keep blends on the counter and also carry them with me and so far they are still good.  I recommend this brand of coconut oil to my friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, as good as any we&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love it and the service.</li>
    <li> Thank you! This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Works great for a carrier oil! I use it alot and now I know a great place to get more when I run out!</li>
    <li> excellent for massage or make your skin shine</li>
    <li> Great for mixing with my essential oils. It is also a great lubricant.</li>
    <li> I wish this oil wasn&#x27;t in a plastic bottle. I can feel it seeping through the plastic, that might not make sense to you reading this review-but it does. The bottle gets super greasy, right away. Otherwise this is perfect for mixing my oils. I don&#x27;t have to melt the oil, and I can use this for a variety of different blends.</li>
    <li> Arrived to day. Top was taped on for extra protection.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it with my EO&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> We are just learning about essential oils and their usage.  One of the necessities is carrier oil.  After doing some research and comparing prices, this was the best quality and best value that I could find.  Delivery was very fast and the order went smoothly.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> First time I had ordered fractionated coconut oil to use in DIY preparations. This was the most reasonable price at the time.</li>
    <li> Great product. I first ordered it just for a carrier oil and then once I receiver it I did some more research on more ways to use coconut oil and I am amazed! I recently started using it for oil pulling too. Great oil!</li>
    <li> Same as the DoTerra Coconut oil, just more and lower price. I use this as my carrier oil on all EO mixed.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, smells great, very smooth on the skin not oliy at all.  Does not stain sheets or towels</li>
    <li> I mixed 4 oz of this oil with 10 drops of frankinsence oil, 10 drops of tea tree oil and 10 drops of lavender oil to make \\&quot;owie\\&quot; spray that I learned was great for healing scrapes and cuts because of its antibacterial and anti inflammatory properties. My son has been using this mixture in a spray bottle on his severe acne and has seen a drastic inprovement in the redness and texture of his skin. His skin is less inflamed and much softer after using harsh acne products for many years!</li>
    <li> When the item arrived the Coconut had leaked.</li>
    <li> Great product, works great as a carrier for my essential oils. Product came quickly and is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this fractionated oil. Smells fresh and good, not like some I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Extremely fast delivery.  I use it to mix with my essential oils.  I used it as a base oil for natural bug repellent.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. I will be buying more as needed</li>
    <li> Just as describe. Arrived promptly and intact. First time using for base oil but mixes well.  Will update later after working with it.</li>
    <li> Everything was timely and as advertised... Def would order from this seller again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love coconut oil as carrier for essential oils that I use daily. Absolutely pure, odor free, absorbs promptly with no residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to working with coconut oil that becomes solid; but for some applications, that is not practical. This is a good fractionated coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my uses with essential oils. And a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Use it everyday for lots of things. Have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with any sort of carrier oil so I can&#x27;t compare it to almond or any others. I love this stuff. I make my own foaming hand soap with a bit of Liquid Castile soap, a squirt of this and some EO. This oil really helps to moisturize your hands while still feeling clean. I&#x27;m going to try making my own makeup remover towels with this stuff soon.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of making essentials roll on oil and body spray.  These are just the products I need,</li>
    <li> No problems here. Have used it for my home made make up remover pads, and hair moisturizer (it helps tame the frizzes). Just remember a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I am a satisfied returning customer. This is such a great product that absorbs so much faster than regular Coconut Oil you buy at Sprouts or Trader Joe&#x27;s. I use it as my moisturizer and for massage.</li>
    <li> I use this with essential oils to make fragranced oil and massage oil. Works great. Perfect consistency and no scent to distract from the fragrance oils. Makes a great massage oil.</li>
    <li> Works great as a massage oil and to mix with my essential oils! A little of it goes a long ways, also Shipping was super fast! Overall very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Great for massage, not sticky or greasy. Absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t appear to stain&lt;br /&gt;the sheets at all. Leaves skin feeling supple.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Fragrance free - not greasy - my skin is very happy and you aren&#x27;t spending a fortune on lotions that don&#x27;t nourish your skin lime this does.</li>
    <li> we bought this because we used coconut oil diluted with essential oils for our baby girl and it worked great.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I needed to make a body butter to use on my hospice patients!  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> No odor at all in this oil. It&#x27;s great for my essential oil blending. Very light weight and not oily after absorbed into skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. There is no odor so if you are looking for fragrance, this is not it. The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin and blends nicely with the essential oils. After it is applied there is no greasy feeling. But after receiving it, I decided that I needed one with a pump. It is much easier to use if I can pump it out instead of pouring it out. The pump is less messy.</li>
    <li> essential oils. This is a great product to use with all the variety of essential oils that I have and use. Sometimes I use another carrier oil, but the fractionated coconut oil is perfect.</li>
    <li> We use this as a sexual lubricant/massage lotion.  No smell, no colors, no taste, wont stain clothing or sheets, a shelf life that lasts longer than we can go through 10 bottles in room temp.  Spouse loves it as it softens ruff areas.  Never gets sticky like some lubricants **cough** Astroglide **cough** KY **cough**.  It is a light oil that absorbs into the skin so the need for a shower afterwards (wink wink) isn&#x27;t needed like baby oil.  Also is safe for her in those um, sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will state what everyone else says about oils and condoms -- not safe for use with the two.  Duh.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Exactly what I wanted and arrived in a very timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!! I use it primarily as a carrier oil. It works excellent with essential oils!!!! I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great carrier of fragrance oil to make a wonderful massage oil. I used peppermint and &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; oils.</li>
    <li> I needed this product to use as a base for application of some essential oils and this works great for that.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product.  It will be used in a variety of items.  DIY cleansing face wash, aromatherapy, DIY face serum, also used directly on very dry areas of skin.  Since itis fractionated does not become solid in cooler weather.  Arrived fairly quickly.  will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> I use this fractionated coconut oil with all my other oils.  I put it in a spray bottle and spray it on my face, hair and body because it is so easy to spread on.  My hairdresser says she has never seen my hair look so healthy.  I told her what I was using and she is using it now, too!  Why spend more for a great oil?  It also removed makeup easily, including eye makeup.  This company is fast to deliver and the quality remains the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it with frankincense oil.  Lovely!</li>
    <li> I use this to help disperse essential oils for massage and other treatments.  It is smooth, scent free and taste free.  It arrived well packaged and as expected.  It is of great quality.  Just a small amount goes a very long way.  I also use this, in addition to other items, to create natural health and beauty products.</li>
    <li> I bought this to dilute my essential oils.  It works great and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  The oil arrived packaged with the top taped and in a separate plastic bag to avoid leaking, which it did --no leaks during transport.  The oil doesn&#x27;t have any smell and absorbs in skin very quickly.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this oil on the recommendation of my sister.  It works well with Frankincense and other essential oils as a carrier. The oil comes in a large bottle with easy to use top for dispensing. No fragrance that is noticeable so doesn&#x27;t take away from scent of the essential oil that is used.</li>
    <li> Love this and at such a great price too!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and one of the best oils I have used.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  I received it as a gift over a year ago, and have continued to purchase this exact brand for myself.  I use it on my whole body, right at the end of a shower.  My skin continues to look healthy &amp; radiant, and I frequently receive compliments.  It&#x27;s also good as a face moisturizer (using a very small amount); since coconut oil is naturally anti-fungal, I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s good way to combat and prevent acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this on my dog&#x27;s skin!!  He had an awful irritation on his abdominal &amp; pelvic area that was making him uncomfortable.  The coconut oil helped TREMENDOUSLY as it seems to have calmed the itching, if not also contributing to his skin&#x27;s recovery.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this....works great with my essential oils...great shipping too!!!</li>
    <li> Good price and doesn&#x27;t turn to a solid. Non-irritating to the skin and sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> great coconut oil, great price, feels great on my skin and I like the bottle shape and size. Im glad I got it and when I run out I will probably get more.</li>
    <li> Awesome I used every day for everything even sex</li>
    <li> Love this....skin so soft</li>
    <li> I have purchased this Plant Therapy Coconut Oil before and I love it!  Works well with all my essential oils as the carrier!</li>
    <li> very convenient, and enables me to share with customers at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This liquid coconut oil is great for my home-made body products. I make a body spray with this oil, witch hazel, essential oils, aloe vera and a little baking soda. It&#x27;s great for a quick freshen-up anytime of the day.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I use it for my eczema dry skin. It is helping with my severely dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product as a carrier oil for essential oils.  Great size too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for making blends with essential oils and much more cost effective.  Will continue to order from here!</li>
    <li> Using this as a carrier oil for putting essential oils in rollers. So far it is working great. It absorbs pretty quickly and is not too greasy!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil and a good price compared to other fractionated coconut oils.  Not greasy and works well with the essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Was shipped quickly, feels lovely, like the bottle and cap applicator.  I had to oder this as I had ordered a competitor&#x27;s product which was late in coming.  This was shipped so promptly--competitor&#x27;s came after almost THREE weeks--and this is nicer oil.  This is I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was better than buying it from doTerra.  I use it to make blends and apply single oils.</li>
    <li> I love it! Thank you for the prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> Great base oil ! Love the convenience of this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I use this with my essential oils in roll-on bottles!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product from this company.  I am very happy with the oil. I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils. And I also use it on my skin, and also  as a treatment on my hair.  This product always arrives on time and is packaged very well.</li>
    <li> a good carrier oil is a must for many of your oils. I love that this is light and NOT smelling like coconut as it would kill the aromas of your essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> Works great for massages and diluting essential oils. Good base and good price.</li>
    <li> Will buy again. Great oil</li>
    <li> Perfect oil to go with essential oils. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my aromatouch technique business. I will use no other thank you for supplying such a wonderful product that I can count on to have shipped promptlyas well as being an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Great customer service.  I love the oil too.</li>
    <li> Great product to extend the use of the other oils that I use.  It is a good base to rub ons and also for hair oils.  It goes along ways..</li>
    <li> I use this in my essential oils as a carrier oil. I also use it on my face and whole body. The oil is so nice that it soaks into my skin fast. Makes for very soft skin  it is also a skin lightener I use it on my face for this reason.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have used it for all my mixes, especially for my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash mixture.  I plan to buy a gallon of it to make my own lotion.  It feels light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel super greasy.  Dislike: I wish it had a coconut aroma to it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I just wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Goes well with my DoTerra essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for a base for essential oils. It doesn&#x27;t add any fragrances or anything. The only thing that could make this better is if this bottle were glass.</li>
    <li> This oil is a fractionated and must be treated as such.  Works great for our purposes!</li>
    <li> very nice for a massage. unscented and it isn&#x27;t sticky like some oils. one bottle will last a long time</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Works great for my essential oils</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> It feels great on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily!</li>
    <li> LOVE coconut oil!!! Great quality at a great price!!!!! Flawless service.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for diluting essential oil.</li>
    <li> arrived brand new &amp; unopened!</li>
    <li> Great oil at a great price.  Shopped around to find the best deal.  Oil is not greasy and provides a great base for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Always get high quality products from Plant Therapy. Happy with purchase</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil and works perfectly for me.  I was afraid that it might be greasy, but it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in place of lotion after showers &amp; as a carrier oil for essential oils. Funny side effect: my cat likes it too &amp; he&#x27;ll start licking me when I put it on.  A cat&#x27;s tongue is like sandpaper, so I just dab a little on his paw so he can lick away. Great for him to keep furballs at bay.</li>
    <li> Love it, I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I was completely happy with this Coconut Oil.  It worked great with my diffusing my essential oils that i use for various reasons.  It fully lived up to it&#x27;s performance as a Carrier (Pure) Oil.</li>
    <li> great product for making lip balms and soaps or lotions , I will order more through this company for sure</li>
    <li> I like this oil a lot. It is light and goes on easily. It has been a great carrier oil for my essential oils and it isn&#x27;t too greasy to use on my face (I live in a very dry climate). I think this might be replacing all my other moisturizers this winter. :)</li>
    <li> Speedy service. Great product.</li>
    <li> Prompt, reliable and a great product.</li>
    <li> I use this with my essential oils and put them in glass roller bottles. It works great. It came packaged well and no spillage.</li>
    <li> I use this as a carrier for my essential oils.  Price was determining factor....as it almost always is with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this! Exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
    <li> The best buy that I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> I like it!  LIght...blends well with essential oils!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need for my skin. Especially for my face because it tends to get very oily after washing it, so applying a bit of this coconut oil has toned down the reproduction of its own skin oil.</li>
    <li> This product arrived promptly. I&#x27;ve used it with several essential oils with good results. Love the price!</li>
    <li> Love the product, but when it was leaking in the packaging. There wasn&#x27;t a ton missing - looking at the bottle you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell. The packaging had oil all through it though.</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected on time and in good shape. They even took time to tape the lid shut so the product wouldn&#x27;t accidentally leak out.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased FCO from other much more expensive sites.  This oil works just as well as any other as a FCO I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, and the shipping was fast and no leakage.</li>
    <li> Low Voltage Arrester for ATS&lt;br /&gt;TM-GL-L2FL220V</li>
    <li> Very good deal, just started using Essential oils and this Fractionated Coconut Oil is perfect for mixing!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Will order again!</li>
    <li> I love your coconut oil for my EO mixes and I use it on my dogs food.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well to cut and carry essential oils.</li>
    <li> perfect for massage oils, fast shipping and very affordable</li>
    <li> So far the product is exactly what I was looking for. There was slight leakage in shipping.</li>
    <li> Product is good; service was timely.  What more can I say!</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful.  Its non-greasy and light.  Its the perfect base for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> it was as I expected and arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> Good Product-multiple uses.</li>
    <li> Bought this oil on the recommendation from my friend that has been using Essential Oils.  The coconut oil is very easy to pour out and does not go everywhere or leak. will buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have back issues and give each other regular back rubs.  This is by far the best oil we have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is made from Coconut oil, there is no smell, the oil is not greasy and allows for a long back massage without absorbing into the skin too quickly.  A little goes a long way.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I believe it stands up with other brands in quality! Smells great and it&#x27;s smooth and silky!</li>
    <li> arrived intact, no broken bottles or seals, no leaking.  i plan to use it w some essential oils as a diluent.  havent used it just yet.</li>
    <li> Worked well with my essential oils!</li>
    <li> Love it so much, we just ordered the larger bottle. Not sticky like other oils. Provides great lubrication without the mess. This oil absorbs into the skin after a short while</li>
    <li> Love this coconut oil for diluting my essential oils and making muscle rubs.</li>
    <li> Definitely store bottles upright. I&#x27;ve bought 4 and all 4 leak if stored on their sides</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is everything that I expected.</li>
    <li> I use this as my carrier oil for my essential oils and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and works with oils.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase, not only was it a good deal, it shipped quickly (didn&#x27;t freeze coming up to AK). Also, I love how a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love this coconut oil! I bought it to mix with essential oils to help eliminate spider veins. I have not used it long enough to tell if the veins are better, but I can say I love the oil and the way my skin looks and feels after I put it on. It absorbs great, much better than anything else I have used, they all seem to lay on top of my skin. I am very happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> The product arrived packaged very well, with even some tape above the lid to keep it closed :)&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my face or anything yet, but I do have to say, it&#x27;s very soothing and exactly as described. I put it on the ends of my hair after a shower and always gives that extra silky feel. I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell, cause too much of any scent would give me a headache. Anyway, I will be ordering again when my current bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, meets my needs perfectly, and is a great valued for the merchandise!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled by how quickly the seller shipped my oil! I was also pleased with the way it was packed for shipping, I could tell that care was taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the oil 4 stars instead of 5 because I am used to doTerra FCO. The doTerra FCO is a little heavier yet absorbs quicker than this FCO, and is food safe. It feels like a higher quality oil on my skin. But it is also costs three times more than this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plant Therapy FCO is still non-greasy, odorless, and it still absorbs quicker than other carrier oils (like sweet almond), so I&#x27;m happy to use this product until I reach a year with doTerra and get 30% off of our products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I need to add oil to a capsule so that my EO&#x27;s don&#x27;t upset my stomach I can use olive oil. I recommend this product if you need to save some money on FCO!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t smell like coconut at all?? Terrible smelling. Smells like something my mom use to rub me down with! Greasy too. Nothing good to say about this product.</li>
    <li> quality oil.. i added lavender oil to it so can be used as massage oil.. absorbs wonderfully...</li>
    <li> Use this all the time with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is a great bargain. It is a smooth texture and mixes well with essential oils.  I used it to dilute topical oils in roller bottles.  Works perfect.</li>
    <li> Its amazing. It soaks in fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I love this stuff!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just a great as the other stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent deal! Top product.</li>
    <li> Packaging was good and I love having the pump!</li>
    <li> Great for diluting essential oils for kids.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I&#x27;ve only used it to fill 2 roller bottles but I like it so far.  I priced the DoTerra fractionated coconut oil and it was quite a bit more expensive for less oil.</li>
    <li> I use this as a carrier oil with my essential oils for my little one.  Very nice quality fractionated oil!  I am back to order more!</li>
    <li> Very nice carrier oil to use with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Love having it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected and great to use when I make up my oils to take.  It is also very good for several other applications. I would truly recommend this product to anyone that wants to use Coconut Carrier Oil.</li>
    <li> first time I have ordered it.  Does well as a carrier for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Love the oil. It&#x27;s not too oily. However, it has no smell and the smell is part of the aroma therapy I was looking for.</li>
    <li> mixed this with essential oils and its works amazing!</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my face with at night using the &amp;#34;oil cleansing&amp;#34; method. I mix in with it a few of my favorite essential oils...melaleuca and cedarwood and my face has never felt so good! I also use it when putting essential oils on my daughter for ease of use. This is a great carrier oil and it will last forever because we only use a little at a time.</li>
    <li> Order was received quickly but have not used the product yet so I can not give it 5 stars.  I will be using it to blend and make essential oil products for personal use.  Cant wait!</li>
    <li> This oil has worked wonderfully for my essential oil dilutions. It has NO smell and goes a long way. Will definitely stick with this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> Nice carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Really nice oil. Mix so well with essential oils. No taste, but &amp;#34;tastes&amp;#34; great!</li>
    <li> This is awesome, quality coconut oil, easy to get to and use.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves my skin feeling so soft and refreshed.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and I would recommend this product to anybody!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used organic coconut oil from the health food store to mix with essential oils, but it has a strong coconut odor.  It also has an occasional flake of coconut in it.  This is more appropriate for mixing with the oils, and is a decent price option if some of the more exotic carrier oils are too pricey.</li>
    <li> I use this sometimes to dilute essential oils.  It is fragrance free, so there is no scent to interfere.  I added this oil to some Peppermint essential oil and put it in a roller bottle.  I use a little on my temples and the back of my neck when I am getting a headache and it makes most of them go away without needing anything else!  This oil is light and absorbs quickly.  It makes my skin soft.  I also use it to clean my face at the end of the day.  Cleans better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!  I massage it into the skin on my face for a minute or two and then lay a hot, damp washcloth on my face for about a half a minute.  I wipe off and rinse the wash cloth and lay it on again on the other side.  It&#x27;s great!  If you start doing this, expect your skin to have a few breakouts at first, as it is drawing the impurities out of your skin.  But, use it for 3 or 4 weeks to clean your face daily, and you will see a big improvement in your skin!</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my massage practice. It is a very nice, light oil that can be used on the face. No per fumy scent which I would not mind but many clients may not like.</li>
    <li> I use this oil the most for making aromatherapy blends.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over a year and can honestly say I will stick with it for life!  Non-greasy, no odor, no color, and works magic on my tired, old skin:)  I use it as a body oil AND use it in my hair to calm down frizz and to give a beautiful shine and glow to my hair.  It is a very clean feeling oil and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 3 bottles and each has had the same consistency.</li>
    <li> I just received my oil and have already mixed it with doterra Lavender and Deep Blue essential oils in small roll on bottles to give to my grandkids.  Deep Blue for growing pains for the little one and lavender for the older one who has issues sleeping.  The coconut fractionated carrier oil is the perfect choice.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks fo the quick turn around and quality product.</li>
    <li> Great as a carrier oil.  This came in a sealed bag.  With a bag over the top in case it leaked.</li>
    <li> When they say this has nonscent, it really doesn&#x27;t.  I use this for my scented oils and for personal massages. It works great and theres plenty of oil to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at great price</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil. I switched brands simply because my new brand comes with a pump. This cap caused me to spill and make big messes. While the product is quality, it just wasn&#x27;t convenient.</li>
    <li> Pure, smooth, scentless, this is a fabulous carrier oil and moisturizer, light enough for the face and strong enough for the entire body. Your skin will love it.</li>
    <li> love it works great on dry skin and dry spots it hills them in just a matter of days. soriasis</li>
    <li> Super great product and bang for the buck</li>
    <li> Great product, Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> Good solid product for a decent price.  I used it for making shower soap.  Does a great job</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft. I enjoy mixing product with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly, had before guaranteed shipping date. Love this carrier oil. Works will all my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great carrier for essential oils and Penetrex</li>
    <li> Item received as promised, in a timely manner :)</li>
    <li> Ii do like this for mixing my oils in.  It best that I have used</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of the product as well as the price, packaging and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have been using the organic coconut oils for year, but I have to say this works better on skin for me, I use it to make spray with my essential oils, it absorbed well and Does not stain the sheets just as those reviews said.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this fractionated coconut oil to use in my natural homemade massage oil and body wash recipes. it works as described but I still prefer pure organic unrefined coconut oil. I have extremely dry skin and the pure coconut oil seems to do a better job of moisturizing my skin. Glad I gave this a try though.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Great carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
    <li> This oil is a great odorless fractionated coconut oil. I am very happy with this oil.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use this for alot of my essential oil projects.  It is a good carrier oil and works well for those times you need to have coconut oil in a roller bottle and you need it to stay liquid and not to solidify.</li>
    <li> this has been so perfect for blending with my essential oils. Received order promptly &amp; love the quality, price! THANK YOU for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I use this as a carrier oil w/my essential oils. Works great! has no scent so it&#x27;s perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare this to, but nonetheless I love this oil!  It has worked great in my homemade wood polish and mixed with virgin coconut oil for my homemade lotion.  I decided to buy it in bulk next time.  It was cheaper per ounce by a different company.  If this other company doesn&#x27;t add up, I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as a carrier oil, primarily for oil pulling. It works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve also added some to regular lotion for extra moisturizing (in this polar vortex) and it works great for that as well.</li>
    <li> good carrier oil at a good price</li>
    <li> Love it I deffinatly would recommend</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil and good price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use along with my massage oils.</li>
    <li> Another great carrier oil, so perfect for aromatherapy!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, odorless too!  Works wonders for dry heels/elbows too.</li>
    <li> I love this carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Great price! Using it with my essential oils :)</li>
    <li> Love it! Comes packaged safely and I use this for all my oil blends!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great seller. Highly recommend. Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  Stays pourable and leaves no greasy mess.</li>
    <li> My new go-to carrier oil for essential oils.  I keep a dropper bottle of this in my oils case, and I use it to make roll-ons.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous carrier oil! It absorbs extremely well and will definitely be a product I will be reordering!</li>
    <li> It poured very easily straight from the cap into my roll-on applicators for essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to use in winter when the the solid oil goes solid. Also use at night for a moisturizer on my face. Also use to dilute my Young Living essential oils.</li>
    <li> It absorbs easily into my skin. Zero scent, it&#x27;s not like the coconut oil you cook with.</li>
    <li> Came as described. Non-scented, real oil, absorbs into the skin without leaving residue. I bought this to use as a carrier oil for essential oils and its worked well so far.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, no smell and I used it to dilute with my essential oils</li>
    <li> Excellent!  So many uses.... A really great product!</li>
    <li> Great product for mixing with my essential oils!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected. Good quality oil. I ordered another for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Love this oil for daily skin moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased a few of these bottles in the past several months to use with my essential oils and it has been a great carrier oil!</li>
    <li> I use this fractionated coconut oil as a carrier oil for my homemade essential oil blends.  This is the second bottle I bought and it works great.  The oil is readily absorbed by my body and it doesn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve ordered it about 6 or 7 times now and it is my go to for Fractionated Coconut Oil. I use essential oils every day and I use this to dilute my oils. I also use this as a massage oil and it works fantastic on my husbands sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve purchased other fractionated coconut oil for around the same price but a 1/4 of this bottle size and then I found this and never went back to the other stuff. This is very clean and pure, I treated 3 dogs with dog fight injuries with essential oils diluted with this coconut oil and I was confident they would not have any reactions to this product and I was right.</li>
    <li> I received this super fast. If has been very helpful in using the EO on my kiddos. What a great but. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great for essential oil users for veg caps.  Clear, clean and taste free.</li>
    <li> Great item. High quality. Tiny amount of leakage during delivery, but it was well packaged and sealed in a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> the best for blending my EO concoctions for roller application- also good just on my skin!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Service from seller was great and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved using to blend with my Doterra essential oil.</li>
    <li> The $16 price was an excellent buy</li>
    <li> This is a pure, wonderful product. I use it alone or with my body lotion as we head into dryer weather. Have also used it on my face when I&#x27;ve exfoliated and want a soothing oil/serum to calm my skin. Use it on my feet before I put on my socks and tennis shoes...just a lovely, all purpose product.</li>
    <li> This is a Wonderful product. I will be ordering it again. I would encourage anyone to get this as their carrier oil.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome!  I mixed it with scented oils to make perfumes and medicines.  Wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Nice oil, but lid not liquid tight.  Bottle was on it&#x27;s side (accidentally) and 80% of the oil leaked out.  Lid was on tightly when this happened.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Fractionated Coconut Carrier Oil from Plant Therapy.  It arrived quickly, was well sealed and packaged, and is fresh as it should be.  As with all oils, I only wish it came in glass rather than plastic.  I recognize this may be out of the company&#x27;s control.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of fractioned coconut oil. It does not have a fragrance at all like most FCOs do.</li>
    <li> Great aromatherapy base.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit more runny than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this &amp; now my husband is using it also.  Great oil for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice oil, good price, packaging leaked.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Great shop!!</li>
    <li> For full health benefits (consumption, etc) you&#x27;ll want organic cold-pressed (unrefined) coconut oil, but for dilluting essential oils easily in topical applications, we LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product! Quick shipping</li>
    <li> Best price for the product. Just ordered another bottle!</li>
    <li> Have purchased this before and it is very nice.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the oil, but the cap was broken when I received it but there was no spill because there was a seal that stayed put.</li>
    <li> Great to use with my essential oils.  I have ordered this twice and I really like the product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fractionated oil to use to blend with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for massage, I love it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with quality and price.</li>
    <li> Great product and is working wonderful to dilute my essential oils with. Arrived very quickly from selling and product is exactly as described. :-)</li>
    <li> Good quality oil, I would buy this again.  Coconut oil is shelf stable and odorless, the perfect carrier oil for you essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> Prompt and the product I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil. We used it to massage our daughter since she was a month old.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for as a carrier oil. Product received promptly. Bottle leaked slightly as it was oily upon removing from package.</li>
    <li> Love the coconut oil, thank you.  I use it with my doterra oils as a mix and it is great</li>
    <li> Blends well with my essential oils, doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t detract from the scent of the oils.  Absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
    <li> Packaging was great, no leakage whatsoever.  Using it on m skin for excema and so far so good.  Very soft feeling.</li>
    <li> I like it. However it&#x27;s pricey! !  I will be looking for some with a better price.  You should not require a certain numer of words for a review.</li>
    <li> This stuff is priced at considerably less than what I&#x27;ve received from Nature&#x27;s Gift. I love purchasing Nature&#x27;s Gift aromatherapy oils, but I can save money getting this stuff on Amazon. Even though the coconut oil I cook with seems fine to make small batches of rubs (using various essential oils), this fractionated oil works much better for the bigger batches of massage oils I make.&lt;br /&gt;Part of the beauty of using fractionated coconut oil for a base in massage oils is that there&#x27;s no coconut fragrance. And it has an incredibly long shelf life so it won&#x27;t go rancid. AND, it&#x27;s a light oil that washes out of sheets most easily.&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil and plan on buying more. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great for skin moisturising! HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> This is the best priced fractionated coconut oil I can find on Amazon.  I use it as a carrier oil for essential oils and also as a moisturizer on my face.  I&#x27;ll never use store bought toxic face cream again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil.  It is a little messy to use, but well worth the effort.  At 72 years old this has renewed my skin.  Not everyone will have my results, but give a bottle a try.  Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great product that I use with my essential oils! It has no scent, so you can use it with any EO.</li>
    <li> great for massages.. just add your favorite essential oils for aroma.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product that is comparatively reasonably priced.  How nice to use something that doesn&#x27;t have chemicals and has so many health benefits.  Plant Therapy has great customer support.  I will continue to purchase this and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My children haven&#x27;t had any reaction to its use (they would react to regular coconut oil).  It does take a learning curve using the dispenser without wasting though.</li>
    <li> Good quality with quantity at the same time!</li>
    <li> THIS OIL RULES. Mix with essential oils, or use it plain, use it as moisturizer, or use it as lube. :) This is the BEST lube and also I did some reading that coconut oil is good for the inside of the vagina, helps ph levels stay balanced. feels amazing and all around so wonderful! Also great to use to whiten your teeth through oil pulling.</li>
    <li> Seems to be oily not what was adverised</li>
    <li> Love this FCO! So smooth and non greasy. My EO mix great with it. Ido think there needs to be better packaging. It came in a bag which prevented leakage into the box but some kind of reinforcement for the bottle should be looked at. A great product at a great price and will definitely but again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great Product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. No smell just pure oil</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil to make Christmas gifts with but had it sitting in my bathroom to test on my skin first for sensitivity. My daughter decided to decorate my sons face in our hometown supports colors. . with sharpies. After my initial shock we tried to remove it a couple of different ways, when I remembered the oil and that I had used it to remove my mascara the night before. It took all of the sharpie off of his face!</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 4 stars only because I have only just started to use it. It was a really good value and I received the product on time. I would buy it again from Plant Therapy</li>
    <li> Excellent carrier oil for essential oils</li>
    <li> Great product. So happy to have found this product for a reasonable product.</li>
    <li> Will keeps ordering this.</li>
    <li> Very good and easy to use</li>
    <li> This oil was advertised with the Green air Spa Vapor so I purchased it. It has no odor, which is useless with the vapor machine. I am stuck with a $16 bottle of odorless greasy oil!</li>
    <li> Pure and easy to use - good for the skin and I use with essential oil distribution - works well for this!</li>
    <li> Great base for essential oils.  Non-staining.</li>
    <li> Bought this oil recently.  Forgot how nice coconut oil feels on the skin and makes a great massage oil.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It works great for blending oils. It&#x27;s the perfect size for someone who is just starting and blending in small quantities.</li>
    <li> Being a Licensed Myo-Fascial release therapist, I always need the best for all my clients. This product is one of the best therapy oils out there. I tried the grape extract one, which I got from Amazon, too (forgot the brand) and it left so much residue behind, even after washing my hands several times, Not this product though! This coconut oil is perfect for myo-fascial release applications and massages as well. My clients love it since, coconut oil is naturally good for your skin.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy Coconut Oil as a carrier oil is equally as effective as the doTerra brand for a much more reasonable price!  Also, my order arrived in very timely fashion!  Plant Therapy will definitely be my source for essential oils from now on!</li>
    <li> This is a really good oil, makes your skin feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this in my rollerball recipes and it works great! It has no smell and goes on very nice. It absorbs into the skin perfectly!</li>
    <li> Use it as a self-massage base for vetiver oil and rub it on my feet when neuropathy is bad. Absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several bottles of this. It&#x27;s awesome. I mix it with essential oils to make sprays, rollers, body scrubs and more.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil. Have used in many lip balms and lotions.</li>
    <li> Works great with a drop or two of my Young Living Essential oils!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product</li>
    <li> My wife uses it to make Himalayan salt scrubs. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!!</li>
    <li> Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
    <li> good product - good value</li>
    <li> Works great as a carrier oil. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> use this with other oils as a base.  daughter cooks with it too.</li>
    <li> Good product. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This product has a nice glide and works well for deep swedish massages, blends well with aromatherapy essential oils. Highly recommend. Just wish it came with a pump.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed to dilute my doTERRA essential oils.</li>
    <li> Unlike regular coconut oil it does not require softening. It remains fluid and can be used for almost anything. It doesn&#x27;t become sticky and leaves skin feeling soft for days to come. The absolute best oil I have used. Recomend this oil to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the lid because it will leak, but you can wipe it up without issue.</li>
    <li> This is a great carrier oil for essential oils. I use the doTerra brand oils. This is a little greasier than the doTerra brand Fractionated coconut oil but it works great to dilute for my roller bottles. I have already recommended this product to some of my friends who use essential oils. Great quality for the price. I will be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with some essential oils that I have to use topically and found it to be the best price for the size.  Excellent service from the seller.  Hopefully this review will make it through.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this light, scentless oil. I live in Hawaii and have pretty dry skin. I use this nightly as a moisturizer, sometimes adding other oils like frankincense. It is absorbed very quickly and does exactly what I want in a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> great price!  I love using this with my DoTerra Essential oils!  Makes them spread much more easily without a greasy after feel!</li>
    <li> some awesome memories</li>
    <li> I love getting these big bottles of FCO.  As an essential oil user and educator, I go through a lot of it, and it&#x27;s nice to find it at a good price.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a therapeutic-grade liquid coconut oil. This came highly recommended from my Young Living Essential Oils group. The price was right, and it was exactly what I was looking for. Works well as a carrier oil for my essential oils when needed!</li>
    <li> It goes on light, not greasy at all, and disappears within a minute.  It has no discernible smell, and does not stain the sheets.  I am really pleased with this purchase; it will become a staple in my household!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, and will buy more in the future.  This oil mixes well with my essential oils without adding any scent.</li>
    <li> Love this carrier oil to be used with the essential oils I use!&lt;br /&gt;Goes on greasy but literally evaporates within a minute or so!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before and I can say I have never been disappointed!</li>
    <li> Quality and no real smell to it. Good for at-home massages.</li>
    <li> A great price and it works amazing!</li>
    <li> Great company and great product.  I will use them again and again.  Trustworthy and highly recommended. Thank you. I use this with different essential oils in a bottle roll on.  It is great since it has no odor of it&#x27;s own and is a wonderful oil all by itself.  I also use the organic coconut in a jar for everything.  I do like this and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice and light. Absorbs into the skin not to quickly but not too slowly either. Nice flip cap makes easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I use it for my making thieves oil.</li>
    <li> The quality is very good as best we can tell in a short period of time. The price was very competitive; you sure cannot find this price in the home show parties. The order was processed and arrived much faster than we anticipated.  At present there is no reason to believe we will not be repeat customers.</li>
    <li> Product as expected.  Delivered in a timely fashion!</li>
    <li> This brand of oil is very consistent.  It is very clear, odorless, and an excellent carrier oil.  Compared to many other options, THIS size/brand I have found to be more affordable than every other option I have yet seen and always available.  It&#x27;s perfect.  as far as I am concerned, it stays on my wish list for re-order indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Good fractionated coconut oil! I use is to mix with my oils and it leaves a oil stain if I spray it too close to my pillows, other than that it works great!</li>
    <li> This is great for use with essential oils and other uses but the review from which I went off of that said it was a great lubricant for sexual activity is wrong.  It was ok at best and should be used for other purposes.</li>
    <li> Great price and the perfect carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping...exactly what I needed. Love this coconut oil</li>
    <li> Really nice, odorless carrier oil for my YL essential oil.  I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> works great in my natural and organic products</li>
    <li> Great product, will order again!</li>
    <li> Thank you. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as noted. Using in rollerball bottles to dilute essential oils. Remains in liquid form. Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> This oil gave us small red rashly bumps and left us very itchy.</li>
    <li> Even better than expected!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil that is excellent for use with essential oils.  I use it as a carrier oil and it absorbs quickly and works great for massage.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thank you. Use it in conjunction with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Fabulous quality product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great for extending the use of essential oils since they can be costly. I just add it right to the bottles.</li>
    <li> Great oil, reasonable price. It&#x27;s been great to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Product is as described and arrived when expected. Very easy to add to the 10ml roller ball tubes for essential oil recipes.</li>
    <li> This is a great carrier oil for my essential oils. It is lightweight and non-scented, which is perfect since you don&#x27;t want anything interfering with the smells of the essential oils. A little goes a long way, so I expect this bottle to last me for quite a while. Great for it&#x27;s price, as some out there are pretty expensive and much smaller.</li>
    <li> I have not had an opportunity to use the oil yet but am certain I will be satisfied. I only received the product end of last week.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for following up!</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great with my essential oils and the price is very good for the amount of oil you get.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product, price, shipment and time frame. Great! Thank you</li>
    <li> Product received just as promised. I love this product, and it&#x27;s nice to know that I can get it so quickly.</li>
    <li> high quality oil, no odor, perfect to mix with tea tree oil!</li>
    <li> I some essential oils and vanilla beans in a bottle to create my own scented moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great right after a shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil for use with my doterra essential oils.  I am very pleased with the quality of this carrier oil and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a good price and seems to be a quality product.  I use it to dilute my essential oils.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this coconut oil. I use it for a base for essential oils as well as a general body oil. It&#x27;s light but has no odor of it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> I found the fractionated Coconut Oil meeting my need very well.  I am currently using doTerra Essential Oils and the combination works well.  The price is right.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Looking for liquid coconut oil for a carrier oil for Young Living Essential oils in vegetable capsules.  This is the perfect product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> A great mix for essential oils</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for what I need....to dilute my essential oils.  It doesn&#x27;t have the coconut smell that will interfere with the natural scent of the essential oils that I am mixing it with.  It also absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy residue.  And won&#x27;t stain clothing. THE BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love buying from Plant Therapy Oils because they are very aware of the importance of good customer service!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Seems a bit expensive but with the bottle size you get a lot of coconut oil. Use it quite often and haven&#x27;t even gone through 1/4 of the bottle.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good for the body and you can use for hair as well,</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price! It&#x27;s a great fragrant free carrier, I already ordered a second bottle!</li>
    <li> Good product. As described.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Essential Oil Dilution. I also use this all over instead of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Its very Runny and absorbs well. I apply a good amount to my legs and arms, rub in then with a damp towel wipe off the excess. Leaves my skin super soft! I suggest using it fresh out of shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no smell, not stick, no color, no staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who say it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut, of course it doesn&#x27;t lol! it is not suppose to! This is a refined oil for skin care, not cooking/eating coconut oil most are use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can not beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I love this oil; I use it is a base for my scented oils.  Is a great productm,it feels great, it my sking is soft and smells wonderfull.</li>
    <li> Good quality and quantity for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I purchased this to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it works great.  No color or smell.</li>
    <li> WOW !  Love this product! Great for my essential oils and super on my skin just by itself!</li>
    <li> I was not sure about ordering because it is less expensive than others I looked at, but gave it a try. I really like it. It mixes well with the essential oils, rubs in nicely and does not leave an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel. I use it after a shower by itself when I feel a little dry. I will order this again. It really is odorless, so does not affect the smell of the oils I add.</li>
    <li> This is such a high grade product! Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to blending essential oils and this product came highly recommended.  So far, it has lived up to expectations and blends well.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service and delivery of the product were very good.  The oil was packaged to prevent leakage and survived the trip into the AZ heat very nicely.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, awesome fast service. I love this Coconut oil and use it everyday on my skin. I will continue to order forever.</li>
    <li> I got my order for your fractionated oil very promptly. I am in Hawaii, and shipping can take a while. The oil isn&#x27;t sticky, and washes easily. Good stuff, good price, good service</li>
    <li> I use this for my skin care products.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I will most definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This item came as described, wasn&#x27;t opened or damaged in anyway, and has been perfect what I need it for, a carrier oil for essential oils for my family. Delivery was quick and easy. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome oil...not greasy and great for a carrier oil.  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Actually, the oil was leaking out of the top.  I did not lose much, but you may want to be sure that you wrap the top well before you put it in the mail.  Thanks for asking.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t like the other brands that are knock off synthetic Coco Oils. We once made a purchase on Amazon for the MCT brand. It was cut with half water...total joke.</li>
    <li> Use this to mix with essential oils.  Great price and nice oil</li>
    <li> Packaged very well! In a plastic bag, lid taped on, and there was a safety seal inside too! I&#x27;m very impressed with Plant Therapy&#x27;s quality control!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the quality of the oil is impressive! Thank you for standing behind your oils!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product will b getting more</li>
    <li> This product arrived promptly and met all expectations.</li>
    <li> I love the way the oil feels on my skin. I understand that it&#x27;s typically used as a carrier oil for salves, lotions, and other topical products. When I used it alone on my skin, I felt like it left an undesirable faint smell.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the coconut oil. I use it with my essential oils and it is wonderful. :)</li>
    <li> Great! with DoTerra oils</li>
    <li> I mix this with essential oils and use it in conjunction with a deodorant crystal.</li>
    <li> This was not my first order of this item from Plant Therapy I use all their products. They have great essential oils plus the customer service is outstanding! You can order directly from them at their website too</li>
    <li> I use this as a carrier oil in my scent warmers and as the base of my lotions.  It has no scent of it&#x27;s own, so it is perfect for both.  I love to smell nice and so I have fun mixing essential oils with this oil for my own lotions...that way you don&#x27;t have to read the label on store bought lotions and wonder about all those chemicals!  I will keep this one in stock...It is so versatile!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Exactly what I was looking for to use with my oils. Thank You!!</li>
    <li> It works for a carrier for the essential oils we have.</li>
    <li> Works very well with the Essential Oils.  Goes on the skin and is not greasy but rubs into the skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived packaged well and am anxious to try this  arrived quickly thanks</li>
    <li> Nice consistency carrier oil with no odor and all the health benefits of coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Really nice base oil!  Smooth and absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> I use this on my massage clients and they love it.  It has great glide and no scent.  Perfect for all styles of massage.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve got to where we use this every day it&#x27;s so versatile in sprays in rubs or as a wonderful lubricant</li>
    <li> I use this with my essential oils and it works great!</li>
    <li> Feels greay on my skin</li>
    <li> Mixes great with my essential oils. I have used this oil in the roller bottles too. Great value.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have very dry skin and it has helped with the itching that goes along with dry skin. Will purchase again. The oil arrived on the date that was posted and the packaging was well done.</li>
    <li> Great oil.  Very lite and absorbs extremely well.  Perfect carrier oil for essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when I need to.</li>
    <li> I like using this as a carrier oil for essential oils. It is supposed to soak into the skin better than regular coconut oil (Nutiva extra-virgin coconut oil, which I love to cook with and remove makeup). The EO&#x27;s seem to be doing their job, so I believe this CO is good for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is nice. Love using it as my lotion right after I get out of the shower. Helps me when I have dry skin. Much better than any lotion.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Great for mixing with essential oils.</li>
    <li> This oil stinks like petroleum. Was totally disappointed. Had to throw the whole bottle in the garbage and wash all my beddings.</li>
    <li> Product received as stated during purchase. love this product. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Was what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Delivery as promised and the product is great.  I use it as a carrier oil for my doterra essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great stuff,  use it for essential oil mixtures.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time for making balms and oil rubs.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because everything they said about the product was what I experienced.  It is a great product at a great price.  It was delivered right on time too!</li>
    <li> Love this - I use this all the time for a carrier oil when using essential oils, as well as making some DYI lotions/creams, and as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to using it to make a medication for my horse. Sadly, the seal came broken and there was oil all inside the box.  Don&#x27;t have time to return it, but loss an amount of it..</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it a lot yet, but so far seems like a good product.  Very moisturizing, soaks in, does not stain clothes. I have not used it a lot yet, but may update my review after more time and usage.  Packaging was fine, item arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Repeat customer.  I love this product.  I use it daily, in my bath and on my skin.  Great product, service. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great medium for making homemade deodorant and perfumes using essential oils.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. It&#x27;s helping her skin tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
    <li> cheaper than at the health store in my area.  I use this product all the time.  For me as well as for my pets.</li>
    <li> Perfect to mix with your theraputic oils!</li>
    <li> Love using this as my carrier oil for essential oils! Great value as well!</li>
    <li> A nice clean feeling oil.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils</li>
    <li> Great oil! Use it to mix with my dōTerra</li>
    <li> I was thoroughly impressed with the way this arrived and works.  It absorbs very nicely and is really great.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin very smooth</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I had anticipated. 100% pure.  This is being used as the carrier oil for my essential oils roll-on mixtures. Has no bad odor and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I actually have not used it as yet. I do want to use it with some oils that I have called M-Graine. You mix it with the oil in a small 5ml bottle and put a rollerball on it to use when you have a migraine. Or other oils for massage.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, great for EO use for a carrier oil. I ordered this twice now and love it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> No comments regarding processing with peanuts or other nuts on the label.  This is a concern in our house but my child with the nut allergies is ok with this brand of FCO for our essential oils.  We have encountered other brands that are potentially &amp;#34;contaminated&amp;#34; with her nut allergens.  I am happy with this oil!</li>
    <li> Showed up quickly. Works great for my needs and seems to massage in as good as any other coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Mixes well with essential oils and great for skin care</li>
    <li> Good product. I used it to help me control the fleas on my dog. He likes getting a massage and i get to keep him free of fleas.</li>
    <li> I use this for body oil and I make my own deodorant blend with lemon and lavender oils in it! Love it I have purchased this more than once and will continue!</li>
    <li> The perfect carrier oil! Works great.</li>
    <li> This is a very good carrier oil for essential oils.  It was a good price and came exactly when they said it would come.</li>
    <li> Perfect carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! came in a timely manner and highly recommend;D</li>
    <li> Awesome carrier oil. I am new to trying essential oils but I am in the arena of finding a combo to repel ticks and fleas for my dogs. This oil is great! It is light and I have tead that simply applying a coconut oil to my furry kids will help. I will use this as my carrier to mix my repellant. I think it is a great deal and worth trying this brand out! Very light to no scent.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils, and I&#x27;ve used this to mix a couple and it works great. I only wish the scents of the oils (and resultant dilutions/mixtures) lasted a bit longer. If I use it on my face plainly, I notice a slight unpleasant odor for a little while, but it eventually goes away. It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t stain sheets and absorbs relatively quickly. Makes for a nice massage.</li>
    <li> My wife said that she like it.</li>
    <li> I use this with my essential oils.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks!!</li>
    <li> A reorder. Very good product b</li>
    <li> Love the FCO from this company. I will order again. It&#x27;s not slimy and absorbs great.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction, very happy! AAAAA+</li>
    <li> No smell and hydrating oil.&lt;br /&gt;Love the quality of it and will certainly buy again from this company.</li>
    <li> Received product severely damaged. The bottle was cracked &amp; all the oil leaked on the other items in the box. Delivery man left the oil soaked box on my porch.</li>
    <li> This fractionated coconut oil is great! Very affordable and I will be ordering again soon. Great find!</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction and the oil is smooth and hydrating!</li>
    <li> Start buying this oil because DoTerra brand is too expensive. I actually like it better than DoTerra. You get more for your money and it&#x27;s fabulous in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Packaged very well. Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a substitute for doTERRA Fractionated Coconut Oil, get this! I am really impressed so far! Same consistency, works fine in roller bottles, larger quantity, easier spout to pour! I hope they keep this product with available free shipping!</li>
    <li> Very clear, high quality coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This Is An Absolutely Great Oil For Essential Oils Specifically With Topical Uses, I Am Attempting Something That Leaves Me Little Time For The Room For Error With My Health. So Im Pleased I Also Was UnAware It Was The Best Oil For Lovin So Respect Life and Have Fun.</li>
    <li> great oil for a great cost. it doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s own smell, so it is great for mixing with my essential oils. i use a mixture of lavender, palmarosa, and geranium essential oils with this carrier oil as a deodorant and it works great. i add what i feel and it never is exactly the same but works each time. a little goes a long way so you will have this oil for a long time.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done with the Deep Blue oil.</li>
    <li> Good price for a wee bit when you&#x27;re short ;)</li>
    <li> The only problem was that some leaked out in transit.</li>
    <li> Oil was good but the package leaked all over the box ..list 1/3 if the bottle...</li>
    <li> I found the product to be exactly what I needed and would likely reorder when the time arises.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. Mixes well with my doTERRA Essential Oils!</li>
    <li> works well with the essential oils</li>
    <li> Works great with my YL essential oils. I love it!</li>
    <li> Go to staple for my preffered carrier oil</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I am using as a carrier oil for and essential oil blend I am using on my face.  The coconut oil is very light and has very little fragrance.  I would recommend for any skin application of essential oils.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful carrier oil for essential oils!</li>
    <li> We were recommended this product by a friend.  It was nice to use and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Purchased to mix with do Terra essential oils!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it, good stuff!!</li>
    <li> This made both my wife and me break out in an itchy rash. I&#x27;m not sure what the deal was with it but we sent it back.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick shipping.  Great quality product, bought as a carrier oil for my expensive essential oils and it works great.</li>
    <li> Makes a great carrier oil.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest, per ounce, that we have found for massage oil. And since it is a &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34;, it is purer than an actual &amp;#34;massage oil&amp;#34; - no scents or other additives. It is very smooth and probably healthier than most massage oils.</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil!  I have several carrier oils to use with my essential oils, but this is by far my favorite.  It is NOT greasy at all and immediately absorbs into the skin.  I want to also add that Plant Therapy Essential Oils provides outstanding customer service. They have excellent communication and follow-up, as well as almost immediate shipping.  This is my 3rd purchase from them, and each time has been exceptional.</li>
    <li> Went and smooth and dried on skin. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nice base for mixing essential oils. Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> love this oil for my skin care products!</li>
    <li> Great value. Good service. Would use this vendor again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this several times. Great product.</li>
    <li> This works great when used with essintial oils! Great product.</li>
    <li> Love it right after my shower.  Bought some roller balls with my &amp;#34;concoctions&amp;#34; in it........works great right out of the shower.  Skin feels moist and supple all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Lissa Giger</li>
    <li> This oil is the best! Not a strong coconut smell. Good price and quality!</li>
    <li> Arrived as ordered and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I would recommend it very highly to anyone who is looking for a carrier oil.  There is no smell of coconut if anyone has that question, and it is very nice when you mix your essential oils with it! The smell is amazing!  :)</li>
    <li> A must for essential oil users. Great product, great price.</li>
