    <li> Good product for a fair price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tea tree oil. I keep it around all the time in case we need it for emergency medicinal times.</li>
    <li> We use this for our cloth diapers to keep the smell away when we are waiting to wash them.  It works well.</li>
    <li> Got for my Dad who has really bad ezema.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve been using this for months and it&#x27;s had zero affect. Safe your money.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I like it. I will order again once exhausted.</li>
    <li> This was pretty terrible. I bought a different brand previously and love it!  I used the other brand for everything, everywhere.  This. This made me develop a incredible rash that didn&#x27;t go away until I had it medically treated.</li>
    <li> Product is great! Exactly as described! Great quality! Great price! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Very powerful product.</li>
    <li> Great deal, much better than buying at the market.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was a great deal. I was wrong. the smell is no where close to Tea tree oil. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it but I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> as promised.  I use this for a variety of reasons and I like the bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This looks like it comes from China and takes a long time to arrive, when I realized this I try to return this product but do not let me. their quality is intermediate. It works well if you are not a professional but a ficionado to polish your car on weekends once a month or every two months.</li>
    <li> It smells weird. Very chemically. Not planty.</li>
    <li> FAST delivery and great packaging Wonderful product  I use it for everything!  3 to 4 drops in baby shampoo for my poodles NO FLEAS at all!  10 to 15 drops in my shampoo and my hair is GREAT. you can even put drops in your mouth wash to help with poor gums the list goes on.........</li>
    <li> With twice a day use and a moisturizing lotion (I use Aveeno), tea tree oil had help my painful skin condition IMMENSELY. I&#x27;ve large, painful lumps and bumps since my teenage years around my belt line, bra line and anywhere tight clothing makes a lot of contact and with the first month of morning and night use, it had cleared A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now into my 4th month of use and very rarely have any more bumps/lumps/zits/whatever you&#x27;d call it. I don&#x27;t dilute it. It&#x27;s really amazing and I feel stupid that this was my &amp;#34;last ditch&amp;#34; effort. Should&#x27;ve been my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is key though and a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate you. Also, get used to the strong smell. :/ that&#x27;s the worst part!</li>
