<li> The glue is easy to be applied as thin and even on the lashes.</li>
<li> and last very long!</li>
<li> I have tried many american eyelash glues and they were often really hard to put on, remove, and they really had bad smells to it.</li>
<li> but this glue is not strong enough to hold overnight so</li>
<li> However, even if the instructions and other usually printed consumer product information been written in English, the eyelash glue had no stickum&#x27; and would not adhere to my eyelids.  </li>
<li> you&#x27;d have to literally peal them off because they don&#x27;t come off like all the other brands after you sweat.</li>
<li> so i didnt have to replace my lashes everyday</li>
<li> The second fixer I got was even worse, for I could hardly draw the brush out because it was stuck in the glue.</li>
<li> The glue was somehow agglomerate, and I found it hard to get the glue onto the brush.</li>
<li> I used it for my sisters wedding and had no issues with my fake lashes coming off halfway through the day.</li>

<li> weird, made me cry irritated my  eyes</li>
<li> I thought it was merely some bad luck, so I placed an order again.</li>
<li> My guess is that the weather was so cold that the glue solidified during shipping/delivery.</li>

    <li> No use at all.so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this overseas while traveling and thought the brush made the adhesive application a breeze! I then discovered that DUO also makes a brush on lash adhesive which I can pick up at any grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the adhesives side by side and found that the DUO adhesive formula to be significantly stronger.</li>
    <li> I love the product! It last several months of daily use. The fine application brush is superb and product does not clump and dries clear</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This is a very effective eyelash glue that is by far one of the best I have ever used.  This is a great Seller with fast delivery.  Highly recommended.[[ASIN:B0012VQTO2 D.U.P Eyelashes Fixer EX (Clear Type)]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very popular product in east Asia and I was very excited to use them, but the fixer I received was totally unusable. The glue was somehow agglomerate, and I found it hard to get the glue onto the brush. Besides, the glue was not sticky at all. I thought it was merely some bad luck, so I placed an order again. The second fixer I got was even worse, for I could hardly draw the brush out because it was stuck in the glue. My guess is that the weather was so cold that the glue solidified during shipping/delivery. Although I put the fixers under room temperature for several days, they were still no longer usable. I had to return both of them, and it was my first time to select the &amp;#34;Defected/Does not work properly&amp;#34; option. I still believe in this product since there are so many positive reviews (not only on Amazon), but maybe I bought it in an inappropriate season.</li>
    <li> I have tried many american eyelash glues and they were often really hard to put on, remove, and they really had bad smells to it. However this japanese brand is amazing. It is so easy to put on and it goes on blue but dries up clear. I was scared that when i had to remove it, it would take lots of my eyelashes, BUT it was very gentle when i removed it without any eyelashes pulled, i didn&#x27;t even put eye makeup remover for this. Since i cannot stand stinky glue, this is totally UNSCENTED, and i can handle it. This is seriously worth the money. I totally recommend this if you want a unscented, gentle, and easy-to-use product.</li>
    <li> I was used to using brands from the store. This is worth the extra money. I used it for my sisters wedding and had no issues with my fake lashes coming off halfway through the day. Great product, worth the money and less than some other brands.</li>
    <li> Best fixer I ever used. The glue is easy to be applied as thin and even on the lashes. And it is solid. Removal is quite easy. Just use some water.</li>
    <li> Long lasting hold; easy to use</li>
    <li> No smell! and last very long! you&#x27;d have to literally peal them off because they don&#x27;t come off like all the other brands after you sweat.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off until you take it off, and if put on properly..it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue after washing your face. The best one so far just wish it was available in local stores :)</li>
    <li> Best eyelashes glue all the time. Easy to apply,  stay on all day. I highly recommend this item to all the &amp;#34; lashes girls &amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have ordered to which I give such a low rating.  The pkg info is written in what appears to be Chinese.  However, even if the instructions and other usually printed consumer product information been written in English, the eyelash glue had no stickum&#x27; and would not adhere to my eyelids.  I wasted several pairs of very good eyelashes trying to get this product to work.  I will not utilize any product made by or from this provider. Jim</li>
    <li> At first I really didn&#x27;t care for this product, however, once I continued using it correctly it worked just like it was supposed to .  I will purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I liked this glue because it&#x27;s easy to apply with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;It turned to clear finish but I can see blue color when I apply.&lt;br /&gt;This is the most powerful bonding for the faux eyelash so far.</li>
    <li> Great glue. Lashes stay on all day and better than the DOUs and other drug store brands.  Easy to apply wand makes it easy to apply. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The only eyelash glue I trust and use. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it never gave me any bad reactions. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it holds my lashes in place all day , and even all all night long.</li>
    <li> weird, made me cry irritated my  eyes</li>
    <li> Wow they look so pretty. I cant wait to try them on. Im very happy with my purchase it came in less than a day thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Strong but not that strong...I wanted to have this so i didnt have to replace my lashes everyday but this glue is not strong enough to hold overnight so therefore making it too expensive...Will not buy again</li>
