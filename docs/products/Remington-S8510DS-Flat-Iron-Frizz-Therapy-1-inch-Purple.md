<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for the price. Heats quickly and straightens well. Love it!</li>
    <li> Really removes frizz and keeps hair frizz free for days. I wish it had dual voltage so I could take it for travel.</li>
    <li> It does not make any difference to buy a regular flat iron compared to this one except the weird smell that it leaves on my hair. i dont like it. and I would not buy again</li>
    <li> Its great but its the first time I bought a flat iron that cost this much so I was kinda expecting something super awesome but overall its great. It does heat up in like 30 secs which is cool but , I think it doesnt work that good for me cuz I have really horrible hair so maybe thats why but It still does the job well</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron as a Christmas gift a year and a half ago. It&#x27;s the fourth flat iron I have used and it is definitely my favorite. I specifically asked for this one because of the auto-shutoff feature, which prevents me from worrying all day at work that I left it on when I left the house. If it ever breaks, I will by the exact same one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Auto shut-off&lt;br /&gt;  2. Never snags my hair - doesn&#x27;t require separating out individual sections&lt;br /&gt;  3. Plates are floating so it presses evenly on your hair&lt;br /&gt;  4. The plate coating still looks perfect after using it almost daily for a 1.5 years. I&#x27;ve had trouble with this with some other models.&lt;br /&gt;  5. Heats up very fast, about 30 seconds to get to 400F&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  1. As fast as it heats up, it also cools off as you use it. The first few swipes work far better than the last few.&lt;br /&gt;  2. The swivel feature on the cord. It hasn&#x27;t quit on me yet, but I can tell this is the first thing that is going to go. The unit won&#x27;t always turn on unless I get the swivel in a specific position first. But, 1.5 years is still pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip to deal with the unit cooling off: Once the flat iron reaches its desired heat setting, it changes the current to maintain that setting but doesn&#x27;t take into account the fact that using it causes it to cool off. This can cause it to cool far below the set temperature. What you want is for it to be continuously heating as you use it. Set the temperature to one level below what you really want. Once it reaches this level, push the up button one more time and begin using it. It will likely never reach the next level because it will cool as you use it, and so it will continuously heat the whole time you use it. This will keep it much closer to your desire temperature.</li>
    <li> Works great.. !!  I do curls also with this.</li>
    <li> ... and she really likes it.  She says it does a good job of straightening and it is fast.  She has long, thick hair and appreciates the fact that she doesn&#x27;t have to spend forever getting the job done.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Have not seen any results after over 6 months of daily use.</li>
    <li> I am a complete rookie when it comes to hair tools. This was my first ever flat iron. Works great even for a novice like me!  Lasts two days.</li>
    <li> The perfect flat iron!  Heats up fast &amp; easy to use.  I love the lock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African-American with transitioning hair (6-months post, 4b/4c) and this is definitely one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned but there are still some cons. However I will begin with the PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*Made my hair silky straight with just one pass.&lt;br /&gt;*No frizz even in humidity. (However I have just begun using some other anti-frizz products so I wont completely attribute this pro to the flat-iron.)&lt;br /&gt;*Heats up extremely fast and the lock feature is great.&lt;br /&gt;*I like how it automatically shuts off after one hour; makes me feel better if I&#x27;m not sure that I shut it off before I left the house.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*Gets very hot on the outside of the flat iron near the plates.&lt;br /&gt;*Hard to get very close to the roots. I&#x27;m not sure if its because of the design or because the outside gets so hot I&#x27;m afraid I will burn my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;*The floating plates are awkward. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m able to put a lot of pressure on my hair which bothers me when I&#x27;m trying to get my thick roots straight. I&#x27;d prefer if it clamped tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Its a good flat iron but could be better. I would avoid it if you have really coarse tightly-curly roots because even though it got my hair silky straight, the roots are still kind of stiff and puffy. If they lost the floating plates and made the outside of a more heat resistant material I think that this would be a 5-star flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have short course thick naturally curly/frizzy hair.  I am coming up on my 6th decade and I swear I have used just about every product, (much wasted money on so called miracle hair products), but never found the ONE.  Actually I realize there isn&#x27;t just one product or styling gadget that will do it all.  Recently I discovered the Agadir shampoo and conditioner product line with Argan oil.  This has made a tremendous improvement on the texture of my hair, adding shine and reducing frizz, love the stuff.    For years I have used curling irons and curling brushes to tame my hair, living in Florida with high humidity, the styling doesn&#x27;t last long.  Many years ago I bought a Babyliss flat iron that was all the rage at the time, very expensive, very big, very awkward to use.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Over the years they have become available in smaller sizes and the heat control much more efficient so thought I would try my hand at using one again.    I really like this iron!  5 stars for me.    So glad I bought this one with the LCD temperature control as I found the full 450 °F much too hot for my hair.  The perfect temp for me is around 325 - 350 °F.  I have learned to angle the iron when pulling my hair through so I get a nice smooth under flip adding body without curl.  Now if you want really straight hair this will do the job too as when I mess up my flip angle, even the curling brush can&#x27;t unstraighten it.  It heats up quick, has a latch that keeps the plates closed together when not in use, long cord reach for us taller gals, and was actually very easy for me to use. There was no offensive odor.  Works with my short hair just fine.  Does what it says it should at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, somewhat curly and not fine but not coarse.  This straightener works well on my hair on the medium setting.  It makes my hair super straight and is very easy to use.  It heats up fast so it takes little time to style my hair.  I believe someone with thicker or curlier hair could use the high setting and someone with fine hair the low setting and both could get good results.</li>
    <li> Great and as expected</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as well as chi at a third of the cost</li>
    <li> Used this daily for a really long time now.  Still works beautifully and has held up through my heavy duty use.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this! Works better than a Chi.</li>
    <li> I had before the remington sleek and curl, for 4 years or so, and this one works a lot better, it doesn&#x27;t pull out hair.  And it is very fast.</li>
    <li> Heats up fine. Snags your hair!</li>
    <li> Bought this hair iron because my CHI broke apart after 5 years of use! I am in love with this flat iron! It turned my bi-racial curly mane into straight perfection!! I am able to get to the roots of my hair with this because I am able to turn down the heat so I don&#x27;t burn my scalp. The anti-frizz really works!!! I recommend this product to anyone looking for a great flat iron on a budget. I honestly think this a way better investment than my $120 CHI</li>
    <li> My hair looks so nice.</li>
    <li> Love love love. Couldn&#x27;t be happier! No more to say than that! Buy this thing it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and I love that you can set the temperature. I had/have a CHI and it seems to get too hot and fry my hair but this iron gets it nice and smooth. I have very thick African American hair and it gives me salon straight hair. Try it, for the price you can&#x27;t afford not too.</li>
    <li> I had a crappy ol&#x27; 2in. flat iron for ages. It was time to try something new, so I ordered this baby and it arrived in no time at all. I ripped open the package and plugged it in. Some other reviewers commented on a distinct smell, which I can attest to. It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, lets be clear, but I don&#x27;t find it in any way repulsive either...it is hard to explain. Anyway, it heated up real fast, and it looks so nice with the blue plates and digital temperature thingy. Very sleek. The temperature it starts out with is 370, so I just left it like that and got to work. My hair is fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it, and of course, its frizzy as all ****. I sectioned off my hair and used the same technique as I normally would. It was a lot faster, with only 1 or 2 passes through each strand. I was done before I knew it. The plates were smooth on my hair, and no hair got stuck under the plates as some other users experienced. The straightening smell was noticeable, definitely, so I started using a delicious smelling heat protectant and now I smell like a field of flowers instead :) I can&#x27;t say whether the anti-frizz holds up in the rain or humidity, as it has been cold and dry where I live. But either way, it keeps my hair straight for days now! I really could not be happier for this price.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, if the smell of the straightener really bothers you, use a scented perfume or other product. Also, I have used the straightener about 10 times now and the smell goes down with every time I use it, so I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and use it almost daily. Heats up really fast and has the auto shut off (that I hope I&#x27;ll never need). My hair is thin mad slightly wavy, so the low setting works perfect. I even straightened my aunt&#x27;s hair, which can be described as tight spiral curls. Her hair stayed straight for 2 days with no frizz! I love the digital display as we&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Chi and needed a replacement, this works just as well for half the price!</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this straightener. The spot where the ceramic plate meets the plastic back has a small teeny tiny gap in it that pulls out my hair every single time. I&#x27;d go bald if I actually used this. And you have to go over one section of hair about 8 times before it&#x27;s actually straight. Extremely disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> iT WAS A GOOD FLAT IRON WHILE IT LASTED, BUT IT BURNED OUT VERY QUICKLY.  The reason I give it a 3 star rating is that you have to hold the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; together to get a really good effect - the one thing I was hoping not to have to do.  Otherwise it is a super flat iron.  Heats up really fast - and I mean fast.  I like that you can set the temperature.  Also like the closing switch on it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that helps my hair be tame without frizz</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I absolutely love my remington flat iron. My hair stays straight and silky for 48+ hour. Never thought possible while using my previous flat iron.  I give it 5 star.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. The only problem I&#x27;ve run into is that it catches my hair and ends up pulling a bunch out. I&#x27;ve found that making sure I go over the pieces of hair slower helps a little, but it&#x27;s a part of the flat iron under the plates that catches my hair all the time. If that could be fixed, this would get 5 stars for sure! I&#x27;ve tried tons of expensive flat irons and this one is just as good. It needs to be replaced sooner than the others but that&#x27;s expected due to the price.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Remington flat irons are far better than the more expensive ones. I have another Remington that works with damp hair for those hurry up moments.</li>
    <li> Id give this 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t pull my hair as much. It is better than the chi flat iron I have.</li>
    <li> Heats up to high with temperature reading which is exactly what I wanted. I would have given 5 stars but it does not go lower than 300 degrees.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have owned. Much better than my PHI heat and my Conairs. I def. recommend this to anyone looking for salon quality at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Recieved item on time, was expected to pay $8 shipping at the door , had no cash on me so it is now sat at the post office. This is a gift for my daughter off her grandmother and all shipping was supposed to be included when it was bought and paid for !</li>
    <li> Amazing results! My daughter and I have ethnic hair and this iron brought great results in the first pass thorough our hair. Shine, smooth and very straight. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the static. They do give u static sheets though.</li>
    <li> I have used this flat iron for months now and all I could say is that its well worth it for the money. Its great compared to other flat irons of the same price. You only need about 1 or 2 swipes so that your hair gets flat.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I was excited about ordering the flat iron.  After 2 uses on a 380 degree setting, it dried my hair out.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that likes to do its own thing and this flat iron puts my hair in its place! It makes my hair smooth and it stays that way all day. I can even curl my hair with it and the curls look good the next day. I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my hair since using this. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I own a Chi flat iron as well as this Remington, and I must say, the Remington is far better - not to mention about $60 cheaper. It is sleek and light, with a swivel cord, and heats up quite quickly. I did not experience any snagging or pulling, I only had to run it through my sections of hair two times max, and the time it took to flat iron my hair was drastically reduced. I have very tight, kinky curls and normally my Chi would leave my hair slightly frizzy, and generally sort of crisp feeling despite using heat protection. The Remington was not like this at all. My hair is as flat and smooth as it has ever been, and so soft! I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I recommend it 100 %&lt;br /&gt;very good, what I expected</li>
    <li> Bought this for my aunt back in 2013, and still works like a charm, the woman just would not put in down!! This was and excellent buy!!!</li>
    <li> Totally met my expectations and beyond!</li>
    <li> I had an older version of the Remington flat iron but this one is amazing and is totally worth it!!  Cut my hair straightening time in 1/2!!</li>
    <li> I tried the Remington and I love it,I think is better than the CHI and overall is very sheap for all the good work It does. I recommended  to buy it.</li>
    <li> It straightens my hair in literally five minutes and it comes out so nice and smooth and lasts forever. I&#x27;ve gotten hundreds of compliments on my hair since I started using this. The only slightly annoying thing is that sometimes it pulls on my hair a little but it&#x27;s really not a big deal. This is seriously the best straightener out there and works perfectly on my thick, curly hair. You only need to go over each section about once or twice. The price is really good too, it works a lot better than the really expensive straighteners out there. Overall, you NEED to get this straightener, it&#x27;ll make your life so much easier and your hair will stay sleek, straight, and fabulous.</li>
    <li> This flat iron went above and beyond my expectations. My hair is as straight as if I got it done at a salon. It straightened my hair with ease. This flat iron is suitable for any hair type. You just have to adjust the temp accordingly</li>
    <li> This iron heats up very quickly and straightens very well. My hair actually FELT smoother after the first time I used it. I love it! Great price, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it four stars is that it has two crevices next to the heating places that really grabbed at, and often tore, my hair. I fixed the problem by putting a piece of black electrical tape over each crack. I barely notice the tape, and I haven&#x27;t tore my hair since. However, it is a design flaw that I hope gets noticed...and fixed.</li>
    <li> With all the rave reviews I read - as well as the product title(!), I guess I was expecting some miracle with regard to smoothing down the frizz.  I have wavy, shoulder-length, color treated hair, and if left to air-dry (or in humid atmospheres) will become quite frizzy.  Well, unless I do a thorough job of blow-drying my hair straight first, this &#x27;Frizz Therapy&#x27; flat iron does not seem to be any better than any other irons I&#x27;ve used.  That being said, if I start with straight, dry hair (and use a thermal protection product like  Tresemme&#x27; Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Leave-in Spray on each strand before ironing, AND and an anti frizz serum before blow drying), my hair will look very nice (as long as weather is cooperating).  I find that if I iron small sections at a time, and then wrap the sections in large velcro rollers to cool, it looks GREAT when I take it out.  This iron does have some really nice features which many reviewers have already mentioned.  Among the ones I like the most are: temperature display and quick warm-up, long length swivel cord, and size and feel of the appliance.  The one feature that I don&#x27;t care for are the &#x27;floating blades&#x27;.  I guess this is meant to allow you to press harder and apply more pressure on each strand while ironing.  Frankly, I would prefer smooth blade tips that slip easily through sections of hair and not ones that have space where hair can get caught.  Just a word of warning - the blades get really hot and so does your hair!  You might want to get yourself some finger protectors to use for the times you don&#x27;t guide the hair sections with a comb.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is as good if not better than the one I spent $100+ on that finally died after some years of use. Even if it doesn&#x27;t last as long, for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. I have very curly hair - lots of hair but each strand not overly thick for reference.</li>
    <li> Works really well and heats up quickly! I can see a difference between using this straightener and my old one. My hair is less frizzy and the time it takes to straighten is less than before!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener more than my chi! Only downfall was the part of it wasn&#x27;t completely connected and my hair would snag- but easily fixed with a small piece of electric tape and is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is a really great drugstore flat iron! I&#x27;ve had it for 2+ years and it&#x27;s still working without any problems. It heats up really quickly (I love its blinking indicator to let you know when it&#x27;s heating and when it has reached the defined temperature). The moveable ceramic plates also create a closer clamp. I also love that the buttons are out of the way and you won&#x27;t accidentally press them when using the iron. In the past, I have used irons that were poorly designed because the buttons were located right where your hand would be putting pressure on the flat iron during use. I would unintentionally press random buttons all the time and it was really annoying. I really have no complaints about this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, does what it says it will do, smooths, keeps the frizz away and conditions. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I first read about this in Good Housekeeping magazine.  I bought one back three years ago or so and it was time for a new one.  I got it on Amazon for a great price and the updates are wonderful.  Keeps my thick wavy Irish &amp;#34;Kennedy&amp;#34; hair behaving wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron as an update from my old, cheap flat iron. My sister and mother both love their Remington straighteners so I decided to try the same brand as well. After using this flat iron for about one week, I&#x27;ve been impressed with how well it straightens by long, thick hair. The reason I only gave a four-star review is because a few strands of my hair tend to get stuck between the lower portion of the plates and the handle. I have been trying to find a way to prevent this, but have not yet had any luck. It does not happen with every section of hair I run it through, but it occurs at least three times while straightening my hair. Other than the problem with my hair getting caught I am very pleased with this straightener thus far.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight tool that works amazing for frizz control.  I have two teenagers that loved the results as their hair is normally extra curly and hard to flat iron.  Defintely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! I have very thick, frizzy, curly hair and it leaves my hair smooth, shiny and with little frizz. It also glides very easy on my hair and does not ripe and pull my hair like other straighteners I have used. I am pleased!</li>
    <li> Been using it since I bought it (January) and it still works great, keeps frizz down, but if you straighten over the same area too much, it will get staticky. (I live in some intense humidity, so for you with no humidity, be careful, static will be more likely)</li>
    <li> Th best flat iron I have ever had</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, naturally curly hair. I&#x27;ve used lots of straighteners before, and I am most pleased with the Remington line. The shine therapy one was good, but I LOVE this one. I live in Alabama and it can get pretty humid, which means that straight hair is out for this girl. But with this straightener, I can go out in 90% humidity and still have great hair. It is a one inch plate, which I&#x27;ve never been able to use before because it took so long to get through my thick hair, but with this one I can have it done really well in less than 15 minutes. I haven&#x27;t had it long but I am very impressed already.</li>
    <li> I have thick, unmanageable frizzy hair. It doesn&#x27;t even matter with this! I had no problem getting my hair straight. It took about 3 minutes to heat up to 430° and it slid smoothly through my hair and left it nearly frizzy free and really straight. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this flat iron and concerned about one constant comment for all customers. But now that I have been using the product for about a month and my hair has been exposed to various kinds of weather and stayed non frizzy and straight, I can say this product works. The only problem with this product is the smell that is left on your hair after using it. I carefully read through most of the customer comments and had the understanding that this would go away. I hope it does in the next few uses. I will keep you posted. Otherwise it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Pulls my hair so bad I have strands everywhere and itS because of a design flaw by the plastic omfg please just go by a damn chi I tried but this product is horrible so pissed off!!! Tried to wrap tape around the piece like another reviewer had said to do and it just gets sticky and gooey ewe !</li>
    <li> Works wonderful, digital hurt display so I can us it on mine and my daughters hair. Hers is much thicker than mine. She&#x27;s biracial so it needs to get way hotterfor her than it does for me. Paired with garnier druggie morrocan argan oil makes her hair shiny soft and manageable for days. Love it. Hate that it doesn&#x27;t lie flat though. I&#x27;m always afraid to burn my countertop.</li>
    <li> This flat iron seemed relatively ok to me, and for the barely 1 year and six months of its life it did my hair pretty well. I have pretty coarse, very thick wavy/curly hair and this flat iron did a decent job of fully straightening once every three days (or curling, as I happen to use my flat irons to mostly do beachy waves) and touching up my hair most every day. I will say that I often had to run it over my hair two to three times to achieve smooth results, but again, my hair is a bit on the horse hair side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, about a month ago, it started malfunctioning and appeared to have an electrical short somewhere that caused it to shut off every time I clamped down--pretty much the opposite of what you want it to do. Still, I made due with it for a little while longer by letting it turn off when it clamped down and then doing a layer of my hair with the residual heat that had built up and then turned it back on to do it over again. A pretty pain-staking process, but ah well. This morning, however, seemed to be all that it could handle anymore and it promptly conked out after about five minutes on, never to return its little blue light again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I used this pretty regularly, but it seems to me that a flat iron as well reviewed as this should&#x27;ve held up a bit longer. I&#x27;ve had 15 dollar flat irons that lasted longer than this thing did. A little disappointing honestly. Guess I should just pony up for a professional flat iron.</li>
    <li> I use it for my leave out, and my curly natural hair gets pinned straight. MAKE SURE TO USE HEAT PROTECTANT.. The room smells when I flat iron my hair, but that always happens.. oh and My hair does not smell any different.</li>
    <li> Its amazing. I don&#x27;t have very curly or hard hairs. I&#x27;ve thin soft Y wavy hairs...&lt;br /&gt;I set the temperature to least, 300 and even before its fully charged, I use it on my front strands &amp; starts straightening them up! I jus need to run twice thru my hairs &amp; voila, they are done!&lt;br /&gt;Its totally worth. Go for it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, heats up in about 30 seconds or less. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair fried at all. Has made such a difference in how shiny and manageable my hair is.</li>
    <li> it heats up super quickly and is very user friendly. It doesnt burn the hair or give off any weird odors. The only issue is that there is a small space between the plate and what holds it in place, my hair gets snagged in it. I deducted a star for that, but Im never disappointed with the results.</li>
    <li> I researched this straightener and all I read was positive feedback, so I figured I&#x27;d try it. Super awesome! The price is ridiculous for an item so good. I am buying a second one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> this was a great product., I was going to purchase another one, then it mentioned that there was a newer one, and I took a chance and it was worth it</li>
    <li> This is a great product for straightening hair, and I find the quality of Remington flat irons to be exceptional.  However, I didn&#x27;t think the addition of the frizz therapy made it work any differently from a regular flat iron.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I am in shock, after years and years of wrestling with my fine frizzy hair and trying a million different hair products for frizz, this flat iron is a MIRACLE! I would flat iron my hair and it would look fine, then 15 minutes later it was all puffed up in a frizz ball. There has never been anything I could do about it, until now. This iron works wonders. Time will tell if it damages my hair but I hope to be using this thing a long time. And I would pay any price for this iron!</li>
    <li> My daughter has Rosanne Rosanna Danna hair and I bought this flat iron to tackle it.  Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m no expert but I now am able to flat-iron her hair in about 40 minutes, sometimes only passing on a section of hair one time through.  The construction of it is comfortable and I don&#x27;t get palm cramp from holding it.  It&#x27;s sleek and functional and, though I do her hair now because it&#x27;s such a daunting task for a 13-yr-old, I know she will be able to handle this device when I&#x27;m ready to let her go at it.</li>
    <li> I thought my CHI was bad about giving me frizz, this one is worse! Straightening however, it performed better than my ULTRA CHI in my opinion. But I have straight hair and mainly want to use it for curling and adding volume. Will be returning. It doesn&#x27;t heat up in 30 secs like promised, still pretty fast for the amount of heat. Straighten well and fast. Handles where the plates are gets pretty hot so you&#x27;ll have to be careful. Okay buy if you want to use for straightening but I think there are better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my flat iron for about 6 months now and I love it! I have to crank it up to 450 degrees for it to work on my hair, but it flattens it just like going to the salon. With heat like that, you&#x27;ll want to put something on your hair to protect it before using this. I love that it turns off automatically,  I&#x27;ve accidentally left it on before going to work, and it shut off for me. This iron heats up very fast too. I&#x27;ve spent twice, three times as much as this for a flat iron and got the same results.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this iron. Works great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener, it is light weight and heats up very quick. I have thick wavy hair and it does not take long to make it silly smooth for the whole day. It does not make my hair frizzy in the least and the style lasts longer than I would have expected as my hair usually goes back to wavy halfway through the day. Would recommend this to all!</li>
    <li> This flatiron gets hotter than my Chi.  And I paid a lot more $ for the Chi than I did this one</li>
    <li> I had been cautioned by my stylist to buy a good quality flat iron that got very hot.  I researched flat irons and finally settled on this one.  After I bought it, I took it to her to try out.  She flat ironed my hair and pronounced this one PRIMO.  She even recommended it to a fellow stylist.  I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I like how portable it is, and it heats up really fast. The LCD display makes it very easy to adjust the heat.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t eliminate frizz, though. It does what any other flat iron does.</li>
    <li> less time spent straightening thick curly hair as gets really hot</li>
    <li> Its okay for this price</li>
    <li> I have some ghd&#x27;s in the UK which I think are fantastic, but wanted some less expensive straighteners for over here. These are excellent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered within two days.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Heats up quickly. I Used a chi before and this works as well. But much more affordable.</li>
    <li> For the past 4 years I have been using Remington&#x27;s S2044 Damage Therapy flat iron.  It has been the best thing ever!  Unfortunately, the teflon fibers have ripped and they no longer make it.  This flat iron seemed like a related alternative.  It definitely isn&#x27;t the same but it isn&#x27;t terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is far less friction pulling the iron through my hair than my previous iron.  It glides through so smoothly and quickly I wasn&#x27;t sure I even had gotten the hair in it.  That is just something I have to get used to.  The plates on this iron are about an inch longer than on my old iron which combined with the fast and smooth glide makes it so much faster!  I do love that.  I also really like that the controls are on the side so I don&#x27;t accidentally hit them while using it.  I also like the sleek look and long cord and my hair looks very shiny when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some things I am not too happy with.  I guess because it has the bare plates and I am used to having a fabric coating on top, I&#x27;m having a hard time adjusting.  The plates get much hotter than I am used to even when set on the same temperature setting.  When touching my hair after running the iron through it, it is extremely hot and I have burned my hands.  This also makes me worry about how much hotter it is on my hair and if it is causing more damage.  Because of this I use it at a lower heat setting than usual.  With the plates being longer and hotter I have also burned my fingers on the plates directly several times.  The end and sides of the unit get extremely hot and it is difficult to avoid touching them.  I also puersonally am not noticing much as far as decreased frizz.  I always have frizzy flyaways and this iron targeting that was the main reason I got it.  I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  I still end up using a little lotion on my hands or hair spray to tame down some of the frizz.  The weather hasn&#x27;t been humid yet but I am anxious to see how it will work then.  It claims to keep hair frizz free even in humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, it is nowhere near as great as my previous Remington flat iron but it is better than other cheap units I have used.  I guess many of my issues I will just have to get used to.  I will have to work on my hand placement and things so I am not burning myself constantly.  While I like the shine I get with these infused plates, I&#x27;m not noticing any difference in frizz reduction.  It makes me wonder how the related shine therapy flat iron compares.</li>
    <li> I am a Remington user, never complain about this product; I replace Remington Wet 2 Straight Slim Plate Wet/Dry, which is more expensive, for this new model; I really like the feeling while doing my hair, it feels more soft and less frizzy, it heats up really quick. Totally worth the change.</li>
    <li> this is THE flat iron to use. bought my mother 4 of these because she wants them forever lol</li>
    <li> The floating plates on this make this straightener better than others I have tried. It heats super fast and works great.</li>
    <li> It work very well and faster than the old one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had my Remington S8500 (which I loved dearly) for 4 years or so when I dropped it and it broke, so I bought this &amp;#34;newer model&amp;#34; as a replacement. I read reviews online, but bought it at a local store. This flat iron is okay, but it&#x27;s not perfect. Here&#x27;s a comparison of the two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of the box, this iron just wasn&#x27;t as smooth. It&#x27;s not rough, just not as smooth as I would expect a brand spanking new iron to be. My S8500 didn&#x27;t start snagging until I&#x27;d had it for about 3 years, and even then it was bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron doesn&#x27;t beep when it&#x27;s reached the set temperature. My S8500 did. Neither took a very long time to heat up, but it would be nice to not be left wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I NEED a heat protection product when using this iron. I know heat protection is always recommended with any styling tool, but my S8500 would hold me down in a pinch. With this newer model, if I don&#x27;t use something, you can definitely tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the buttons are now in a place where they won&#x27;t be pushed by accident. Also, there&#x27;s a clip at the base that easily holds the iron closed when not in use (The S8500 had one, too, but it was a dial that was hard to operate). Overall, this a great choice for a flat iron. It has all the standard features you expect, like floating plates (plural), a swivel cord, and attractive design, and the quality that the Remington brand is known for. I&#x27;ve loved every Remington iron I&#x27;ve ever bought...save for one (not this one).</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!!!! I am a hair novice and never put any thought into a hair straitner but I wanted one that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair strait and staticy and which defeats the purpose of a hair straitner so I bought this one and so far love that it is infused with a conditioner and have had no problems like some with the heat adjustment sensor my hair looks fab now....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your wondering I have long hair down to my but and it takes less than 10 minutes from start to finish, my hair is coarse and heavy in-between thin and thick (Native American Hair)....</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this product I was so excited to get it and I was not disappointed! It gets hot very quickly and generally only takes one pass over my hair to get it straight. (However, I would recommend doing sections of hair because it is a small flat iron). It is also the perfect size to make great, loose curls! I love the LED display; it makes it really easy to increase or decrease the temperature quickly. I also really love the lock feature, so that fingers and such can&#x27;t get between the hot plates. After THE FIRST USE I noticed my hair was softer and smoother and I credit that to the ceramic oil-treated plates. This was a great product at a great price! I would definitely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> It was okay for me, I was replacing an iron I bought from folica. I paid 100 dollars for it and my aunts dog chewed the cord. Had the iron for 3 years....tried this on a whim and the first time my hair came out great. After that, my hair was just decent....ended up giving the iron away and buying a nume iron which honestly isnt much better and I payed 70 dollars on sale....Going to go back to folica and treat myself to barbar or something work taking the risk. I am an African American with a weird texture of hair, my hair isn&#x27;t loose curls nor is it course, so too much heat is as bad as someone using not enough heat.</li>
    <li> fast heating but frizz is still a problem</li>
    <li> This hot iron was wonderful...when it worked. From the beginning, it would randomly shut off. Sometimes it would shut off after only 5 minutes, and other times it would last maybe about 15 minutes. Usually, I would have to continuously start it back up again. Eventually, it just stopped working all together, and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on, after only about 3 months of use. I loved the way that it made my hair shine when it did work, but it wasn&#x27;t reliable, and then just stopped working, so I had to buy a different straightener.</li>
    <li> I adore this flat iron!! It straightens my semi-curly hair with one slow pass, yet still manages to make it look naturally straight. It seems to do everything it says it does, it&#x27;s been great during this humid summer. One reviewer said she regularly got a couple strands of hair caught in it, it has happened to me too but I&#x27;m a bit more careful now and I still gave it 5 stars because it is SO far superior to every other flat iron I&#x27;ve owned. I was seriously surprised by how amazing it is and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This straightener heats very quickly and gets your hair very very straight! The only thing is that it is a little pinchy and hair damaging. I bought this because my solia broke, and before that I have had chi and sedu straighteners. I will say that this is good for the price, and I would recommend it as a straightener for under $50, but if you&#x27;re willing to spend the extra money the other ones I&#x27;ve had are much much better on the hair</li>
    <li> I have been natural (no perms) for about 18 months now and lately I&#x27;ve been having difficulty managing my hair especially the frizz.  I have even thought about going back to perms.  I recently found out about this flat iron and purchased it because of the great reviews it has and this has changed my natural hair life!!!  I&#x27;m so in love with this flat iron.  The first time I straighten my hair was about a week ago and it&#x27;s still straight, smooth &amp; shiny!  No frizz whatsoever.  I will never use another heating tool besides this one again!</li>
    <li> This is not a dual voltage flat iron, as advertised. And when I contacted the company regarding this issue and on how to return it I received no response. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> So yeah, I have frizzy hair. And... I pretty much gave up on it years ago. Then I spotted this item and thought, well, maybe it could help?  And the answer is: very much so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good looking iron. I like the temperature display. It&#x27;s a little awkward to set down -- it&#x27;s lightweight with a small, slick \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; and a fairly long heavy cord, so it kind of wants to slide around. Be careful with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the plate edges do have a little bit of a gap that can catch hair. I imagine if you&#x27;re working with real curls it would be especially bad. If I choose a small enough section of hair and work slowly, I can avoid getting caught in the edges, but it takes some effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; coating on the plate does much more then another flat iron would, but my very-prone-to-frizz hair stayed nice and smooth, even in very high humidity (we&#x27;re talking fog), so it certainly seems effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will take a bit of practice to use well. I really like when I can get a little curl at the ends. Now I need to go get a nice haircut to take advantage of this iron!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this flat iron!  My hair has never gotten snagged in this flat iron, which is a plus!  The nice, smooth edges next to the floating plates help in styling ends or doing curls.  I also feel like the edges that surround the heated plates help guard against burns when I&#x27;m working around my face. This flat iron heats up very quickly and can go all the way to 450 degrees.  It gets my hair nice and smooth and keeps the frizzies away.  I love the locking feature, as I really like to be able to lock the flat iron closed for storage.  The swivel cord is a great feature, especially if you&#x27;re wanting to do curls. This flat iron works fabulously without an outrageous price.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick, long hair that tends to get frizzy and \\&quot;puffy\\&quot; when its humid.She&#x27;s constantly fighting it. This staightener doesn&#x27;t just straighten hair, it makes her hair looks markedly better. Her hair is definitely smoother, shinier, fuller, so much better than any other straightener we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I purchase this almost a year ago. While there are some great things about it (gets really hot, straightens nicely, nice size, etc) that is all negated by the fact that the on/off button SUCKS!!! Sometimes I have to press it 10 times or more to get it to turn on or off. I&#x27;ve tried holding it down briefly, holding it down for a couple seconds and holding it down for a while. It makes no difference! And this happens every friggin time I try to turn it on and every friggin time I try to turn it off. SO not worth the good things about it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. . It does exactly what it says it does. . My hair doesn&#x27;t look damaged anymore love love this best iron I&#x27;ve bought. .I always have used chi or Paul Mitchell flat irons this one in my opinion is way better</li>
    <li> Great straightener and great price! Recommend this product to anyone, better than conair or those unnecessarily expensive hair products they sell in malls (my sister bought one before and it was okay but didn&#x27;t last too long).</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low, using various products trying to tame my hair (which gets frizzy if it even hears the word humid).  I have been using Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Straight Shampoo and Conditioner, which are excellent for straightening/calming hair, but they are so expensive (and my hair seems to develop an immunity to them with continued usage).  So, I decided to try this Frizz Therapy flat iron and am SO happy I did.  My hair actually looks nice and calm (no frizzy flyaways) after using it.  I do apply a heat protectant to my hair before using AND dry my hair as straight as possible (using only my hand).  I can go over my hair with this flat iron at night and then put in big, hot rollers in the morning (for a little body).  And, for added body, I apply hair powder directly to my roots (which gives volume and hold).  I will definitely continue to use this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  In less than 5 minutes, she has straight hair.  It seems well built and will hopefully last a while.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend liked this flat iron and I liked the fact that as forgetful as she is I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it burning down the apartment.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Remington products especially the flat irons! and they will last longer than the $200.00 fancy, but lame,  flatirons @ the mall. don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. I really like the way the no frizz special therapy really works with my curly, course, kinky, thick hair!</li>
    <li> This pretty baby blue flat iron is not just lovely but performs beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It instantly smooths frizz and unruly hair and adds a beautiful sheen. It contains micro-conditioners that keep it smooth and glossy for fifteen hours, which is a very long time for frizz prone hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the side of the unit are the \\&quot;lock\\&quot; and \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; symbols. Also on the side are the controls for raising and lowering heat temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED display is a beautiful, brilliant blue,  which is very clear and visible to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent flat iron and I highly recommend it to those who need longer lasting protection from frizz.</li>
    <li> Remington flat irons perform better than Conair and Revlon irons - some of which are comparably priced. This iron has the same positive features.&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic coating makes the iron snag free unlike some others with thinner coating that catch hair. The swivel head helps with the maneuvering. It heats up quickly and evenly and maintains heat, the digital LCD is nice as it tells you the temperature. It also beeps when it reaches the correct temperature and shuts off after 60 minutes for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straightening irons are best used on almost dry hair, and this one is no exception. Spraying some heat resistant products also helps prevent damage to your hair but if you have very thin hair you will have to pick the product carefully, and spray just a little as the frizz reducers in this iron can almost make your hair too limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington iron 1 inch size is nice if you want to create flat iron curls. It also makes it easy to work with being less bulky. We used the Remington S9500 model with the pearl infused plates before this one - and although this iron is better for frizzy hair my daughter prefers the other one as it has more &#x27;glide&#x27; due to pearl infusion. It is also more rounded on the front, making it more convenient for her specially when she does the hair on the front. However, I like the frizz reducing feature of this particular model.</li>
    <li> I loved how my hair looked after I used this straightener, but the smell it left behind was unbearable. It also curled my hair perfectly and the curls lasted all day, but so did the stink! My hair smelled for a week or so after I used this Remington straightener. Eventually I left my conditioner on my hair for an hour before rinsing it which is what got rid of most of the smell. The first time I washed my hair after using this flat iron it smelled like skunk all night. My husband asked me the next morning \\&quot;did you smell that skunk last night?\\&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t a skunk, it was my hair! I used it a couple more times before I decided that the awful smell wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has so many five and four star reviews, that I&#x27;m thinking maybe only certain types of hair have a reaction to the ceramic plates. I returned it with a heavy heart because it was the first hair straightener that actually left my hair looking exactly the way I wanted it. Now I am testing the [[ASIN:B0009PVV4A Conair CS31TP Infiniti Instant Heat Pure Ceramic 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron]]. It&#x27;s not as good as the Remington, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stink!</li>
    <li> It worked amazingly - while it worked. Unfortunately I only had the Remington S8510DS Flat Iron, Frizz Therapy, for about 1 month. Shortly after I purchased it, I noticed that it was becoming harder and harder to switch it on. I would have to push the button in at a certain angle, or pray, or both, to get it to turn on. Soon after it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Period. Had to throw it out. Was a shame, really. While it was working it worked very well, but I&#x27;m sad to say it was put together rather poorly.</li>
    <li> I like this iron more than Chi brands. hits fast and goes smooth on your hair. you should lower your expectations however about the Frizz, you still get them if you don&#x27;t use anti-frizz hair products. If you use them the results with this iron are awesome.</li>
    <li> After a week  of using it.the.flat iron completely stopped working it wouldnt turn on at all so I had to return it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the nicest flat iron I have owned.  Great price as well.  I would recommend this flat iron</li>
    <li> This is my first ever Amazon review, though I&#x27;ve been reading Amazon reviews for many years. This product just blew my mind to the point that I felt I couldn&#x27;t NOT write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, very wavy, thick, frizz-prone hair. I used to have to very tediously blow dry my hair straight and then spend 30+ minutes with my old straightening iron to get it smooth and straight. And then a bit of wave would come back an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, NO MORE! I thought I would have to spend $100+ to get a salon quality straightener, but the reviews for this one convinced me to give it a try. Best $35 I have ever spent on my hair. What I love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ It heats up very quickly. Less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ The digital temperature gauge is awesome. This is the future, people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ It glides right through my hair with no pulling, but enough tension to really grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Only ONE PASS needed to get hair straight. I couldn&#x27;t believe this - it used to take me at least 2 or 3 passes through each section of hair to get it straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now get super straight, smooth, silky hair (salon quality) in 5 - 10 minutes. This is MIND-BLOWING, especially for a mom like me. 30 minutes to straighten hair? Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that. And my hair was really struggling because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$35 later, my hair looks awesome. No more frizzy mom hair here!</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this. Much cheaper than somewhere like Ulta, with just as much quality. Heats up within 30 seconds, no pulling hairs either!</li>
    <li> The best flat iron!  I&#x27;ve had two of these in the last ten years, they last for a really long time.  My hair is naturally curly, I blow dry it and use this to straighten or curl to style.  The curved blades allow for big dramatic curls or simple spirals.  Of course this flat iron also straightens my hair wonderfully, keeping it shiny and not dull at all.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of straighteners that have cost so much money so I was a little skeptical about purchasing this one but since I had a Gift Card if figured I should. WOW WOW I tried it on my sisters hair first and it came out super straight and didnt break any hair! I tried it on my hair which is really really curly and frizzy and my hair was super straight. My sister purchased one too after trying mine.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Heats super fast, makes my hair smooth and shiny! Very easy to clean. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> What I love the most about this flat iron is that it doesn&#x27;t snag your hair. However: to me the iron works best on relaxed hair versus natural: while it would still lay the hair, I noticed it was a little rougher and I had to do more passes as with relaxed hair I&#x27;d only done 1-2 passes tops. Either way: I would still recommend anyone to try this product out!</li>
    <li> I have the thickest, frizziest, and crazy hair ever! With my old wet 2 straight Remington it took 20 minutes to straighten my hair and it still looks poofy. With this iron, it took me only 10 minutes and it looked 10x better. It actually gets my hair straight and flat! I love this, it&#x27;s a beast.</li>
    <li> I have owned a basic Chi straightener for eight years. I started to notice it damaging my hair, and later discovered that the plates must be wearing out, so I started doing research on straighteners and came across phenomal reviews for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this Remington one, I can see feel the difference in quality (Remington&#x27;s is definitely lower than Chi), but I can also see how old and worn out my Chi has become. It squeaks, doesn&#x27;t press down well, and burns my hair, after eight years. Hopefully this Remington lasts a long time too. As of now, it definitely helps with frizz, it straightens very evenly, and leaves a nice shine. It gets hot very fast, and goes up to 450 degrees. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it sometimes yanks my hair. That never happened to me with my Chi. I will update this review in about a year to report on how it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Good item. My granddaughter uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used! Leaves my thick wavy hair silky smooth! Every women who uses a flat iron should have this. I&#x27;ve even bought it for friends as gifts and they all swear by it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my current flat iron died. I knew I wanted a ceramic flat iron and also one that did not snag my hair. I got an Amazon gift card for a Christmas and decided to give this one a whirl! It is fantastic. It heats up quickly, my hair does not get caught on the edges, and it straightens with ease. I am able to get my hair done within 20 minutes and it does not need to be blown dry prior to using this like my old one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: African American fine and curly and color treated. It&#x27;s amazing on my ends and I have to use very little product to keep it looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product. Heats up quickly and is fairly idiot-proof.</li>
    <li> The Remington Shine Therapy does a fine job for ladies with short to medium-length hair but ladies with long hair would do well to try a 1 ½-inch flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A frizz-resistant conditioner called Argan are infused into the Moroccan ceramic floating plates to condition and protect the hair from humidity while being straightened. The Argan micro-conditioner is said to last the lifetime of the device to produce desired results without oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron quickly heats up to 450 degrees in only 30 seconds, features an instant turn-off, and automatic shut-off after 60 minutes - no more trips back home to see whether you turned off your flat iron or not. It has a digital temperature gauge that is very easy to read. My wife especially enjoyed the swivel chord but felt the flat iron tipped over too easily when laid down on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reasonable price at $50 so the user gets good value for their money.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick, wavy hair. Usually I wash and wear but sometimes I want to wear it straight. Usually my hair takes over an hour to straighten so I never really bother and only do it once in a blue moon. I was surprised at how awesome this product is. Over the years I have used many different straightener trying to find the one that really did the job. While I doubt my hair will ever be pin straight this is the closest it has ever come to being straight and it took me only 25 minutes. The iron heats up before you are ready to go. Very fast, only 1 inch but really powerful. LOVE it. You will always have hair falling as you straighten because basically you are heating the hair and hair can easily break especially hair like mine which is dry and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And because of the design, I have yet to burn my hair. Woot! That right there is one of the best parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair wasn&#x27;t pin straight but the frizz was controlled. Great product. Great price</li>
    <li> The Remington Frizz Therapy Flat Iron is totally amazing! First of all, it gives a finished result that actually lasts for two days. For me, that is completely unexpected. No touch-ups required, just fluff and go! Also, it gets pretty darn hot, but you don&#x27;t have to take it to the max to get those perfect results -- as a matter of fact, I don&#x27;t recommend it. After all, hair is hair and over-styling can cause damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have to say that the conditioner built into this iron leaves an excellent result, despite the fact that I don&#x27;t understand how it works. The proof is in the style the iron can produce. It is quite easy to work with -- the swivel cord is an added plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a new flat iron for yourself or for a gift, this Remington Frizz Therapy Iron is certainly one that will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> This iron is totally worth the money I spent on it. I wish I had not bought my old iron.</li>
    <li> I gave this a neutral review because I am required to review it, but didn&#x27;t receive the product. Instead, I received two of the Remington Flat Iron Shine Therapy which I liked very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could&#x27;ve helped, but Amazon made a shipping mistake.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works well for my hair, but it&#x27;s not life-changing.  I&#x27;m Black and have 4a/4b natural hair which I generally wear straight.  The best flat iron I have ever used is the standard GHD straightener.  The GHD gets my hair straight with one pass per section and never creates smoke or the burning smell that many other flat irons do.  However, the GHD is out of my price range for the time being, so when I found a couple of reviews from people saying they got similar results with this one, I decided to try it out.  Like I said, it does work well, I like the digital temperature controls and it&#x27;s easy to create a bend at the end of my hair or a loose spiral curl.  My only complaint is that it does require multiple passes to get my hair completely straight.  After one pass, I can still see some of my natural curls and the hair is a little puffy, especially at the ends.  It can also be kind of difficult to get very close to my roots, but I have a smaller 1/4&amp;#34; flat iron that I generally use for that anyway.  I honestly can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in terms of frizz control, but my hair is naturally very susceptible to frizz.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love it... espeically for the price. This leaves my hair flat &amp; smooth just as if I just got it done at the salon.</li>
    <li> This straightener is exactly what I was looking for!!! It really does help with minimizing frizz, turns off automatically after one hour, heats up SO FAST, it&#x27;s just wonderful! And my hair actually stays straight all day!</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s assessment. She finds the iron good on all the details of design, style, operation (especially the fast warm up) and quality. What makes it stand out is that it leaves her hair feeling and looking better than the other aids she was used. Her comment is that she can&#x27;t see anything providing a better result.</li>
    <li> This by far my favorite hair appliance!  It does a beautiful job on my hair and there isn&#x27;t anywhere on the straightener  that catches my hair, like my last one did.  The smooth plate makes my hair glide right through and comes out smooth and straight.  Though the price is a bit high it is far better than other ones I have had so I feel like it will last a long time.  It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Exactly as promised</li>
    <li> This statement from the product description is false:  &amp;#34;This anti-frizz flat iron also features worldwide voltage so there&#x27;s no need to skimp on your style routine whether you&#x27;re home or abroad.&amp;#34;  If you plugged this into a 220v outlet with an adaptor, you&#x27;d overheat it and probably burn it out.  You&#x27;d need a converter to use it, but who wants to drag one of those along on a vacation.  I wrote to Amazon after I received this flat iron to tell them that it does not indicate it can be used with 220v, only 110v.  I don&#x27;t know why the statement is still there.  Other than that, I&#x27;m satisfied with the flat iron.  It straightens my hair like another one that I had (and lost, unfortunately).</li>
    <li> I love this iron!!, it&#x27;s my second one (my daughter took over my 1st one).the best one I&#x27;ve found . It heats up quick and straightens easily.</li>
    <li> This straightener does a great job! It makes my hair very soft and shiny. The only problem, which is a deal breaker for me, is that it pulls out my hair very badly. It has caused my hair to have fly aways and major breakage. Upset about the straightener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to my natural hair and my hair looks like I have a perm after using this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. It heats up fast. I&#x27;m not a daily straightener so I&#x27;m not a good source to talk about how well it holds up.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. My only complaint is that the cord is not long enough.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron a month ago and have used several times. It&#x27;s works great, i&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I love how hot this iron gets, but it has been snagging my hair lately. There looks to be a gap between the plates and the handle towards the bottom of the iron.</li>
    <li> I got this straightner about a year ago for christmas. And i completely fell inlove with it. It works amazing!! So one day my bestfriend came over and wanted me to do her hair so i did. And she completely fell inlove with the way her hair came out. She took pictures and all. Even of the straightner. So i had to buy it for her. She loves it. Also the shipping was amazing. Came way faster then expected. I was a happy camper as far as shipping. Bcuz it came exactly the day before christmas eve, need i mind you this was my bestfriend christmas gift, so it was perfect. The expected date was actually the following week after Christmas so i was very happy it came whrn it came. And my bestfriend was very happy with this straightner. Would definitely reccoment to anyone. I wouldnt go different to be honest. Out of all straightners ive had this one has met all my expectations! Amazing product</li>
    <li> The flat iron heats up very quickly and evenly but I don&#x27;t know if it actually helps with frizz because it doesn&#x27;t seem to. I like that flat iron regardless though although I&#x27;m worried about how it will hold out over time. Very good flat iron though it does just about everything it said it would.</li>
    <li> I received the Remington S8510DS last week, and have been using it every day.&lt;br /&gt;The iron is nicely built, although the only beef I have is that it is difficult&lt;br /&gt;to lay the iron on my counter without it flopping over, although it does have a&lt;br /&gt;swivel cord base.&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up very quickly, indicating readiness when its light stops flashing.&lt;br /&gt;It gets quite hot, although the temperature setting is changeable. Mine is set at 370F.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it gets so hot that I think it&#x27;s possible to almost burn yourself by touching&lt;br /&gt;just ironed hair! Even so, my hair stays soft and does not feel fried, which it sometimes does with the other irons.&lt;br /&gt;Although I have two other flat irons, a 2\\&quot; and a 1/2\\&quot; width, the 1\\&quot; seems to be the preferred width for styling.&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in this particular iron because of the \\&quot;frizz therapy\\&quot;. Living in Florida, frizz&lt;br /&gt;is a constant companion.&lt;br /&gt;This is also the only one of the irons that will actually straighten my hair. It also seems to&lt;br /&gt;get rid of frizz for me, which is wonderful, since none of the anti-frizz products do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;After washing I blow my hair dry, then use the flat iron quickly to style my hair. This iron does a&lt;br /&gt;fabulous job and allows me to get my hair exactly as I want it.&lt;br /&gt;I see that one reviewer mentioned a bad odor on her hair after suing this iron, but I do not have any&lt;br /&gt;kind of odor issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this flat iron and highly recommend it, especially if you have wavy dry hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;My style stays in quite well, and lasts longer, too.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have to wash my hair every day now, which is good since I have dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Straightens my really curly hair pretty quick but it still frizzes up a bit. Still one of the best straighteners you could buy at this price.</li>
    <li> The transaction took forever, but once it shipped it got to me fast. Product works wonderful, easy to use... the lock to close it once im done is a plus. Overall great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Remington wide \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; for the past year and enjoyed that iron.  The wide plates were silky smooth with the infused pearl in them.  Unfortunately, that one died last month and I was left scrambling to find a suitable replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several friends recommended the \\&quot;Frizz Therapy\\&quot; flat iron so I decided to give it a try.  I don&#x27;t necessarily have \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair, but it is really thin and susceptible to frizzing during the day due to humidity variances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial first impression is that the plates were even SMOOTHER than the pearl iron.  It must be the coating that they put on the plates, but they simply glide through my hair like no other iron I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly (less than 20 secs) and the temperature gauge is easily to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that the 1\\&quot; was going to be able to keep up with my 2\\&quot; iron I just came from, but it has and I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional time requirements in getting ready.  The exterior also has a \\&quot;textured grip\\&quot; which I like a lot better than my Chi and the wide plate iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOWNSIDE:&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things I would like to see changed.  First, there is no audible beep when the iron reaches the temperature.  I typically do a lot of different things when getting ready and an audible tone is a nice reminder.  Also, buttons are right in the area of the grip of my fingers and I have accidentally hit the power button on several occasions when clamping down on the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-SMOOTH, SMOOTH, SMOOTH&lt;br /&gt;-Small form factor&lt;br /&gt;-Quick heat&lt;br /&gt;-Hand guards don&#x27;t get hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t beep when it&#x27;s ready...it only flashes.&lt;br /&gt;-Buttons (incl. power) can be accidentally pressed when ironing</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it more than she thought she would.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Long cord&lt;br /&gt;*Digital display&lt;br /&gt;*Wide range of heating temperatures&lt;br /&gt;*Iron plate is smooth/hair doesn&#x27;t snag&lt;br /&gt;*Straightens well and quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Can&#x27;t lock the plates together for safety&lt;br /&gt;*Flips over easily when you set it on the counter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve reviewed several flat irons from Amazon now and this is one of my favorites.  It&#x27;s a good value and will do just as good a job as some of the more expensive irons.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was ok for the price, but after about 5 uses it started to work opposite. Instead of making my hair smooth it was making them so frizzy, very dry looking. I had to apply bunch of products and none of them could kill the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Each time I&#x27;ve tried it got worse, maybe defective, maybe some coating came off, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for fine highlighted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes hair straight with no problems, heats up quite fast, has a temperature controller and it&#x27;s not heavy/bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried GHD Candy flat iron/ styler and it smoothed my hair instantly with 1 stroke. There is only 1 temperature setting, which I like and it heats up in 2 seconds, smaller, sleeker and fun color. Expensive but makes my hair look good.</li>
    <li> I have very long (all the way down my back) and thin, straight hair. I have had Chi brand straightners and the cheapie Revlon brands too. Since my hair is already very straight, I have been fine with either one. This one, however, has worked extremely well compared to any of the other brands I have used. My long hair doesn&#x27;t snag on the plates and it makes my hair nice and shiny, especially when I use it with a heat styling protector spray. This straightner does the flat iron curls really nicely as well... Just as well as a Chi does them in my opinion. I love the digital display and it shows that the flat iron is heating up by flashing until it is at the desired temperature. Ofcourse, I think the big test for any straightner is how long it will last...since I&#x27;ve only been using this one for a few weeks, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know what it&#x27;s stamina is, but I will let you know!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to the Flat Iron. I just got a haircut and the stylist used a flat iron on my bangs. It looked really good, so I was excited to have the opportunity to review a flat iron. I have cowlicks on my bangs, and in just a few seconds this straightens the bangs. I don&#x27;t mind the curl in the rest of my hair, but I like the look of the straight bangs. I&#x27;m not sure that my hair looks as good as the picture, but at the end of the day, they still look pretty good. I have received compliments on my hair, when I use this, something unusual for me. I don&#x27;t notice any smell. I always remember to unplug it after use, but I noticed that it has a safety shut off after an hour.  I have nothing to compare this too, but I have to say, I&#x27;m very happy with the Remington S8510DS Flat Iron.</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron!  The heat is adjustable up to 450 which is essential for different hair types.  It heats up very quickly, closes completely so that one hand operation is an option, is fairly light to hold and has large plate surface area.</li>
    <li> Is a great product . My older daughter was well pleased with it !</li>
    <li> Love it.  This is my second Remington curling iron, and the second one I&#x27;ve really enjoyed.  (I also have and like the remington  [[ASIN:B003V249L0 Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch]] )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This performs very well.  I find that I need a lower heat setting with this iron than I typically choose.  Heats quicking and uniformly.  It has a nice weight in the hand.  Those the plates of this flat iron are equal in width to the above listed product, the overall size and heft is slightly larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major plus: GOOD FOR CREATING CURLS.  I feel that creating curls with a flat iron is actually much more simple and do-able with this product than any other flat iron I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to lock the iron closed for travel as well (though it&#x27;s a big large to choose for travel when space is at a premium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1)  It doesn&#x27;t remember the last heat setting.  When turned on, it automatically choose a middle heat setting.  It would be nice if it went to the setting you last used.&lt;br /&gt;2)  I&#x27;m not sure why, but I have a small issue with the power button.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s slightly recessed or that it requires slightly atypical pressure, but I find that sometimes I *think* I&#x27;ve turned it on, only to find that I haven&#x27;t pressed the power button hard enough.</li>
    <li> I always use an iron of somesort on my hair (just prefer my hair straight in contrast to the natural wave that I have). I previously had used the Remington Shine Therapy model so I thought I would compare the Frizz Therapy to it. I actually prefer the S8510DS Frizz therapy iron over the Shine therapy. I find my hair to be sleek and looks like it was keratin conditioned every time I use it. I love the way my hair shines. If I had any complaint at all it would be in the 1\\&quot; size. I have previously used 1.5 and 2 inch irons and I feel they are easier to use for me. But all in all, the Remington Frizz Therapy is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have pretty spiral-ly curls that get frizzy easily.  This straightener worked well - didn&#x27;t take too long to straighten, and after I was done, I didn&#x27;t experience any frizz the rest of the day.  Remington straighteners work very well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m REALLY into my hair.  It&#x27;s long, thick, and curly with a tendency to frizz in humid weather.  I usually straighten it so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m stuck in an &#x27;80s big hair band.  I was eager to try this \\&quot;frizz therapy\\&quot; flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice weight and design, with a digital readout so you can select the proper heat setting.  The default is 370 degrees, but can go as high as 450.  The first time I tried it at 370 and wowza--I couldn&#x27;t even touch my hair after I passed the straightener over a section, it was that burning hot.  You&#x27;d have to be crazy to use a flat iron at this temperature or higher(!).  Turning it down to 300 was plenty hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron got my hair super-straight and shiny and it lasted all day.  However, it was not a humid day, so it wasn&#x27;t a fair test.  I tried it the next time when the humidity was higher.  Did it \\&quot;provide up to 65 percent less frizz all day--even in humid conditions?\\&quot;  Nah.  I got the same old frizz I always get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also boasts of \\&quot;micro-conditioners\\&quot; that magically come out of the plates (forever) and onto your hair for conditioning benefits.  Um.  Seriously?  I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates make an off-putting scraping sound as they pass down the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know this sounds like a lot of negatives, but I still think this is a good iron in a mid-price range.  It gets the hair straight and you can control the heat settings--two major pluses.  The anti-frizz claim did not pan out for me, but since no iron prevents my frizzies in humid weather, this straightener is no worse than any others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for \\&quot;the best\\&quot; flat iron, I highly recommend [[ASIN:B0009V1YR8 Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron]].  Have never found anything better, and as of this writing, it seems to be heavily discounted (I paid about $120 for mine).</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve used, so I&#x27;m not an expert.  But this does a really good job of straightening my hair and keeping it straight between washes. I have it in a medium setting (to try to avoid overheating my hair) and most times it will work on the first pass (needing a second one if my hair isn&#x27;t perfectly dry).  I don&#x27;t have very curly hair, but frizz is a concern, and as stated, my hair remains straight even with humidity, sleeping, working out, etc after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a strong &#x27;new ceramic&#x27; smell that I&#x27;ve noticed with other ceramic plate items in the past, but I&#x27;ve never noticed it transferred to my hair and it is dissipating the longer the iron is used.  I would definitely recommend this iron compared to the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve seen out there. It heats up very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Give a nice silky texture. Durable straightening  Also my hair started to look better just at natural style. Higher temperature can get very very hot so be careful in thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Let me tell yall something this flat iron right here is really everything... When you have natural here in Florida humidity and you try to straighten it with the regular flat iron it will frizz up,  but when I straighten my hair with this iron my hair was gorgeous.  Humidity had nothing on my hair. My hair stayed straight for at least three weeks despite going to the gym.  Any black girl who wants their natural hair to be straightened out without paying the salon price this is the go to flat iron.</li>
    <li> Initially the straightener worked well and left me with straight, smooth hair. It beat out my previous Remington straightener in the frizz department and really left me with frizz-free hair through a whole day, even in the middle of a humid summer. But... I purchased in June and started having problems in September with the straightener shutting off in the middle of use shortly after heating. It does this multiple times even after restarting. It also has gotten hair caught in the corners of the plates and straightener and pulls these hairs out. The problems have gotten worse with use. I&#x27;d understand if this was a few years down the line, but only a few months? Not sure if it&#x27;s an individual defect or affects all models.</li>
    <li> My heart broke when my $130 GMJ vibrating flat iron stopped working. It was the only flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used and I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find anything comparable without spending even more money. I mean how many flat irons do you know of that vibrate? I looked at all the expensive brands like CHI and GHD, but read so many reviews about how these also stop working after awhile. Money is tight, so I decided to take my chances with this Remington S8510DS flat iron and WOW!!! I cannot believe this flat iron straightens my hair even better than my GMJ one and at a fraction of the cost. I have wavy hair that loves to curl up at even the smallest hint of water. I noticed with my GMJ iron that I had to constantly fix my hair throughout the day, but not anymore. This flat iron not only gets my hair pin straight in just two passes, but it stays straight for days through humidity and rain. It also makes my hair incredibly soft. My hair has literally never felt softer. I barely have to brush it now. It must be the conditioners in the plates. Thank you Remington for such a wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because one of my friends had it and it always did a good job on her hair. For the way it makes the hair look, I thought it would be an expensive flat iron, but thats not the case at all. Great price and quality!</li>
    <li> it works but it really doesn&#x27;t tame the frizzies for long</li>
    <li> Okay, I have difficult hair.  It is thin, but it is very frizzy and requires a lot of strokes in order to get the job even part way done.  I tried this because I am tired of spending $200.00 or even $100.00 on flat irons that work, but damage my hair and are just way expensive!  I have only used this once, but my hair was finished within ten minutes...and it is more silky than I have ever felt it in my life!  My most recent flat iron was a T3 wet to dry iron.  It worked great for the first couple of months, but I NEVER got the silk that this iron has given me!  I had to purchase a new iron only because a prong broke on my T3 after like 2 years of use...and I was upset that it broke, but now I am thrilled because my hair feels like a little girls hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is UNBEATABLE!  The results are seriously AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> Literally obsessed with this thing. I will admit that after owning it for awhile (a few months) it does smell a bit weird, which sometimes transfers to the hair..but it&#x27;s still worth it. I have very curly hair and have owned many straighteners (chi, HSI, global beauty), all of which are more expensive, but this one is by far the best. i only have to go over each section of hair once with it, and all of my friends have curly hair and own this as well. We joke about it being the best straightener for so cheap but it really is amazing. you will not be disappointed if you buy this, i am very picky with my straighteners but would give this more than 5 stars if i could.</li>
    <li> I had an old Conair flat iron for years and I just never used it because it would take forever to heat up and sometimes never even to a reasonable temperature (it was a pretty cheap one, mind you, so I got what I paid for). I was watching all the Lightning Deals and snagged this one for $5-10 off. I love how heating up to 370 takes less than 30 seconds - HUGE time saver. I have long, somewhat thin hair and it gets caught in between the plates every once in a while, but not to the point where there&#x27;s pain or damage.</li>
    <li> I had been using a cheap, fat curling iron like a flat iron to give my roots lift and smooth out the hair.  When my curling iron broke I figured that I would buy a seemingly better product.  I used it today and what a waste of time!  It took several passes to get the hair with some style (and I have thin, fine hair).  Then, 10 minutes later all of the style was gone and now I have flat, raggedy hair hanging in my face all day.  I gave it 2 stars because it may just be that flat irons, in general, suck.  I&#x27;ll try one more time, but when I get home I am getting the packaging out of the recycling to return this thing!</li>
    <li> I gave it as a present so my daughter wouldnt have to schlep one iron back and forth on visits. She tells me this is a better iron than the one she had been using.</li>
    <li> Leaves my thick, coarse hair silky and bone straight! Performs better than any flat iron I have ever owned.  I highly recommend.  Just be sure to purchase a heat glove if you plan to grasp with two hands.</li>
    <li> I really like this iron and highly recommend it.  I already own a more high-end flat iron, and this one works just as well, if not better.  I think that the flattening technology is not just hype--it actually works.  While my hair stayed straighter all day, it did not stay perfectly straight and got a little frizzy when I sweated during a walk.  Overall, though, my hair still looks flat and I like using a good flat iron rather than getting keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron is lightweight and heats up almost instantaneously.  Buttons along the device&#x27;s side can be used to make it heat up more or less.  In furture models, however, I would suggest having either a carrier that keeps the two iron parts together and possibly even making a smaller version of the iron that can fit easily in a backpack or gym bag.  However, I think this device is great and that users will be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My daughter and my wife fight over these straightening irons.  They have both used this one and like it a lot.  My wife who has excessively curly hair has been able to straighten hers with ...well not ease, but better than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big question I&#x27;m finding about all electrical hair products is that they seem to have a short lifespan.  I can&#x27;t speak to that...check with me next year.  based on early results i recommend this product</li>
    <li> My wife really like it.  It controls the frizzies and wild hairs all day.  She is able to curl her hair also making it a great multitasker.  It heats up quickly and the heating elements are spring loaded so there is not a lot of extra stress or tension on the hair.  The temp read out is nice but the controls can be changed accidentally when in use.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter has thick, wavy hair that tends to have a mind of its own. She hates it and has been begging me for a flat iron for months. She is loving the Remington Flat Iron and uses it every day, even on the weekends when she doesn&#x27;t have school. It&#x27;s easy for her to use and she loves the results. She likes the swivel cord, the fast heating, and how the plates \\&quot;float\\&quot; so that it&#x27;s easier and quicker for her to straighten her hair in less passes. So far there has been minimal or no damage to her hair. She did get one small blister on the side of her index finger near the knuckle when she accidentally touched the heating plates but that&#x27;s more due to user error. She&#x27;s much more careful now. It&#x27;s a great flat iron and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different flat irons over the years and this is my favorite one of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron gets good and hot with precise temperature controls. I don&#x27;t understand the technology of the ceramic plates being infused with moisturizers, but I do know I like what it does to my hair. This iron makes my hair silky, shiny, and perfectly straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is really no comparing this Remington iron to the Conair and other brands they sell at drugstores and discount stores. This is in a MUCH higher class. I&#x27;ve used some of those cheap ones and they destroy my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned three Remington irons over the years, liked them all and if this one ever dies, I&#x27;ll buy another one just like it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t experience any &amp;#34;frizz therapy&amp;#34; from it, still&lt;br /&gt;had to use plenty of product to achieve no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bulky, and I have to be careful&lt;br /&gt;because it has a tendency to snag the hair.&lt;br /&gt;But, for the price,  it is still a good deal. It does straighten as well as a chi.</li>
    <li> I had the same straightener except I got it over 5 years ago from Target. I loved that straightener so much that I decided to buy the same one but a newer model which is this flat iron. I absolutely love it! Works even better than my old flat iron. I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible. I would recommend to anyone! Very good deal considering the price is so much lower than &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; ones. I tried a name brand one and it didn&#x27;t work as well as this one. It&#x27;s also nice to know that it will last me at least another 5 years.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Product as described!</li>
    <li> This is a very good flat iron for the price, much more expensive at other stores. Watch the temperature though because it will very easily burn your hair. I have thin fragile hair and even with heat protectant, it is very damaged now. Other than that it is fast, slides nicely, and has a long cord. I would definately recoment this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Have thick curly hair and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t start on :( I was so glad when I received it but it&#x27;s no working!</li>
    <li> super fast shipping. Best straightener on amazon!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron I went to empire beauty school and I used to swear my flat iron was the best well it broke and then I got this one im so glad my other one broke because I just BEST flat iron yet. Frizz controll for real. I got real frizzy wavy hair I used to flat iron and later in the day have to redo it again but not now since I got this  it does last all day and if ur not out doing anything my hair stayed frizz free and straight for two days if I don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.</li>
    <li> I love love love this hair straightener! It heats up in no time at all, and straightens my hair in just one go, leaving it shiny and sleek. With other hair straighteners, I&#x27;ve had to go over a section multiple times and they would pull at my hair. That is definitely not the case here! Even when I am in a rush, I am always able to quickly straighten out some misbehaving strands of hair, because it heats up and works so quickly. The screen flashes as it is heating up, which is incredibly useful for knowing when the straightener is ready to use. It also has a very convenient swivel cord to prevent tangling, and the hinge lock is great for storage. The buttons are located on the side and can be locked so I don&#x27;t accidentally change the heat settings while I am using it. My only complaint is that my hair will sometimes get caught in the cracks on the straightener right below the plates. I&#x27;m not too sure what I can do to prevent that, as they look to be part of the product design and are close enough to the plates that the area also gets hot.</li>
    <li> it does work... I used many flat irons before but this one is hands down one of the best... my hair is very puffy and wavy but the iron leave it super straight... love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and I live in florida so believe me that the anti frizz helps a lot  :-)</li>
    <li> Awesome absolutely love it! 10sec flat iron!</li>
    <li> I am a newbie to hair straightening, and this iron makes it easy and trouble-free.  It just does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Daughter says it does the job and is still working so what more can you expect. I guess it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazed by this hair straightener.  For the price you pay you are getting a product that should be worth double.  Quickly heats up, gets hot fast, stays hot, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and works in a single pass.  Far better than any drugstore brand hair straightener.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product after my old iron had a cord issue (don&#x27;t buy BioSilk irons!!).  It heats up instantly, and I like the different temperature buttons.  The sides of the iron do sometimes get caught in my hair, which can be uncomfortable.  Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with the &amp;#34;frizz therapy&amp;#34; feature the item claims to have. It does the job of a normal iron with a few extra features. Hopefully it lasts longer than a year!</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly, and does a great job smoothing out my very fine but very frizzy hair.  It doesn&#x27;t curl as well as my old one, but I&#x27;ll take the lack of frizz over that any day.  Love it so far!</li>
    <li> Excellent results however my hair iron does not turn the LED light as indicated in its case. Why not give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very impressed! I have course, hard-to-straighten hair, and like other reviewers said, this accomplished the task on just one pass. I was obsessed with it for the first week or so, but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same effect. I&#x27;m not sure if my hair has gotten used to it (is that even possible?) or if the microconditioners lose their potentcy, but it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as that first miraculous week. However, still a great flat iron and I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great - it heats up quickly and really makes my hair look good (while other irons I&#x27;ve used have left crimps where I first apply it or caused damage/frizziness).</li>
    <li> This product delivers everything it promises. It heats up quickly and at 390 degrees I am able to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife she is very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend after reading all of the positive reviews. She loves it. She hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it snagging hair, she likes the temperature display and now she prefers the Remington Frizz Therapy to her CHI straightening iron. The locking hinge (locks closed) is really nice for storage and travel, and it heats up very quickly. Frizz? None, but she hasn&#x27;t had any problem with frizz with her CHI either.  Overall, the Remington works better than the CHI and costs much less.  UPDATE: Two years later, and it still works great!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very good. Just as described. would recommend and my hair is very difficult and I have a lotof it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener!!  I have three other ones, but this one does the trick.  I have frizzy hair, and it does keep the frizz down, however, I do need to use de-frizz product to keep it semi-de-frizz for the day.  I love how I don&#x27;t have to constantly go over the hair a lot.  It takes about 2-3 strokes at the starting temp. and my hair is straight.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Very good Price.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron as a gift for my daughter about a year ago.  She has thick course brown hair.  She loves this tool!  The plates had a weird smell for maybe the first week but it went away quickly.  A few months later, I bought myself a Hot Tools titanium plate flat iron for about $20 more than what I paid for this one at the recommendation of a stylist at a store, and I really wish I&#x27;d just bought another one of these.  I have thick, wavy, bleached blonde hair.  I&#x27;m able to use a lower heat setting on this flat iron to get one-pass straightening.  I&#x27;ve also used a friend&#x27;s Chi, and I still like this one better.  The plates are still close together after a year and 3-4 days/wk of use and she&#x27;s had no problems with it.  As far as damage to the hair.....you&#x27;ll always need a heat protectant.  My daughter got really bad split ends using this without protectant, but that&#x27;s going to be true of all heat applications to your hair.  For the price and the low heat setting for one-pass straightening, I&#x27;d say this is one of the best flat irons you can buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered the S-9951 and instead received the S8510.  I didn&#x27;t even receive the latest model as advertised which is S8510DS.  Terribly disappointed.  I was willing to pay more for the S9951 on Amazon as I could not find the S9951 model retail.  I can find the S8510 locally and for a lower price!!  I paid for the S9951 not the  S8510.  Feel cheated.</li>
    <li> I needed a new flat iron and saw this one on sale for thirty dollars and went for it. I have a Remington blow dryer and epilator that I really like and both have lasted a long time. I love it!! I have a lot of long, wavy, fine hair, and the lowest setting works fine for me - in one pass its done. Heats up very fast. Button location is ideal - you can even lock it so the temp can&#x27;t change. Well made product!</li>
    <li> My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I curl it or flat iron it, before long it will go back to being fuzzy and wavy. Admittedly, I expect fantastic results in 5 minutes or less (yea, right.)  Anyway, this is a good flat iron at a good price.  It&#x27;s fairly lightweight, heats up remarkably quickly and has a good range of settings.  My hair was actually straight the next day and that is unusual.  My hair felt very nice - especially on day two.  (I believe that using a smoothing/conditioning balm when using any flat iron makes a huge difference in results.  I like K Pak Smoothing Balm.)  I have another Remington iron and I like them both.</li>
    <li> Goodbye Frizz...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair straightener creates a smooth and sleek look while reducing flyaway&#x27;s. The floating plates are ceramic to reduce heat damage and do not snag the hair as much as some other straighteners. I have fine hair so I only used the lowest heat setting but I&#x27;m sure this would also be perfect for thicker hair. In terms of the other features here is a list of the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Heat control up to 450 f&lt;br /&gt;* Fast heat up (30-60 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;* Finer hair seems more resistant to humidity and stays straight all day&lt;br /&gt;* Swivel cord allows for better movement during use&lt;br /&gt;* Long durable cord&lt;br /&gt;* Ergonomic design means on/off and temperature dials less likely to be pressed during use&lt;br /&gt;* Less Frizz and no static!&lt;br /&gt;* Superb handling and styling ability for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Slightly heavy to handle but this will probably make it more hard-wearing for straightening thicker hair styles</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair and I&#x27;m forever torn between straightening it and leaving it curly.  Of course, frizz is a huge factor in my life, and I hate straightening my hair just to have it all puffy and out of control an hour later.  I have used Remington straighteners before, so I already liked this brand and though I&#x27;d give this special \\&quot;Frizz Therapy\\&quot; one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It straightened by hair well enough, but I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything in particular for the frizz.  My hair was still frizzy about an hour later just like with my regular straightener.  I does a good job getting close to the hair line, so I like that feature, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great. I have the older model but left it in a hotel room (I almost cried when I realized it) so I bought this one and it&#x27;s even better.</li>
