      <li>(My favorite remains the Gillette Swedes.).  </li>
      <li>The Feathers are better for a day or two</li>
      <li>These are better than others I&#x27;ve been trying.  </li>
      <li>I have always had irritation from disposable razors and I tried many.  </li>
      <li>I love to save money, but what I love more is the close, non-irritating shave I get from this razor and these blades.    </li>
      <li>Get some Feather razor blades, must better.</li>
      <li>Though pricier, feather blades have suited me better.</li>

      <li>Way better than what you&#x27;d find at CVS</li>
      <li>There are better, sharper, quality razors out there</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s face, skin and shaving technique is different but those seem to work best for me.  </li>
      <li>Because these blades are so widely available, most men who begin using a double-edge safety razor use these blades.  </li>
      <li>These razor blades do the job just fine.  </li>
      <li>I used the Merkur Super blades for awhile, and they were OK, but they don&#x27;t compare well to Feather blades.</li>
      <li>any cheap alternatives for me.</li>
      <li>The blades work great with my Merkur double egde razor.</li>
      <li>Well I liked them well enough that I ordered 30 more, and plan on ordering more.</li>
      <li>I really want to like feather because I get such a good shave with them, but these are ALMOST as good without any irritation.</li>
      <li>but here you have what could definately give you nice shaves for a good while and still maintain a relatively sharp edge for about 3-4 days.  </li>
      <li>Super close and super smooth.</li>
      <li>You are still getting a much better shave than if using a modern razor.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the Crystal Super+</li>
      <li>Very high quality blades in an easy to use dispensing pack.</li>
      <li>It is a great bargain compared to typical multi-blades.  </li>
      <li>and theres even a place to put old ones on the bottom super great product i will buy again next time i run out</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they are worth $1 each.  </li>
      <li>The case also has a handy slot on the back to slide used razors into when you&#x27;re finished with them (eliminating the danger of throwing them in a trash can).  </li>
      <li>These blade are good for the entry level wet shavers.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve kept their edge better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried, they&#x27;re sharp enough to give a satisfactorily close shave, and so far, I haven&#x27;t experienced skin irritation from using them.</li>
      <li>If you have ever thought about using a safety razor, you are on the right track.  </li>
      <li>I have used the blade four times on my face so far and it still feels very comfortable and gives me a very close shave.  </li>
      <li>Very close shave!</li>
      <li>I enjoy these razors, I have a relatively soft beard and these seem to do the trick.</li>
      <li>After a couple of days shaving with these blades I am completely rash free and my face is the smoothest it has ever been.    </li>
      <li>These blades are nice and sharp.</li>
      <li>Merkur blades cost a bit more, but they last longer and the quality is consistently high.</li>
      <li>These are very sharp, and will give you an amazing shave.</li>
      <li>When compared to Wilkinson Sword brand blades, the Merkur blades are vastly superior in performance, at least for the first shave.</li>
      <li>I was looking for double sided blades to fit a pedicure tool and these were too large.  </li>
      <li>You will become a shaving pro in no time, and wonder how you shaved your whole life without these.</li>
      <li>I have not had such a close and smooth shave like it in ages.</li>
      <li>The razor is very well made.</li>
      <li>but I have light facial hair.</li>
      <li>I really like these blades</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than the modern style refills I was buying every month.  </li>
      <li>So far, these are my second favorite blades to shave with.</li>
      <li>These blades came with my Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Classic Safety Razor - Open-#41 I just ordered.  </li>
      <li>The initial lines are good and the product is firm.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these double-edged razor blades.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>They cut cleanly and smoothly and stay sharp for an incredibly long time.  </li>
      <li>My advice is to keep trying new blades - an excellent shave cream won&#x27;t compensate for a bad blade.</li>
      <li>I am new to using a saftey razor and all I could say is where have you been all my life.  </li>
      <li>I chalked the razor burn up to inexperience with my new razor and tried lots of new shave creams, pre-shave oil and even face cleansers.  </li>
      <li>Merkur saftey razor has beaten the new trend of 3, 4 and 5 blades.  </li>
      <li>but then you need a new blade because it is already done.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and the Merkurs</li>
      <li>These were the first double-edged I had ever used, having switched to a safety razor recently.  </li>
      <li>Very fine edge, for decreased nicking and a very close shave.</li>
      <li>They keep their edge for a considerable amount of time and use.</li>
      <li>Keep your extra blades packed in their original box, and outside the bathroom, such as in a closet until you need to use them.</li>
      <li>In fact, for me, there&#x27;s only one blade that is worse - luckily those aren&#x27;t widely available.  </li>
      <li>Switch to other side of the blade after each pass, and rinse in hot water, and then do again.</li>
      <li>These blades would barely sharp the first time, and by my 3rd shave, they&#x27;d be pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Gave me  a reasonable amount of razor burn due to the blades.</li>
      <li>I hope I like the other blades I ordered just as much,</li>
      <li>Although they tend to lose their edge after the first shave and I am not able to use them for more than one shave, I find it unnecessary to apply pressure to the razor handle.  </li>

    <li> There are better, sharper, quality razors out there but here you have what could definately give you nice shaves for a good while and still maintain a relatively sharp edge for about 3-4 days.  I used these for 3 plus years and they definately work.  That however is the only problem I have with these razors, their sharpness doesn&#x27;t last as long as other blades such as Feather or my favorites; the red box of Personna Platinum blades.  Other than the length of sharpness there&#x27;s not a thing wrong with these.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, and lasts a long time. I recommend using it with pacific shaving oil to reduce nicks and cuts. If it did not cost so much more than others I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These blades came with my Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Classic Safety Razor - Open-#41 I just ordered.  I am new to using a saftey razor and all I could say is where have you been all my life.  I have always had irritation from disposable razors and I tried many.  I saw an ad in Money Magazine about the cost effectiveness of using a Saftey Razor so I gave it a try.  I love to save money, but what I love more is the close, non-irritating shave I get from this razor and these blades.    I have used the blade four times on my face so far and it still feels very comfortable and gives me a very close shave.  I am so pleased with these blades and shaver that I am amazed why more men don&#x27;t shave using saftey razors.    I also bought other blades that I haven&#x27;t used yet, but all I can say is my beard is extremely heavy and I&#x27;m on my fourth shave with the same blade.  I hope I like the other blades I ordered just as much, if not, I am order these blades in bulk.    I now look forward to shaving and don&#x27;t dread it like I used to.  In the past my face was so irritated, I would sometimes have to let my beard grow in for a few days because the rash was so bad.  After a couple of days shaving with these blades I am completely rash free and my face is the smoothest it has ever been.    I would never go back to using a disposable razor again.  One double edge Merkur saftey razor has beaten the new trend of 3, 4 and 5 blades.  My face no longer looks like it went through a meat grinder.</li>
    <li> Bought these to go with my Merkur razor. Read a lot of reviews about people not liking them. Well I liked them well enough that I ordered 30 more, and plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> If you have ever thought about using a safety razor, you are on the right track.  I have tried every type of razor out there: disposable, electric, Mach V, whatever.  Every one of them has always cut my skin, left razor burn, and my skin has bumps.    This Christmas, my wife bought my Proraso, Merkur safety razor, and these blades after doing her search and I have to say I will never go back.  This is the best way to shave out there. Its not as convenient as the disposable blades, but your skin will thank you.  I have had zero razor burn or skin bumps since December so bye bye any cheap alternatives for me.</li>
    <li> Blades for a safety razor.....there are a LOT. These blades though are excellent. Way better than what you&#x27;d find at CVS</li>
    <li> After using disposal razors, I decided to find a good handle and some of the sharpest blades for it. After reading reviews after reviews of different razor handles and blades, I decided on the Merkur blades and they did not disappoint. I have not had such a close and smooth shave like it in ages. The blade even retains its&#x27; sharpness after multiple uses (with care of course). Love these blades!</li>
    <li> I used the Merkur Super blades for awhile, and they were OK, but they don&#x27;t compare well to Feather blades. The Feathers are sharper allowing for a closer shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give these 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t found anything that beats them other than the Feather.</li>
    <li> Get some Feather razor blades, must better. These blades would barely sharp the first time, and by my 3rd shave, they&#x27;d be pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave them 2 stars because they are still better then gillette or shick crap.</li>
    <li> Merkur blades cost a bit more, but they last longer and the quality is consistently high. Some blades can actually be too sharp. These are just about perfect.</li>
    <li> Great shave at a great price</li>
    <li> The product was not what I wanted.  I was looking for double sided blades to fit a pedicure tool and these were too large.  It would be helpful to put their size in the description.</li>
    <li> Because these blades are so widely available, most men who begin using a double-edge safety razor use these blades.  I did.  I chalked the razor burn up to inexperience with my new razor and tried lots of new shave creams, pre-shave oil and even face cleansers.  It wasn&#x27;t until I started using different blades that I realized how bad Merkur blades are.  Now years later I can honestly say these are about the worst of the DE blades.  In fact, for me, there&#x27;s only one blade that is worse - luckily those aren&#x27;t widely available.  My advice is to keep trying new blades - an excellent shave cream won&#x27;t compensate for a bad blade.</li>
    <li> These are better than others I&#x27;ve been trying.  The difference has been surprising.  They&#x27;re sharper and seem to last longer, and I can get a closer shave with less burn.</li>
    <li> not much to be said other than you need these for your merkur razor. These are very sharp, and will give you an amazing shave. If you are new to merkur  double edge razors, start slow, and with short strokes; shave with the grain of your face. Switch to other side of the blade after each pass, and rinse in hot water, and then do again. You will become a shaving pro in no time, and wonder how you shaved your whole life without these. Keep your extra blades packed in their original box, and outside the bathroom, such as in a closet until you need to use them.</li>
    <li> So far, these are my second favorite blades to shave with. (My favorite remains the Gillette Swedes.).  They&#x27;ve kept their edge better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried, they&#x27;re sharp enough to give a satisfactorily close shave, and so far, I haven&#x27;t experienced skin irritation from using them.</li>
    <li> The best blades I have ever used!</li>
    <li> like someone else said, good for beginners to DE shaving, but you&#x27;ll probably switch to sharper blades soon. i recommend buying a small package.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades, I have tried a few others including gillete, shark, feather, etc. I really want to like feather because I get such a good shave with them, but these are ALMOST as good without any irritation. The feather are just so sharp that the first couple shaves with a blade are not comfortable, not the case with these blades, they have become my regular blade.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these double-edged razor blades.  These were the first double-edged I had ever used, having switched to a safety razor recently.  They are relatively forgiving for a rookie and not so sharp that one false move will leave you needing skin grafts on your face.  They cut cleanly and smoothly and stay sharp for an incredibly long time.  The case also has a handy slot on the back to slide used razors into when you&#x27;re finished with them (eliminating the danger of throwing them in a trash can).  All in all, I have nothing bad to say about these blades and I would encourage anyone, though especially new comers to the world of wet shaving, to try out these razor blades.</li>
    <li> These blade are good for the entry level wet shavers. They are a forgiving compared to the feather blades. Gave me  a reasonable amount of razor burn due to the blades. scavenging through forums, recommendation was to move to feather blades.  Though pricier, feather blades have suited me better. Doubt I will return to these blades again.</li>
    <li> I started with Merkur and I seemed to have come back to using them as my preferred blade, at least for the time being.  I have tried two others, Feathers and Derbys.  The Feathers will give a closer shave.  No doubt.  But they are not smooth.  The Derby&#x27;s ripped my face up without the close shave.  So why not just use the Feathers?  I have very sensitive skin and the Merkurs do the job without being harsh.  That is their strength.  Smoothness.  The Feathers are better for a day or two but then you need a new blade because it is already done.  One and done.  I have used the Merkurs well beyond and they keep on ticking.  And let&#x27;s face it, we are splitting hairs here.  You are still getting a much better shave than if using a modern razor.  Use the right shaving cream/soap, and you have the best of both worlds:  Super close and super smooth.</li>
    <li> I enjoy these razors, I have a relatively soft beard and these seem to do the trick. I&#x27;ve been told that there are sharper ones, but Merkur work for me</li>
    <li> These blades are nice and sharp. What a relief from disposable commercial razors with expensive blade refills! I&#x27;m done with them and will be buying Merkur blades online in the future. (I&#x27;m using some Merkur razor handle which is also nice.)</li>
    <li> They work well for me.</li>
    <li> The razor is very well made. It is a great bargain compared to typical multi-blades.  Very close shave! I would definitely recommend the razor.</li>
    <li> there awesome work great and theres even a place to put old ones on the bottom super great product i will buy again next time i run out</li>
    <li> These blades are very thin as well as sharp.  Although they tend to lose their edge after the first shave and I am not able to use them for more than one shave, I find it unnecessary to apply pressure to the razor handle.  The weight of the razor is sufficient to obtain a consistently very good shave.  When compared to Wilkinson Sword brand blades, the Merkur blades are vastly superior in performance, at least for the first shave.</li>
    <li> These razor blades do the job just fine.  Much cheaper than the modern style refills I was buying every month.  I get two to four shaves out of each blade but I have light facial hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and lasts for a lot of shaves. The blades work great with my Merkur double egde razor. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Yes. These are quality.</li>
    <li> Very high quality blades in an easy to use dispensing pack. Very fine edge, for decreased nicking and a very close shave. They keep their edge for a considerable amount of time and use.</li>
    <li> The initial lines are good and the product is firm.  I personally prefer the feathers but these are a solid product.  I just always feel that these are missing something.</li>
    <li> I find these to be no better or worse as far as closeness and comfort when compared to other DE blades.  I don&#x27;t think they are worth $1 each.  I prefer the Crystal Super+ (aka Israeli Personna) blades.  Everyone&#x27;s face, skin and shaving technique is different but those seem to work best for me.  I also like that they are only 16 cents each here on Amazon.</li>
