<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a slightly oily skin and this is perfect for washing after a workout</li>
    <li> I am a 32 year old that still gets breakouts and blackheads, I have tried several other kinds of face/acne wash claiming to clear my face up and not one of them worked so I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but this did clear my face up.&lt;br /&gt; I only use it once a day  sometimes twice if my face feels extra dirty that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I have combination skin and it dries it out so I use a moisturizer with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about three weeks, and it have done nothing good to my skin. It was suppose to help remove blemish, and i guess black heads. it is also suppose help control acne, but instead it cause you to get acne, i do have sensitive skin but i didn&#x27;t see what this product does, it does get rid of excessive oil, but you could use a make-up remover that does the trick. In my own opinion this product does not work. especially if you have acne, even worst it causes you to have more acne on your face. I try to be patient and see but its hard to be patient when the product is causing you to break- out. Its more trouble that its worth.</li>
    <li> This is great. I&#x27;m 30 and have acne prone skill. I need a face wash that will remove oil without drying my skin out. This product does the job. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually skin clearing, but it does not cause breakouts and won&#x27;t over dry.</li>
    <li> This is a great Face Wash. Not too harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> great product leaves skin soft and very clean</li>
    <li> Even though I am over 40, I find most facewashes to be too harsh for my skin.  I love this facewash.  pH balanced so everyone can use it.  LOVE</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> It was good for my skin but didn&#x27;t seem to reduce the blemish.</li>
    <li> Seams to have a positive effect on acne, but nothing extraordinary</li>
    <li> best acne cleanser I&#x27;ve used in a while.. since using it, my face has been cleared for the most part.  It even \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like its working.. maybe something with the PH balanced?  IDK but it works, def a must try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wash for 10 years and will continue to as long as it is made.  My fiancee and I both use this product.  This product has a mild aroma, similar to original DAWN dish liquid.  I started using this product during my teens, and I feel it was more effective than proactive.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily. I&#x27;ve been using Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Cleanser for many years and it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out or become irritated. If I use a different cleanser or soap, my skin will still break out. Since it is sometimes unavailable in my area, I enrolled in the regular delivery program so I never have to run out again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.. My entire house uses this to keep summer blemishes at bay. It keeps my skin clear without drying it out.</li>
    <li> This face wash works well for people with regular to oily skin.  It is a great daily cleanser.  The scent is mild and leaves a nice clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have never been disappointed.  Amazon keeps this stocked and the price is very reasonablie.  Highly recommended for all skin types and problem areas.  I will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap for everyone and people ph sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I&#x27;m not sure why the price suddenly went up two dollars a bottle, but I bought it at another website (as you can tell, I was not happy to see the price increase from less than four dollars a bottle to five and a half or six dollars a bottle).</li>
    <li> great acne facewash, when used regularly helps keep skin clear, comparable to expensive products</li>
    <li> Its ok. I don&#x27;t notice a huge change, but its ok for me.</li>
    <li> Really did not like this product. It was a liquid, not A gel. I already started breaking out again and my eczema broke out as well. I have really oily skin and this dried my skin out really bad. Would never buy again.</li>
    <li> Removes oils and dirt witout irritating skin.No film or residue. Easy to use dispenser with traval lock.Exesting pimples disapper in hours.</li>
    <li> Bought this for hubby as the heat is causing acne.  This bottle is less &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; than other manufacturers and he uses in the shower.  Still small amounts of acne, but MUCH better than before.  Be sure you guys cool-down for at least 30 minutes, after exercise and before showering, or you are just wasting your money.</li>
    <li> Phisoderm is the only thing that clears up my skin and I have tried everything.</li>
    <li> Very suitable for acne-prone sensitive skin. Paired this with [[ASIN:B000UVWGGA St. Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub, 10 Ounce]] and they work really well to prevent breakouts without over-drying my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for Phisoderm for sometime and finally found it!  Dries out the acne without drying out your skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I suffer from severe acne as a result of my oily skin. What I love most about this product is that it works for sensitive skin because it does not have the harsh dyes or chemicals. I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NT2EE8 Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Gel Cleanser for Combination to Oily Skin 6fl oz.(177ml)]]</li>
    <li> Great product for oily skin, not too drying either which I usually find with anti-blemish cleansers.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite salicylic acid wash so far. It always fees good not too harsh or drying, even if you double wash. good going, pHISODERM!</li>
    <li> I think this product is very nice for oily acne skin as well. Works vet well by getting rid of the breakout and keeps your skin matte and clean. I would definetly recommend it and the price is great as well.</li>
    <li> Good face wash.  Dispenses easily.  My acne is more hormone related but appears to keep my skin clean and somewhat acne free.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me and it actually made my acne worse.  Never has this problem with any other product, be careful before you decide to buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap...for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A far better anti blemish/acne soap that kills more bacteria than any other non prescription soap I&#x27;ve tried. It leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean without overdrying.</li>
    <li> I have used Phisoderm Facial Wash for the past 30+ years and as in day 1 use, it still works wonders in keeping my skin acne free.  The product also controls the oil in my face.</li>
    <li> Works great. Gentle on skin and removes dirt and grime without harsh chemicals. Would highly recommend this product. Five plus stars</li>
    <li> On my quest to find my perfect cleanser has been quite the journey. This is a good product, but not MY perfect cleanser. I now and forever use ceraV for combination and dry skin</li>
    <li> This cleanser is gentle, yet effective, on my skin. I have had no problems with blemishes since using this.</li>
    <li> This was my daily face wash through my teens and into my early twenties. Now I go back to it once in a while if my face needs a little extra (gentle) exfoliation. It does the trick!</li>
    <li> Really nice for oily skin! Cleans all makeup off (does pretty well with waterproof mascara).</li>
    <li> these cleaned my face however it didnt help with my acne, it does dry the face a bit so make sure you have face lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great when washing your face. I use it for a gentle face wash, I have no blemishes to be able to say if it helps or not.  A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser.  Leaves my face feeling impeccably clean.  I use it each night before bed and one bottle lasts about two months.  Gentle enough to use before an acid peel/moisturizer which I do a couple of times per week.  I&#x27;ve tried several expensive brands but always come back to phisoderm.</li>
    <li> Not drying at all, but cleans well and delivers anti acne treatment at the same time.  Great price too.  I have tried many face washes from drugstore brand to expensive cosmetic brands and this is my choice for general daily use.</li>
    <li> I bought this all the time, then ventured away, and then found it back here for a great value so I had to buy again.  Phisoderm really gives that clean feeling and removes all makeup and oil.  I love that this was a two pack because I can keep one in the shower and one at the sink, something I always mean to do but forget when I&#x27;m buying.</li>
    <li> MD recommended this for a patch of folliculitis I have been fighting for years.  We have cultured it, tested it, all normal bacteria.  We have used special soaps, antibacterial washes, hydrogen peroxide, rinses, creams, ointments, salves, etc....  Nothing really helped.  So far, using this daily, it is clearing and I hope it continues long term.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in a store locally, glad to finally look on Amazon, I should have looked here first!  Update, a month later:  The patch of irritated skin is mostly cleared.  It is scarred from being unhealthy for so long, but it is healing.  For the first time, literally, in years.  It has changed how I feel about myself, and I love this product!!</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick and it&#x27;s a good cleanser for when I feel like I, going to break out, but whenever I use it my skin is more oily than usual. Yes, it prevents ance, but I hate having oily skin. The label says for oily to combination skin, but this works better for my friend who has dry skin. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend buying it</li>
    <li> I remember Phisoderm facial cleaser from when I was a teenager.  It came in a mid-sized green bottle back in the 90&#x27;s.  I always wanted to use this product, but with my 20 dollar a month toiletry budget it was out of my league.  I&#x27;m grateful that Phisoderm is still available on-line.  I haven&#x27;t seen it in stores in years.  It feels good on my skin and extracts the oil and dirt wonderfully.  Truly worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Is as described but didn&#x27;t work for me....which is true about a lot of things so no real slight to this product, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for my problematic skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only sight that I have been able to find this on. By going back to this product&lt;br /&gt;it has helped with my rosacea and my skin clarity. I get a lot of compliments on my&lt;br /&gt;facial skin all the time now</li>
    <li> Works well for the price. I have acne prone skin and I use this to take my make up off every night. Didn&#x27;t see any improvement but it gets the job done. Probably will buy this again</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Face never felt very fresh after using.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for cleansing the face, hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Used Phisoderm years ago without much success but returned to it some twenty years later a couple of weeks ago, very impressed. Nice lather without feeling greasy, feels like it&#x27;s actually cleansing your skin, especially once dry. Have noticed a big difference in a short time. Fragrance is nice too, just enough to separate itself from other cleansers that don&#x27;t have one (aside from known allergies never understood that). Has renewed my belief in cleansers intended to reduce blemishes. Keep in mind that it does have salicylic acid so might be good idea to use gently. Definitely a return buy.</li>
    <li> Love this brand. Always deliverers results. It just isn&#x27;t sold in many stores, but I find myself always coming back to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and STILL have acne (not in my 20s anymore).  This soap is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that my sensitive skin likes.  Glad Amazon carries it as it is difficult to find.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a preservative that most beauty and cleansing products now have. Phisoderm gel is wonderful as it does not have anything I am allergic to and it cleanses my skin beautifully. Very gentle as well.</li>
    <li> After the first use I noticed a 40 percent improvement in the amount of blemishes on my face. it simply took 3 total uses to have a clear face.&lt;br /&gt;the solution was very smooth and easy top apply. the bottle had concise instructions that were very easy to follow as well. if you buy this product i would definitely also recommend having a soft towel to dab and dry because that is a necessity and will help to keep form the future cause of zits.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Only thing that worked for me in school and great on my 3 girls. Pay attention when ordering. Normal to oil is combination; skin sensitive is not as fast in results but no irritation.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all, stopped using it and went back to my old remedy which is a lot better. No more rarely any breakouts! However, everybody skin sensitivity is different. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. Stores quit carrying it.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of using this product, I would give it a 3-star rating.  Although this product worked well with the oily areas of my face, it actually caused acne to breakout in other facial areas. Also, there wasn&#x27;t any noticeable difference in clearing up blemish areas.</li>
    <li> I ordered this since I have oily acne prone skin. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. The cleanser takes really long to get washed off and I&#x27;m left with some acne on the sides of my face now. Probably the cleanser is not getting washed off completely inspite of washing the face with water for a long time</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely. A little pump goes a long way. A bit strongly perfumed for my taste. But my face feels clean and not too stripped or dry. Has been moderately effective in keeping my acne at bay. Less breakouts for sure. Great product for the price. Definitely recommend checking it out.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new facial cleanser for years.  Glad I tried this one.  It cleans my make-up foundation off well without stinging. Non drying yet not greasy.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> So I only got this yesterday and it might be a little premature for me to already leave feedback but due to the results I couldn&#x27;t help myself!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have random bouts of break outs on my face, but I have a constant line of acne along my hairline on my forehead. Well, with just two uses yesterday and one this morning, they have already started disappearing! I am so ecstatic it isn&#x27;t even funny! I have used sooo many different products to try and fight that and the random break outs that pop out on my face and this is the first time I have noticed a huge difference in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but I can FEEL this face wash working. It makes my skin feel tight as well which is a bonus. AND there are no perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not wait to see what the results are in another week and I will try to add on to this review when I know the results. My fiance is also using it so I will get his opinion on it as well. I am pretty darn sure I will be recommending this to friends and family. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It&#x27;s only been three days since I started using the product and it just continues to impress me. I wash my face in the morning and before bed. Already my pores have shrunk to half their size, my skin is smooth and even, and the &amp;#34;about to break surface&amp;#34; acne bumps have disappeared. AND, as I mentioned the hairline acne before, there are only about 10 left before they have completely disappeared. I have tried so many other products and none have amazed me like this one has. I do hope that whoever buys this product it works just as good for them as it does for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: October 5th, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really did great for my face and I still use it when I am not using my other face wash (which is much stronger). My hubby definitely prefers this stuff and I need to order more. It really is gentle on the skin and helps keep breakouts down. It might not be a miracle cure for everyone, but it seems to work really good for me. Especially in comparison to a ton of other facewashes I have used.cewashes I have used.</li>
    <li> This is for the youngsters in the family battling blemishes.  They love it.  If you have breakouts -- they said it works!  Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  It&#x27;s powerful stuff.</li>
    <li> My skin is getting better each day. I&#x27;ve tried so many different face washes and I still broke out. Phisoderm acne face wash is very gentle on skin but strong on acne. For the price I would definitely recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> This is a great wash for blemish prone skin - cleans well but doesn&#x27;t dry skin out.</li>
    <li> Always love this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my acne. Another crossed off the list. I&#x27;m moving on to try Coconut oil. haha</li>
    <li> The cleanser I received was not the one described, it was one that was formulated for dry skin so it contained all kinds of oils and moisturizers.  What you order is not what you get.</li>
    <li> It seems like I have tried every cleanser out there, drugstore brands, Philosophy, you name it. I am very pleased with this product. I have combination skin, some dry spots, mostly oily spots, breakout prone, some sensitive areas...sounds fun huh? This product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, it controls my oily areas and has cleared my skin up. Plus it makes my skin soft! And seriously $4? Buy this now! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great gentle odorless cleansing lotion for the face.  I&#x27;ve used this same cleanser for years and my skin is smooth and clear. I don&#x27;t have blemishes but it&#x27;s a great facial wash. My existing supply was running out so I was pleased to find it available at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Yuck, this was suggested for breakout prone skin and it just left a disgusting oily film on my skin, which caused worse breakouts. NOT a fan. Purpose cleanser is so much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a face wash I could use twice a day (I&#x27;m 28 and luckily only have the occasional breakout). I found this one and I love it! The fragrance is light, which I haven&#x27;t experienced with other salicylic cleansers and the gel itself is really silly and light. My skin felt soft and smooth after my first use! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be running through bottles of this!</li>
    <li> Smells great, has really done a good job removing my acne. I would buy again. Performance, texture, and feel matches the description.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have any proof that it&#x27;s actively stopping pimples from appearing, but it does smoothly come on and off.  There is a little drying, but not nearly as much as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get it in your eyes, there is only a mild stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I do plan to continue buying this product.  I like how it is soap and alcohol free.  Not sure if this particular Phisoderm product is pH balanced though.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried it and I like it a lot and will continue to buy it.  Leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever found. I&#x27;ve used it for ten years and love it. Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  The best cleanser around and mild enough for my skin.</li>
    <li> simple, effective and affordable.  i have oily skin and i&#x27;ve learned to embrace it, but only because of products like this, that help keep breakouts in check and my skin feeling clean w/out feeling stripped.</li>
    <li> This facewash did a decent job of cleansing, but did not help clear my face of acne/blemishes.  It has salicylic acid as the ingredient to help clear acne/blemished.  It does seem quite gentle, though.</li>
    <li> I love this facewash. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and I have very sensitive skin. It smells nice and clean, and really does make me feel more confident. I will definitely purchase again. I have very oily skin and this wash keeps my face soft and much less oily all day long. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this product when it was Phisohex so I have been using it basically since the 1970s. EXCELLENT product. My face looks at least 15 years younger with no lines, yet.</li>
    <li> Work quite well and is the only thing that has worked with my acne.</li>
    <li> I have very bad combination skin. My T-zone is exceedingly oily but the rest of my face dries out and flakes very easily. This cleanser is mild enough to leave my entire face soft, but still clean the oily skin.  Most others I&#x27;ve used, like St Ives and Clean and Clear, my nose and forehead are completely oily again after about an hour. With this one, I can get about five hours before I need to blot my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: Works much better than anything I&#x27;ve used yet, but still doesn&#x27;t keep my face completely oil-free all day long.</li>
    <li> Hard to find, good product, gentle but tough on acne</li>
    <li> I was 34 and tired of looking like a teenager with pimples everywhere.  This was my answer.  I use it at night and in the morning. (once a day wasn&#x27;t enough)  My skin gets dried out overnight and then I use a great moisturizer in the morning under my make up.  I&#x27;m now 37 and I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I buy it online otherwise I have to go from store to store trying to find one that has any in stock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Phisoderm products and this one is no exception.  I have very sensitive skin that is prone to allergy-related breakouts, but this cleanser helps very much to minimize them.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product and the price here on Amazon is awesome!</li>
    <li> I am a woman in my late thirties, still dealing with acne and not happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;In the last year or so, I&#x27;ve developed facial peeling and dryness from my old acne cleanser.  This has been much less irritating but contains the same strength acne medication as my old wash. I can use this daily and my face looks better than it has in a long time. I use Walgreens store brand alpha hydroxy acid for a few days if I notice any dead skin build up or black heads. That dissolves or at least softens any hardened oil in pores the face wash isn&#x27;t reaching. I&#x27;ve had one tub of the Walgreens alpha hydroxy acid for a few years. I recommend both products.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleaner ever. Wish they sold in the US again.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser for oily skin. It&#x27;s clear and a thinner consistency than other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried and a little goes a long way. In humid weather I sometimes wash my face 3 times a day and it doesn&#x27;t strip your face so that you end up oilier from over washing. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was bought on a whim, I just wanted a good facial cleanser and I am so happy I purchase this. Its amazing!!!! Its cleans your face of makeup and dirt, leaving you feeling refreshed.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dried out one bit, after washing my face, I use Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Cosmedica Skincare and Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf15 - Sensitive.  My face looks and feels great.  I immediately bought 3 more bottles of this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Really worked for my teen! Had a problem with acne that prescription medicine wouldn&#x27;t help. Tried this and are so happy we did! Total change in her skin!</li>
    <li> this product is ok- as expected</li>
    <li> This stuff has worked wonders for my face.  My face has cleared up really nicely.  I use it once in the morning and once in the evening.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Works great. I was very surprised that it does not dry out my skin like most of the products I&#x27;ve tried. My skin is smooth and feels great - even after a few hours it is still oil free. It does have a light scent but nothing too overwhelming or unpleasant. Great for my combination skin, oily in the T-zone and dry on my cheeks. I experienced none of the usual over drying that other products produced which just lead to increased oil production. Definitely going to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> this if a great/poutstanding cleanser</li>
    <li> Great wash for the price. Not overly drying.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the only time I get pimples now are when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this face wash in an attempt to gain the same results as the Phisoderm 3 step facial wash I used in 2006.  That facewash was discontinued and I was really upset.  It was the only facial wash that cleared my acne and blemishes.  Phisoderm has great facial products.  I love this product and stocked up on it because if they discontinue this one, I won&#x27;t be so upset.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to clear acne blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Fast service, great product, I highly recommend if you have adult acne.  Phisoderm was recommended to me by a doctor about 40 years ago, I&#x27;m thankful it is still available.</li>
    <li> This has worked very well for me, and I&#x27;ve tried it all. Proactive, Cerave wash (which broke me out more), Neutrogena face wash, all of it. I know everyone is different, but for the price, I highly recommend giving this a try if you&#x27;ve tried a bunch of things and haven&#x27;t had much luck. I still get some breakouts, of course, but overall, this just has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I am just trying this for the first time, and my skin has definitely cleared up after about a week! I was going through a really tough time skin- wise, and this has been amazing. Face wash doesn&#x27;t really ever help me much, but for some reason this one is different. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell and one pump is more than enough so it is probably going to last a good while. Great product, give it a try!</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser in the morning and at night.  I did not experience any irritation and find it gentle enough to use at any time of the day as well as to take off my make-up.  It is comparable to Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s Purpose soap.  It has a very very light fragrant smell but nothing purfumy.  I like it well enough to use indefinitely.  It&#x27;s a good buy for the price as well</li>
    <li> My skin is oily AND dry somehow, and therefore VERY sensitive as well. After using this cleanser only once, however, I can sincerely see and feel a noticeable difference and my face feels sensational. My overall tone is softer and less shiny, and my skin feels like soft micro suede instead of a cracking desert wasteland. After a couple more days, my vibrantly red problem areas have begun to fade, as the cleanser&#x27;s evened my tone and visibly diminished my blemishes. The best part is the soothing tingle that comes towards the end when it feels like it&#x27;s both invigorating and purifying my pores all at once. I was worried it would sting because of the salicylic acid, but instead it feels nourishing like a creamy moisturizer, and because it&#x27;s alcohol free, it actually STAYS moisturized all day. Love it, can&#x27;t wait to keep using it and see more results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all levels of drugstore to high end products and it feels great to find a product that is so cheap and works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a &amp;#34;breakout booster&amp;#34; when I feel acne on the verge. I have combo dry/oily + sensitive skin and thought the acne days were long gone, but find myself with a new crop post-40&#x27;s.  It is somewhat drying, so I usually dilute it slightly before applying to my skin. Great for prevention and treating existing acne, even small level cystic acne, 2x a day. I don&#x27;t use this daily, only for periods of breakout and switch between this and the DHC Deep Cleansing Oil, which I highly recommend for maintaining clean, moist skin.</li>
    <li> Works like no other face wash I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> This face wash is the best in the market and the best I&#x27;ve ever used. 5 stars for it. Very gentle and clear acne that caused by excessive oil and irritation. It can be used on the back acne as well.</li>
    <li> The piney scent of this is off-putting to me. It&#x27;s strong and it strikes me as masculine, which is not ideal, as I&#x27;m female.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin feels cleaner and clearer.</li>
    <li> Have hormonal acne and this does the trick! Have used it for over ten years love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years now, both for its cleansing capabilities and antibacterial action.  It makes a nice soapy foam and rinses cleanly.  I find it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, nor does it leave it oily.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have used it for years!</li>
    <li> After having no luck with my previous clean and clear facial cleanser (which was actually making me break out more) I turned to this. No regrets! Leaves the skin super soft and looking healthier even after the first wash. My blemishes have all cleared up I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase :-)</li>
    <li> wonderful non-irritating cleanser</li>
    <li> this small cleanser is definitely helping cure my face will update with results when get my face cleared up.</li>
    <li> nothing special but its a good price and works</li>
    <li> Born at the tail end of the baby boom, I used Phisoderm as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, Phisoderm was recommended to me when I asked around for a new cleanser.  My skin began reacting to my old cleanser  which was an exfoliator with 2% salicylic acid. Because of the recommendation and my positive childhood memories, I decided to give Phisoderm a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked several stores and did not see Phisoderm. Finally at my 4th stop, I asked an employee.  She walked me to the aisle and showed me a bottle. It never occurred to me something might be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for a grass green colored bottle.  The new packaging is mint green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for a big P with bold black writing.&lt;br /&gt;The new writing has more attractive fonts with softer colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it dispenses with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that day, I have been using Phisoderm as recommended which is twice daily.  My break-outs stopped immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Phisoderm cleanses and softens my skin without a lot of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cheekbone skin is sensitive. Subsequently, I do feel some tingling and drying. But, not enough to stop using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Phisoderm to anyone who wants a reasonably priced over the counter cleanser that does not exfoliate, is not overly fragrant and has the highest level of salicylic acid without a prescription.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me. I used it every morning and night, zero difference in my acne.</li>
    <li> I used it as a teen, with great results. My son is using now, with similar success.</li>
    <li> Good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested I use a cleanser with salicylic acid, and this was inexpensive and not tested on animals so it&#x27;s the one I picked. My skin seems to be improving and I like the foamy suds - I use it with my Clarisonic. Taking off one star because it is scented and I prefer unscented products. But the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it&#x27;s gone once I rinse it off, so I can live with it.</li>
