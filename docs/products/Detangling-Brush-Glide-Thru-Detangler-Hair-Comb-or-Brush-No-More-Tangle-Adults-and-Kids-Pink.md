      <li>I have fine curly hair which should be good</li>
      <li>so I have been in need of finding a more time effective solution.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more effective than finger detangling for me because I am not a patient person and so many times I end up not being thorough as I rush to finish my never ending head of hair.</li>
      <li>It was very light and looked flimsy.</li>
      <li>it lays in my hand as if it is made for my hand and it is very light weight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best hairbrush ever!! Especially if you have very curly hair like mine</li>
    <li> My daughter whom is 4 yrs old can now brush her own long hair. She said &amp;#34; look mommy - it doesn&#x27;t hurt !&amp;#34;  So glad I tried if.</li>
    <li> did NOT work at all for neither myself nor for daughter&#x27;s hair (wet or dry). wish i could return it. her regular brush, and my large wavy pick hurts a lot less.</li>
    <li> Wow! Why didn&#x27;t I purchase this brush years ago??  It would have saved me countless days of my daughter whining in the morning when I had to brush her hair.  My daughter is 8 and has long medium/thick hair, it&#x27;s also wavy.  She sleeps crazy so when she wakes up her hair is a mess! I dreaded brushing it especially if we were in a hurry. But now with this brush it takes half the time to brush! And most importantly, no whining or complaining that I&#x27;m pulling her hair.  Sometimes there were even tears. Seriously I did not buy this brush at first because I thought it was dumb to spend 15-20 bucks on a brush.  I&#x27;m so glad I did, best money I ever spent! And I&#x27;m buying a second one for my niece! Buy the brush!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I bought this brush for myself.  I have very curly, unruly long hair.  I live in NJ where humidity rules the day late spring to early fall.  The brush worked great!  It was completely impossible to get a brush through my hair unless it was wet and I used leave in conditioner.  This brush actually goes through my dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to make my hair frizz even worse though, so I tried it on the cat.  I know it isn&#x27;t promoted as a brush for pets, but I have to tell you that it does a great job.  I have the original grumpy cat, and before now she would refuse to let me brush her.  She&#x27;s long hair (Maine Coon), but has always kept herself very clean so it hasn&#x27;t really been an issue, but she&#x27;s getting older (17 yo) and recently hasn&#x27;t been taking as much time for her grooming.  To my surprise, she LOVES being brushed with this brush.  She now climbs into bed at night with me and lets me brush her until I get tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll be buying a couple more of these brushes soon.  Another one for me and one for my brother&#x27;s family.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest brush of all times. I bought because my little girl screams when she even sees a brush. Then I fell in love with it when I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out like most brushes. So I got one for me. Then I gave brushes to my brother and son who both have unruly long hair. Buy it. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair!</li>
    <li> After struggling with a normal brush for months with my daughter&#x27;s fine, easily tangled hair, this brush is awesome.  Not sure how it does it, but there is no more snagging, no more pain, when we have to brush out her hair (she&#x27;s 5).  She used to run away from me when it came time to brush, but its easy now.  Leaves a very soft, silky feel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> great brush for a kid with really long hair.  Much easier than a comb for her.</li>
    <li> works great but wish handle was little longer cause hard to hold u have to put ur whole hand over top so it doesn&#x27;t fly out of your hand</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I almost cried when I first used this brush. I was so happy! I have long hair that is bleached blonde and tangles were something I had to deal with daily. The brush makes my hair 100% manageable after a wash and during blow drying and it keeps the tangles out pretty well throughout the day</li>
    <li> I tested this brush on my hair, and it works just fine.  But that&#x27;s to be expected as I am a firm advocate of conditioner, which take the tangles out of my hair.  The detangling brush has a nice ergonomic shape and feels good in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I wanted to give it a try on my long-haired Maine Coon whose fur knots up no matter how much I brush it.  It even knots up behind his ears.  So I used this brush on his fur, and it does work better than the brushes with the little balls on the ends of their bristles.  He likes it, and it does seem to handle his tangles better than the much more expensive cat brush.  It&#x27;s not perfect.  For the really bad knots, I have to resort to a seam ripper, but this brush does work at least as well as any other brush I&#x27;ve tried on his fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***product supplied by manufacturer for testing and review purposes***</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive when the brush first arrived. The brush itself was smaller than I thought it would be, and the teeth were much smaller as well.  I have a thick head of  tightly curled hair, but my hair is also very fine and soft, and I was concerned about the brush pulling out my hair.  I used the brush for the first time this morning. I didn&#x27;t think this would make a good de-tangler, so first I used it brush my hair and lift fine particles and remove dry skin. Then I shampoo&#x27;d conditioned, and used the brush and it was amazing; the brush didn&#x27;t pull my hair out at all it was very easy to use and my scalp and hair felt very good during and after. The brush is a little slippery, but just a little. The brush literally glides through your hair managing your hair and helping to remove left over residue from soap and conditioner. I&#x27;m not sure if the shape makes it ergonomic, but it feels that way it reduces the stress in my wrist. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome, this brush is definitely my new favorite for shampoo and conditioning.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I am part Black and part Hispanic and my hair is long and coarse. This brush not only detangled my hair, but it did not hurt my sensitive scalp. The brush combed through my hair in minutes. I will soon buy a second one for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I got it for my little girl that has a tender head. She used it and said &amp;#34;mom it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> A great no tears option for my seven year old daughter with long hair.  Previously hair brushing was an ordeal to say the least.  She wanted to use the kind of brush that doesn&#x27;t really get the knots out because it hurt less.  When she saw this advertised I ordered it immediately.  While it&#x27;s not 100% pain free brushing, it&#x27;s good enough so that she doesn&#x27;t fight brushing and it leaves her very long hair smooth and silky.  Her hair is very straight and thick in case there is anyone considering this for their hair.</li>
    <li> I wonder what took me so long to discover this?! For the record, this is not for my imaginary daughter who whines as I attempt to brush her hair. As a woman in her 30&#x27;s with long curly/frizzy/unruly hair this brush is amazing. The way it&#x27;s shaped it&#x27;s such a bonus. It never occurred to me just how uncomfortable ordinary brushes are until using this. While the handle could stand to be slightly longer for longer hair it&#x27;s no deal breaker. If you&#x27;re considering it, stop and take the plunge. I only wish I did sooner</li>
    <li> I honestly did not think this brush would work so incredibly well. I was more zhan sceptical when I tried it on my daughther, but she didnt compkain or flinch ince. And she wakes up witha rats nest on her gead every single morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely recommend  it.</li>
    <li> I am glad I found this on Amazon and bought it after reading all the reviews.  This brush is wonderful for tangled, knotted up hair that keeps breaking off.  I use it with a special detangling spray that I also found on Amazon.  I am 65 years old and have natural curly hair below my shoulders which I would like to keep long.  The problem is that I am being treated for breast cancer and am on an anti hormone one pill per day treatment for five years which began on 3/1/15.  An immediate side effect has been breakage of hair, so I began a search to find new products for myself to try to minimize or solve this problem without going to a very short hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush glides through my washed, wet hair which has been sprayed with the detangling spray.  There is very minimal breakage now and the brush is no longer filled with a handful of broken hair when I am finished combing it out.  I also have an arthritic disease which makes it difficult for me to hold things in my hands.  Because of the curved design of this brush, I am able to hold on to it while I comb my hair with less pain in my hand and it does it fall out of my hand to drop on the floor.  This brush is well worth the price to help with solving all my new hair problems as I embark on oral chemo treatment for the next five years.  I see clearly how great this is for young children who are always in pain while Mommy combs out their hair.  Wish I had had this when I was s kid.</li>
    <li> Amazon Prime purchase.  Love the color. Love the product.  I have long fine hair and this does seem to glide through I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I bought this for my son, who has very curly hair and then tried it for myself and I love using it on both of us. It has really changed our detangling sessions. There is little to no struggle when doing either of our hair now and I&#x27;ve noticed much less shedding as well. The only negative thing about this product is an aesthetic thing, which is that the logo came off after a few uses, but I do use this brush to distribute conditioner throughout my hair and my son&#x27;s hair, so that probably contributed to that, but it in no way affects the performance of the product.</li>
    <li> This brush works wonders. Getting for the rest of my family.</li>
    <li> For all you gals with crazy kinky hair you know how difficult it can be to brush it especially if you have children with the same hair. MY 20 month old daughter has the most beautiful soft curly hair but she absoultely hates anyone brushing her hair. The results from not brushing her hair is similar to that of Doc Brown from Back to the future.. just out of control messy mufasha jungle baby. Anyways this brush is so gentle and i can minimize the torture and me chasing my daughter around the house to brush her hair. I just wish that I had this brush when i was little so that it could have saved me years of endless abuse and torture of my aunts roughly coming my hair!</li>
    <li> This brush glides through my hair with absolutely no effort or pulling of tangles. It feels really great on my scalp, too. However, I have extremely thick hair and I find that the shorter bristles don&#x27;t seem to reach down deep enough for me. I think this brush will work well for someone with shorter, thinner hair than mine.</li>
    <li> Ouch. I was using the wet brush, which has lost some bristles... so I tried this. It hurt at first brush and caught in my long hair. I don&#x27;t get what people are liking about this....&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle felt too short in my hand.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, beautiful design, great for kids! No more crying on detangling!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! My nine year old daughter refused to brush her hair until we received this. Glides through with no tears.</li>
    <li> This is the best detangling brush out there! My daughter&#x27;s hair gets so tangled that no other brush can do it. I tried the knot genie and did not get through her knots. This brush went right through her hair and made it shiny and smooth. It cut the amount of time spent brushing in half. Much less tears!!</li>
    <li> As a woman who has color treated her hair it can be hard to brush through. This brush has made it so much easier and less painful to brush it both wet and dry. Saves me precious time not having to try and slowly work through tangles.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, and you still have to take your time on knotty hair, but it was a lot easier than if I were to use any other comb or brush.  I normally don&#x27;t touch my hair with a brush when it&#x27;s wet, but this brush was gentle and effective. I  would only say maybe 5 hairs had come out when I was done, and normally have two or three chunks come out (I have long, thick hair, but thin and fragile strands). It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I got it to try it and see if it really works. It works great! It glides right thru my very thin hair. It goes thru my tangles so easily and doesn&#x27;t hurt. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush! My daughter loves it too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have thick and wavy hair for a guy. My wife has thick and curly hair for a woman. Thus, my daughter was unfortunately cursed with hair that -- although beautiful -- is a real challenge to comb, style, wash, etc without making her scream and cry from all of the tangles and snarls. So, I have tried a few different products, and so far, I am most impressed with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Typical Morning: Wake-up, go potty, brush teeth, wake-up daughter (4 years old), feed dog, get dressed, wake-up daughter again, prepare my lunch, wake-up daughter a third time, get items ready for breakfast, and check on daughter who is typically finishing brushing her teeth. Then, I grab the brush, sit down on the toilet seat in the bathroom, and see my daughter&#x27;s face sink. She tries to sneak past me, but I grab her. After some initial resistance, I am able to start brushing her hair. Then the whining and the squealing commences. Banshee-like shrieks, over-dramatic tears, etc. You all know what I mean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically by the end, I have a head ache, I&#x27;m annoyed, and she is dramatically complaining about how much it hurt. So, thank you Detangling Brush for making my mornings a lot more manageable. The squealing and shrieking has definitely been moved to a minimum, and she doesn&#x27;t try and run by me every morning now. I will say that it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the 4 stars? Well, I am not a fan of the handle area. I find that it isn&#x27;t &#x27;gripy&#x27; enough when using either in a dry environment, or a wet environment. The shape is a little awkward as well. I would prefer a nice contoured handle, or some sort of tactile grip on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: For the cost, I am very pleased, but would be willing to pay a little more for a better handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This has made my life better and my daughter&#x27;s life better. Great product, I fully recommend</li>
    <li> Great brush - does a good job detangling hair.  The multiple lengths of bristles really help to effectively brush my hair.</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair and this is the best brush for my hair type. It glides through those tight curls. highly recommend it 👍</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and this brush is amazing</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it!</li>
    <li> If you gave kids who cry the moment they see a brush in your hands-get this product. I purchased two so one will be at grandparents house. No more crying!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best detangling brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. My daughters African American natural hair is very thick and long. I use  it to clean her scalp while shampooing and to detangle afterwards. She actually fell asleep while I washed her hair. She said it felt so good and relaxing. S. We love this brush 😊</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter has really curly hair.  I have used the Wet Brush in the past, but this brush far exceeds it.  I would recommend this brush to anyone with thick curly hair</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these brushes a while back for my wife . She&#x27;s had long hair ever since we were married . 57 years ago. [yikes]  Detangling was sometimes ahh , issues to say the least. Like , I think I&#x27;ll leave the house till ya get it fixed toots. Anyhow, she liked the first one so well she had me order a second one for back up and another for our youngest daughter who also has hair like her mother and , by the way is quite fine. So -- wife&#x27;s happy , I&#x27;m happy , everyone&#x27;s happy. Thank you , Have a good one.</li>
    <li> This brush is alright. I was hoping for a 5 star brush, but as I said this brush is fine but nothing I&#x27;m over the moon about. Bought to use on my 3 daughters who have very sensitive scalps and all hate hair brushing. They do not like how hard the bristles are on their scalp. I do not find it amazing for detangling. If you use this on dry hair you will have MAJOR static issues. You must at least spritz the hair down before using. The handle is also quite short. It&#x27;s nice and we&#x27;ll use it but I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> My nine year old daughter has long, thick, wavy hair.  Getting a brush through it without damaging it and without causing too much pain is an issue for us.  I had high hopes that this brush was the solution we were looking for.  She was excited about it upon receiving it, but it has made its way to the back of our brush drawer, because it hurts to use it, just like all our other brushes.  Bummed.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush really works well with my hard to style and manage baby fine hair. In fact, it easily removes the tangles from my hair after it is freshly washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I especially like it how well this brush glides through my hair and smooths out my hair. And also after brushing my hair with this brush, my hair is shinier and gives my hair that classy hairstyle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I have tried many types of brushes similar to this one and I like this one the very best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this brush and give it a full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> You have to use it to believe it. When I first got this, I was still skeptical. It was very light and looked flimsy. I was pretty sure I just wasted money. When I USED it, I was amazed. No pain at all and my hair was getting brushed! And it was getting brushed easily as if there weren&#x27;t any tangles and knots. No hair falling out either. I can feel the brush going through and the hair getting pulled by the brush but it&#x27;s such a gentle pull that is absolutely painless. I was just sitting on my bed brushing and brushing in bewilderment until my boyfriend walked in and gave me a weird look. \\&quot;You&#x27;re acting like you&#x27;ve never brushed your hair before\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not like this I haven&#x27;t. This brush is amazing and I&#x27;m relieved it works because I have so much healthy hair that falls out when I brush with a normal brush and the pain is just awful when it forcefully tears my hair out. But the detangling brush is soothing and gentle and totally painless. And makes my hair smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really impressed!</li>
    <li> Some of my buddies here on Amazon suggested this brush so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design, as you can see, is different.  It has a pleasant appearance --and comes in zingy colors! -- but it doesn&#x27;t have your standard handle.  Don&#x27;t worry.  The handle it does have I have found to be very comfortable.  And it suits my big mom hands as well as my teen daughter&#x27;s more delicate little hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about it, besides the fact that the bright pink color helps me find it even in the dark, is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to break my hair.  The soft rubbery nubs don&#x27;t &#x27;grab&#x27; my long hair --I don&#x27;t know why this works so well -- and I don&#x27;t find heaps of hair stuck amongst the bristles like I did with all of our other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is affordably price I think you should give it a shot if you want fewer hairs accumulating on your brush.  (My hair is long so broken hair is a problem.)  Plus, as they suggest, this brush is more effective in detangling than other brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t work for my hair at all. It&#x27;s cheaply made, and I will not buy again! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Amazon, of course has amazing shipping. The brush is also amazing! We have had many issues with brushing our daughter&#x27;s hair...this brush solves everyone of those issues. I like it enough, to purchase one for myself! It is a quality brush that will stand the test of a preschooler!</li>
    <li> So when I opened the package, I thought the handle was too small. I was so wrong! It&#x27;s the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me give a little background: I have thick, wavy and frizzy hair. My hair is so thick and heavy, that it has to be thinned in order to prevent neck issues. It&#x27;s also long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few months, due to depression my hair has been a mess. I stopped caring and my husband would have to spend 2 hours helping me detangle it every once in a while. It was very painful, breaking my hair and damaging it more and I ended up crying. It was too the point where I was contemplating shaving it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried this out tonight (I&#x27;ve had this brush around 3 hours so far). Oh my gosh! My hair is amazing! It took 1/3 of my usual time to detangle and it was a mess! (Trust me). It got all the dead hair out, smoothed my hair to look shiny and healthier and got it feeling soft and tangle free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love LOVE LOVE this brush. It&#x27;s a miracle. I feel so much more clean and healthy and lady like. This was a hair saver!</li>
    <li> Good price but did not not do the trick for me as it did for others.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. My daughter is bi-racial and has always cried during bath time when I work through her tangles. With this brush there are no tears at all. I thoroughly coat her hair with conditioner, and after a few minutes this brush works the knots out easily. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy and life is good again. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Omg I love this brush!! It really works well on my wet &amp; dry hair! It&#x27;s amazing &amp; won&#x27;t do any other brush &amp; my hair is VERY natural curly so if you are experiencing pain with other brushes, well no worries. This brush is defiantly for you! It WORKS!</li>
    <li> Great brush and it does not pull your hair out. Works great with my eight year old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not super impressed with this hair brush. Especially as it is advertised as a detangling brush-glide thru. My girls have long hair and constantly complain when I am brushing out their knots so I figured to give this brush a try and see how effective it is as detangling without the pain of running a brush through knots. It did not diminish the pain whatsoever when brushing through their hair and I found it more difficult to use then the regular brush i&#x27;ve been  using until now. I tried it on my own hair and it wasnt pain free either. I also want to add that I spray their hair with a detangler spray and i still found it difficult to brush through and definitely not pain free. oh well. back to the regular brush i go.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that does not pull my hair and make it fall out. It truly does as promised</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this brush and I am sure it would work for some hair types. I have fine curly hair which should be good but I have a lot of it. I was hoping for scalp massaging benefits but the bristles don&#x27;t reach my head. When I used the brush I did have a few knots which came out so that part of it works. The bristles bend before yanking any hair out so there was minimal shedding. My hair, stubborn as it is, bent a few bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Yes, I will say that. It didn&#x27;t hurt either -- I guess I expected more out of it and for it to be able to reach more of my hair and my scalp. I have to not push down too hard either or the bristles flatten, which was disappointing. There were times it seemed like it was just gliding over the surface of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the right hair, I can see this as a valuable purchase. For a parent brushing their childrens hair, ditto.</li>
    <li> My kids all have thin hair which tends to get very tangled very often.  We saw an advertisement for the brush on TV.  My kids were tired of me constantly pulling at their hair to get the knots out and I was tired of hearing them scream because, according to them, it hurt.  When we received the brush I had my doubts.  And the kids even said it hurt when they brushed with it because they were used to very soft brushes.  But....after they used it a few times (not happily, but they did), they began to realize that it was good at getting the tangles out and they could do it themselves.  That meant less pulling for them and less screaming for me.  The brush definitely takes some getting used to, but if you stick with it, it&#x27;s well worth the time.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a very sensitive scalp and acts like she&#x27;s dying whenever I brush her hair. To be fair she has some minor sensory issues. She is 4 and has hair to the middle of her back. This brush didn&#x27;t help get through the tangles in my daughters hair without the drama. If her hair is wet and has detangler in it then we have pretty good success, but I was hoping to find a brush that can get through the tangles when her is dry. This can&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> I have used the brush several times. It works very well at detangling but the shortness and shape of the handle makes it hard for me to use. I detangle my hair in the shower with conditioner. This makes my hands slippery and consequently makes it hard for me to maintain a good grip on the brush. This is my dilemma as I really like its detangling abilities. I often end up reverting back to my old standby... The wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for tangled hair. I used the de tangled bruch for my curly hair after hair washed but it doesn&#x27;t work at all. This brush solved the problem in less than five minutes. Awesome product and thinking to order another one for my family.</li>
    <li> This brush does a great job of detangling wet (or dry) hair.  I have fairly long hair and I have struggled with a comb for many years then read about this.  Thought it was worth a try and it actually works.  It really does &amp;#34;detangle&amp;#34; much better than using a comb.  Especially when hair is wet.  My daughter has one also.  She has long (&amp; thick) hair.  We would highly recommend to anyone who is tired of struggling with tangles!</li>
    <li> My daughters super curly hair gets tangled up so easily, especially after she wakes up its a huge mess and this detangling brush really came in handy! It fits nicely in your hand and has tons of bristles to help untangle hair, my daughter doesnt cry at all now when I brush her hair, even she is trying to use it herself! :) Love the cute pink color and the sleekness of the handle&lt;br /&gt;Id reccommend especially if you have a kid with curly hair who hates brushing their hair due to the tangles and such, this is great for sorting all that mess out</li>
    <li> I tried this brush first when my hair was dry and it doesn&#x27;t pull. It does tend to create static electricity but it isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick, so I was skeptical about it working when it is wet as the bristles seem too flexible. I am pleased to say that it detangles without the pull I get from a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Got this for my granddaughter, now there is not a battle brushing her hair. It&#x27;s a life saver.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick hair and it tangles very easily. It&#x27;s hard for her to brush her hair because the combs and brushes she&#x27;s used before all tear out her hair. Not anymore! She loves this brush and uses it very often, although she has no need to: this brush detangles hair very quickly without pulling or causing frizz. Her hair is now tangle free, soft, and shiny! She also loves using it after she washes her hair. It used to take her a long time to comb out her hair, but not anymore. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my 18 month old  daughter. She doesn&#x27;t have much hair in the front or sides but her hair in the back is getting long and was starting to get knotty and frizzy, completely opposite texture to her hair in the front. I bought this brush to try it and it has restored her hair to the smooth and silky texture that she originally had. This brush removes the knots in her hair pain-free and easily and she actually allows me to use it on her without fussing. The only issue I have is the cool design and color make it so that she wants to play with it. I have also used it on myself and it works great. Would highly recommend this brush and feel that it is worthy of the high price tag.</li>
    <li> I took some time to really put this brush to the test before I made my review. First let me start off by saying I have long hair that is thin, tangles easily, I have a ton of hair, and I enjoy changing my hair color frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the brush I had just had my hair stripped of color (bleached). So I knew my hair and scalp were in the recovery period from having all the natural oils taken out. I read that this brush massages your scalp when you use it. I have to say that it really does massage the scalp and it felt very good. I used it on my dry hair first to see if it would untangle it before I got in the shower. Yes I have to brush my hair before I wash it so I can get my finger through it while washing it. So I showered washed my hair and conditioned it like normal. So here came the real test after shower brushing. I could never brush my hair when wet or I&#x27;d lose a ton of hair and get the brush stuck. I typically used a large wide toothed comb. I started brushing and low and behold it actually made it through my hair! I was shocked and it wasn&#x27;t pulling, tugging, or ripping my hair out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe my success was a fluke. So I continued using the brush and it continued to work so well. I acutally started to notice my hair wasn&#x27;t as frizzy and damaged looking (this has nothing to do with my hair coloring). My hair brush used to look like someone attacked my hair with it because of how much hair it broke off and pulled out. This brush barely pulls any hair out at all and I assume it&#x27;s all lose because I don&#x27;t feel it pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using the brush I had my hair dyed bright pink. It&#x27;s a temporary dye so it goes through a lovely bleed out stage where it turns my towels and other things pink while it&#x27;s in that stage. I have a white and pale lavender bathroom so when I use to brush my hair after dying hair would fly all over the place and stick to the wall and doors which would stain them. After I dyed my hair I went outside to brush my hair while wet for the first time. I didn&#x27;t have any hair flying all over the place to the point that I have not had to clean any doors or walls since I dyed my hair pink and use this brush. I used my comb the other night on my wet hair and I had to pull some strands of hair off the door before it could stain because my hair was so tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who uses a brush. This brush is going to allow me to clean up and take my other brushes and combs out of my drawer in the bathroom to make room for other stuff. I&#x27;m so in love with this brush and how it works. I will never use a regular hair brush ever again.hair I went outside to brush my hair while wet for the first time.

    <li> Amazingly amazing.  My hair is a nightmare with a capital &amp;#34;N&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not long, but being colored over and over, coupled with bad quality of water we have here, every time I get out of the shower my hair look like a tangled mop. How can it even do that? It usually takes me at least 20 minutes to brush it through putting myself in danger to pulling off my own scalp in this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came across this brush browsing through Amazon goodies, I seriously thought that all the glowing reviews are fake. It looks like a regular-ish brush and what possibly can be so different about that? But I fell for it and very glad I did. This little pink thing is a miracle and probably will save me from going bold before my time. I was very excited to use it the first time and was AMAZED how easily it glided through my hair getting it untangled. The whole brushing procedure took about 2 minutes vs. the usual 20. And there were just a few hairs stuck in it. A lot less casualties than my old friend. I could not believe it. I am very, very happy and will buy another for my sister for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Everyday, as the minority (being the only male) in my family, I had to hear the groans and fights for the discomfort due to tangled hair as the kids need to rush to the school (as always they are always late to get up and hair combing is painful to watch). This one really changed it all. Now I dont have to sit through that circus. I was skeptic before ordering as I did not believe it would make a difference. My elder one has longer hair and she goes for swimming thrice a week, and had to shower bath everytime leading to lot of tangled hair.. this one just glides through; even though when we need to untangle a bit of hair, she says it does not hurt that much like before. Also it leaves the hair shiny and more uniform now. I usually get bad raps for the things I buy for them, but for this one, they all praise me. A life saver and I recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build is also good; feels strong. Color is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if I had to pick one thing that I dont like, the handle is bit smaller. But that does not stop me to give it five stars.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:8354b1389e31b4cfb3e2f21850e9e55]] Not only is this brush great for longer hair, but I found it to be good when I&#x27;m brushing all of the product out of my hair.  I have short hair that I use fiber paste and hair spray on, so brushing it out at night before bed is a must, otherwise I&#x27;m stabbing my husband with my sharp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush I have been using pulls and it hurts, but it was a necessary evil.  No longer with my Crave Naturals Glide-Thru Detangling Brush.  The brush gets through the product in my hair, making is \\&quot;uncrunchy\\&quot; in just a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Crave Naturals Glide-Thru Detangling Brush, because it makes quick, easy work of the product in my hair and leaves my hair soft and my scalp massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Went through my knotted hair so easily with no pain and no pulling. I was skeptical but I&#x27;m a believer now</li>
    <li> This brush really is amazing. I saw it posted from an Instagramer and loved what I saw. It detangles and smoothes hair out. I have very thick hair past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> This actually really works! This brush glides through my hair without getting so much hair pulled out like with my comb! My husband was very skeptical too but when he saw how much in ease I was while combing my wet hair he was also impressed. He is very much used to me combing my hair after washing it which can be kind of a hassle. I also love that the brush is formed &amp;#34;ergonomically&amp;#34;- it lays in my hand as if it is made for my hand and it is very light weight. I am gonna throw my comb away cause this brush is doing the job so much better! Love it and recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Awesome.  My granddaughter with long hair loves her new brush. Makes getting tangles out pain free. Great valentine day present for her</li>
    <li> Seriously an amazing product !</li>
    <li> Reading through some of the negative reviews I am shocked as I have no issues with the brush at all! I truly adore this brush and it has replaced all the other detangling brushes I have in my home. I wish I had known about the Crave naturals hair brush long ago so I could have had less of a headache over time. I have super long and curly thick hair that has been bleached a few times and dyed for many years. With other brushes I found myself loosing tons and tons of hair but with this one I lost a large amount of what Had been loose and causing the knots with my curls that the other brushes missed the first 2-3 times I used the brush. Once that was over I find myself shedding less and less. Anyone with long curly hair that seems to have a mind of its own knows how it is when it seems like your hair gets everywhere and I mean everywhere. After using this brush it just doesn&#x27;t happen anymore pretty soon my old man won&#x27;t even be able to complain that My hair has clogged up the drain in the tub. If you are looking for a brush to get the job done without all the fight then this is the brush for you.</li>
    <li> Just got this, and so far I love it! I have short, fine hair.  No more tangles!!  Works great on wet or dry hair and is doing a great job on my blow out, too!!  Pretty fun!</li>
    <li> Long thick haired people like myself need not use this product. I&#x27;ve given it 3 stars because my husband who has almost no hair uses it occasionally (shhh don&#x27;t tell him I said so) and it works ok for him. The Bristles are super flimsy and way too short. It&#x27;s just not meant for people with longer thick hair.</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Work very well on my daughter super long hair. Great customer service with following up email with advices on how to take better care of hair</li>
    <li> This brush wasn&#x27;t the miracle cure I was hoping for.  I have very long, very thick curly hair, and this brush still rips out oodles of hair - just as much (if not more) than my previous brush did, whether brushing wet or dry.  I included a (terribly quality - sorry) photo of the typical amount of hair I remove from the brush.  But where it DOES excel is the amount of pain - with this brush it is dramatically reduced, I&#x27;d say 75%.  I don&#x27;t know how this is possible, but it&#x27;s my honest experience.  It&#x27;s not painless - it still gets caught, it still snags and yanks, but the instance of this is far less than what I have experienced in the past.  I don&#x27;t really care about the amount of hair I lose every time I brush, but I DID care about the pain.  I am pleased with this brush.  Don&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; scenario - you will likely still lose hair, and still have pain from time to time, but this brush somehow makes those things easier to live with.</li>
    <li> I love the brush!  I am letting my hair grow out long as I begin to gray and it really helps to detangle my hair. I also like the way it massages my scalp as I brush.  My two year old Granddaughter was here when the brush arrived.  No more fussing when I brushed her hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves her brush.  She has 3c hair and it works wonders.  I think I&#x27;m going to get this brush for my niece next.</li>
    <li> I purchased the brush as an alternative to the &amp;#34;Michel Mercier Detangling Brush&amp;#34; that I had been considering checking out for a while.  That brush did not rate as well as this one on Amazon and I liked the reviews I read here , so that&#x27;s why I decided to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My six-year-old daughter has normal Caucasian hair (average thickness, smooth texture), about four inches past her shoulders in length.  It gets really full of tangles and it can be very difficult to work through in the mornings, especially if it&#x27;s not brushed out and braided the night before.  Anyways, we have been using it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with it......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle brush in that you can&#x27;t merely stroke from the very top of the head and it magically takes care of the tangles as you stroke down (and, I was not expecting it to be -- those commercials for the competitor&#x27;s brush in particular lead one to think theirs will which I totally do not believe) -- you still need to work from the bottom up, but it&#x27;s MUCH easier with this brush than a standard hair brush.  Cuts down on the time, effort, and fussing in the morning considerably compared to the regular brush we had been using.  It should be noted that if your child gets something sticky in her hair, this brush will not magically comb through that and is no better than a regular brush in dealing with that (thus, you need to wash out the sticky stuff first!).  It should be noted that I&#x27;ve always used a detangling spray when brushing (and a conditioner after shampooing) and continue to do so with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a brush that makes dealing with tangles easier, this one is definitely better than a standard hairbrush!  Well worth the $15 - $16 I paid for it.  NOTE:  It may look &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; due to it&#x27;s all plastic-like construction, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
    <li> This item works wonders by itself and with the Giovonni leave in conditioner. My daughter has extra thick hair and with this product, I definitely don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time detangling it.</li>
    <li> Tried many. This is the best yet for my young girls! !!</li>
    <li> This brush actually does do what it says, it glides through my daughters wet hair very easily. I&#x27;m very happy I got this one. So is my daughter. :)</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this  brush.  Detangling is a necessary evil for length retention so I have been in need of finding a more time effective solution.  This is it!  It&#x27;s perfection on whatever grade of hair, straightened or coily. I use it when I cowash in the shower and it separates my strands like a hot knife through butter. I also bought the Denman brush to compare and this brush is definitely better because it&#x27;s more delicate on the individual strand. It&#x27;s more effective than finger detangling for me because I am not a patient person and so many times I end up not being thorough as I rush to finish my never ending head of hair. This allows me to go through my whole head of thick 4C natural hair with ease. Like 15 minutes. You can&#x27;t beat that! Would recommend up and down and I will probably buy more for different bags and compartments so I am never without it.</li>
    <li> Holy moly this brush has brought me so much relief and ENDED the power struggle of brushing my toddler&#x27;s curly mop!!  I always felt horrible for putting her through pain by combing out her tangles (with a comb and detangle spray). But I didn&#x27;t want her hair turning into knots.  I would either hold her down, with her crying, or I would chase her around the house. I would be super frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this brush. She saw the bright pink color and immediately started BRUSHING HER OWN HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEOPLE. SHE IS A YEAR AND A HALF OLD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she went to each family member to brush OUR hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried brushing her hair with it, SHE LET ME. And the brush did not hurt her! The brushing process went so fast, no fighting!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I get a very kind, personalized follow up email from the company, checking in to see if I am satisfied with the product. How cool is that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I&#x27;ve already recommended to many friends this brush, and I plan on making a facebook status update about it!</li>
    <li> I love this just used it on my long thick hair and it worked prefect without me getting one tear in my eye!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> My favorite new brush...I have long thick hair that just knots all the time ..this brush glides right thru it works for all hair types as well def. a must have!!!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the brush.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t claim to be the ultimate solution to tangled hair and some of the alternate suggestions are pretty basic. Regardless, ordered another one as a gift for my adult daughter ... and would be tempted to order another one for me if it was available in turquoise ;-)</li>
    <li> very good quality. will recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this brush. I have very thin hair and it untangles it very well.</li>
    <li> My very sensitive daughter loves it and she has very coarse curly hair that knots easily.</li>
    <li> Awsume product must use it</li>
    <li> Pretty nice. Soft bristles. Good for detangling, not great for pulling your hair back in a pony-- but i use this first to detangle, and then my tighter regular brush to pull it up In a pony.</li>
    <li> Nice design, love the color hot pink, and no more tangles!</li>
