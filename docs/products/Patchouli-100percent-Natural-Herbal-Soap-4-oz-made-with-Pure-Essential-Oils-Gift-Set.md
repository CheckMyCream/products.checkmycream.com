<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is really great soap</li>
    <li> Purchase five of these expensive soaps based off the majority of reviews. I DO LOVE the fragrance of Patchouli. I should have listened to the minority posting about this soap. It smells NOTHING like Patchouli. In fact, the smell that was supposed to be emanating from the box was apparently lost during the shipment... because there was none! I have purchased other Patchouli soaps and will go back to those as those truly DO emanate the fragrance.  Poor customer relations in trying to resolve issues of returning product.  Nice boxing of soap, however, one of the boxes looks like it too may have been returned as it was dirty.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Just wish it were not so costly. It feels wonderful on our skin and the patchouli scent is perfect. Not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely delighted with this soap.  It appears to be of the highest quality and is wonderfully fragrant.  The patchouli scent is very natural and the soap produces a nice lather.  This is an all around wonderful soap.  I will definitely reorder this one.</li>
    <li> A beautiful soap with a lasting aroma. It leaves my hand soft and clean. The scent lingers in the bathroom too. It would be a great gift. It is packaged like a gift. The box is the type a gift comes in and has a modest ribbon on it. Inside, the soap is nested in a neatly folded piece of gift tisse paper.</li>
    <li> Great smelling, and leaves my skin so soft. Store bought soap drys my skin.. perfect size easy to hold.  Very long lasting.</li>
    <li> I ordered this just to try out a new type of patchouli soap.  It has a typical patchouli scent.  It&#x27;s not too light scented (like the Pre de Provence) yet not overpowering.  The best thing about this was the packaging.  Just like the picture, it came wrapped in tissue paper inside a gift box. Then the box was tied with a ribbon around the box.</li>
    <li> Stuff made me gag. Returned all of it for a refund. Worst smelling patchouli soap I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
    <li> Yes so glad I found spiritual sky! I&#x27;ve been&lt;br /&gt;Loving this since the 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Rate this 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic! My skin feels clean and I get all kinds of compliments on the great smell.</li>
    <li> Smells perfect, love the after glow of the use of it. It has such a wonderful earthy smell that leaves me relaxed and tranquil.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Delicious smell, great lather.  Good buy</li>
    <li> This was my second try at patchouli scented soap. This one is a bit better that the Zum wash since the aroma isnt as odd.  Again here, the scent mellows out on the skin and all thats left is patchouli but getting beyond the onset of the soaps aroma is tough.&lt;br /&gt;experiment over - Im going back to sea Salts and herbals like basil and sage.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> These natural soaps leave my skin feeling clean and I feel good knowing I am not putting anything fake onto my skin.  I&#x27;m so glad amazon is stocking these here as it is quite difficult to find in any stores. I asked the grocery store about it and they looked at me funny.  They are missing out!</li>
    <li> Anyone who likes patchouli will love this soap.  It is a great product and wonderful true patchoule scent.  Whole bathroom smells wonderful!  Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Lovely soap - smells great</li>
    <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The soap smells amazing, (I should have bought one for myself) and it comes in a cute box; no need to wrap it. Perfect for gift giving any time of the year.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend who loves the scent-which is very subtle in fragrance but high in moisturizers. She likes it!</li>
    <li> The packaging was more than I expected!  I love seeing a package on my doorstep, but once I opened this one it was as if I was receiving a special gift.  And the aroma of the soap...pure bliss.  I have used this soap for the past three mornings and I love the way it leaves me clean (no soap residue), but the aroma remains.  I highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SOAP AND WILL BE PURCHASING MORE!!</li>
    <li> The smell is nice def , the only thing is that the soap melts really quickly</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap. Works great. Smells wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Great packaging, however, the soap itself is just ok. Not silky smooth. The bar kind of sticks to your skin as you wash. Weird. And the scent is not as strong as I would like. But, again, have to hand it to them for the packaging. Nice gift.</li>
    <li> Being a long time fan of the Patchouli scent, I decided I wanted to check to see if there was such a thing as patchouli scented soap, and to my surprise, there is.  After browsing a little on the net, I was led here, to Amazon, and this particular product stood out above the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with it. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The patchouli scent is perfect. Not overpowering and not too faint that you don&#x27;t detect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s nice, big bar, and not one that you feel as though you were ripped off by a picture that was taken to make the product look bigger than it is. This bar is a very nice size, and perhaps a little bigger than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The price is very, very reasonable.  Little over 6 bucks to have such a nice bar of soap delivered. Not too much to spend for a little self-indulgence in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The packaging and look of the product is top notch.  A very nice little bow around a tasteful, organic looking box is the perfect complement to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this item and will definitely do it again.</li>
    <li> THE BEST Pachouli scented soap I have found.  It is creamy, does not dissolve in the shower like other &#x27;specialty soaps&#x27;.  The scent is as strong today, one month later as it was the day I received it.  The scent puts this ole&#x27; gal in a great mood....even at 6:00 a.m. heading to work.  Will definitely purchase again.  Comes in a NICE quality little brown box, delicately wrapped in tissue with a cute seal..and nice elastic brown ribbon.  PERFECT for a hostess gift.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOODNESS. i LOVE this soap. i have a regular soap maker who recently stopped making this scent so i turned to amazon. i recommend this shop to buy from because the price, the soap and the packaging are pleasing. plus it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Last a long time and the aroma is long lasting. My bathroom smells fantastic. As soon as I open the door it&#x27;s an air freshner!</li>
    <li> A lovely package that can never conceal the nature of the contents; the scent wafts me back to my past.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality product</li>
    <li> This soap was great and packaged beautifully! My only complaint is that it did not last very long. It made it through only 10 showers. The smell is amazing and I would like to use it all the time but with shipping costs on top of the soap cost there is no way I could afford a bar every 2 weeks. My request is either cheaper, or more compacted soap so it lasts longer. I dont regret buying it, I may buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my son, as he loves the scent.  He called and thanked me for it.  He had bought a cheap brand and it did not meet his expectations, so threw it away.  Said this was high quality.</li>
    <li> This is great smelling soap. I will buy more!</li>
    <li> I love all natural soaps and this one is heavenly. They come nicely packaged in little boxes - perfect to give as gifts. Of course I kept this purchase for myself.</li>
    <li> Great. Not oily but medicates great for shaving. Fragrant (if you like Patchouli !</li>
    <li> It looks beautiful, but has barely any patchouli scent...it smells waxy and weak....not buying again, in fact, I threw out the bar after one use because I was so disappointed. I usually use Zum Bar and its the best.</li>
    <li> Now that&#x27;s patchouli!!  I will definitely buy this again. My entire bathroom smells of this wonderful patchouli.</li>
    <li> Sent these as a gift to my sister, who loves Patchouli but sometimes hard to find the best.  She was THRILLED -- the scent is divine and the look of the soaps is simply beautiful.  Great seller, too.</li>
    <li> Works great on your skin, makes it feel nice and soft. Also very good for any mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> Love my patchouli  soap. Makes my whole house smelll good and it&#x27;s wonderful on the hands.</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance and skin smells nice after use!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 6 months or so and I love it. I always get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling patchouli soaps I&#x27;ve found in years.  I have pieces of it in everyone of my drawers.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> A buddy of mine recommended this soap and I decided to give it a try.  It lathers great, has a wonderful long lasting scent and I would now also recommend it to others.  In addition, it was delivered much faster than the time give when I purchased it.  I am a new lifelong customer to this product and company.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The sent is natural &amp; long lasting. I cut the bar in half. This soap lasts a lot longer than the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I will say that it is a nice moisturizing soap. However the patchouli scent is barely detectable.</li>
    <li> If you love patchouli, you&#x27;ll love this soap.</li>
    <li> smells great and leaves skin smooth my mom loved it</li>
    <li> The soap is thick, has great lather and the scent is just right. It lingers on your hands and a hints remains for a while.</li>
    <li> Great that has disinfecting properties.  Great for men who have strong body odor and stinky feet.  Package arrived in perfect condition and on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my mother as a gift, and she absolutely loves it.  She said the patchouli scent is wonderful, and it leaves a faint smell throughout her apartment.  You have to like the smell of patchouli, though!  The soap itself is also fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great soap. Smells like a Indian Forrest</li>
    <li> Fairly strong smelling soap, pleasant, does soften well but holds up ok when soaking in water, but I would drain off water once showered.  The rectangular shape is a tad awkward but ok.</li>
    <li> Pretty good soap. Didn&#x27;t smell exactly how I wanted it to, but still decent. Is kinda drying, but the scent stays on for a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful bar of soap and it lathers really well. I do feel clean after my bath but there is very little to no fragrance.</li>
    <li> One click above average. Keep shopping.</li>
    <li> Smells great awesome packaging and I would buy again</li>
    <li> this was exceptionally packaged &amp; also has the best patchouli fragrance .... almost to nice to use ... had a nice note in it to enjoy!thx! this was sent fast ... &amp; i have this in my other bathroom ... the whole house--- now is taken care of, back in the days of the 60&#x27;s .... smells great! thx!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I had anticipated and I was disappointed that the scent was less than overwhelming and faded too quickly for the price paid.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not the best</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> smells great, but not too strong. nice lather. all around good soap. I would happily buy other products from this maker.</li>
    <li> i have bought plantlife soaps for years and love the feel of my skin after i use it and the smell is wonderful.  the box is a lovely touch and is a great idea for a gift..  keeping this for myself</li>
    <li> love it love it love it!! So natural and scent is a distinct woodsy scent .  Buy it and try it!</li>
    <li> This soap was fabulous, Patchouli is from the Mint family, it had a musk smell. After you used it you could smell it on your body during the day, loved it.My partner also loved it, (not good). I need to find a soap hiding place before I order more.</li>
    <li> Not overpowering but leaves a nice light scent on your body.</li>
    <li> I loved this soap.  Great patchouli scent and the scent really lasted to the end of the bar.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many brands of patchouli soap with many losing their fragrance quickly. NOT THIS ONE ! I love it and will a loyal buyer.</li>
    <li> The smell is okay. I wouldn&#x27;t put the soap in a cardboard box anymore though as it kinda smells like cardboard and soap....</li>
    <li> If you never smelled Patchouli Herbal soap you are missing out. I put mine in with stored clothes in the dresser</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell so good till you get it on your face or hands. It doesn&#x27;t stay with you that long. I think I might have to change my rating to a 3. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> This soap is ok but I won&#x27;t buy it again. I do like the smell and the fact it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin very long at all.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loved it. The scent was quite nice and permiated the surrounding rooms. I thought the next time I&#x27;d try a different brand, and cheaper. Boy, we were both disappointed! This time I bought 4 to keep him happy for awhile. Great homemade soap with a great smell. Will continue to buy from this seller. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> nice box. although I wasn&#x27;t to impressed with the scent. unlike other comments that made my decision to purchase it, I did not smell it after I used the product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but if the smell is any indication I will definitely like it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Will order more</li>
    <li> I keep the unwrapped soap in my bathroom as a permanent air freshener - love it! - arrived quicky as well</li>
    <li> Loved the fragrance (one star), loved the lather (one star), but not at all an economical soap.  Went through it way too fast.</li>
    <li> Good soap, great scent</li>
    <li> Oh my god this is the best soap every I will buy more&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> really good soap...had a little ashy smell. but other wise it was fine.</li>
    <li> My husband is a big fan of Patchouli, I ordered him a variety of patchouli soap to try and this was by far the best! It smelled the best, shipped in a beautiful little gift box and lasted a good long time. We will order it again soon!</li>
    <li> It smells so good, makes the whole room smell good, I hope I don&#x27;t get used to the smell and can&#x27;t smell it anymore, that will be a sad day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like good living, then you will like this soap.</li>
    <li> If you love the scent of patchouli you will love this soap!  It lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and of course the scent is heavenly.  I also cut off a piece of the bar and put it in my lingerie drawer.</li>
    <li> When my husband recommended this soap to buy I was ready to love it but, when I used the soap it wasn&#x27;t as lovely as I was hoping. It smelled great but didn&#x27;t dry after a day of not using and stained orange on its resting rack. Probably not buy again unless I could pick the bar I wanted in a store.</li>
    <li> Nice gift box ready to give away (if you want!). It&#x27;s a nice smelling soap for the bathroom and also an excellent shower soap.</li>
    <li> The soap arrived as described, complete with the pretty packaging, and in a timely manner. The scent is lovely and true patchouli; the downside is the LACK of potency. I went with other reviewers who stated that it gave their bathrooms a whiff of the scent; not true in my case. No odor whatsoever unless the face is pressed against the bar of soap; therefore my disappointment. The soap is is a good quality grade; just not what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the shipping on this was so much.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is okay but perhaps my expectations were too high as I thought it would not look so average.</li>
    <li> this soap is the best. i love patchouli. very nice smell and makes your skin nice and soft. very well worth the money</li>
    <li> Love the smell, its earthy and comes beautifully packaged. Will order again and will check out the other soaps. :)</li>
    <li> Love this soap and it has a very nice patchouli scent (definitely there but not overwhelming). The bar is large and should last quite a while.  The packaging is also very nice and though I purchased this for myself I would purchase it again as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is the best patchouli soap I have ever purchased and used. I&#x27;ve been buying patchouli soap in many varieties from many companies for the last 20 years and this one is the best. Strong scent, smooth, long lasting bar. I feel like im treating myself to the spa when I use it! But the highlight is, its the most inexpensive patchouli soap I&#x27;ve ever bought. Generous bar and lowest price with genuine patchouli scent:) thanks for sharing your products on Amazon. Im looking forward to trying your essential oil roll ons next. Keep the patchouli coming! I&#x27;ve just reordered:)</li>
    <li> I am the Patchouli Queen...I have tried so many soaps and so many fall short to holding the true scent.&lt;br /&gt;This Soap Is FANTASTIC and great smelling Patchouli....no skimping on the essence...and does not smell like lye!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the soap for myself.  It came in such a lovely package I decided to gift it to a friend.</li>
    <li> It was good but the bar of soap lost it&#x27;s scent way before I finished it,however I would recommend this soap if you&#x27;re a&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli lover.</li>
    <li> This is will be the shortest review I&#x27;ll ever write:  Awesome Soap if your a fan of the scent and the patchouli is so strong you can smell it through the Amazon box it&#x27;s shipped in. Enuff said -- take my money.</li>
    <li> These bars began to almost &#x27;melt&#x27; in the shower while sitting in the soap dish, not being used.  I&#x27;m afraid that they will not last long, and were too expensive to fall apart so soon.  Good smell, but bummed that I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;ll get my money out of it.</li>
    <li> Soap smells SOOO good !  Got my order right away also - did not have to wait very long  !</li>
    <li> An awesome soap which leaves skin soft and a subtle fragrance which lasts and lasts!...I even save a bar to wash my puppy-dog and he smells fresh all week!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but I&#x27;ve used stronger smelling soap.</li>
    <li> Better than described. Lathers really well and you can smell this raw fragrance on you all day.  I am re-ordering!</li>
    <li> a great lathering soap with a nice woodsey smell that does not overwhelm and dry out skin. the bar lasts a long time also</li>
    <li> Wish I had ordered a 100 of them, beautiful package and delightful smell.</li>
    <li> great soap, I really enjoyed it and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best patchouli soap I&#x27;ve ever had.  The scent is intense and shows no sign of fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is so big that I cut it in half, to use one half at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, though-the soap is *very* soft, so it kind of makes a mess in the soap dish.</li>
    <li> Makes a beautiful gift.  Scent stays with you, doesn&#x27;t just wash away.</li>
    <li> Such a cute little box. I love Patchouli, and so does a friend of mine. I hope she likes it c:</li>
    <li> How many times do you buy a soap and the fragrance doesnt last.  Well this does and so soft!!!!  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the price.  Very costly for soap with shipping and all.  Other than that I loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Grand-daughter for this xmas.  She loved it.  I ordered Sandlewood and the aroma was fantastic.  I liked it so much I am going to buy me some.  Shipping was speedy.  Very good purchase. Arrived in a cute lil box with a ribbon.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap....Wonderful fragrance that leaves &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; of a scent behind. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Recently tried a number of Patchouli products and this soap has by far the best smell. Not overpowering but a light lingering smell that stays with you all day long. Great price and fast shipping means ill be ordering more soon</li>
    <li> Love it! After landscaping all day I&#x27;m dirty, all I want is to small nice and be clean. This soap is so soft it just feels wonderful. To feeling clean!!!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap and the feel of the suds.  Also bought one for my son, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> good stuff great for my skin and smells sooo good</li>
    <li> Patchouli yes. But this soap was so strongly scented it was unusable.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap.  The smell is so wonderful, it envelopes the senses.  The smell of patchouli from the soap stayed on my skin for a few hours.  The soap lasted for a little over six weeks and I bathe daily, sometimes twice a day.  The only negative I am write about is the packaging.  The gift box packaging is very nice but not really practical if you are just buying the soap for yourself and not necessarily giving it as a gift.  I really wish the seller would knock off a dollar on price of a buyer doesn&#x27;t want the gift box option.  I did message the seller and they said they don&#x27;t lower the price if a person doesn&#x27;t want the box packaging.  Other than that, the soap is great...true patchouli through and through.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly. Great packaging. Looks great to give as a gift as is. I get compliments on the way my house smells after I&#x27;ve showered with it. I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Rinses off easy with no over drying..</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this soap fills the house.  Did wonders on my dry skin and keeps your body scented all day.</li>
