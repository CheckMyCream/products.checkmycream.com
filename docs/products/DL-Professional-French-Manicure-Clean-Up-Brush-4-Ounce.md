      <li>Perfect stiffness and shape for cleaning up manicures</li>
      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>Works perfect!</li>
      <li>If the brush was fuller, it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great price,perfect.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>, maybe I just need more practice, but still very nice brush</li>
      <li>Nice brush, the shap is helpful.</li>
      <li>Great brushes for French tips,  makes perfect smile lines, also great for clean-up.</li>
      <li>Doing my own french gel manicures, this brush is awesome!</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>I love these freaking brushes.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it.</li>
      <li>did my nails :)</li>
      <li>Nice clean up brush.</li>
      <li>I still use it as my clean up brush for now, as I&#x27;ve not found a suitable replacement for the cheap lip brush I was using before.</li>
      <li>but they are more for detail clean up.</li>
      <li>I got this primarily to be a manicure clean-up brush, to touch up around the edges and cuticles.</li>
      <li>very useful</li>
      <li>Helps create that smooth, clean line.</li>
      <li>Good but slightly to big for me to clean the edges</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and seems to be holding up good.  </li>
      <li>Helps with smile lines and polish clean up.  </li>
      <li>The brush itself is good, but I wish the bristles were a bit more stiff.</li>
      <li>The bristles are high quality and it is super easy to clean when done.  </li>
      <li>, these are the absolute bomb!!</li>
      <li>Great little brushes.  </li>
      <li>so I can attempt to paint my own white tips.</li>
      <li>I keep one taped to the outside of my nail polish remover bottle and have really liked using it.  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time and was exactly as it was stated in description.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t do french manicures for myself to try out its smile line clean up capabilities.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a great shape, not too big, not too little, and the glue stands up against the 100% acetone I use and manages to keep the bristles in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still perfecting this, but the bristles are perfectly straight and the size of this brush works well.</li>
      <li>This brush does the job really well.</li>
      <li>As described, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Used to clean my nails with orange stick with cotton, but this is fantastic-not only for french manicure but to clean all borders and cuticle.  </li>
      <li>Makes a nice smile line for the French manicure but picks up and wastes a lot of product (acetone).  </li>
      <li>so I have to be extra careful making the line nice and straight, but it still works.</li>
      <li>You just have to be patient and have steady hands.</li>
      <li>I would still highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I use Shellac nail color, damp brush with alcohol, dry excess on a paper towel and clean nail color from area around the nail.  </li>
      <li>it makes french manicures so much easier!</li>
      <li>I get a professional manicure home made!</li>
      <li>The seller isn&#x27;t properly taking orders for the pack of 2, and I only received 1 for the full 2-pack price.</li>
      <li>Brush hairs are sturdy but not stiff.</li>
      <li>now i look like a professional</li>
      <li>Makes it so much easier to get the defined lines i need on my french manicure!</li>
      <li>So obsessed I bought more!</li>

<li> Unfortunately, this brush is too large and flexible to serve that purpose</li>
<li> When I would do my manicure, the brush is a little bit uneven</li>
<li> Seriously; I&#x27;ve been into doing my nails for years and these are, hands down,</li>
<li> not sure who i contact about that...</li>
<li> Not a happy camper.</li>

    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as it was stated in description.</li>
    <li> I always use this little tool for the detail on my French manicure with gel polish. Works perfect!</li>
    <li> I literally just received my order and there was only one brush in my two pack....not sure who i contact about that...</li>
    <li> So obsessed I bought more! Perfect stiffness and shape for cleaning up manicures, these are the absolute bomb!!</li>

    <li> Excellent. very useful</li>
    <li> My wife is a nail tech, she loves these brushes ! That&#x27;s all I can say!</li>
    <li> This brush does the job really well. If the brush was fuller, it would be perfect. When I would do my manicure, the brush is a little bit uneven so I have to be extra careful making the line nice and straight, but it still works. You just have to be patient and have steady hands. Since it comes with two, I might just trim one of the brush and see how that would work.</li>
    <li> Good but slightly to big for me to clean the edges, maybe I just need more practice, but still very nice brush</li>
    <li> The seller isn&#x27;t properly taking orders for the pack of 2, and I only received 1 for the full 2-pack price. The brush itself is good, but I wish the bristles were a bit more stiff. Amazon took care of me and refunded me for 1 brush.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, the shap is helpful.</li>
    <li> I thought the brushes would have been a normal size they are small and I got 2 of them and I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them but they are more for detail clean up.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Helps with smile lines and polish clean up.  Brush hairs are sturdy but not stiff. I am happy with my purchase.</li>

    <li> why did i wait so darn long before i bought this?! it makes french manicures so much easier! now i look like a professional did my nails :)</li>
    <li> the bristles on the brush fell off after one use. Not a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I can attempt to paint my own white tips. Works great. Helps create that smooth, clean line. I&#x27;ve used it several times and seems to be holding up good.  No loose/wild bristles.</li>
    <li> cleans up those oops polishing mistakes</li>
    <li> Doing my own french gel manicures, this brush is awesome!</li>
    <li> Great little brushes.  You get 2 in the set and they are about 2/3 the size of a pencil.  I keep one taped to the outside of my nail polish remover bottle and have really liked using it.  The bristles are high quality and it is super easy to clean when done.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The item worked for what I wanted to use it for. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
