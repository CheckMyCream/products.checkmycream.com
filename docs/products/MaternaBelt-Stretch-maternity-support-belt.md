      <li>It&#x27;s also much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>support, I like this better than the under belly ones bc</li>
      <li>and I am on my feet most of that day and moving around A LOT.</li>
      <li>This belt, worn on top of the Cantaloop support band is what gets me through my day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is much more support than a belly band(a joke).</li>
      <li>When looking for maternity belts, I read a lot of reviews and found that I had to choose between more support or more comfort.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily adjustable, as you can just pull the back straps to wherever feels best for you.</li>
      <li>I found it is very comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have had a great pregnancy thus far</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and stays where I want it to be.</li>
      <li>and I got a size large, which is perfect because I know my belly will get bigger</li>
      <li>Specially during jogging and working.</li>
      <li>It has a strong but soft, flexible band that makes you feel very secure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant</li>
      <li>super stretchy too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I was a size 12 when I got pregnant</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty comfortable for a maternity belt.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t go 20 mins, I was super hot and super sweaty.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a  comfortable support band that actually works I cannot recommend a better one than this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s breathable so I am able to wear it to work under my scrubs (I&#x27;m an RN on a busy med/surg floor).</li>
      <li>This belt gave me the right amount of support I needed.</li>
      <li>great support, I have carried my baby all out front, and this helps with that feeling that my belly might rip open any second!</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>My hips definitely feel better at the end of the day when I wear this.</li>
      <li>Thank you SO much!</li>
      <li>my back(I have never had pain like this before, then again its my first pregnancy).</li>
      <li>I am now almost 30 weeks and the large is just the right size.</li>
      <li>My back hurt while using this more than with out.</li>
      <li>Keeps that big belly from flopping over and hurting :)</li>
      <li>And I wear a uniform so for me to say it doesn&#x27;t make me hot and sweaty</li>
      <li>so I ordered a LARGE size.</li>
      <li>In terms of sizing, I wore large shirts and size</li>
      <li>got the large as was recommended in their sizing chart and it fits with tons of room to grow.  </li>
      <li>So when I say its a great breathable material, I mean it!</li>
      <li>Love how wide it is.</li>
      <li>It will probably work trough the whole pregnancy, since you can adjust the strap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I could control how much pressure I needed on what days.</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife, and she absolutely cannot do anything without this.</li>
      <li>I really feel the difference if I don&#x27;t use my belt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it.but</li>
      <li>I love that its soft enough to wear in bed.  </li>
      <li>Much better than those thinner bands, those other ones don&#x60;t seem to hold your tummy in very well.  </li>
      <li>I tried using one of those belts I bought from Walmart a long time ago, OMG huge mistake.</li>
      <li>I am pregnant with my second child</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be realistic people.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this maternity belt.</li>
      <li>and I found myself getting much larger much faster than with my first.</li>
      <li>Now I used it only for few days, but It looks a very good support belt, especially for my back.</li>
      <li>Their customer service goes above and beyond and is very fast to respond to any questions.</li>
      <li>Fabric is very soft.</li>
      <li>skin is sensitive, and this belt is soft and does not irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you have to adjust it quite frequently.</li>
      <li>Provides firm, comfortable support.</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be that I have worn this belt so much that it has almost worn out (the fabric where the velcro attaches is wearing out), but thankfully I called the company and they are sending me  a new belt for free.</li>
      <li>The extra weight was really hurting my back.</li>
      <li>I ordered 5 different maternity support devices when I developed severe lower back pain and also an umbilical hernia.</li>
      <li>At 18 weeks, the large was a little big, and I had to put it on the tightest setting.</li>

    <li> Not easy to put on.  Returned it</li>
    <li> great support, I have carried my baby all out front, and this helps with that feeling that my belly might rip open any second!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. Now I used it only for few days, but It looks a very good support belt, especially for my back. It will probably work trough the whole pregnancy, since you can adjust the strap.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give five stars because it&#x27;s a little bit bigger than expected. I checked the size-info panel, and got the one corresponding my measurement, but it&#x27;s not as fitted than I tough. Still, it&#x27;s a good support belt, nothing compared to the bellaband.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 different maternity support devices when I developed severe lower back pain and also an umbilical hernia. Nothing even comes close to this one! It has a strong but soft, flexible band that makes you feel very secure. It is adjustable so it can grow with you as you get bigger. I wear this every second of the day except for when I am showering. I hate to take it off! It&#x27;s breathable so I am able to wear it to work under my scrubs (I&#x27;m an RN on a busy med/surg floor). If you&#x27;re looking for a  comfortable support band that actually works I cannot recommend a better one than this. I showed it to my OB/GYN and she was also impressed. Their customer service goes above and beyond and is very fast to respond to any questions. Thank you SO much!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, and she absolutely cannot do anything without this. She is 7+months. Specially during jogging and working.</li>
    <li> I am so grateful I got this belt. I have had a great pregnancy thus far but once I hit 5 months I have had terrible back pain. I bought this belt because I was pretty much desperate to try anything to help my back(I have never had pain like this before, then again its my first pregnancy). I am SOOOO SUPER Happy I bought this. Not only does it take the back pain away and support me where I need it, it allows my mid-section to breathe as well. I tried using one of those belts I bought from Walmart a long time ago, OMG huge mistake. I couldn&#x27;t go 20 mins, I was super hot and super sweaty. Here are my stats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I was a size 12 when I got pregnant and I got a size large, which is perfect because I know my belly will get bigger but the belt fits now.&lt;br /&gt;-I work 12 hours a day and I am on my feet most of that day and moving around A LOT. So when I say its a great breathable material, I mean it! I would know. And I wear a uniform so for me to say it doesn&#x27;t make me hot and sweaty is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;-My skin is sensitive, and this belt is soft and does not irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps anyone that is thinking about purchasing this amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> did not hep  me at all. THere was no support to this at all! My back hurt while using this more than with out.</li>
    <li> Love this belt! I suffer from diastasis recti (abdominal separation) and have been able to find nothing that helps. This is my third pregnancy and with two little ones to take care of, I was in dire need of something. This belt, worn on top of the Cantaloop support band is what gets me through my day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For support, I like this better than the under belly ones bc it gives me that lift I need plus compresses the torn abs. It&#x27;s also much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing it beware of though is that it seems to run big. I bought mine off off the Materna Belt website and followed their guidelines for sizing. According to the measurements I should wear a medium but it came and was way too big! The small was for me, with plenty of room to grow.</li>
    <li> Not a super fan of this maternity belt. It bunches and you have to adjust it quite frequently. BUT it does the job when I need the extra support being out and about.</li>
    <li> This belt has been a lifesaver. I&#x27;ve had really bad back pain during my 3rd trimester and wearing this is the only way to walk around and get through the day.</li>
    <li> This is the best investment. Took away side pain and back pain associated with pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Super comfortable and fits perfect!  I can wear this all day without even thinking about it.  It&#x27;s very secure and easy to wear!  Fabric is very soft.</li>
    <li> This is my 5th pregnancy and this is the best pregnancy belly band I&#x60;ve ever owned!!&lt;br /&gt;such a great price and a very high quality garment.  Love how wide it is. Much better than those thinner bands, those other ones don&#x60;t seem to hold your tummy in very well.  This one is wide, but doesn&#x60;t roll or ride up at all.  It&#x60;s super stretchy too. I love that its soft enough to wear in bed.  I wear it all night and makes for a better nights sleep.  Keeps that big belly from flopping over and hurting :)&lt;br /&gt;Also holds me together when I have to get up to pee 3 times a night.&lt;br /&gt;I got the large as was recommended in their sizing chart and it fits with tons of room to grow.  I&#x27;m 18 weeks today.</li>
    <li> This belt gave me the right amount of support I needed. It was adjustable all I could control how much pressure I needed on what days. I wore this every day throughout my last 2 trimesters, and for 3 weeks postpartum my csection. The Velcro was heavy duty enough for me. Some of these reviews are ridiculous. It&lt;br /&gt;There is no miracle product that will make your pregnancy a breeze, our a product that is going to last forever with no signs of use. Let&#x27;s be realistic people. This is a great support band that helped me tremendously get the weight of my baby off of my pelvis MOST OF THE TIME. All babies and pregnancies are different.This is much more support than a belly band(a joke). Good luck mamas and this is just the beginning. There is no magic thing to solve all your problems but simply a few things that might make life a little less painful.</li>
    <li> I loved this support belt!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried  many others before, this one is very soft material but still gives you just the perfect amount of support that you need to feel the relive.&lt;br /&gt;And I really feel the difference if I don&#x27;t use my belt.&lt;br /&gt;I am for sure buying for my pregnant friends !!</li>
    <li> Saved my back while working during pregnancy!  Provides firm, comfortable support.</li>
    <li> This belt has been great in helping with the pain I was having from my growing uterus during my 4th pregnancy. I can&#x27;t go a day without it. It&#x27;s pretty comfortable for a maternity belt. I highly recommend this maternity belt.</li>
    <li> When looking for maternity belts, I read a lot of reviews and found that I had to choose between more support or more comfort. I knew if it was really uncomfortable I would never wear it, so I went with this one. It is very comfortable and provides sufficient support for my needs. My hips definitely feel better at the end of the day when I wear this. It&#x27;s easy to put on and stays where I want it to be. It&#x27;s easily adjustable, as you can just pull the back straps to wherever feels best for you.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant with my second child and I found myself getting much larger much faster than with my first. The extra weight was really hurting my back. I also have an umbilical hernia which protrudes enough to be seen through my clothes. I bought this belt after one of my friends recommended it. It has been a lifesaver! My back doesn&#x27;t hurt even after a long day on my feet in the lab. It also relieved my umbilical hernia pain. I have worn it basically 24/7 for the past 3.5 months (I started wearing it at about 18 weeks believe it or not). I sleep in it and everything. It lays flat under my clothes and in fact hides my protruding belly button! I showed it to my doctor who even recommended that I wear it during delivery to help relieve pressure off the umbilical hernia. In terms of sizing, I wore large shirts and size 10-12 pants pre-pregnancy so I ordered a LARGE size. At 18 weeks, the large was a little big, and I had to put it on the tightest setting. I am now almost 30 weeks and the large is just the right size. My only complaint would be that I have worn this belt so much that it has almost worn out (the fabric where the velcro attaches is wearing out), but thankfully I called the company and they are sending me  a new belt for free. Amazing customer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and I have a small belly,so I don&#x27;t really use it.but I found it is very comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I brought it when I was 5 months and size L.</li>
    <li> This belly belt was a blessing!  I tried several types of belly belts but was unimpressed.  This belt did not bunch, shift or cut into my belly like other belts.  I LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> Meh. Tried it once. So uncomfortable.</li>
