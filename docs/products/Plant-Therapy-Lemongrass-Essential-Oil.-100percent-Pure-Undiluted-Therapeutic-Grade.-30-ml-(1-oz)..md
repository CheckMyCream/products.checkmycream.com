<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. I put a drop of it in everything - my laundry, dish water, diffuser, etc. Really brings a fresh clean scent to the house.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It smells great!  I will be using it to bait our top-bar beehive and to make some coconut soap.</li>
    <li> This brand is tolerable for the husband where some of the expensive ones make him cough</li>
    <li> This is a vey nice quality oil with a refreshing, lovely scent.  Lemongrass is an all time favorite of mine.  This appears to be just as good of quality as Young Living and at a significant savings.  I don&#x27;t ingest this oil but use in a diffuser or in mix with other essential oils and would absolutely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I use this for hiking and cycling, a small amount on a headband or neck of your shirt helps keeps bugs away without tons of chemicals. This vendor has excellent essential oil, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Great smell just too small in size but will buy again</li>
    <li> Love w carrier oil when i get out of shower...invigorating and tefreshing and healthy.... great oil.</li>
    <li> Great product. Strong long lasting scent. I make my own bug and mosquito repellent...all natural. No more chemicals on me like deet!</li>
    <li> both husband and&lt;br /&gt;I love lemongrass</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma, Plant Therapy makes some of the best oils.</li>
    <li> great EO for the price!</li>
    <li> This seems to work for me with fleas and mosquitos...and they love me!  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it makes a huge difference without deet.</li>
    <li> Great product.  We used this, along with eucalyptus oil for a home remedy for tick prevention and it has worked great.</li>
    <li> In my diffuser there is hardly a day goes by that I don&#x27;t use oil of lemongrass. It is most healthful and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is the best lemongrass oil I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several. It came in a timely manner; the bottles were&lt;br /&gt;carefully wrapped, and the scent lasts. I use it in my diffuser. I will continue to buy this essential oil.</li>
    <li> great oil!  dilute in water for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as I normally only buy my essential oil from local distributors. Well with recent changes in my life  hunting down various oils in person wasn&#x27;t an option. Plant Therapy Essential Oils are not only high grade, but the best by  far that I&#x27;ve gotten. Everything was perfect about the service. I will buy all my oils from now on from them!</li>
    <li> This lemongrass has an amazing smell.I cant get enough . I diffuse it in my house put it in my lotions and shampoos and even in my laundry !! But Next time i will buy it in the Organic !</li>
    <li> Always happy with Plant Therapy products!!</li>
    <li> I got this for myself and my sister in hopes of getting rid of toenail fungus. I used it for 6 months and saw no improvement, although my toenails turned a disgusting color like old, dried blood. I used it full-strength and really didn&#x27;t have to use it everyday, though I did, because the oil permeates the entire nail. I stopped using it about a month ago and now the disgusting color won&#x27;t go away. On the plus side, the oil has a lovely fragrance. My sister has used it as a deoderant, which makes sense because it kills bacteria, which are the main cause of odor.</li>
    <li> the lemongrass essential oil arrived as expected.  It is NOT organic, but seems of good quality for mixing. It is a good value and quality for the money.</li>
    <li> Happy in all regards, just reordered to give as a gift. Please know you will receive full value and great product and service for your money.</li>
    <li> This therapeutic grade essential oil is exactly what I needed to reduce toenail fungus. Hopefully when the new nail grows completely, the fungus will stay away. How to use: place 8-10 drops of lemongrass essential oil mixed with 30 milliliters of grapeseed oil in a dropper bottle and apply drops of mixture twice daily on top and under the toenail. Let seep in and blot excess. Nail will be discolored. Painting your toenail will delay effectiveness. After 3 months of diligence, my toenail is half returned and reattached to the nail bed. I&#x27;m trimming the disgusting areas as they grow out. In about 6 months, my toenail should look better. I&#x27;ll apply this mixture for life if I need to. This product is definitely therapeutic grade and definitely undiluted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for use in lotions and smells great. I have been using it everyday this way. My only complaint is the dropper flows too freely compared to other essential oil bottles I have used, so sometimes it is a little difficult to control the amount.</li>
    <li> As always I am extremely satisfied with Plant Therapy products. Great quality and superior customer service at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This oil is very potent. It smells great and was delivered quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought other oils from them and have never been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Company has specials and promotions, also.</li>
    <li> Great and smells great also,  Using to keep mosquitos and such from inside home and using in my defuser. Pleasant smell,</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as a room freshener and to keep mosquitos away from me and my dog.  I am also using it in unscented gold bond body lotion.  I just love the clean and light fragrence.  I can smell this light fragrence on my clothes when I change after work.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This oil smells great and is a really great price. I am happy that I bought this product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this! Very good quality! I would buy this again. Very happy with purchase thanks so much!</li>
    <li> This is the ONE if you are looking for a perfect Lemongrass Oil. I have been buying this oil for over two years now and it&#x27;s consistently amazing.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is exactly as advertised. I use this oil in an oil warmer, which makes the house smell amazing. I also make my own deodorant due to the questionable ingredients in store-bought deodorants. After having used several different scents (lavender, citrus, etc), this one is my favorite. It&#x27;s a clean, crisp smell, and it is really refreshing. This particular brand is good, and it is fairly priced. I compared to the price at my local Whole Foods and health food store, and this one was the cheapest and just as potent as any of the others.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. Plant therapy has never disappointed me yet. I use this in soaps and to diffuse in the room.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase.  The lemongrass essential oil was exactly what I was hoping for.  It is intense and will blend perfectly with base oils.  I love citrus scents and this one is a winner!</li>
    <li> Ordered this along with eucalyptus oil as a bug repellent.  The two together do have a pleasant odor.  Living in the country, I don&#x27;t seem to get as many ticks when I spray on myself.  My dog isn&#x27;t too sure about it.</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorites, as I love the smell of lemons, and it has helped in the relief of pain for me!</li>
    <li> The best oil I have used. Great scent and lasts. Will be purchasing a bunch more.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brand &amp; its refreshing lemongrass scemt. Use it to make any room or space smell instantly inviting! Potent concentration.</li>
    <li> The oil itself is fine, im just not a fan of the smell so much, but that is just my opinon. Think this will go best in sugar scrub or bath salts. Not so much for aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> I have already used up my bottle and plan to order more. This is good pure essetial oil. I no problems with my order and the company even sent me a email tomake sure I was happy with my order. Now that&#x27;s something that doesn&#x27;t happen every day, right?! Very good service company and a fine product.</li>
    <li> I used this in some homemade deodorant and it smells divine. So much more pleasant than the overly chemical scents found in traditional deodorants.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, very potent, plus i live that every bottle has a description of things you can use it for&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve mixed 20 drops of lemongrass and 20 drops of  lavender from the Plant Therapy Essential oils ( also great stuff) with 1/2 of cup of witch hazel, made the great stuff from masquitos</li>
    <li> The item was very good, I was very pleased with what the item done, ordered it to kill gnats, and it helped</li>
    <li> I keep bees, so I was looking for Lemongrass Oil for reasons other than aroma therapy.  The product arrived early and was well packaged for the trip.  I received exactly what I was expecting.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I expected, smell is perfect.  Made bug repellent spray with it and also use it to rub on rashes, works as it should.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Almost 3 times the amount you would get from Whole Foods for less cost. I will definitely continue to buy. The price and quantity really help since I have to buy it all the time. My girlfriend is stage 2b and we use it in conjunction with many other things. Shipped on time and to my surprise there was an extra 20 or 30% oil they gave as a bonus.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is working just as well as a brand purchased previously for nearly 4x the price.  If it&#x27;s important to you use a label that will impress other essential oil users, by all means skip this one.  If content/price is the critical component, this represents a very good value.  I&#x27;ll be slowly replacing my oils with this brand.</li>
    <li> Mixed with a few drops of each the other being Eucalyptus oil, (must be the essential oils) keeps the mosquito&#x27;s away without chemical pesticides.</li>
    <li> Anyone into essential oils will need this for thier collection.  I have been amazed at all the little wonders. Thanks</li>
    <li> Flies and mosquitoes do not like Lemongrass.  So when I am working outside and coming and going a lot, I run the diffuser with Lemongrass so the flies do not come in my house.  It was great when I was helping a friend move recently.  The flies were driving us crazy until we put on the Lemongrass.  Then they went out the door instead of in :-)</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product. I&#x27;m putting it on my knee and I believe it&#x27;s making a difference. I ordered larger bottle so I&#x27;m liking the oil BUT the top was not on tight and oil had leaked. It was down to the top of the label. Thought about sending it back  - seems like company would have QA system to avoid this. Will likely try another vender next time.</li>
    <li> On first whiff, this oil smelled like the lemongrass that I love. However, after applying to sore muscles, it had a various strange &#x27;after-smell&#x27; that I just didn&#x27;t care for. It didn&#x27;t smell like lemongrass at all, I can&#x27;t really place what it was. I am going to try using it in the bath, and mixing it with hand lotion as others have suggested, to see if that helps at all. Will amend my review if so!</li>
    <li> I love the Plant Therapy essential oils - this one is a lovely pure Lemongrass oil, perfect for deterring mosquitos and reducing spider vein patches.  And it makes you smell so wonderfully fresh when you use it.  For this one, I dilute a few drops in a teaspoon of carrier oil (grapeseed) and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great! I use it for cleaning up in  the kitchen and all the time now!</li>
    <li> Not a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I use it in a cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking I would burn through this stuff. Nope! This stuff is so undiluted, and when I mean undiluted, I mean pure. It&#x27;s very strong and potent. A lot of times retailers say that about stuff and it&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s definitely the case with this stuff. I use this for just about everything. It&#x27;s anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-viral so when I feel down, I just add a drop or two with a drop also of Oil of Oregano to water and sip accordingly. The Oregano balances it out a little bit and the two mix quite well. Since there is no carrier with the Lemongrass it can be a bit over powering. So make sure you dilute or mix it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great though, like a yellow Life Saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great disinfectant &amp; deodorizer for your garbage disposal (hate those things) that&#x27;s pretty much nothing but a bacteria breeding ground. Shipped fast, and arrived in perfect condition. I</li>
    <li> Definitely will order more. Great refreshing scent for my aroma diffusers.</li>
    <li> I love lemongrass oil for it&#x27;s fragrance. It gives my house a happy ambiance that is perfect for the summer</li>
    <li> This does not smell sweet and it is not supposed to smell sweet.  It is not a fragrance that I prefer, but that is more of personal preference.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  I have been ordering this scent and brand for several months.  I use it in my warmer and the scent is throughout the house.  I just ordered another scent from this company as their oils are the best and strong.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price!  I am using it for a plug-in oil burner.  I am planning on looking into a few more scents to add to my collection from this company.</li>
    <li> This oil has so many properties, love the smell. It lasts a long time. I diffuse it in a vapor diffuser... I will be ordering some more!!</li>
    <li> I am familiar with homeopathy and this, like the rest, works great.  Moving to the mountains was a big transition as poison ivy is everywhere. After one bad case, I decided I could not get on steroids again and I researched and found these pills.  With me they work wonders! One thing to remember is not to take mint of caffeine  when you take the poison ivy pills as it would not work as well.</li>
    <li> the product is great and the delivery time was impeccable,will order from these guys again.im truly impressed.i use the oil as a scent for my room,on my skin and in my hair,im in love with this scent</li>
    <li> I had no idea how great Lemongrass Essential Oil would smell. I mainly bought it to keep the mosquitoes away, but I really love this scent. The product seems to be of good quality because the scent lasts, sometimes for more than a whole day. Lemongrass is now one of my top five essential oils!</li>
    <li> I am very please with the product, I like it for the good quality that it has and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I had read this oil was good for muscle pain when rubbed on with a carrier oil. Tried this for both my shoulder and my daughter&#x27;s legs after tough soccer game. Seemed to work great as pain was reduced after a little  time. Product came as promised and I was happy with overall experience.  Just started learning about essential oils but would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this essential oil to use for many things.  One, in my diffuser, it puts off a wonderful scent that lasts!  Second, I use it mixed with almond oil as a moisturizer.  I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell!  And third, I rub it on my thyroid because I am hypothyroid.  Not sure if it really works for that or not, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try!</li>
    <li> I just bought a mist vapor for my room.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the same day,&lt;br /&gt;Came back 4 days later... It is very strong and it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly !</li>
    <li> Great smell, great price, love this brand. I feel like all of my oils from them are high quality. I mostly use this oil in my cleaning products.</li>
    <li> The smell/aroma of this lemongrass essential oil is simply wonderful and freshly intoxicating! I have loved Plant Therapy for a good while now and I am never disappointed with their products.</li>
    <li> Honestly cant say if it works or not.  Purchased it for a sun blister, tastes nasty if you get it in your mouth.  It is VERY dark in color.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have purchased Lemongrass Essential Oil.  The first time I got a smaller bottle and I loved the smell so much, so when I ran out, I bought the larger size.  Great product. I use it on my car air freshener.  Lasts long and I love that it is a natural product.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product.  I have been using it and it really is great.  I would order from them again.  I feel that the company did a great job on shipping.  I love the smell and it has worked great in my homemade body scrub.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  All lemon grass oil smell nice.  this company is good</li>
    <li> It says it is 100% pure lemon oil but it is a very, very soft essence.  You need a lot more than two or three drops to smell the lemongrass.  In fact, I&#x27;ve used 8-10 drops and still feel the smell is too weak.  When I burn oil, I like to be able to smell it in my room.</li>
    <li> Again, Plant Therapy has delivered an incredibly wonderful product and an awesome price! It has the expected strong, invigorating, citrus scent that will be great to diffuse in a blend or on its own to lift spirits on a gloomy day. (It may be good in a bath for muscle or nerve pain. I haven&#x27;t tried that out yet......) It is anti-septic and makes the house smell clean without toxic :P chemicals. Great quality- that&#x27;s what I was looking for! Great price (and volume)- that&#x27;s what I was looking for, too! I recommend this to everyone... even if it&#x27;s to put on a cotton ball as a car air freshener!</li>
    <li> Nice and earthy. a very well made Essential Oil, i would concede buying this brand again. 4 more words required.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t take the time to write many reviews but on this one product I will! I am so thoroughly pleased with it!!!!! I ordered it to help with some carpal tunnel and joint pain problems that I was having with my elbow, shoulder, and wrist from overuse. Sometimes I put it on straight and sometimes I use the little carrier oil such as coconut oil. It has dramatically helped to reduce my pain level and sometimes I don&#x27;t even have any pain!!!!! I need to be consistent with using it every day however. Also, I must admit, when I first got this product I did not like the smell at all!!! After time, however, it has really grown on me and I  really miss the smell if I don&#x27;t have it on. It is very comforting smell to me now. Even my husband who is picky about smells, really likes it!!! One more thing I must note as I feel it is important because it states it is a therapeutic grade oil... The bottle says not to take it internally and less you are under the care of a certified health professional. When I first got the oil I was very disappointed about this as I was planning on taking it internally. But now after using it externally, I am just as pleased as a if I would&#x27;ve been able to take it internally. I will definitely be ordering this oil again and also other oils from this company!!!!!!! I am very, very pleased!!!!!!!!!!!!!    6 week update: I am sad to write this but after 6 weeks I developed an allergy to this product! I got a terrible case of hives at site applications. I was so disappointed because this oil took away my carpal tunal issues... On the back if the bottle, it does say, \\&quot;Caution: possible skin reaction\\&quot;...I thought everything was fine because I didn&#x27;t exhibit any kind of reaction at first, then after 6 weeks, I became very exhausted, physically, and developed the hives!</li>
    <li> i love this scent. It smells so good</li>
    <li> I love the fresh scent of lemongrass. This is my favorite for soap making. This is a good brand. Happy with it!</li>
    <li> The scent is crisp and clean. I initially ordered this lemongrass to use as a repellent for mosquitoes, but found I like the scent so much I use it to freshen up the scent in a room, especially the kitchen.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal love this brand very strong and stays for a long time, not too greasy and protect you from mosquitos</li>
    <li> This is a great essential oil.  I must admit I&#x27;m not crazy about the odor, but I purchased it because I had read on another website that Lemongrass was a good oil for carpal tunnel syndrome.  I cross stitch a lot and am on my computer a lot so I do a lot of repetitive movements.  I mixed a few drops of Lemongrass with a carrier oil and I massage it in every night from my wrists up to my elbows.  It really does help with the pain in my wrists and elbows and helps them feel better at night.  I&#x27;m not completely pain free, but I&#x27;m going to continue using it as it does do quite a bit of good.  I would rather use this than anything else.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very perdurable and usefull</li>
    <li> Very strong fragrance. I&#x27;m still playing with how much to use (water to oil ratio) but the smell is good, not great. Kind of a chemical smell if its too strong, but still lemon grass .</li>
    <li> I have added a few drops of this wonderful oil to a hand-made lotion, effectively making the lotion a wonderful alternative to a hand santizer.  With the Lemongrass oil&#x27;s anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and other beneficial properties, it not only helps my family fight those nasty microscopic bugs out there, but the oil also added a nice scent too!  Alone, the oil smells strong, but when added to a home made lotion, it is light and fresh.  I also added a couple of drops to baking soda and then sifted the mixture onto our mattresses (as recommended by Martha Stewart).  After leaving the mixture on the mattresses for half an hour, I vacuumed it off and it leaves a mattress that is clean and santized.  An added bonus is the price for this item is not nearly as expensive as others I have seen on the market.</li>
    <li> I just began using essential oils about a month ago. I use this scent/brand in my diffuser, on cotton pads placed in my car and other various areas. This is currently my favorite scent. The few oils that I purchased from Plant Therapy seem to be of high quality. Right now they are my first choice of brands. I have only tried 3 other brands so I&#x27;m obviously not an expert. I will be purchasing this scent as well as others from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil for pain/inflammation and to make my own insect spray.  I love the way it smells and am very pleased with the prompt delivery of the oil.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about buying a brand I hadn&#x27;t used before. This was absolutely a great find. Fantastic quality. Probably better than what I was paying twice as much for before!</li>
    <li> Good size bottle for the dollar. Good strong scent. I now need to order a citrus oil of some variety to get the exact scent I am searching for.</li>
    <li> Pumpkin seed and oil contain the ingredient that reduces prostate growth and male pattern baldness. I put 4 drops of Lemongrass oil into 8 ounces of pumpkin seed oil to use it for hair oil (1/2 teaspoon is enough at an application spread through the hair.) It covered the pumpkin seed oil odor and improved the fragrance. I had also opened 4 vitamin capsules into the 8 oz of pumpkin oil; my hair is becoming darker again after 2 weeks. The Lemongrass therapy calms as it lightly remains throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great smell, last long and good product.</li>
    <li> The essential oils I purchase from Plant Therapy are always of excellent quality and the company is easy to work with and ship out their products quickly. I have ordered several different essential oils and all have been of high quality.</li>
    <li> The oil got to me quickly and it smelled great! My soap will smell wonderful once I add it! I hope I have enough!</li>
    <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
    <li> The smell is great.  I add it to my natural cleaner and it makes the house smell amazing.  I get compliments all the time from people walking in. It was shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> Thanks for producing an excelent oil.  It helps our health and makes the house smell great...  I have always been pleased with Plant Therapy Oils..  I&#x27;m not fooled by other oil companies that always tell us to use theirs&#x27; only.  Good Product.  I am always amazed by all the benefits of using this Lemongrass plus all the other oils available.</li>
    <li> I am moving the the holistic side of life so I am seeing Lemongrass as more an more of a chemical free life</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this oil. Came with some directions/what you can do with it. Directions on the bottle and very pleasant smell and taste. It is great for infections, headaches, sore throats and insect repellant among other great things.</li>
    <li> Really good. Lemongrass is also used to relieve cold symptoms. Added to your hot beverage (typically tea), in a diluted form (a drop in a cup of drink), it can ease congestion of nose, throat &amp; even sinuses.</li>
    <li> Great, great products!.</li>
    <li> I love this essential oil ... when my joints are aching after a long day, I just rub some lemongrass essential oil on, and go to sleep.  The pleasant smell helps me relax and sleep.</li>
    <li> I think it would have worked better if there would have been instructions on how to use it. There was nothing telling you what to do</li>
    <li> I love using this essential oil in my homemade laundry products!  Everything smells so fresh and invigorating!  This is a great price for this size container.  I also love using this on light bulbs.  The warmth from the bulbs causes the scent to spread through the room.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy this lemongrass scent. I am new to essential oils, so it may be just me, but I felt like the lemon part of the scent was fake smelling and overpowering. I couldn&#x27;t enjoy it because it was just so strong. I did also order the \\&quot;Citrus Burst\\&quot; scent and I enjoyed that one very much. Additionally, the bottle arrived unsealed, so I had to return it. I just wasn&#x27;t comfortable with that.</li>
    <li> I just love natural products and remedies. I am using this to cure my embarrassing toenail fungus. I didn&#x27;t want to use those medications that you get from the Doctor which damage your liver for this cosmetic (only) but highly embarrassing problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for three days and it looks and feels like it is working better than any other natural things I have tried (Vicks, Apple Cider Vinegar). Plus it smells better than those things and is much easier to work with because it absorbs in to the nail and skin after a few minutes but keeps on working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt this will be a winner. When it discolors your toenail within a few minutes, you know it it is actually killing the fungus. This happens way quicker than with Vicks so this is great for this purpose!</li>
    <li> The Lemongrass Essential Oil is good but it is not as strong as the one I bought from India before.</li>
    <li> I have had a lemongrass oil which i got from thailand. This one is no close to authentic lemongrass. It smells kinda like gingery + Tea.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product</li>
    <li> I love the smell. And yes, it is the real EO. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it only takes a couple drops to fill my living room.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious!  Lemony, sweet, and a little earthy. I love to use it in my cleaning products and at times in a diffuser.</li>
    <li> great for DIY detergent</li>
    <li> Love the smell of Lemongrass. Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> Excellent for combining with eucalyptus and tea tree oil for mosquito control.  Love it, my grand kids were bite free.</li>
    <li> I use it for cooking and making my high last longer! Thanks Lemongrass Essential Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(inserting five words per requirement)</li>
