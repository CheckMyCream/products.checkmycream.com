      <li>and great product!</li>
      <li>Good customer service!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful matte purple.</li>
      <li>Its looks great on the lips but does not moisturized it so if you don&#x27;t apply anything over your lips will look CRUSTY and colored.</li>
      <li>Lol</li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>The colour is opaque and great for fall.</li>
      <li>I received this lipstick in the mail today and I absolutely love it!!</li>
      <li>Very nice color.</li>
      <li>it was still very nice</li>
      <li>Love the color but the lipstick itself is not the greatest.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s the perfect formula: smooth and still matte.</li>
      <li>but this purple is beautiful and blends well with my brown skin tone, i love the texture</li>
      <li>Love it, perfect color for my skin tone:)</li>
      <li>This lipstick is amazing.</li>
      <li>Seriously so amazing .</li>
      <li>This is a nice lipstick.</li>
      <li>I love how the color feels on my lips and it kind of smells good too.</li>
      <li>look to more of a sophisticated funk, this is the one!</li>
      <li>I think for the price you bought its a good purchase if your looking for a change from the light airyness</li>
      <li>But my daughter liked more..</li>
      <li>Best if topped with a clear gloss</li>
      <li>most perfect dark purple for my brown skin tone great dupe for macs cyber</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great and worth the buy, i love Rimmel</li>
      <li>love the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>More like grape.</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a better formula.</li>
      <li>Love this color on me</li>
      <li>Absolutely in love with this lipstick.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t sure if they discontinued the color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sexy and lovely on everyone lips, just try it, you&#x27;ll like it</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely and it looks great if you put clear lip gloss on over it.</li>
      <li>i love it and it stays on your lips for hours...</li>
      <li>what more can i say about it.</li>
      <li>and I just love it.</li>
      <li>love this color.</li>
      <li>so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The result is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It was a bit light, and it smudged when you drank anything, but then again most lipsticks do. :)</li>
      <li>The best use for this color, however, is to darken other lip colors, in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit patchy, like many darker colors, so I would also recommend topping it with a purple gloss if you wear it at full strength.  </li>
      <li>Love the color, I found it true to its description.</li>
      <li>thats was fine.</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and made my winter!</li>
      <li>Eye makeup should be extremely LIGHT.</li>
      <li>I suggest wearing light eye make up with it.</li>
      <li>If you never have this problem and have smooth lips, go for it.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>I love this color so very much.</li>
      <li>This color is so unique</li>
      <li>Everyone is wearing this beautiful dark purple lipstick.  </li>
      <li>You can wear this straight from the bullet or you can wear this as a stain- apply the lipstick, blot, rub in the lipstick, blot, top with lip balm or gloss.</li>
      <li>Came quickly in the mail.</li>
      <li>By itself, I did not find the grape purple color very flattering on me, since I have a light skin tone with cool undertones.</li>
      <li>this powerful</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try to post an image of it myself soon, if I can get one that matches the color right.</li>
      <li>Perfect Fall/Winter dramatic lipstick.</li>
      <li>Exactly the color I wanted, sooooooooooo worth the shipping charge.....</li>
      <li>and I needed to get this right the first time...</li>
      <li>so glad I finally found it</li>
      <li>buy it if your interested</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Most lipsticks that look purple in the tube are actually berry or fuchsia colored when worn.</li>
      <li>I liked it to mix with other colors..</li>
      <li>lasts long and the color is amazing, I highly recommend it . . .</li>
      <li>I love the deepness of the color and it lasts pretty long.  </li>
      <li>It has a rich exuberant color, it came within 4 day</li>
      <li>Compared to most dark purples, this is pretty unique, since purples usually have a more bluish undertone.</li>
      <li>This lip color(#4) is a very dark purple with warm brownish undertones.</li>
      <li>an demands the attention of the whole room .</li>
      <li>It is in fact very purple</li>
      <li>I think a person with a deep, warm skin tone would totally rock this color by itself though.</li>
      <li>that goth chic high fashion thing in a drugstore lipstick.</li>
      <li>I wish it would last a little longer, but overall I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
      <li>it look normal purple</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this color after watching a few YouTube videos.</li>
      <li>Va Violet\\&quot; is a cream formula, which with dark pigments isn&#x27;t usually that great of an idea.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Likewise, it feathers easily, has no staying power and must be reapplied every few hours.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t  been this excited since I found Revlon Black Cherry.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not black, don&#x27;t worry!</li>
      <li>Then everytime I apply it, it lasts nearly an hour</li>
      <li>Between all the blogs I found on dupes, it seemed to be pretty much summed down to</li>
      <li>I have searched high and low for a shade</li>
      <li>Its super dark but its so sheer and slippery</li>
      <li>but on the lips it was darker although i never expected the color i got from the picture</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, not dry or rough at all, but rather wet actually.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no red tint to it at all, and I was hoping that it would have a little, but I&#x27;m not afraid to mix colors, so I&#x27;ll still use it.</li>
      <li>Highly pigmented, creamy, long lasting, and smells delish!!!</li>
      <li>, even though it&#x27;s not long lasting.</li>
      <li>I bought this lipstick in Rosetti about a year ago because I was looking for a highly pigmented dark purple lip color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is great. It&#x27;s a beautiful matte purple.</li>
    <li> Came quickly in the mail. Love the color, I found it true to its description. I wish it would last a little longer, but overall I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Thick, dry, streaky, muddy and not true to color.  Would give zero stars if possible.</li>
    <li> I liked it to mix with other colors..But my daughter liked more..so she took it.lol  thats was fine.</li>
    <li> Everyone is wearing this beautiful dark purple lipstick.  It&#x27;s sexy and lovely on everyone lips, just try it, you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> This is definitely a dark purple. More like grape. There&#x27;s no red tint to it at all, and I was hoping that it would have a little, but I&#x27;m not afraid to mix colors, so I&#x27;ll still use it. It goes on smooth, not dry or rough at all, but rather wet actually.</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick in Rosetti about a year ago because I was looking for a highly pigmented dark purple lip color. Unfortunately, this color is so pigmented and so drying that it is unwearable unless blended with one or two other colors. Likewise, it feathers easily, has no staying power and must be reapplied every few hours. Seriously, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> This in my s***! I love the deepness of the color and it lasts pretty long.  Glam goth staple.</li>
    <li> Seriously so amazing . This color is so unique an demands the attention of the whole room . Buy this if you are that kinda girl. I have searched high and low for a shade this powerful so glad I finally found it</li>
    <li> This is a nice lipstick. It&#x27;s a deep eggplant purple. The formula is on the dry side so it will tug on your lips and be hard to apply! But nothing a little lip balm base and lipstick brush won&#x27;t fix. The colour is opaque and great for fall. I would recommend buying this but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a better formula.</li>
    <li> I think for the price you bought its a good purchase if your looking for a change from the light airyness look to more of a sophisticated funk, this is the one!</li>
    <li> I received this lipstick in the mail today and I absolutely love it!! I am about the color of Gabrielle Union so I was nervous about trying a shade so dark. It goes on nicely and it looks great if you put clear lip gloss on over it.</li>
    <li> i love it and it stays on your lips for hours... what more can i say about it. buy it if your interested</li>
    <li> love this color., even though it&#x27;s not long lasting., you will have to reapply. Best if topped with a clear gloss</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this color after watching a few YouTube videos. It is really hard to find a dark purple lipstick. Believe me, I tried! Most lipsticks that look purple in the tube are actually berry or fuchsia colored when worn. I breezed through half a dozen lipsticks and found out the hard way. This is a deep, dark grape color. It&#x27;s not black, don&#x27;t worry! This has been discontinued in stores so I was glad to find it on Amazon. My only problem is that if your lips are usually dry or has lines, this lipstick will catch in every little nook and cranny. If you never have this problem and have smooth lips, go for it.</li>
    <li> I love this color so very much. It was just the color I was looking for! I love how the color feels on my lips and it kind of smells good too. Lol</li>
    <li> Exactly the color I wanted, sooooooooooo worth the shipping charge.....</li>
    <li> Perfect shade for me. Easy to apply and long lasting. Exactly what I wanted. I bought 2, don&#x27;t want to run out any time soon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this lipstick. It has a rich exuberant color, it came within 4 day and I just love it. I&#x27;ll recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a long lasting lipstick for so long and I was in cvs hunting yesterday and came across this one and I got the \\&quot;01\\&quot; it&#x27;s very red with a cherry like scent. Its looks great on the lips but does not moisturized it so if you don&#x27;t apply anything over your lips will look CRUSTY and colored. Then everytime I apply it, it lasts nearly an hour so that \\&quot;up to 8 hours\\&quot; need to not be marketed on the brand of this line. Look like I have lip liner on after an hour...sucks!</li>
    <li> Good customer service! and great product!</li>
    <li> Love this color on me</li>
    <li> most perfect dark purple for my brown skin tone great dupe for macs cyber</li>
    <li> horrible consistency....everyone raves about this lipstick but its awful.  Its super dark but its so sheer and slippery that it doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
    <li> love the quality of the product. lasts long and the color is amazing, I highly recommend it . . .</li>
    <li> This lip color(#4) is a very dark purple with warm brownish undertones. Compared to most dark purples, this is pretty unique, since purples usually have a more bluish undertone. You can wear this straight from the bullet or you can wear this as a stain- apply the lipstick, blot, rub in the lipstick, blot, top with lip balm or gloss. The best use for this color, however, is to darken other lip colors, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit patchy, like many darker colors, so I would also recommend topping it with a purple gloss if you wear it at full strength.  By itself, I did not find the grape purple color very flattering on me, since I have a light skin tone with cool undertones. Again, I like this as a stain and as a way to darken other lipsticks. I think a person with a deep, warm skin tone would totally rock this color by itself though.</li>
    <li> I was originally looking for # 15 but came across this color, It is hard for me to wear lip colors, i usually stick to nude&#x27;s but this purple is beautiful and blends well with my brown skin tone, i love the texture it&#x27;s great and worth the buy, i love Rimmel</li>
    <li> Very nice color. This was what i expected. Check out the pictures of the product on pinterest or on google before you buy it cause (obviously) it looks lighter once it is applied.</li>
    <li> The color was lighter than i expected in the tube it look normal purple but on the lips it was darker although i never expected the color i got from the picture it was still very nice and i recieved compliments</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick a lot. Especially when I am in a mood for a change that stands out. I suggest wearing light eye make up with it. I also enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is amazing. The quality for the cost is insane. Highly pigmented, creamy, long lasting, and smells delish!!! This is the color of the season....that goth chic high fashion thing in a drugstore lipstick. I haven&#x27;t  been this excited since I found Revlon Black Cherry. Perfect Fall/Winter dramatic lipstick. TIP: Eye makeup should be extremely LIGHT. Use a flesh toned shimmer/frost shadow on lids and a couple coats of the darkest mascara you have. Apply lipstick and BLOT!!! The result is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Had been looking for this color FOREVER! wasn&#x27;t sure if they discontinued the color but it was perfect! arrived quickly and made my winter!</li>
    <li> Great deal for me! Came faster than I expected. Love the color. It&#x27;s a little glossy than I wanted it to be but I totally dig the color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m strapped on cash and I needed to get this right the first time...Between all the blogs I found on dupes, it seemed to be pretty much summed down to Rimmel&#x27;s \\&quot;Va Va Violet\\&quot; and this one. The \\&quot;Va Va Violet\\&quot; is a cream formula, which with dark pigments isn&#x27;t usually that great of an idea. It&#x27;ll just slide all over the place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images online don&#x27;t do it justice, so I&#x27;ll try to post an image of it myself soon, if I can get one that matches the color right. It&#x27;s not as frosted as it looks in a lot of the pictures you&#x27;ll get from a search engine, and the closer looking images make it look brown, which is definitely is not. It is in fact very purple, it&#x27;s the perfect formula: smooth and still matte. I definitely reccommend it! ^_^</li>
    <li> This lipstick is georgous and will defiantly order another one.</li>
    <li> It was a bit light, and it smudged when you drank anything, but then again most lipsticks do. :)</li>
    <li> Thank you for the lipstick.</li>
    <li> Love it, perfect color for my skin tone:)</li>
    <li> Love the color but the lipstick itself is not the greatest. It&#x27;s sort of dry and smeary. On the plus side it does not stain your lips. However, I will not purchase Rimmel London lipsticks in the future.</li>
