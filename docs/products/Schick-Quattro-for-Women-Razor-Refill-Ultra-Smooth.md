      <li>These are my all-time new favorite razors!</li>
      <li>thanks to being on Subscribe &amp; Save! :)</li>
      <li>I get a smooth shave and rarely ever nick myself.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and on time.</li>
      <li>I have been using this razor loyally for 10+ years now.</li>
      <li>I certainly think so, so if you feel the same way, you&#x27;ll be delighted to find that these refill blades have a neutral gray color and do indeed fit on the Schick Quattro men&#x27;s line of handles.</li>
      <li>really like that they do the job quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>used these Schick Quattro refills on the handle of a men&#x27;s razor, because I can&#x27;t stand the bright pink handles on some of the razors for women.</li>
      <li>These have a nice life to them, I can get several shaves out of one razor.</li>
      <li>the price is right.</li>
      <li>Old razor styles would nick my legs all over, but this pivot head really solves that problem and the 4 blades do such a great job.</li>
      <li>Despite staying sharp for a good amount of time, even with the first use they leave my legs bumpy and itchy.</li>
      <li>As a mom of two teen girls we love Shick Quattro and how well they shave without the nicks,cuts of cheaper razors.</li>
      <li>I only keep looking because I&#x27;d like a better moisturizing strip.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re not terribly expensive and work pretty well.</li>
      <li>It cracked me up, but I definitely try to pay more attention now.</li>
      <li>Thanks Shick!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the most patient person in the world, in fact I&#x27;m a huge fan of efficiency and don&#x27;t like to waste time.</li>
      <li>Check your prices locally but this seemed cheap to me and they came fast.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get much razor burn at all.</li>
      <li>What on earth can I really say about this set of razors?</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than buying them in the store.  </li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re definitely better than some other brands.</li>
      <li>Because it has four blades, it takes fewer swipes and is highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I try to get by with disposable razors all the time, but they are so tough on my skin, I figured it was time to invest in a good razor.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and fast growing hair.</li>
      <li>I keep trying new razors every once in a while</li>
      <li>These razors work well, a smooth shave, and aren&#x27;t the most expensive (although all razors are pricey)</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I have no problems 95% of the time with these.  </li>
      <li>Price was good as it seems like razor blades are so expensive.</li>
      <li>i ordered this refill package of blades at the same time i ordered her a new razor</li>
      <li>yet they give a very close shave, and I&#x27;ve only cut myself with them a handful of times after years of almost daily use.</li>
      <li>I actually like them because I shave in sensitive areas</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed random single armpit hairs that are clearly being missed more than one day in a row!</li>

<li> These razors are expensive but they are the only ones I will use.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very poor business decision for Shick to make razors that won&#x27;t hold quattro replacement blades, I&#x27;ll be switching back to Gillette!</li>
<li> I also like the Schicks with the lotion built in, too, but they are too expensive for me to buy all the time.  </li>
<li> Why are these things so expensive?</li>
<li> All razors replacements are expensive.</li>

    <li> Smooth shave but have to rinse often. Rotates around knees well. Price was good as it seems like razor blades are so expensive.</li>
    <li> These fit the Quattro turquoise one just fine!  Great price for a 4 count!</li>
    <li> my daughter-in-law uses the quattro women&#x27;s razor.  i ordered this refill package of blades at the same time i ordered her a new razor</li>
    <li> Great product, super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> As a mom of two teen girls we love Shick Quattro and how well they shave without the nicks,cuts of cheaper razors. Love how they leave nice smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Fits my razor perfectly and I love the shave from it! Would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I have tried every razor out there, and these are my favorites.  I have very sensitive skin, and I have no problems 95% of the time with these.  I also like the Schicks with the lotion built in, too, but they are too expensive for me to buy all the time.  These razors work well, a smooth shave, and aren&#x27;t the most expensive (although all razors are pricey)</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and fast growing hair. i never had any problems with razor burn with these babies yet they give a very close shave, and I&#x27;ve only cut myself with them a handful of times after years of almost daily use. I don&#x27;t even use shaving cream with these razors, just bar soap and water.</li>
    <li> very good razors very smooth and clean will use again ,a big step up the ladder from disposable razors so if you use disposable razors it time to step up the ladder and try schick quattro razors</li>
    <li> What on earth can I really say about this set of razors? Hm, I can&#x27;t complain about a close shave.</li>
    <li> i only use these razor. so not much to say there. but in terms of ordering online all was smooth and have no expectation what were not met,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for a long time now, and it&#x27;s always great when I can find a good deal/price.</li>
    <li> I like these razors. They aren&#x27;t amazing but they&#x27;re not terribly expensive and work pretty well. I don&#x27;t get much razor burn at all. They don&#x27;t last all that long for me but they&#x27;re definitely better than some other brands.</li>
    <li> Please read how many you get before ordering because the cost of these  4 refills is a tad bit expensive. I actually thought I was getting 6 refills - then thinking, ahh, what a good deal. NOT!</li>
    <li> I buy these through Amazon Prime and subscribe and save.  Much cheaper than buying them in the store.  These have a nice life to them, I can get several shaves out of one razor. The product alley arrives on time and in nice packaging. I would definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Check your prices locally but this seemed cheap to me and they came fast. I like these blades a lot. I never cut myself</li>
    <li> These are my all-time new favorite razors! After YEARS of using Venus razors, these are SO much better! A much better shave, no nicks or razor burn anymore! And cheaper than Venus thanks to being on Subscribe &amp; Save! :)</li>
    <li> Works okay. Personally, I don&#x27;t care for the rubber on both ends as that has to defeat the purpose of having 4 blades to being with. I&#x27;ve also noticed random single armpit hairs that are clearly being missed more than one day in a row! It cracked me up, but I definitely try to pay more attention now.</li>
    <li> I find these razors to be as abrasive as cheapy disposables. Despite staying sharp for a good amount of time, even with the first use they leave my legs bumpy and itchy. I&#x27;ve had much better result with the Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> great price for a wonderful razor</li>
    <li> Great blades, would recommend</li>
    <li> It no longer causes skin damage when touching my wifes legs. Thanks Shick!</li>
    <li> the product pictured is the purple blade, but what they shipped is yellow and papaya and pearl. NOT what i wanted or what i thought i was getting.</li>
    <li> I keep trying new razors every once in a while but I keep coming back to these. They seem to give the best shave. I only keep looking because I&#x27;d like a better moisturizing strip.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for ages and so the razor blades too and really like that they do the job quickly and easily.  Old razor styles would nick my legs all over, but this pivot head really solves that problem and the 4 blades do such a great job.</li>
    <li> These work well for me. I feel as though they get close even with the protective wires. I actually like them because I shave in sensitive areas and I don&#x27;t get nicked, I typically dont because I am careful. And I never got cut on my legs with these so...They work for me! I will keep using these and repurchase.</li>
    <li> Compared to buying in the store this is great. Saved 10 bucks ordering it online. Packaging was good and razors are brand new.</li>
    <li> These razor refills are the best.  Gets the job done and can go a few days without using again.&lt;br /&gt;The price here was better than any store.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor.  I never get any cuts when using it.  I have been using this razor loyally for 10+ years now.</li>
    <li> These razors are expensive but they are the only ones I will use. I spend years using some cheaper disposable razors and suffered with razor burn thinking it was just how my skin is. I don&#x27;t get razor burn any more and a 4 pack of these refills will last me 2-3 months. I would recommend doing a price check at your local stores before buying online.</li>
    <li> This refill cartridge is so much more expensive in my local stores (even Walmart). I generally don&#x27;t buy such small items online. Bought it with S&amp;S here on Amazon with a coupon for an even better deal. This goes on my Quattro TrimStyle razor. The pivoting head and 4 blades really gives a very close shave, perfect for touch-ups between waxes, etc. and to take on trips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the most patient person in the world, in fact I&#x27;m a huge fan of efficiency and don&#x27;t like to waste time. This Schick Quattro razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve found for getting the job done quickly and with little fuss. Because it has four blades, it takes fewer swipes and is highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these Schick Quattro refills on the handle of a men&#x27;s razor, because I can&#x27;t stand the bright pink handles on some of the razors for women. I mean, Schick even has raspberry scented florescent pink razor handles now. Is that not going a little too far? I certainly think so, so if you feel the same way, you&#x27;ll be delighted to find that these refill blades have a neutral gray color and do indeed fit on the Schick Quattro men&#x27;s line of handles.</li>
    <li> Great price through subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Have been using this razor for years. Nice thicker handle that makes it easier to hold than other razors.</li>
    <li> I gave this product because its convenient, and quick, easy to use and works well for everyday use, Great product!</li>
    <li> Why are these things so expensive? All razors replacements are expensive. Why?</li>
    <li> I love my trimmer, so I have to buy more refills. :)  close cut, just no cuts..... They last&lt;br /&gt;pretty long also.</li>
    <li> I got the furry gams silky smooth and without nicks</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than these refills live up to Schick&#x27;s reputation as quality products.  With a little care they last and last.</li>
    <li> I try to get by with disposable razors all the time, but they are so tough on my skin, I figured it was time to invest in a good razor.  The Quattro is easy to handle and great looking.  This 4 count refill is a fantastic value, much better than I could find anywhere else</li>
    <li> Not much to say just razors about the same as others I used but would buy again the price is right.</li>
    <li> Works as well as any razor. I get a smooth shave and rarely ever nick myself. I do wish they would last a little longer because I feel like I have to change the blades frequently.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that Shick Hydro is not a type of quattro razor, and these replacement blades won&#x27;t stay in a Hydro razor. It&#x27;s a very poor business decision for Shick to make razors that won&#x27;t hold quattro replacement blades, I&#x27;ll be switching back to Gillette!</li>
    <li> I fear the day these blades aren&#x27;t made anymore. They&#x27;ve been my go to blades for years and years. Nothing gets a better shave!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re razors; it&#x27;s a refill; they fit. Is there anymore to add?</li>
    <li> Just what I expected!!!</li>
    <li> Works correctly with product.  Sounds simple but this does not always happen.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> i like it! it makes your skin very smooth afterwards. I believe i&#x27;m on my 3rd razor. would buy again.</li>
    <li> great deal on great razors</li>
    <li> The refills work extremely well. They leave you with a smooth, close shave. It&#x27;s the best product that I&#x27;ve ever had. I recommend it to all women. I will definitely order from them again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for this product. The blades are purple. Came quickly and on time. Would buy again when I use all the blades up.</li>
