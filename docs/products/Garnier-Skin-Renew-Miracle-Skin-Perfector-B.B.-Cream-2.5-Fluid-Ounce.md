      <li>Great Quality.</li>
      <li>This stuff if amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that we could find this in fair color.</li>
      <li>good buy &amp; would purchase again.</li>
      <li>I have really fair skin</li>
      <li>I see there is a product for oily skin so this would probably be a good replacement however...</li>
      <li>I like it because it provides a fair amount of coverage</li>
      <li>I purchased this on the advice of a friend, who had heard good things.</li>
      <li>and it smelled really good</li>
      <li>If you are really fair, I would try another brand.</li>
      <li>It also has a really good smell to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been noticing the longer you wear it throughout the day it gets almost dewy (not the good kind), sort of makes your skin look a bit greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give this product the 2 stars for the SPF protection and the light coverage on my fair skin, but holy smokes!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this tinted moisturizer!</li>
      <li>So until this product is &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34; or I am no longer satisfied, I will continue to use this bb-cream!</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just say I bought more than one!</li>
      <li>The coverage and color was really great for my skin tone but this stuff smells STRONG.</li>
      <li>It even looks amazing in pictures.</li>
      <li>This product gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
      <li>I liked the consistency and feel of it when I was applying it, however I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it once it was on</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the cream and use it every day since it does work well and the coverage is good and moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>Nice gift.</li>
      <li>It blends very easily.</li>
      <li>I have since started using this bb-cream and as far as I can tell it is still just as perfect.</li>
      <li>This product is great quality and meets my needs exactly as I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>this product is a very light coverage foundation and sunscreen.</li>
      <li>So huge savings!</li>
      <li>I will never be able to wear this.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It is basically just a tinted sunscreen, but the packaging makes it out to be much more.</li>
      <li>Avon Magix is a way better blur cream than this.</li>
      <li>They were all so oily, and seems to make my face break out even more.</li>
      <li>I know there are probably better BB creams somewhere out there,</li>
      <li>I only patch it on under my eyes, on my nose, and chin, and it blends perfect.</li>
      <li>The scent added is light and nice, but it triggers my allergies/asthma a bit.</li>
      <li>Two Faced brands which I&#x27;ve tried--much more illuminating in color and les oily.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>They all made my skin more red,and irritated which led to more break outs.</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels healthy and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This cream is too dark for people with fair skin maybe good for light skin with warm undertones but fair skin...</li>
      <li>I was very excited about this product when I purchased it, but it caused me to break out and</li>
      <li>If you already have nice skin it might work for you, but if you have a red-tinted face full of acne scars like me don&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to see that it looked very natural and blended.</li>
      <li>It surprisingly offers GREAT build-able coverage.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, I have acne prone skin, and this product did not make me break out more than I do normally.</li>
      <li>I love the light texture of this product.</li>
      <li>Garnier BB Cream arrived quickly and I find it very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I can not say enough good things about this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with the light coverage and feel like it&#x27;s helped clear up some acne.  </li>
      <li>The perfume in this stuff is way too strong.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this for anyone with fair skin.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for the fair toned bb cream by garnier, and I have to say that I am dissapointed.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to people with fair skin</li>
      <li>I have light (not pale, but definitely fair) skin and most podwers</li>
      <li>leaves skin smooth and matte not shiny like others can.</li>
      <li>It was smooth and spread well over my skin</li>
      <li>Very useful.</li>
      <li>this is still too moisture rich.</li>
      <li>but for a cheap enough (abut 13$ in a store) price it&#x27;s the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>When first trying foundation type products, I have to either try before I buy or be able to return them -- otherwise, I would be broke.</li>
      <li>Hard to find light to fair but got it here!!!!</li>
      <li>and I had to buy the fair to light BB cream because they only had that one, no lighter</li>
      <li>This BB cream is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for; it&#x27;s lightweight but gives you a pretty good amount of coverage (not as much as foundation of course</li>
      <li>I love this BB cream so much</li>
      <li>It really was an unbearable scent for me, but lovely color and coverage for the price.</li>
      <li>my skin looks fresh, light, dewy, and my skin tone is super even.</li>
      <li>Once I&#x27;m happy though, I turn to Amazon for future purchases if possible. :)</li>
      <li>very pretty.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and a cool under tone (pink).</li>
      <li>The most important feature of this, in my opinion, is that it does not dry out your skin!</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t smooth and doesn&#x27;t really serve the coverage purpose.</li>
      <li>I had to put on a moisturizer right away to feel my face</li>
      <li>It also has a very strong fragrance which I personally don&#x27;t mind, but if you don&#x27;t care for perfume smells don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>I finally bought this product, and fell in love by my first use!</li>
      <li>I thought this one might be a better buy than cover girl because it&#x27;s twice the size so it will last longer, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth buying again.</li>
      <li>I can actually say now that I love my skin.</li>
      <li>Plus i got it shipped straight to my door!</li>
      <li>It has a sticky texture first of all.</li>
      <li>I have been an avid user of Ganier&#x27;s BB Eye Roll-on</li>
      <li>I get compliments from all of my co-workers and family on my skin, and have even had strangers pull me aside in stores asking what I do to make my skin look so good; something I would have NEVER expected since I have dealt with severe acne my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what people were raving about. This BB cream is not too great. It has a sticky texture first of all. It also has little to no coverage. I realy prefer the rimmel bb cream over this, but unfortunately, even the light shade in the is too dark for my skin. I had high hopes for the fair toned bb cream by garnier, and I have to say that I am dissapointed. I might use it on days that I go to the beach; I&#x27;ll carry it in my beach bag since you are supposed to reapply every two hours. On the bright side, I have acne prone skin, and this product did not make me break out more than I do normally. Still, the sticky texture was awful. Among the drugstore bb creams I have tried, this one was the worst. I really regret spending money on this product.</li>
    <li> Good coverage but so greasy!</li>
    <li> Garnier BB Cream arrived quickly and I find it very easy to use. It goes on smoothly and actually conceals many of my skin issues....such as red spots from broken capillaries, etc.</li>
    <li> I seriously have not found a better BB cream. The creaminess, the color, just the right amount of coverage not too thick not too thin. I only patch it on under my eyes, on my nose, and chin, and it blends perfect. My friends can&#x27;t even tell I have makeup on there.</li>
    <li> I never thought I had particularly sensitive skin but this stuff have me small mini gives all over my chin. In my opinion, nothing that goes on your skin, ESPECIALLY your face, needs to be perfumed. I definitely prefer and recommend unscented and mostly natural products because of my skin&#x27;s reaction to this bb cream. It also made my skin look greasy and not dewy. All in all I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Hard to find light to fair but got it here!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I have never tried any other bb creams. So I can&#x27;t say I know how it compares to others. I got this product on clearance at a store awhile back. At first it just sat on the shelf. Then when I started having really dry skin and wanted lighter make-up, I decided to give it a try. I was honestly very pleased! I will say though, you HAVE to set it with some sort of power otherwise your face WILL get oily, after all this is bb-cream with moisturizer in it! I began using this underneath my foundation to create a nice base, &amp; give myself a little moisturizer, but not too much. I eventually went through the entire bottle! I had been searching high &amp; low for the fair/light color, &amp; to my surprise I couldn&#x27;t find it at any of the drug stores or big box stores! I started searching on amazon for it, &amp; came across this listing. Only $6.79 for that color!! Let&#x27;s just say I bought more than one! These retail for about $10-$14 at other stores! So huge savings! Plus i got it shipped straight to my door! I have since started using this bb-cream and as far as I can tell it is still just as perfect. No formula change, no complaints, It doesn&#x27;t break me out. I absolutely love it. So until this product is &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34; or I am no longer satisfied, I will continue to use this bb-cream! I hope this seller doesn&#x27;t stop selling the light/fair color because I have no idea what i will do then! I can&#x27;t promise this will be your perfect bb-cream, but I can say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt for the price!</li>
    <li> This product gives my skin a nice glow. I wish it weren&#x27;t scented. The scent added is light and nice, but it triggers my allergies/asthma a bit. I hope they make a sensitive skin formula without scent. I am quite pale and the Fair/Light color works fine for me. This product fades inperfection while you wear it, but does not cover them completely. I have freckles, and they are softened, but not gone, which I prefer. The product feels a bit sticky after applying it, but dries enough pretty well in about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product, met the expectation of purchase. I&#x27;m looking for other similar, with the skin tone lighter.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough good things about this product! I have struggled with TERRIBLE skin my entire life; redness, uneven skin tone, bad acne, and dark acne scars. I had tried every foundation on the market. They all made my skin more red,and irritated which led to more break outs. Traditional foundation made my skin super dry and flakey- just no good all around.&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical in trying this product as I have tried tinted moisturizers in the past and I didn&#x27;t like them. They were all so oily, and seems to make my face break out even more. I finally bought this product, and fell in love by my first use! It surprisingly offers GREAT build-able coverage. I apply over my whole face, and add a little extra on my problem areas. I can use this as my foundation. My skin looks FLAWLESS when I use this product! my skin looks fresh, light, dewy, and my skin tone is super even. It even looks amazing in pictures. I get compliments from all of my co-workers and family on my skin, and have even had strangers pull me aside in stores asking what I do to make my skin look so good; something I would have NEVER expected since I have dealt with severe acne my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does my skin look great with it on, but by regularly using this product, my skin has gradually starting clearing up, my skin tone is very even, no more redness or blotchiness, and my acne scars are starting to improve and lighten. My skin looks and feels healthy and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I am so so thankful I have found this product. I can actually say now that I love my skin. I am so much more confident knowing that I am not this awkward 25 year old with terrible acne and skin. Thank you Garnier for this product! it has been life changing!</li>
    <li> This was my first BB Cream purchase, and so far it&#x27;s worked out well. It doesn&#x27;t cake on, gives me a soft glow however the fragrance they put in it is a little too strong. I have a sensitive nose, so I wish they made a fragrance-free version.</li>
    <li> this product is a very light coverage foundation and sunscreen. very pretty. has a very slight shimmer to it just enough to attract light to highlight the right places. leaves skin smooth and matte not shiny like others can. very good!</li>
    <li> I love the light texture of this product. It blends very easily.</li>
    <li> I really like the multitasking idea of this product but it&#x27;a just not that great. Avon Magix is a way better blur cream than this. The color was also a bit darker than Fair/Light should be and the BIGGEST problem with this stuff is the fragrance! The perfume in this stuff is way too strong. Especially for a product you are going to put on your face! Perfume is a migraine trigger for me but even if that weren&#x27;t the case, the fragrance is just too much. I&#x27;ll be going back to Avon Magix even if I have to use a seperate moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff if amazing! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I get it on here. It&#x27;s the only liquid cover up that does NOT make you break out, it actually cleans your skin while your wear it. It also has a really good smell to it. Would highly recommend this for anyone with fair skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with the light coverage and feel like it&#x27;s helped clear up some acne.  I also like that it has sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> I think it improves the overall look of my skin without completely making up my face. Sometimes I still sweat through it, but it&#x27;s summer and that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Great product! Its super silky and provides decent coverage. It doesn&#x27;t cover major blemishes but concealing isn&#x27;t its only function so I can live with it. I really like it though. good buy &amp; would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It matches skin color perfectly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t faid the fair/light tone everywhere, but with subscribe and save amazon had my color and the best price</li>
    <li> Still looking for a BB cream that likes me and my skin .... thought I would give this brand a try.&lt;br /&gt;Very thin, very , very light in color and not a great moisturizer .... color was off ...so I continue to search for yet another bb &amp; cc cream.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the advice of a friend, who had heard good things. I like it because it provides a fair amount of coverage, I always use it with some finishing or tinted powder, depending on how I&#x27;m feeling but it&#x27;s definitely so much better for my skin that everyday use of foundation. I still use coverup for a few spots of my face but it blends in very well and the redness is much reduced by the BB cream. I switched to an Olay brand just for experimentation and immediately wished I hadn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s thick coming out of the tube and a little goes a long long way. That being said, I still use a heavier cream to moisturize because my skin tends to dry out easily. I also have sensitive skin prone to breakouts or &#x27;freakouts&#x27; as I like to call them (hives, rosacea looking spots) and this cream doesn&#x27;t exacerbate that at all. After a day of wearing it, my Tzone is a bit shiny but that&#x27;s the case even with foundation so I don&#x27;t count that as a con.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid user of Ganier&#x27;s BB Eye Roll-on so I thought to give this a try. However, this is greasy and is nothing like other BB creams I&#x27;ve used. It isn&#x27;t smooth and doesn&#x27;t really serve the coverage purpose.</li>
    <li> Just Amazing, this product make me very happy. I recommended it for everyone. Perfect. Great Quality. Very useful. Nice gift.</li>
    <li> The color is to dark for fair skin, too much yellow undertone. I have fair skin and a cool under tone (pink). This cream is too dark for people with fair skin maybe good for light skin with warm undertones but fair skin...absolutely not. It&#x27;s fragrance is just a little to strong, and the cream is also to greasy.</li>
    <li> By chance I saw this in a makeup video on youtube and I don&#x27;t use foundation (usually foundation doesn&#x27;t work for me), and I&#x27;ve always wanted to give BB cream a try. I have light (not pale, but definitely fair) skin and most podwers/foundations don&#x27;t work with it, making my skin look fake or powdery. My skin is also pretty dry in certain areas, I get an occasional pimple, and I have red areas near my nose and cheeks. This BB cream is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for; it&#x27;s lightweight but gives you a pretty good amount of coverage (not as much as foundation of course so if you have pretty noticeable acne or other dark blemishes you might try this with concealer). The most important feature of this, in my opinion, is that it does not dry out your skin! I was so happy to see that it looked very natural and blended. I don&#x27;t have oily skin, but on the one spot on my face that can get oily, it still works! I know there are probably better BB creams somewhere out there, but for a cheap enough (abut 13$ in a store) price it&#x27;s the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried so far. I would highly recommend it to people with fair skin (this color was just right), dry skin, and some redness. UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and it still does exactly what I said in the review, but I&#x27;ve been noticing the longer you wear it throughout the day it gets almost dewy (not the good kind), sort of makes your skin look a bit greasy. So I guess you can&#x27;t wear it the whole day, but for going out places it still works!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the cream and use it every day since it does work well and the coverage is good and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really complain except that when I use it to cover blemishes it doesn&#x27;t blend as naturally as it does on clear skin.</li>
    <li> This product covers alright, but seems to cause me to breakout.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Blends nicely&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Includes SPF 15&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;My package does not say &amp;#34;normal to dry.&amp;#34; Even though I have &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;skin this is still too moisture rich. My skin feels oily way too early into the day. I see there is a product for oily skin so this would probably be a good replacement however...&lt;br /&gt;I feel like &amp;#34;fair/light&amp;#34; could be much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the L&#x27;oreal and/or Two Faced brands which I&#x27;ve tried--much more illuminating in color and les oily. Next I will try BalmShelter brand because it has safer ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t so terrible that I will throw it out-- I will finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> The coverage and color was really great for my skin tone but this stuff smells STRONG. VERY perfumy, and since you&#x27;re wearing it on, presumably, your face, it is really overpowering. It&#x27;s is an awesome price for BB Cream but I&#x27;d rather spend more money and get something less stinky.</li>
    <li> I love this tinted moisturizer! I have worn coverup for years and spent so much money. This stuff looks beautiful and stays on all day</li>
    <li> This product is great quality and meets my needs exactly as I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, but not worth the price. It is basically just a tinted sunscreen, but the packaging makes it out to be much more. It doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage. If you already have nice skin it might work for you, but if you have a red-tinted face full of acne scars like me don&#x27;t expect any miracles. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, wearing it underneath my foundation, and I really haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement in the quality of my skin. Even as a sunscreen it is lacking: it is not waterproof so you can&#x27;t use it swimming or sweating. It also has a very strong fragrance which I personally don&#x27;t mind, but if you don&#x27;t care for perfume smells don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a little thick for being just a BB cream, and it has a strong smell. I thought this one might be a better buy than cover girl because it&#x27;s twice the size so it will last longer, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth buying again.</li>
    <li> Great cream, but fragrance is way too much. The oily skin version is fragrance-free. Wish the normal-dry version was. It really was an unbearable scent for me, but lovely color and coverage for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this turned orange the minute I applied it.  I will never be able to wear this.  I&#x27;m bummed that I wasted the money.  If you are really fair, I would try another brand.</li>
    <li> My skin is very fair, very pink with spots of melasma, and it&#x27;s pretty dry. I&#x27;ve tried foundations of every type for 20+ years and this is the first foundation-esque product that works with my skin. I&#x27;m worried that they&#x27;ll stop making the fair/light tone as I can no longer find it in any local store and have to order it instead.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It does a wonderful job covering up blemishes!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like a foundation to help cover up blemishes and I ordered the fair/light cream and it was still to dark for me.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product when I purchased it, but it caused me to break out and the scent was a little overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream so much and it works great! I have really fair skin and I had to buy the fair to light BB cream because they only had that one, no lighter, it is a bit darker than my skin tone cause I&#x27;m pink toned fair skinned redheaded ginger, but I can use just a Lil bit of it all on my neck and face and it won&#x27;t look too different from my tone. It was smooth and spread well over my skin and it smelled really good so I will def</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, as it states it could even out my dark spots and moisturize my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving it however, I turned it over to look at the directions and it says the item is a sun screen. It has two ingredient, both of them a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;When I squeezed a tiny amount out and rubbed it between my fingers it felt greasy. It took a long time to even dry.&lt;br /&gt;I would hardly call this product a &amp;#34;Miracle Skin Perfector&amp;#34;. I would call it an extreme waste of money and time.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and continue looking for a real BB cream.</li>
    <li> The fragrance on this product is way too heavy. If it&#x27;s to mask the sunscreen smell, I&#x27;d rather smell the sunscreen. I&#x27;ll give this product the 2 stars for the SPF protection and the light coverage on my fair skin, but holy smokes! Not something I will buy again, unless the fragrance is removed. I wish it would have been noted somewhere on the product aside from the tail end of the list of inactive ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product says it for normal to dry skin, I have dry skin, and on my face it feels very dry. I had to put on a moisturizer right away to feel my face hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to blend it in as much as I could on my face and I still saw streaks on my face. My face felt a little itchy and rough after I took off the product.&lt;br /&gt;I am not satisfied with this product at all.</li>
    <li> I always like to try the new products that come out,so I decided to try this,BIG MISTAKE!You have to put on layers upon layers just for it to cover little things,after you put it on and leave it on for about an hour or so it feels so greasy and oily,it has also caused me to break out.It gets worse if you even sweat, even a tiny bit, the BB cream rubs off, smears, and practically melts off. I will never buy this product again!Garnier failed me with the Hydra Recharge Shampoo and now this BB cream. Shame!</li>
    <li> I have difficult to match skin (pale/neutral), so products like this that cover ranges don&#x27;t typically work for me. This was no exception. The color showed up as too dark and too orange. I liked the consistency and feel of it when I was applying it, however I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it once it was on -- it was much too greasy feeling. It remained greasy and sticky even after it had been on for a couple of hours. Luckily, I bought it at a local drugstore that allows returns on makeup products. When first trying foundation type products, I have to either try before I buy or be able to return them -- otherwise, I would be broke. Once I&#x27;m happy though, I turn to Amazon for future purchases if possible. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that we could find this in fair color. Everything else that I find is too dark.</li>
