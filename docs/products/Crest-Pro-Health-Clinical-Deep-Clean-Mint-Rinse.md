      <li>It really is the best.</li>
      <li>I thought about letting my husband try it, but I honestly feel safer just pouring it out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To crest, I say this: Kindly PISS OFF until you fix the formula in this mouthwash.</li>

      <li>And to be fair, I also originally pointed out the negatives</li>
      <li>&#x27;s even better is that they don&#x27;t seem to sell this product in this size near me, so finding this was great!</li>
      <li>At first I thought this product was great.  </li>
      <li>If you brush beforehand you&#x27;re fine!</li>
      <li>This is simply the best mouthwash I have found, but it is not a case of more is better.</li>
      <li>It is a better dieting aid</li>
      <li>I love the way this product works.... and its benefits to help with plaque and gingivitis...</li>
      <li>shows many \\&quot;operators\\&quot; have taken compliants like this daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then i started looking around for more information about this</li>
      <li>i found many consumers have also suffered this.</li>
      <li>If you read online there are many sites and news stories about how this product is hurting people</li>
      <li>I love this rinse.  </li>
      <li>Our products and packages are thoroughly evaluated to be safe when used as directed.</li>
      <li>I did not immediately make the connection and visited my doctor after a week of not being able to taste anything.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I enjoy Pro-Health Toothpaste and thought it would pair nicely.</li>
      <li>For answers to medical questions, we recommend you speak with your doctor who will be able to give you the best advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for getting in touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This will always remain my favorite mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I hope you lose even more sales because of this review.</li>
      <li>Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and RINSE any toothpaste from your mouth before using it</li>
      <li>I got this yesterday and since I&#x27;ve used it I haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything.</li>
      <li>By day 21 I had to spit it out within seconds of it touching my mouth because of throbbing and what felt like chemical burns.</li>
      <li>stuff makes my swollen gums look healthy after one use.</li>
      <li>I sure hope they&#x27;ll come off.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a bit more \\&quot;work\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have not been to the dentist yet, but I sure am going to stop using this product.  </li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m 100% sure this product should take the blame for it.</li>
      <li>I would love to give this -5 stars.</li>
      <li>This stuff browned my teeth more than I could stand.  </li>
      <li>I told my dentist during my latest check up</li>
      <li>Works better than any mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>(don&#x27;t most people?)</li>
      <li>Picked this up locally thinking it would be the best after seeing the words &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; and a hefty price tag to go with it.  </li>
      <li>Anything that has this many immediate side effects should NOT be in an over the counter mouthwash.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
      <li>Simply the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I grew up in the Listerine generation, so I can tolerate a lot if I think it will help me keep my teeth and gums healthy.  </li>
      <li>This cuts the burning some, and I feel the salt is even more soothing and healing.  </li>
      <li>I used the product for three days morning &amp; night, I had to stop using it because I could not taste anything any more.</li>
      <li>Love this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Gets better as your health gets better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite all of the amazing pro-health claims on the bottle, I have decided not wait around to discover if any of the \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; results are true.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s very tempting to think that any mouthwash this strong must be doing a great job, I really have to wonder if a chemical that burns my otherwise healthy mouth and makes me salivate for three minutes after I spit it out can be all that good for me.  </li>
      <li>The more I clean my teeth, the more brown stains I get.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to enjoy any meals for a week now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For a mouthwash that Crests touts as their \\&quot;most advanced yet,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>cool, Crest!</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but the taste is nice, and it does what it is supposed to do, it is mouthwash, however compared to the scope that I was using, I prefer this, it taste better, leaves my mouth feeling cleaner, and I can tell its whitening my teeth!</li>
      <li>I was looking for something strong to stop my gum bleeding.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is even on the market, and I&#x27;d strongly recommend the government look into the safety of this product.  </li>
      <li>it was kind of funny</li>
      <li>This mouthwash got rid of the pain and seemed to reduce the inflammation around the crowns, so at first I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>So, I repeat: rinse your mouth with water after brushing your teeth, and then again once you&#x27;ve used this, and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
      <li>and they are sending me a coupon to replace it for free with another Crest product.</li>
      <li>I experienced moderate pain as my salivary gland was stimulated before eating food.</li>
      <li>I opted for this mouth rinse because it didnt contain alcohol and it seems as though it would be a good choice for people who have sensitive mouths.</li>
      <li>I had a successful (and impressive) bowel movement everyday for last week.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s easily remedied by a quick rinse with water once again, too.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product but won&#x27;t ever use it again.</li>
      <li>This is the first mouthwash I have ever had that tastes OK, and I like to use.  </li>
      <li>After the first day of using it I started to get blisters on my top gum line and a burning sensation.  </li>
      <li>I recently got my tongue pierced and thought this would be a good mouth wash to use, since it was alcohol free.</li>
      <li>In an attempt to remedy this, I began using the mouthwash twice a day to clean the sores from infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
      <li>My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel completely clean unless I use this mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>Some may attempt to scrape off the offending film (which is probably oxidized plaque that inevitably forms on some surfaces even with good brushing) and in so doing, damage the enamel of their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i will continue to purchase it as it seems like it is doing a good job of adding just that extra cleaning after brushing that we are looking for.</li>
      <li>When i did try this the only good thing  </li>
      <li>If to mouth rinse with Crest before the bed, then there is no bad feeling in the mouth in the morning.</li>
      <li>Burns the mouth badly not like</li>
      <li>I was happy to post a glowing review and even defended it to other people.</li>
      <li>My breath was fresh and my teeth felt clean.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the way this product works.... and its benefits to help with plaque and gingivitis... I&#x27;d recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe people use this product. It tastes disgusting and after two days I lost most of my sense of taste -- everything I eat now tastes dull and flavorless. I even tried heaping servings of sriracha hot sauce on everything, but still nothing. I didn&#x27;t realize the problem the first day because it tasted so bad -- I thought the foul gag-me-with-a-spoon flavor was the only problem but now I really hope my sense of taste comes back.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mouthwash I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash does not have any noticeable antibacterial effect, and it actually makes my breath worse.  Honest to goodness, it dries my mouth out and gives me the most awful dragon breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side effects of this product outweigh its benefits.  There are plenty of decent mouthwashes on the market, stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what consumer panel Crest polled when they were developing this product, but they made this ... THING ... that should be completely appealing to those of you who enjoy hours and hours of painful burning sensations in their mouth, accompanied by a loss of taste for days after a single use. Side benefits from this product include: food takes on a wonderful metallic flavor, and if you use this product religiously, Crest has indicated (in the small print, of course) that you mighty be lucky enough to see your teeth turn a lovely shade of brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a mouthwash that Crests touts as their \\&quot;most advanced yet,\\&quot; this reviewer can only think that perhaps this was written ironically by the playful hipsters in  Crest&#x27;s marketing division. A sane consumer, however, would probably disagree. This product is not fabulous or advanced in any sense; far from it, it is an AWFUL step backward and an AWFUL mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to other reviewers, I noticed two hideous ... benefits ... from using this product just a few times. First and foremost, this product brings the pain on like Rocky Marciano or perhaps  a thousand burning habenero peppers. It produced a some serious and lingering burning sensation across the mouth and tongue that, like the Last Airbender, I simply could not wait for it to end. Another ... benefit.. was the a sustained loss of taste, perhaps nice for those of us on a diet, but pretty cruddy for anyone else. After just a couple of days, I noticed that my sense of taste went completely flat. No fine dining for the next few days until my tongue has had a chance to recover from Crest&#x27;s chemical warfare attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even respected brands, like Crest, can produce bad products, and this has to be the worst mouthwash that Crest has ever produced. Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> We have gone through 2 bottles and i will continue to purchase it as it seems like it is doing a good job of adding just that extra cleaning after brushing that we are looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several mouthwashes over the years and have never been overly fond of any of them.  This one I greatly appreciate, though. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and RINSE any toothpaste from your mouth before using it (is that why people are having problems?).  Also, yes, it leaves a foamy white residue on your tongue, but that&#x27;s because it foams slightly when using it due to a tiny bit of hydrogen peroxide in the mix -- I think this is what characterizes it from other similar products.  That&#x27;s easily remedied by a quick rinse with water once again, too.  So it&#x27;s a bit more \\&quot;work\\&quot; (if you can call it that?) than something like Listerine (which, by the way, DEFINITELY produces a burning sensation due to the alcohol -- I&#x27;ve never felt anything akin to that using this), but it&#x27;s also the only mouthwash that has continued to make my mouth feel clean until after I wake up the next day.  (I use it daily, and have for a while now, and have never experienced loss of taste or burning or metallic flavor or anything else that people are complaining about.)  So, I repeat: rinse your mouth with water after brushing your teeth, and then again once you&#x27;ve used this, and you&#x27;ll be fine.  It really is the best.</li>
    <li> Worst mouth wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  Picked this up locally thinking it would be the best after seeing the words &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; and a hefty price tag to go with it.  I was wrong.  I realized after using it in the morning that my tastes were SEVERELY altered by this mouth wash, even hours after using it.  Anything that should taste salty, tasted like it had sugar on it and made my tongue tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely 100% DO NOT recommend this mouth wash.  Stay away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for about 2 weeks straight now, bought it instead of the normal Crest Pro Health Complete mouthwash because I thought the word \\&quot;Clinical\\&quot; would mean that it was in fact better for your mouth. While I have not experienced some of the more severe symptoms others have listed on this site, like the burning sensation in mouth and loss of taste, I can tell you that it leaves a residue in your mouth than cannot simply be rinsed out. After using, I have to rinse my mouth out a dozen or more times to clear it of the white foam that sticks to your tongue and sides of mouth like glue. Even rinsing that many times, I still end up with white in my mouth, and it disgusts me. No mouth wash has ever left stuff in my mouth other than a fresh feeling. This comes with dry mouth, and a whole lot of sticky white spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned there is Hydrogen Peroxide in it which causes the white foamy stuff in your mouth. I use Hydrogen Peroxide to rinse my mouth from time to time, and I can promise you, with a few flushes of water through the mouth all the peroxide leaves with the water. This mouthwash does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy, would not recommend, stick with the normal Crest Pro Health Complete mouthwash, or use something different entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now going to shoot Crest an e-mail and see if they&#x27;ll refund my money, or at the least provide me with a coupon or voucher for their normal mouthwash. This stuff is more expensive, and it&#x27;s worse. Doesn&#x27;t seem right to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 7-26-13: I did in fact contact Crest complaining about this product. Here is their response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for contacting Crest, Justin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry about your experience with the Clinical Rinse and appreciate your reporting it to us.

Please reply to this e-mail with your complete name and mailing address; then allow 2 to 3 weeks for my letter to arrive.

I like the normal Crest Pro Health mouthwashes just fine, so I&#x27;ll just return to using those again.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Works well</li>
    <li> I got this yesterday and since I&#x27;ve used it I haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything. My tongue feels like I&#x27;ve burned it on hot pizza or something.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time last night and I woke up feeling like I had burned my tongue on hot food. Eating breakfast and lunch today I noticed I could still taste my food but not as well and my tongue still feels raw and burned. After looking up the rest of the reviews I&#x27;m going home and dumping the entire bottle and never using again as I value my sense of taste. I&#x27;ve been using Pro Health toothpaste and I&#x27;m dumping THAT too for good measure. Ugh!!!!</li>
    <li> My teeth used to be white. This product turned my teeth to be yellow and brown on some teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product because I was having gum pain. I didn&#x27;t realize I made a terrible mistake in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I ended with yellow teeth and the gum pain didn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please stay away from this product!</li>
    <li> Yes it does have an effect on your taste buds and does burn a bit while using it but it goes away the next day or so. Do it at night before bed. It DOES keep the fuzzies/Gingivitis off your teeth for a while too and it may ROLL back Gingivitis too so it&#x27;s a good product. It MAY do the browning everyone mentions if you don&#x27;t brush BEFORE using it as the germs etc stuck on your teeth \\&quot;die\\&quot; and turn brown. If you brush beforehand you&#x27;re fine! My recommendation is use it once or twice a WEEK, NOT once or twice a DAY and you&#x27;ll be fine. It&#x27;s even been cut in half in price at most stores due to reviews here and elsewhere so get it while it lasts! Crest needs to just fix the recommendation of daily use as well as needs to emphasize that you NEED to brush thoroughly immediately BEFORE use.</li>
    <li> What is this some kind of prank!?! Imagine melting the taste buds off your tongue with paint remover, then having the taste of pocket change and rubber bands in your mouth for 2 weeks. Yep, that&#x27;s basically what you get after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all of the amazing pro-health claims on the bottle, I have decided not wait around to discover if any of the \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; results are true. I stopped using this mouth wash after 2 days for the same reasons many of the other dissatisfied customers are complaining about. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It leaves a thick slimy film in your mouth after using it. This is probably cells from your tongue and gums being stripped off like paint.&lt;br /&gt;2. Your tongue will feel burned for the first day or two, then slightly numb for 1-2 weeks (I&#x27;m not completely sure how long because it&#x27;s been a week and my tongue still feels numb on top).&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve had a very unpleasant metallic taste in my mouth for a week now. I expect it to last for up to 2 weeks according to other reviews. It will ruin the taste of almost anything you eat or drink. I haven&#x27;t been able to enjoy any meals for a week now. It&#x27;s making me really angry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use Crest Pro-health \\&quot;Clinical\\&quot; mouth wash again - even if they paid me to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cool, Crest! Not cool!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe all the bad reviews I love this product,would have given 5 stars but have to admit it does alter the taste for a while, even water tastes funny for a while after using this, but the cleaning results are fantastic, it looks like it basically sucks the placke from teeth and tongue, the white stuff kind off shrinks together and you just spit it out and rinse with water, and your mouth feels a LOT cleaner afterwards, I had a lot of cavities before but no more since I use this mouthwash, it&#x27;s so aggressive on the germs, I can live with a little funny taste, and no burning at all,....</li>
    <li> After using this product I experienced a loss of taste.  I ate gummy bear vitamins and they tasted like rubber, I ate a chocolate chip muffin and it tasted bland. I just Googled Crest Pro-Health and loss of taste and found that there are a lot of others who have had this experience.  Although my mouth felt tingly clean, the loss of taste is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So I had some gum irritation because a wisdom tooth is pushing its way through, so I needed a mouth wash to help ease the soreness till the next time I could see a dentist. I was given this by my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually does help. The sore&#x27;s pain, while not gone completely, soothed it significantly, and my mouth did feel much cleaner. However,the chemical power of this product is much too great! It practically burnt off my tastebuds, for at dinner I tried to eat bread and found it like eating cotton. Moreover, while my wisdom teeth pain is at least manageable, my mouth is weird and tingly. Not what I had in mind to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do use it, use in emergencies only, and definitely use sparingly</li>
    <li> If possible, I would rate this zero stars.  I purchased this product in-store and had not reviewed online beforehand.  After several weeks of use, I noticed that my teeth had stains.  There were brown spots and then it was particularly bad around my bottom four front teeth, both in between the teeth and along the gum line.  My teeth also felt gritty and dirty all the time, even right after brushing.  I discontinued use and hoped that the damage would fade.  It did not.  Someone else actually noticed and very gently asked me about.  That&#x27;s when I panicked.  After doing online research, I realized this would require a trip to the dentist.  After a thorough cleaning, I am pleased to report my dental hygienist gave me my smile back!  Thankfully the damage was not permanent.  I cannot believe a dental product would turn your teeth brown.  Please do not use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year, and never had any problems.  I love it because it definitely works at keeping my gingivitis at bay.  I have had good reports at the dentist since I started using it, and had gum problems before I started.  I use it regularly twice a day, and even take it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. I wish I could give it negative stars. This mouthwash caused brown stains on my lower teeth along the gum line for years. I didn&#x27;t know what was causing it and had to visit my dental hygienist 4 times a year to have the stains removed using a cavitron. I worked with my hygienist to try and determine the cause but she couldn&#x27;t figure to out either. Started looking at Amazon to purchase all my hygiene needs and came across the reviews for this product. I then realized that this product was the cause of this issue that had plagued me for several years. I switched to Act and the stains haven&#x27;t come back. I now visit my dental hygienist 2 times a year instead of 4. My dental hygienist is thrilled that she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant staining. I can&#x27;t believe Crest sells a product like this. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel completely clean unless I use this mouthwash.  No strong alcohol taste like many other reviews state.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the terrible reviews this mouthwash is getting. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had been a long time since I had gone to the dentist so when I finally scheduled to go back, about a month before I started brushing, flossing and rinsing regularly (it always sucks to hear you aren&#x27;t brushing enough!). While being inspected the dentist and hygienist were surprised it had only been a month as my oral health was above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day after I brush (and floss at night), and I&#x27;ve *never* had burning or after-effects like the other reviewers are talking about. I do spit out very unpleasant, foamy textured stuff after I finish but here I am sitting down at my computer 3 minutes later and it&#x27;s already gone. I did just have to spit one last time though. Ick. As for burning, some mouthwashes have me holding back tears by the 30 second mark but with this one I can lose track of time and it&#x27;s not a problem. For me it&#x27;s a subdued burning, not harsh at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: Aside from sensitivity to cold and some cavities and old fillings, I don&#x27;t have dental or oral hygiene issues. I stay away from sodas (nowadays) and excessive sweets. Some people were talking about using this with open sores and just after dental surgery. That doesn&#x27;t sound smart to me at all and I don&#x27;t believe the bottle says anything about that. What I recall being there is it is supposed to help to prevent and combat gingivitis. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m looking for out of this mouthwash (or any, really). I also don&#x27;t drink anything for 10ish minutes afterwards and try not to eat for 30ish minutes afterwards. I do this with all mouthwashes because they all leave my mouth feeling unpleasant, like I have leftover mouthwash, and I avoid doing things that would have me actively swallow more of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t review often but after so many terrible reviews that run completely contrary to my experience I had to write about my own. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because of the foamy stuff you spit out afterwards. That&#x27;s a little worse than other brands / types of mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried, but this is also the strongest mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says Clinical not &amp;#34;Miracle flavor: Tastes like a mouthful of bubblegum while riding a unicorn through a field of cotton candy.&amp;#34; You use stuff like this for your health. If it&#x27;s stronger it stands to reason the taste is slightly more unpleasant.</li>
    <li> First off I want to say I bought this at Wal Mart thinking it was a few steps above other mouthwashes. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and have noticed my sense of taste is gone and my mouth feels like it&#x27;s burnt (like having hot soup or pizza). I&#x27;ve stopped using it for a day now and my mouth is still feeling numb. I can&#x27;t taste what I&#x27;m eating..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be spreading the word online, at stores and wherever I can to avoid any crest products.. Especially the mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest is a joke. Anyone reading this, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: At this point I am going on principle, the money I spent on this is not as big of an issue. The thing that irks me is that these clowns at Crest are reading these reviews and DOING NOTHING about it fixing this garbage they call a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be contacting my doctor and my lawyer to see if this is something I should be taking to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The burnt and numb feeling is gone from my mouth once I stopped using it for a few days. I was able to return this garbage back to wal mart for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To crest, I say this: Kindly PISS OFF until you fix the formula in this mouthwash. I hope you lose even more sales because of this review.</li>
    <li> this stuff works GREAT!!!  I had such a result from the first use, that i began to use it twice a day. It was then, I did notice, like some of the other reviewers, that I had the sensation of numbness at the tip of my toungue. took it back to once a day and have had no problems since. My dentist has noticed the change in my gums, too!</li>
    <li> So I swished for 30 seconds, got chemical burns to my gums and lost the ability to taste food for about a day.  It was pretty bad and it took hours to get the burning and bad taste out of my mouth.  It contains Cetylpyridinium chloride, which some (a lot?) of people are sensitive to.  Threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> You have been warned...Do not use this product...I used it twice...mouth was in so much pain could not sleep a wink....My tongue swelled to the point I had trouble swallowing...Tongue hurt so bad I could not touch it.  2 days later....pain has decreased...gums&lt;br /&gt;still sore....taste buds shot....Some skin peeling from the inside of my mouth.  It&#x27;s like rinsing with paint thinner...Cannot believe this product is stil on the shelves.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something strong to stop my gum bleeding. But this thing burns my tongue after each use. After 3 use I lost taste in my tongue.</li>
    <li> I used this mouthwash for quite some time when I began noticing yellow and brown stains on my teeth. After some research I realized what caused the issue. From this point on I will no longer be using any crest products. I cannot believe that such a BIG name in oral hygiene would sell something they knew was doing this to people. To add insult to injury this product is STILL on the market. Even after the uproar from consumers and consumer advocate groups. I understand they want to keep their niche in alcohol-free mouthwashes but at what expense?</li>
    <li> I just started using this product a month ago and after using it for two weeks, I started to feel numb on my tongue and pain on the floor of my mouth. I woke up with swollen salivary gland one morning and it was painful to move my tongue around. I thought I have some sort of viral or bacteria infection so I kept using it (thinking that the mouth rinse could help). I have been waking up in the morning with swollen lips at least for a week without realizing this product was the culprit. It messes up my whole mouth and makes eating and brushing difficult. I stopped using it a few days ago and my mouth was finally recovered until recently, I used it again...BIG MISTAKE!! My symptoms came back more quickly and severe on my second occurrence. Now, I&#x27;m 100% sure this product should take the blame for it. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item despite negative reviews and I am so sorry I didn&#x27;t listen! I used this twice and not only does it burn when used but it left a white film all over my tongue and gums which couldn&#x27;t be removed even after rinsing with water. The next day after using I broke out with blisters in 3 places in my mouth. I will be returning this product. I do not recommend it at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after a dentist visit and needed something to heal my gums faster. I opted for this mouth rinse because it didnt contain alcohol and it seems as though it would be a good choice for people who have sensitive mouths. I used this product for two days before my tongue and cheeks started feeling a slight burning sensation. I thought it would go away as the day progressed but it got WORSE. By the time I was ready to go to bed I could barely sleep because I was in so much pain. The next day I had sores allover my lower gum line. Considering the amount of people complaining about this, you would think they would pull this off the shelves by now or at the very least write these things in the warning or side-effects section. After finally getting my dental work done and having a healthy mouth, this piece of garbage just worsened by condition. For those of you who also shared a similar experience, i would suggest trying oil-pulling and gargling salt water for the next couple of days. I will never be purchasing another Crest product ever again.</li>
    <li> It should be removed from the market.It temporarily(I hope) damaged my sense of taste,and damaged my right salivary gland.I experienced moderate pain as my salivary gland was stimulated before eating food.What the hell?I followed the instructions,I have used post dental procedures rinses with similar ingredients which did not have this adverse reaction.Shame on proctor and gamble for putting this on the market.I will NEVER by any of their products again.I am very hesitant to eat anything today...thanks alot.</li>
    <li> This product is so bad it caused me to write my first amazon review ever. After two uses, as others experienced, my tongue feels burnt and there is a odd metallic strange taste in my mouth still 24 hours later.  Steer clear.</li>
    <li> This product will stain your teeth a horrible brown colour! I thought I had some sort of disease, but nope -- just Crest!</li>
    <li> This is the first mouthwash I have ever had that tastes OK, and I like to use.  I often use it for additional freshness before bedtime and durig the day.</li>
    <li> I had some temporary pain in my jaw area on one side (irritation of some gland?) and it destroyed my sense of taste for days (not just minutes) after using it.  There is research out there on how variable people&#x27;s sense of taste can be- maybe for some it&#x27;s not totally disruptive.  For me, right now nothing tastes right- very little flavor altogether, but everything is too sweet and weirdly metallic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets two stars instead of one because I called the number on the bottle and they are sending me a coupon to replace it for free with another Crest product.</li>
    <li> Simply the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this product was great.  My breath was fresh and my teeth felt clean.  After using this rinse for 3 days, I began to lose taste, my tongue turned white, and my tongue burned like heck.  I was not aware it was the mount rinse that was causing this until I came to Amazon to read reviews. Sure enough, it was the mouthwash. After 2 days of not using the Pro-Health rinse, but tongue is healing. Hopefully I will regain my sense of taste.  This product should not be sold.  With enough use, I can see it causing permanent damage to the mouth and tongue.</li>
    <li> 0 stars if I could!!  I was having lots of bleeding with flossing and decided to try this.  Holy cow, worst mistake ever.  At first I thought it was working well but after 2 days my tongue felt burned, I lost all taste, and I was having pain in the salivary glands in front of my ears.  Eating caused my tongue to burn even worse.  Looking for something else, because this is the worst thing out there</li>
    <li> I used it twice and I can&#x27;t taste anything!!!!!!  This stuff is terrible!!!  My tongue feels burned.  I even rinsed after using it because my mouth kept foaming.</li>
    <li> Just a little preamble: I never write reviews, and I am not one of those people who likes to rant on the Internet. But any potential buyer of this product should know what they are in for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this mouthwash up on a whim at my local drugstore. It looked more professional and perhaps gentler than classic alcohol-based mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the mouthwash, the sensation was so odd I almost threw it away right then. It foamed somewhat and my tongue felt very weird, like it had been badly burned and numbed at the same time. However, I continued using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days, I started developing small ulcers on the inside of my upper lip, along the gums. In an attempt to remedy this, I began using the mouthwash twice a day to clean the sores from infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, the ulcers were still there and suddenly I couldn&#x27;t taste anything, not spicier foods. Frustrated, I continued my oral care with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days more (about a week after buying the mouthwash), I still have ulcers all along my upper lip and am now getting additional sore along my lower gums on one side. The ulcers are so painful that eating, drinking, and even talking are all excruciating!! I have had stress-related ulcers before, but never to this extent or for this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it occurred to me that the only change I had made was this new mouthwash. So, I googled the brand and alas, it appears that many, many people have reported similar side effects, with some reports going back at least 5 years. Just a quick google search will show you how many people are experiencing my same symptoms as well as scarier ones: brown teeth, black gums, neck and chest pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble are aware of the problem, but continue to sell the product with no warning. Save yourself some money and a lot of pain by passing on this mouthwash. I wish I had never picked it up myself.</li>
    <li> If I could give this -5 stars I would as well. I am so upset with this product I am writing a my very first review. I recently got my tongue pierced and thought this would be a good mouth wash to use, since it was alcohol free. I used this product for only two days, about 4-6x and my mouth is in the worst pain I have ever experienced. My tongue feels completely burnt and numb. My cheeks and gums are so sore and I have white bumps on the the tips of my tongue that are extremely painful. I wouldn&#x27;t wish this on my worst enemy!!  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! Currently trying to find anything to ease the pain!</li>
    <li> After my last dentist trip I decided to be more proactive. I went looking for something like this. After two uses the chemical burns to my taste buds took two days to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Wow. I have no idea how anyone can give this a high rating. And yes I followed the directions.</li>
    <li> This is a good product</li>
    <li> What is this? Add yet another person who will never buy another Crest product to the list. I can&#x27;t taste anything, my tongue is burning - and thankfully, I decided to look this up before my teeth were stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this product still out in the market? This needs to be addressed.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mouthwash I have ever used. I bought some from CVS and thought it would be great because of the &#x27;clinical&#x27; name. Turns out, all it does is burn. My mouth is still burning as we speak. Avoid this mouth wash at all costs! I don&#x27;t know how to make the burning stop!</li>
    <li> A number of people have complained about burning, etc. This will happen if you do not follow the directions. The directions are specific: Use twice a day and rinse for 30 seconds after rinsing all the toothpaste out of your mouth. This is simply the best mouthwash I have found, but it is not a case of more is better. If you use it more than twice a day or rinse for too long, your mouth will probably burn and that is not a good thing. I have a very sensitive mouth. I cannot even eat food that is too hot. The slightest bit of trauma to the mouth or the wrong toothpaste will result in mouth ulcers. However, I have found this mouthwash causes no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I experienced taste disturbances for several days after briefly using this product,  It should not be on the market without a big warning label.</li>
    <li> Have tartar/gum problems? This is your answer. Works better than any mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This stuff needs taken off shelves. It&#x27;s toxic and damaging to your mouth. Unless you were already planning a painful and expensive trip to the dentist don&#x27;t use this product. It&#x27;s absurd to me that this mouth wash ever made it to production.</li>
    <li> Left my mouth covered with white stuff... I think the white stuff ARE my gums. I feel as if this mouthwash just burned and peeled everything away. I highly do not recommend this product. Has only caused harm. Do not buy Crest in general, they use plastic in their products too!</li>
    <li> Stained between my teeth a very dark blackish brown, outlining each tooth and ruining my smile. It DOES burn and leave a weird film and numb the taste buds as others have said, but for me the worst side effect was the stains. Stay away.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know about the consumer reports about how this product was causing brown stains for some cosumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways im here to report I&#x27;m one of 3% of consumers that have suffered the bad affects of using this mouthwash. After about 2 weeks of directed use brown and yellow spots started appearing near the gum line of my teeth that have regular contact with the sides of my mouth. Then i started looking around for more information about this i found many consumers have also suffered this. When my regular dental check up came around i asked for whitening treatment and they couldn&#x27;t get the stains off. The areas that weren&#x27;t affected by this product became pearly white after treatment but the affected areas stayed brownish yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are even law firms accepting clients to build a case against Proctor &amp; Gamble. As apparently the FDA and P&amp;G new about the affects and how it will stain the teeth, and the FDA didn&#x27;t find the staining to be dangerous so they didn&#x27;t require P&amp;G to put a warning on the label. I cannot support a company that does that kind of technical foul practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consumers be warned. 3% of consumers are expected to experience brown-yellowish staining while using this product.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash has a terrible taste, and is much worse than the cheaper alcohol based mouth washes. Even worse, after using the product for 3 days I have lost most of my ability to taste and my tongue feels like it has been chemically burned. The pain on my tongue actually woke me up in the middle of the night, it felt like I went to sleep with acid in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a lingering foam that stays in your mouth after you use it. I try spiting it out but it continues to foam. This is a terrible product and I have no idea how it managed to get FDA approval. If you read online there are many sites and news stories about how this product is hurting people, Crest needs to stop selling these.</li>
    <li> Tastes like someone farted in my mouth and I let it ferment their ~ 1 month. I just picked this up and was getting ready to go out and was like \\&quot;ok let&#x27;s just finishing groomin up with some mouthwash\\&quot;. Gurgle for 30s. Spit in sink. Than noticed this putrid smell. At first I wondered if I had a small bowel obstruction and was regurgitating fecal matter but realized that can&#x27;t be the case bc I had a successful (and impressive) bowel movement everyday for last week. I realized it was the mouthwash so tried to dilute it by swishing water around... No luck. Started dry heaving from taste. Finally after 5more minutes of putting my mouth on my kitchen facet taste is down to a baby fart. I hate you crest! My dreams will be haunted by your product tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hesitant to throw this product away. I feel like I should burn it and read some sacred passages from some ancient text. It&#x27;s that bad!</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash. I have problems with my gums and this stuff works!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone that doesn&#x27;t need such a strong rinse, but it&#x27;s a lot easier to handle than Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s even better is that they don&#x27;t seem to sell this product in this size near me, so finding this was great!</li>
    <li> I would love to give this -5 stars. This is the most horrible mouthwash ever. I bought it at Kroger a couple weeks ago buying into all the claims on the bottle. I always get severe canker sores from using products with sodium lauryl sulfate and since it was not in this mouthwash, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve used it off and on for the last couple weeks and just last night could not figure out why everything I have been eating tasted like nothing at all. No matter how much salt or sugar was in everything I ate, I could not taste it. I have been adding extra salt to all my savory foods wondering what was going on. Well, last night I decided to do a google search on &amp;#34;not being able to taste food&amp;#34; along with &amp;#34;mouthwash&amp;#34; and lo and behold, this very mouthwash comes up over and over. To add to that, I have had 3 or 4 canker sores over the past couple weeks and using my normal Glyoxide (great product, by the way) to cleanse my mouth has not been as effective as usual. Only to find out that this mouthwash has been destroying the inside of my mouth. The active ingredient in this mouthwash is toxic! Please do not use this! The rest of my bottle is going directly down the drain along with the money I spent on this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> If to mouth rinse with Crest before the bed, then there is no bad feeling in the mouth in the morning. I like it.</li>
    <li> Very surprised to see the amount of negative reviews. People are mentioning the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ulcers&lt;br /&gt;- Loss of taste&lt;br /&gt;- Stains&lt;br /&gt;- Swelling / Jaw Pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this multiple times in the past and now as well, without any of the above symptoms whatsoever. The only thing I&#x27;ve seen similar to descriptions here is the foaminess/film that it leaves behind. This is to be expected though with its ingredients, and is probably how it continues working long after rinsing. CPC is known to stay around and continue killing germs long after the initial rinse. They&#x27;ve probably also added ingredients to give it this property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not doubting the reports of the above issues. In fact, seeing so many negative reviews makes me think twice about the product, but I&#x27;ll continue using since I&#x27;ve had no issues. I will keep a keen eye out for anything happening though. Maybe some of the ingredients are very prone to cause allergic reactions and I happen to be one that it doesn&#x27;t affect? I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that it is helping my gum health. Less swelling/bleeding/pain and a cleaner feeling of teeth overall. Sorry that it doesn&#x27;t work well for more people though...</li>
    <li> I should have checked reviews on Amazon before buying this at the store. It BURNED my tongue! I couldn&#x27;t taste food all day because of it! WORST mouthwash I have ever experienced. There should be a RECALL for safety hazard.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used this for several months. I did learn to rinse all the toothpaste out of my mouth first and rinse afterward. The health of my gums has improved due to the intense cleaning the peroxide does. I let it bubble in my mouth about a minute and then spit it out and wait about 30 Seconds  and rinse throughly. It does make my tongue a bit odd for a bit and  at one point a tooth became sensitive because it was cleaning in the exposed bit of root. I feel my teeth feel healthier and I am sure I have less bacteria in my gums. When I was a kid and would have inflammation on my gums my mom had me use straight peroxide and it cleared it up. Keep making it Crest! I signed on to buy more!</li>
    <li> On the plus side, this mouthwash cleared up a bad case of halitosis with just one use. I used it for three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, it&#x27;s been 34 hours since I stopped using it, and food still doesn&#x27;t taste right. The taste of salt is completely gone, along with sweetness. Just to test it out, I licked up a fair quantity of salt grains. It was as though I had nothing but grit on my tongue. Currently, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference between Coke and Dr. Pepper in a blind taste test. Running searches on this product revealed many complaints related to diminished taste and browning teeth. Interestingly, I&#x27;ve used other mouth washes with the same cetylpyridinium chloride active ingredient, but at a lower concentration, 0.075%, without issue.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but the taste is nice, and it does what it is supposed to do, it is mouthwash, however compared to the scope that I was using, I prefer this, it taste better, leaves my mouth feeling cleaner, and I can tell its whitening my teeth! I have subscribed to this now, and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and used for 2 days as directed.  After 2 days I can no longer taste anything, the entire inside of my mouth is incredibly painful, and I&#x27;m in process of scheduling an emergency trip to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first review of any product on Amazon.  I feel strongly enough about it to waste time where I could be working to get on Amazon, search for the product, figure out how to write a review,and actually write a review.  My experience was HORRIBLE with this product.  Stay away from it.</li>
    <li> Leaves a bad taste after using it and does not make mouth feel fresh like the other mouthwashes from crest</li>
    <li> I used this mouth wash for 2 days straight. I used it once at day. 3rd day I woke up with horrible jaw pain! I couldn&#x27;t really eat because it was painful to open my jaw. It felt like it was getting stuck, like if I was getting locked jaw! I stopped using it for 3 day and the pain went away. I used it again and the pain was back the next morning! So I figured it was the mouth wash after that..0</li>
    <li> I bought this cause I thought it would help me get RID of my canker sores that I had on my gums.  WRONG.  The first time I used it it burned so badly and the next day I ended up with little cankersores (like four) on my tongue that still have not gone away yet (it&#x27;s been like, a week??)  It sucks because eating anything is extremely painful now!!!  I WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS STUFF.  Obviously I am NOT the only one to experience something like this.  Have never had such a bad reaction to mouthwash before!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walgreens, not Amazon.  It was on sale and included a rebate coupon, so it ended up costing about $.50.  Sounds like a good deal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really.  I used it twice (last night and this morning), and now I cannot taste anything.  I have a strange metallic taste in my mouth and my tongue feels \\&quot;furry.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad stuff.</li>
    <li> My mouth has never felt so clean. I used to suffer from occasional soreness on cheeks/gums, all gone now. Teeth look great, even with all the coffee I drink.</li>
    <li> Add me to the list of people shocked from the side effects of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am accustomed to some foods tasting funny for an hour or two past using an intense mouthwash, but this is beyond the pale.  I used this product at 8pm last night, and almost twelve hours later at breakfast I still had that post-mouthwash/ metallic/ medicine taste in my mouth...and yes, breakfast was ruined.  This sent me running to Whole Foods to try a natural mouthwash.  I am not shocked to see the overwhelmingly bad reviews here of people having a similar experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years  after my Dentist recommended it. I&#x27;ll use it as long as they keep offering it.  Geo.</li>
    <li> I used prohealth whitening mouthwash for a year and then my teeth started to yellow.  My dentist had to scrape it off and told me that this is a common effect of the prohealth products!  DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on Amazon.  I purchased this item at Target and planned to use it after the oral irrigator I DID purchase on Amazon.  So, I&#x27;ve noticed these brown stains between my teeth.  I thought, what&#x27;s up with that?  The more I clean my teeth, the more brown stains I get.  It looks awful!  I googled stains between teeth and what do you know..the first thing that came up was about Pro-health mouthwashes causing brown stains on teeth.  I sure hope they&#x27;ll come off.  I have not been to the dentist yet, but I sure am going to stop using this product.  I did like it when I first used it because it made my  mouth feel so clean.  I will update if the stains come off or not.  I am SO MAD.  I do not believe for one second it&#x27;s only 3%.  Oh, and I did look at the bottle and it does mention the possibility of staining.  I never would have thought...</li>
    <li> I have fairly advanced gum disease and I am one of those people whom is afraid of the dentist. I know I have to go soon, but I have tried many different products to help slow down the disease until I can afford to go and this product is far and away THE BEST of anything I have tried and I have tried dozens of things. This will always remain my favorite mouthwash. It stings a little but it works. I don&#x27;t even rinse it out with water afterwards because I don&#x27;t want to reduce its effectiveness. But, the sting goes away anyway after a minute or so. Some people have said it alters the taste of their food, but that applies to every mouthwash I have ever used. That effect also goes away fairly quickly; within about an hour. But, the results don&#x27;t lie. This stuff really works and I noticed a huge change for  the better after only using it for a few weeks. I use it about 2 to 4 times a day and Ive been using it for almost 3 months now. It is virtually a miracle product. I can&#x27;t imagine any mouthwash could possibly be any better.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever done this, but I&#x27;m editing my original review. After using this mouthwash for several weeks, I&#x27;ve had a change of heart.    My original review was 5 stars and VERY long, so I&#x27;ll sum it up: I have two crowns (one on each side) that are inflamed and very painful. This mouthwash got rid of the pain and seemed to reduce the inflammation around the crowns, so at first I was thrilled. And to be fair, I also originally pointed out the negatives: it tastes NASTY, foams ridiculously (with foam that just keeps on coming for up to half an hour), and actually gave me bad breath. But it got rid of the pain, so as far as I was concerned it was a miracle worker. I was happy to post a glowing review and even defended it to other people. Yay!! Right?    Wrong. I have now been using this mouthwash every night for several weeks. Only at night (due to all the foam), and in combination with Crest Pro Health Sensitive &amp; Enamel Shield toothpaste (morning &amp; night) + daily flossing. At first it seemed like things improved. The throbbing in the crowns immediately went away. But after a week or so I started noticing the sore throat &amp; burned tongue other people talked about. It progressed to what felt like swollen tonsils - like a wad of bubble gum that I just couldn&#x27;t swallow.    Then the &#x27;ghost pains&#x27; started in ALL of my teeth. Prior to using this mouthwash I had sensitivity in those two crowns, particularly when flossing. The dentist had recommended the sensitive toothpaste, which seemed to help a little. But after a few weeks of this mouthwash I had pain in ALL of my teeth. The only way I can describe it is to say it feels like my teeth have been \\&quot;peeled,\\&quot; leaving every single tooth sensitive to EVERYTHING. Hot, cold, even breathing through my mouth causes pain.    And this morning I pulled my lips way up high and looked very closely at those crowns. They&#x27;re in the back, so they&#x27;re hard to see. But I took a good look (more than my usual \\&quot;smile\\&quot; check afterbrushing). The gums around those crowns are GRAY. I don&#x27;t know what that means but it scared the daylights out of me. One of the crowns is also inflamed FAR WORSE than it was prior to using the mouthwash. I actually started crying.    I can honestly say I&#x27;m now frightened of this mouthwash. I feel like I&#x27;ve been dousing my mouth in harsh chemicals, and I&#x27;m terrified I&#x27;ve done some kind of permanent damage to my teeth. Obviously I dumped it out and will NEVER use this stuff again. I also threw out the Crest toothpaste as well. I wasn&#x27;t wild about all those plastic bits in the toothpaste, but it was cheaper than Sensodyne so I stuck with it. Not anymore. Two weeks of using this mouthwash just erased 30+ years of faithfully using and trusting Crest products. I don&#x27;t know if this mouthwash is actually dangerous or not, but it is without a doubt frightening.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased Crest Clinical mouth mouth six weeks ago, just after getting my teeth professionally cleaned.  I initially really liked the foaming action and the clean feeling it left in my mouth after use.  After using the first bottle I purchased a second bottle, which my wife and I shared.  After less than six weeks of use, I noticed that I was getting a lot of brown staining between my teeth, which I have never had in 50 years of owning my teeth. When I contact Crest regarding the unsightly staining, they told me that a small percentage of users will get brown staining which is cause by the dead bacteria building up on your teeth (yes very appealing).  I cannot imagine why any product which claims to whiten teach, but can cause such staining is still on the market. They apologized and are sending a refund for my purchase.  I am asking them to pay to have my teach professionally cleaned because I cannot get the stains off myself.  I have been using Crest products my whole life and have never had problems like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife stopped using the product because it took away her sense of taste.  After a few days of discontinuing use, her taste returned.  So to summarize:  brown teeth stains and a loss of taste.  Stay far away.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  After the first day of using it I started to get blisters on my top gum line and a burning sensation.  Please do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 days.  I started experiencing a metallic taste in my mouth but thought it was a reaction to medication.  Gradually I have been noticing food tasting differently.  Today, the third day I no longer can taste salt and most of other taste sensations are significantly diminished.  I have read other reviews here and elsewhere that this product can cause that.  Please spread the word so this does not happen to others.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this stuff is dangerous!  After using this the left side of my face is swollen and my jaw really hurts,  making eating painful.  This should be banned and a law suit should be filed.  There is no way p&amp;g aren&#x27;t aware of these issues.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a month or so and discovered as others have posted that it stains your teeth yellow. Now my teeth look horrible. I just purchased Crest whitening strips. Clever sales tactic, Crest.</li>
    <li> In my case the foaming did not bother me. That is probably because, knowing there was hydrogen peroxide in it, I rinsed my mouth twice after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I noticed that if I failed to rinse my white sink thoroughly after spitting it out, in the morning there were brown stains. I could get them off the porcelain fairly easily but that combined with the staining reports of other reviewers is enough evidence to look elsewhere for an alcohol-free mouthwash. In my opinion, it is downright stupid of a manufacturer to market a product that they know stains teeth, saying as they do here, \\&quot;In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who care about their appearance do not want filthy-looking teeth, even temporarily. Some may attempt to scrape off the offending film (which is probably oxidized plaque that inevitably forms on some surfaces even with good brushing) and in so doing, damage the enamel of their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proctor &amp; Gamble gives you 60 days in which you can get a refund if not satisfied. In this case I bought ahead so as to not run out (don&#x27;t most people?), so I&#x27;m out of luck there.</li>
    <li> This stuff browned my teeth more than I could stand.  If you have very straight teeth, and you clean them very, very well prior to using this mouthwash, you might like it.</li>
    <li> After several days of use, noticed my tongue was going numb and couldn&#x27;t taste properly - almost feels like when you burn it. It also appears to make the back of my tongue black and has stained some of the gaps between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot fathom how they&#x27;re allowed to keep this product on the market!</li>
    <li> having occasionally issues with an infection on one gum area, forgot for days to remove food particles between teeth, this solution gives relief and heals within days. No need to see the dentist, which I otherwise like like my hairdresser</li>
    <li> I have also noticed brown staining on the gumline of my teeth.  I tried to have them whitened and nothing worked.  Don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> I have unhealthy gums, and normal mouthwash just doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash is a little more uncomfortable than other mouthwash, but so is going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes my swollen gums look healthy after one use. And it&#x27;s the only mouthwash that keeps my mouth that keeps my mouth from feeling icky in the morning after using it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After mouth washing and spitting it out, you see the bubbles lining your gums from this stuff killing bacteria, just like you see peroxide bubbles on a wound from the peroxide killing the baddies.</li>
    <li> Great. Improved my oral health from one visit to the next. Gets better as your health gets better.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I enjoy Pro-Health Toothpaste and thought it would pair nicely. Plus, it was cheaper than Listerine, so I figured that I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I noticed that as I swished it around, a slimy precipitate formed. I first figured that it was just a sign that it was working, but after a few days, it became worrisome. It also leaves a white film inside your mouth and along your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I noticed that my gums started to get irritated and my tongue became extremely sensitve. I have since stopped using it and would recommend that others avoid this at all costs. It seems caustic and potentially hazardous. I will be contacting P and G soon.</li>
    <li> To start- **this review is strictly for the product** and not for any sellers of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, DO NOT BUY THIS! It is absolutely AWFUL. The side-effects are not worth whatever the benefits may be, if any exist. The side-effects include: a gross after-taste that hangs around for a very long time (overnight), it burns the insides of your mouth including your gums and tongue, this leads to not being able to taste anything for days after (I used it 2 days ago, and still have a burnt tongue which makes eating un-enjoyable), and it has been known to cause brown spots on teeth that CANNOT be removed even by a professional dental cleaning (don&#x27;t believe Crest who will tell you otherwise). Look elsewhere, and consider avoiding the Crest brand altogether since they don&#x27;t care for their consumers at all and continue to sell this horrible product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews, but I had to get on to warn people away from this. I ran out of my regular mouthwash one day, and decided to try this instead. BIG MISTAKE. I used it twice: once before bed, and once again in the morning. Hours later, my breakfast tastes like a combination of burning and bland (yes my mouth tingled while it tasted like nothing). I get online, only to see all over the web that tons of people have this problem, and there isn&#x27;t any indication of how long it will take for my taste to come back. Also, according to Crest&#x27;s own website, this can stain your teeth brown! Good thing I won&#x27;t be using it long enough to find out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 0 stars if I could. DON&#x27;T USE IT! This should not be legal. I will be filing a complaint with Proctor and Gamble as well as with the FDA. If you&#x27;re looking for a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol because of the burn, look elsewhere because this still burns while also destroying your sense of taste.</li>
    <li> When i did try this the only good thing  i can say that i was on antibiotics so i had thrush on my tonge the first time i used it it burnt my tonge so bad all the thrush was gone and left raw and i couldnt taste any thing then my teeth turned sensitive it was horrible. I told my sister she was like i think it&#x27;s your mouth (she thought my mouth was Yuck) so i gave it to her lol. Her tonge turned raw teeth sensitive she tasted metal for 2 days it was kind of funny i must say lol. This for no reason went on amazon and was so shocked from the reviews were horrible went on youtube it was on the news and when i found out it turns your teeth brown boy was i happy it burned all my taste-buds and gave me early signs because it would have been horrible to have brown teeth. In poured this down the drain called cfrest and got my money back !!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t taste anything for 24 hours after I use this product. My tongue is really sensitive too. Yuck. I thought about letting my husband try it, but I honestly feel safer just pouring it out.</li>
    <li> After a few days, a metallic feel &amp; taste would not leave my tongue and it is VERY uncomfortable!! I find myself &amp;#34;bothering&amp;#34; my tongue all day to try to get rid of the effects but nothing helps. WARNING!! Horrible product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite a while - starting on my 3rd bottle.  It does burn and does foam.  The foam is from the peroxide and I welcome it!  I pour the product in one of the lids and add salt to it.  This cuts the burning some, and I feel the salt is even more soothing and healing.  I keep the product off the tip of my tongue, and RINSE WELL after swishing around on my teeth and gums for about 1 - 2 minutes. However, since this product is an &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34; with Amazon, instead of ordering $25 of products that I don&#x27;t need in order to buy it, I go to the nearest drug store and buy it; no shipping charges, no $25 of stuff I don&#x27;t need!!</li>
    <li> I grew up in the Listerine generation, so I can tolerate a lot if I think it will help me keep my teeth and gums healthy.  But this mouthwash is way beyond me.  Although it&#x27;s very tempting to think that any mouthwash this strong must be doing a great job, I really have to wonder if a chemical that burns my otherwise healthy mouth and makes me salivate for three minutes after I spit it out can be all that good for me.  I&#x27;m not going to find out because I am through with this unfortunate little experiment in oral hygiene...</li>
    <li> I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you&#x27;re rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I&#x27;m getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I&#x27;m miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that&#x27;s just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don&#x27;t think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I&#x27;ve permanently damaged my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awful, awful products.  Research them, and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the same boat as what appears to be many other reviewers.  I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is even on the market, and I&#x27;d strongly recommend the government look into the safety of this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for 4 days, but I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m done with it.  This stuff is very acidic or something, and if it kills bad breath, well it also kills your ability to taste your food.  My tongue is very sore from using it, and I&#x27;d imagine it would be very unhealthy and possibly damaging to keep using it.  Do not buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 weeks.  After use it constantly got worse in tingling and burning of the mouth.  By day 21 I had to spit it out within seconds of it touching my mouth because of throbbing and what felt like chemical burns. Some people report faster times till pain and discomfort (some within one use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look inside to my cheek and found scar tissue (white bumps) in the exact spot of burning.  I then went to sleep to find my cheek swollen up the next morning. Through out the next day my cheek fell in swelling and I am still recovering 2 days later (white spots getting smaller).  Very tender in the area and will go to doctor to get advice within the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT SHIP your bottle back to Crest. They will offer to pay shipping etc. DO NOT do this.  If they ask for a sample you could give that. This is your evidence and CPC in percentage in this product could be negligence by Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinical Trials by this company have shown exactly this among a high percentage of users and calling them shows many \\&quot;operators\\&quot; have taken compliants like this daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember this is NON-Alcoholic. If it burns...STOP USING THE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Toxic!!!!!!!  I bought this at walmart, thinking it was the best mouth rinse available- based on claims on bottle at least.  I used this for a couple of weeks, with no obvious side effects.  During this time I had a constant sore throat, and figured I was just coming down with something.  About 2 weeks in I woke up with swollen cheeks, and blister looking sores on the inside of my mouth.  Of course it was a Saturday so my dentist/doctor was closed.  I finally realized my problems started when I started this mouthwash.  Decided to check reviews, and wow!!!  I happened to have my dental checkup a couple of days later, my dentist informed me that I had these sores way back in my throat as well (explains sore throat) and my glands were swollen.  It has now been 72 hours since I stopped using, and thankfully my throat/sores are almost healed.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product but won&#x27;t ever use it again. After 3 uses I found food had very little flavor and my tongue felt strange! This was a little concerning until I researched the product and found this is a possible side effect of this product. To say I&#x27;m disappointed is an understatement.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! Burns the mouth badly not like your typical mouth wash burn. I used the product for three days morning &amp; night, I had to stop using it because I could not taste anything any more. Took over 1 week to start regaining taste back after stopped using this product. I am going back to Listerine! I emailed Crest and they have never replied to my email regarding this horrible product.</li>
    <li> I usually used baking soda and peroxide, it great to find a product that also uses these and with a fresh scent and taste</li>
    <li> I rarely write a review - but in this case I feel the need to share my personal experience.  I started using this product 2 months ago and my teeth became stained and very sensitive to cold.  I told my dentist during my latest check up and he said many others have complained of the same thing.  He told me to stop using the product immediately and I will.</li>
    <li> GREAT.looked better than on line.and was shipped ,I love it love it ,love it,,,,,,,, good quality nice design ,,,,I would recomend it to every one,,</li>
    <li> This may be the worst product I have ever bought.  I thought it was just me but after reading all the other reviews of this product line I know it is not.  I used the product as directed last night before bed.  First off it burns but only mildly, but the main thing i noticed during use was the excessive foaming.  I looked like Cujo by the time 30 seconds was up.  Then after spitting it out i noticed the entire inside of my mouth coated in foam, worst of all my tongue was caked with the stuff.  I kept spitting to get rid of it but never could.  So I went to bed.  This morning going on 12 hours later and I still cannot taste anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a crest toothpaste user since I was a kid and will continue to use it, but didn&#x27;t anyone test this product before deciding to sell it?  It is a better dieting aid then mouth wash.... though I presume if you don&#x27;t feel like eating or drinking anything than there is less of a chance for plaque so there is a bonus there too.</li>
    <li> Worse mouthwash ever! I usually just rinse with hydrogen peroxide, but decided to change it up with this disgusting, toxic chemic rinse instead thinking it would somehow be better. Immediately had a metallic burning taste in my mouth, my throat felt swollen and numb, I felt slightly nauseous, the tip of my tongue feels dry, my ear canal is aching and I lost my sense of taste. These symptoms persisted for the rest of the day with sense of taste just starting to reappear after about 6 hours, and other symptoms appearing later like the ear pain, mouth dryness, swollen glands, jaw pain and headache. I actually called Crest because I was so freaked out by the loss of taste and they offered to send me some pro-health toothpaste... um, no thanks. They assured me loss of taste was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; due to the CPC and it would return eventually. uh huh, so if it&#x27;s so normal-- which it appears to be from the other 78 one-star reviews here-- shouldnt they list that on the bottle? As far as I&#x27;m concerned CPC is not safe and should not be used. Anything that has this many immediate side effects should NOT be in an over the counter mouthwash. Crest said they will refund my money. Never using this product again and I highly recommend no one else does either unless you hate food, love the taste of copper and have a thing for drymouth and burning sensations.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues at the dentist since I started using this mouth wash!</li>
    <li> Worst dental product I&#x27;ve ever used. I lost my sense of taste after using this and my mouth and tongue feel weird and as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, it foams in my mouth for about 15minutes after use. Stay away from this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product locally.  Shortly after using it my sense of taste vanished completely.  I did not immediately make the connection and visited my doctor after a week of not being able to taste anything.  He was unable to diagnose the problem.  I stopped using this product while on vacation and my taste return a few days later.  When I got home I used it again and my taste immediately disappeared again and that&#x27;s when I finally made the connection.  I know there are already plenty of reports here about it but I wanted to add mine.</li>
    <li> I love this rinse.  Your mouth will feel clean and fresh for hours.  My husband and I have an issue with bleeding gums and this product has helped to reduce it greatly!  Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t always find it in the grocery but when you can, I suggest you try it.  It really seems to help with overall dental and gum health!</li>
