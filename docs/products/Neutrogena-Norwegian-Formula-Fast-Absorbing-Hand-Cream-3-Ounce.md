      <li>A great all-around hand moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Since it works great, I live with the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Since it stands &amp;#34;upside down&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s extremely easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Absorbs very quickly.</li>
      <li>This is fine.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of all their products.</li>
      <li>Great product for dry hands.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin looking young and healthy!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is overwhelming for my senses and very floral.</li>
      <li>It is non greasy and seems to disappear into the skin quickly, which I like.</li>
      <li>I can easily put it in my bag, very convenient.</li>
      <li>It smells like the topside of a freshly shaved yak in the Nepali winter and is twice as gentle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good for the knitter in me who does not want to transfer greasy hand cream onto yarn.</li>
      <li>Feels just right on my skin.</li>
      <li>If you have a strong sense of smell, I would steer clear of this one.</li>
      <li>It is really light, fast absorbing and non-greasy as decribed.</li>
      <li>I should have known, because whenever we are in need of anything, we check Amazon.com FIRST.  </li>
      <li>The subscriptions are scheduled to ship when we request them and can be changed if the need arises that we need more than previously thought, OR need fewer than originally believed.  </li>
      <li>Not as good at moisturizing as the regular Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, but also not as greasy.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the strong smell.  </li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, and moisturizes really well.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena absorbs very well and is soothing.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s a caver and really scrubs her hands.</li>
      <li>Absorbs fast, just like the name suggests.  </li>
      <li>Fast absorbing, non greasy.</li>
      <li>I would recommend ordering shipments of this Hand Cream and many other products.  </li>
      <li>These Nebraska winters can make for some mighty dry, sore hands.  </li>
      <li>When we learned that the Norwegian Fishermen use this hand cream to keep their hands from chapping, or to help their hands return to soft smooth skin, we knew this was the hand cream for everyone, whether he is a fisherman or just a regular worker whose hands get chapped.  </li>
      <li>I usually get the unscented formula, which I love, but I decided to try this one since it says &amp;#34;fast absorbing.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Top notch hand cream, used this in N.Y. our hands became rough and dry, Neutrogena to the rescue!!</li>
      <li>It did dry quickly, depending on how much you put on, 2-3 minutes roughly.  </li>
      <li>this product is the only one that i have found that is not greasy and that does a decent job.</li>
      <li>Of course, as usual, I logged onto Amazon.com and found this hand cream was available.  </li>
      <li>My hands get dry and very chafed.</li>
      <li>Not extremely greasy.  </li>
      <li>It is thick but feels so light weight.</li>
      <li>I wash my hands frequently throughout the day and was getting dry hands.  </li>

    <li> It is really light, fast absorbing and non-greasy as decribed. I can easily put it in my bag, very convenient. LIKE it!</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this to me. She&#x27;s a caver and really scrubs her hands. It is thick but feels so light weight. Absorbs very quickly. Softens my skin all day. Don&#x27;t have to re-use after each hand washing. Since it stands &amp;#34;upside down&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s extremely easy to get out of the bottle. I keep it on my bathroom counter. Often use over my entire body. I wish they made a tinted facial lotion as I would use it. Non-greasy, Lightweight. Wonderful. Even use in the summer.</li>
    <li> This is by far and away the best hand moisturizer.  You only need a little dab, and it absorbs into your skin almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This is excellent hand lotion.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, and moisturizes really well.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but couldn&#x27;t find it at any drugstore! Found it on Amazon. Product came quickly--no problems at all! Great experience.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite. Won&#x27;t settle for less.</li>

    <li> Very effective product. Hard to find in stores. Good Amazon value!</li>
    <li> This is fine. I thought it was the hand lotion I&#x27;ve bought in the past that is like an ointment. It&#x27;s not. As it says, it&#x27;s a fast-absorbing lotion. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I was so sick of hand cream that left my hands greasy and left greasy spots on everything I touched until I wiped half of it off.&lt;br /&gt;Just started using this and I will be using it forever.  My hands never looked or felt better.</li>
    <li> It smells like the topside of a freshly shaved yak in the Nepali winter and is twice as gentle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</li>
    <li> The best ever. My hands get dry and very chafed. Neutrogena absorbs very well and is soothing. I am a huge fan of all their products.</li>

    <li> A Cosmetics Cop Best product!  It works very well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the strong smell.  I usually try to get all products unscented.  BTW, the unscented version of this is not the same formula and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Since it works great, I live with the fragrance.  Would be five stars if it wasn&#x27;t scented.  Also works great when moisturizing your feet.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever.  These Nebraska winters can make for some mighty dry, sore hands.  This stuff works well, isn&#x27;t greasy and has minimal odor.  Just bought 3 more tubes.</li>
    <li> It is the best for fast absorption.</li>
    <li> If you have a strong sense of smell, I would steer clear of this one. The fragrance is overwhelming for my senses and very floral. The batch I just purchased leaves my hands feeling greasy, even fifteen minutes after application. I usually get the unscented formula, which I love, but I decided to try this one since it says &amp;#34;fast absorbing.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Fast absorbing, non greasy. Good for the knitter in me who does not want to transfer greasy hand cream onto yarn.</li>
    <li> I hate hand creams and the likes. this product is the only one that i have found that is not greasy and that does a decent job.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream. Feels just right on my skin. Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry hands. Have not found anything better than this. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the hand moisturizer.  I wash my hands frequently throughout the day and was getting dry hands.  Since I can&#x27;t wait 30 minutes to put on lotion and have it dry while at work, I decided to try this product.  It did dry quickly, depending on how much you put on, 2-3 minutes roughly.  It doesn&#x27;t provide the same moisturizing result as other hand lotions but it is a very good trade-off between effectiveness and absorption.  There also is a very light fragrance.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT WITHOUT BEING GREASY.</li>
