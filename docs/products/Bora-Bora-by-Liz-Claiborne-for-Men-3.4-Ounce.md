<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It did not last for more than a half hour. Did not smell like description.</li>
    <li> 1st time purchase of this scent and am VERY pleased with it!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy as to how fast I got my order and I love my bora bora</li>
    <li> Excelent price, free delivery on time, product as expected.</li>
    <li> The original packaging was opened and the perfume was missing a quarter of the liquid. This is the only item I&#x27;ve purchased that hasn&#x27;t met my expectations.</li>
    <li> bora bora is the ONLY fragrance i use. it has a light scent and everyone i come in contact with compliments me on it.</li>
    <li> completely satisfied with product and shipping.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase, fragrance is great for this hard to find item.  It was received on time and packaged well. I will order again.</li>
    <li> My wife and i are always trying out new perfumes/colognes and she suggested i buy this for her. She loved it immediately and said this might be her signature fragrance. It has the scent of some cool flowers (i&#x27;m not good with flower names) but even i love the scent on her body. Its just great!</li>
    <li> My wife said it smells gross. Bought this from Macy&#x27;s had a different smell</li>
    <li> Gift for mom. She love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed when the perfume came in. When i smelled it, i was expecting to smell something with mangos in it. Boy was the description wrong, to me the perfume smells like gardenias, which is going to make me sneeze during the allergy season. And what&#x27;s even more disappointing is the fact that I can&#x27;t return it. Yeppy, I&#x27;m stuck with this damn thing, woopy-do.</li>
    <li> With all these white floral notes listed, I would normally be turned off ... but not with Bora Bora. After hours of research online, I finally decided to give this one a try for summer, and without a sniff ... I bought it. I am so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the tropical island theme fool ya -- it&#x27;s neither a fruit salad nor a pina colada, and it&#x27;s not watery or island-like either. Many reviewers highlight the tropical flower notes -- I get those, but on paper. On me, it wears differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely florals &amp; fruits, very well blended &amp; difficult to pick out individual notes. Wears sweet. I can smell jasmine on top. There&#x27;s a musk and/or amber. Perhaps bamboo &amp; pineapple? On another website, notes listed are pink peppercorn, lychee, sand, mango, and musk. No single note dominates and nothing turns sickly, which is frequently a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice. Pleasant. Unique. Adult. Unknown. Exotic. Womanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mature fragrance, in that it is meant for a woman not a girl. It&#x27;s got good lasting power, and a few sprays are lasting me a full day. However, it is a soft fragrance that stays close to the skin. Although I&#x27;ll likely only wear it in summer, and occasionally as a pick-me-up in winter, this fragrance would be suitable year-round for many women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opalescent glass bottle is beautiful &amp; substantial ... but the plastic top is just plain tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its current price, it&#x27;s terrific value for a quality fragrance imho. In fact, I am so impressed with Bora Bora that I am sampling every LC release in the 2000s. Yup, Bora Bora is that good. Full bottle worth!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 5 out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Confirmed! Bora Bora is a famous designer smell-alike. I have penned 2 *unnamed*perfume* reviews with the observation, only to have them deleted. That said, the famous designer brand is smoother &amp; rounder than BB, and it is muskier as it dries. Regardless, BB is a GREAT smell-alike at a great price. Search a bit online and you find the name mentioned.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years.  It is one on my favorite perfumes.  I find the scent intoxicating, romantic and sensual.</li>
    <li> Love love love love love this perfume! !!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance OMG! So many compliments will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think \\&quot;sweet floral with passion\\&quot; says it all! And if there is a French-native inside you and you think you were meant for the Islands, this one is for you!</li>
    <li> It has a nice fragrance I&#x27;m glad I bought it and will purchase another one soon</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister because it&#x27;s her favorite. I don&#x27;t care for it, myself, but she likes it alot.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> This is a light fragrance that sticks with me all day. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of complements. And it&#x27;s age appropriate, I&#x27;m 32 and on&#x27;t want to smell like cotton candy or an old lady.</li>
    <li> Great perfume however packaging need to be wrapped in plastic.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! So glad I purchased this.  It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
    <li> As expected, love it!</li>
    <li> The product is genuine and smells great . I love it .</li>
    <li> My old standby.  I love this fragrance, and am never without.</li>
    <li> is divine smells delicious, the beginning is a bit strong but after a few minutes leaving a delicate and lasting smell</li>
    <li> So breezy and Summer! I have been wearing it for years. Its a classy tropical scent to me. I love it and its great for day or night. The bottle is beautiful too. It reminds me of being on the beach, with a cold drink, tanning oil and sandy feet. I love it!</li>
    <li> Sorry I posted the wrong comment! The price for the larger bottle is unbeatable! I purchased a small purse size bottle first &amp; was disappointed in the size however I&#x27;m very pleased with this fragrance! It has a long lasting scent &amp; can be worn in all seasons.</li>
    <li> I have gone thru 3 bottles of this I get compliments every time I wear it and it lasts all day</li>
    <li> Nice perfume, attracts good compliments.</li>
    <li> Loved it ! It is an wonderful perfume and the price was good too !</li>
    <li> This fragrance is nice, it is sweet and light. It smells like flowers and cottoncandy. It lasts a long time. I feel so feminine with this on. A great price for a nice longlasting scent.</li>
    <li> One of my signature scents.  I wear this most often and it is a great value.  I will continue to purchase this parfum as long as it is on the market</li>
    <li> Ordered 4 of these! Love It! Great price! Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> The answer to all of my questions is great!!!</li>
    <li> One of my mother&#x27;s favorites. I buy it for each birthday she has...and she&#x27;s a fussy lady.</li>
    <li> Wow I am absolutely in love with that perfume. It is sublime, it is suave, mesmerizing, delicious, Lord have Mercy... I had been using Touch as my signature perfume for years and never thought that I would ever find any other that could surpass my expectations, Well, I have discovered Bora Bora. Bora Bora my love Our love affair has just begun and I am cheating on Touch...</li>
    <li> Love this old fragance!  Great price and arrived fast!  Tropical and wonderful staying power.  I feel like I am in a flower garden.</li>
    <li> smells great.  fast shipping</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my  fav, I just love it, I just smell like a goddess</li>
    <li> great smell. Not too strong.  A soft touch of freshness.</li>
    <li> I have used this before  lovely fragarnce</li>
    <li> Was 2 days late...but other than that Great!</li>
    <li> Nice.  Soft and long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> bora bora has been one of my favorite scents since I found it about 6 yrs ago, I only buy it online</li>
    <li> Ordered this product and the company called and said they did not have one with a box...Told them that was fine, gift for myself. Company gave me $5 back on price...Excellent quality product</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how fast it was shipped.</li>
    <li> I so enjoy this fragrance and the price was the best I&#x27;ve found.  Very glad to have it back in my perfume lineup.</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume at a great price!</li>
    <li> This product met all my expectations...I order for someone else as a gift..evrytime they run out of it,that is! The quantity was priced well below other sites.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and they quit making it. I don&#x27;t know why people LOVED IT. So now I have to find them on Amazon before there all gone and get to old.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Strong scent (just how I like it) and it stays on all day!</li>
    <li> The perfume that I ordered were the same as what I had brought from dillards a few years ago. I love the perfume and was over joyed that I was able to find it. SoOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy.</li>
    <li> I love this, my favorite scent! A light beachy floral. Great for all day wear, can be light enough to put on in the morning and deep enough for evening as well.</li>
    <li> I had heard that the had quit making this fragrance and was really happy that I found it on Amazon. This is one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come back to review this perfume.It smells the same as store bought, but I think it&#x27;s watered down. It doesn&#x27;t last all day like my previous bottles have. I noticed the same thing with other perfumes I&#x27;ve bought on amazon. I think they put a little more alcohol or whatever to create more product at a cheaper price. but thats my guess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll just pay the extra $10 and hit the store instead for a lasting scent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;previous review:&lt;br /&gt;I got this perfume years ago, and loved it back then, love it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always come back to this one in spite of all the new temporary distractions, because it really is delicate and floral and just smells amazing to me. The price is a steal on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of your skin (or the amount of melanin in your skin) affects the scent of every perfume. I have light brown skin, and this smells lovely on me.</li>
    <li> Great price for size! My mother loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product by accident thinking it was something else.  It was not expensive and I thought I would give it a try.  I have gotten so many compliments from men and women on how nice I smelled.  This is a perfume that stays with you .  Its a very light scent.  I will continue to buy this forever.  Thank you Liz Claiborne :)</li>
    <li> I always loved this perfume. This product came in the mail with tons of protection around it, the bottle is a perfect size, the price for it is amazing I will be ordering more in a few months to have an extra. The smell of this perfume is light it&#x27;s not harsh at all so if u like scents from Victoria&#x27;s secret like endless love or moonlight dream you will love the smell of this perfume. And I promise you that you will not smell like an old lady with this perfume on. Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> my favorite!! Price was great! Hard to find</li>
    <li> Love all MS.LIZ CLAIBORNE products, and Bora Bora, is one of my favorite!! Nice Aroma! Scent!</li>
    <li> Looks like the correct bottle, but scent is all washed out.  Does not smell like Bora Bora.  Will pay full price in the future.,</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect! Great seller and great product , timeless scent !</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, and there is more to love with that huge bottle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was the real thing.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I smelled much fragrance</li>
    <li> Love this perfume been wearing it since high school. I tend to prefer musks and soft perfume this one does has a exotic tone and lingers wonderfully.</li>
