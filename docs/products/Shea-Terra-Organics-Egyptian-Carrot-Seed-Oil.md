### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have found Egyptian Carrot Seed Oil (along with sea buckthorn oil) to be one of the best nutritive ingredients to include in a blend I create for hydrating aging skin.</li>
      <li>This is a great product!</li>
      <li>Very good oil, I added it to my homemade sunscreen and face serum</li>
      <li>Amazing for hair and skin!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>Love this oil!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent thanks!</li>
      <li>but the results have been so good, it has spurred me to be better.</li>
      <li>A lovely authentic oil.  </li>
      <li>Love this oil.</li>
      <li>and my skin has never been clearer or looked better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So to update my review after way more than 6 months of use.</li>
      <li>Fantastic oil!!!!!! It smells fresh and when I use it on my skin I can feel a gentle warmth.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the product.</li>
      <li>Though my skin has not yet wrinkled, I suspect this precious oil will help me keep them at bay.</li>
      <li>Had been trying many things but not a thing worked.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal, so it smells pleasant but not like carrots as you might think.</li>
      <li>but it is just a great oil overall</li>
      <li>After 3 days my skin was significantly improved.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it initially for SPF</li>
      <li>Seemed that quick.</li>
      <li>I am only giving 3 stars right now because it is a good oil.  </li>
      <li>I am very glad I tried this oil, you likely will as well.</li>
      <li>Main reason for that is because reviews are requested within days and for most products I purchase, that is rarely enough time for an honest opinion that others can rely on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a really good price for such a high quality carrot seed oil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also helped with the dry patches of mild eczema on my legs that I&#x27;ve had for years, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
      <li>Put this wondrous oil on and first day, felt a difference.</li>
      <li>Cannot say that, but even if it had taken weeks, and the results had been the same, the review would still be as glowing as my  now much better looking (and feeling) skin.</li>
      <li>So far, I like the oil, feel it is a high quality oil and will try to get back here to give an honest review in 3-6 months.</li>
      <li>Will your results be as fast as mine?</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure carrots arent green anywhere they are harvested though.</li>
      <li>Really aids in protecting and helping to clear my skin!</li>
      <li>I would like to use this for more than a few days.</li>
      <li>When I use a facial serum, oil or cream, I rate the whole experience, and the smell and color leave me feeling dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>and my looks so soft and no pimples.</li>
      <li>It really makes your skin look brighter and younger.</li>
      <li>I am using this in a lush essential oil blend for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, as in, the oil hasnt aged well, and it is also greenish in color, which is a new experience for me as far as carrot seed oil.</li>

    <li> I think I got a bad batch, because it&#x27;s a thick green.</li>
    <li> Fantastic oil!!!!!! It smells fresh and when I use it on my skin I can feel a gentle warmth. It really makes your skin look brighter and younger. It helps with wrinkles too. A must buy.</li>
    <li> I think the oil quality is good, in so far as its hydrating properties, but I was disappointed in a few things about this oil. The smell is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, as in, the oil hasnt aged well, and it is also greenish in color, which is a new experience for me as far as carrot seed oil. The previous oil I used had a orange/yellow tinge to it, not green, but that might be the &amp;#34;egyptian&amp;#34; part..? I am pretty sure carrots arent green anywhere they are harvested though. When I use a facial serum, oil or cream, I rate the whole experience, and the smell and color leave me feeling dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and was as described. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of dry patches. Does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Definitely hydrating.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have used in moisturizer for my face and in sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Amazing for hair and skin! Already have another on the way. Definitely a good purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it initially for SPF but it is just a great oil overall</li>
    <li> Love this oil! For some reason (age?) I went from oily skin one day to horrible dry skin the next. Seemed that quick. Had been trying many things but not a thing worked. Put this wondrous oil on and first day, felt a difference. After 3 days my skin was significantly improved. Though my skin has not yet wrinkled, I suspect this precious oil will help me keep them at bay. Some have complained about the scent of it but it seems to last just a short time. So NOT a good routine person at all but the results have been so good, it has spurred me to be better. I am very glad I tried this oil, you likely will as well. Will your results be as fast as mine? Cannot say that, but even if it had taken weeks, and the results had been the same, the review would still be as glowing as my  now much better looking (and feeling) skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good oil, I added it to my homemade sunscreen and face serum and my looks so soft and no pimples.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I use it when I wash my face at night!</li>
    <li> I am always wary of people hype in these reviews, but I&#x27;m a believer. I have replaced my expensive anti-aging moisturizers with a homemade combo of this, jojoba, and raspberry seed oil - and my skin has never been clearer or looked better.  It&#x27;s also helped with the dry patches of mild eczema on my legs that I&#x27;ve had for years, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. And you only need the tiniest amounts of it. This stuff is everything I was hoping it would be.</li>
    <li> I am only giving 3 stars right now because it is a good oil.  I would like to use this for more than a few days. So far, I like the oil, feel it is a high quality oil and will try to get back here to give an honest review in 3-6 months. I am using this in a lush essential oil blend for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**8/19/16** I wish there was an easier way to keep up with reviews like this. I had initially listed this as a three star review. Main reason for that is because reviews are requested within days and for most products I purchase, that is rarely enough time for an honest opinion that others can rely on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to update my review after way more than 6 months of use. I LOVE the product. I have found Egyptian Carrot Seed Oil (along with sea buckthorn oil) to be one of the best nutritive ingredients to include in a blend I create for hydrating aging skin. This is a really good price for such a high quality carrot seed oil. Thank you Shea Terra Organics.</li>
    <li> Really aids in protecting and helping to clear my skin!</li>
    <li> After using this on my skin for a month I have already noticed a difference in the texture!</li>
    <li> A lovely authentic oil.  This is the real deal, so it smells pleasant but not like carrots as you might think.</li>
