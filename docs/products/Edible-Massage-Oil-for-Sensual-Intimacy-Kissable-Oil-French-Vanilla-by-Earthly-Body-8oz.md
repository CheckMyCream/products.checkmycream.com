    <li> Late review but product was delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Never greasy, smells wonderful, works great! Well worth the money. 2nd time ordering.</li>
    <li> The taste is so so comfortable feel.</li>
    <li> I really like this massage oil. When you rub it on it doesn&#x27;t leave a stickiness, actually leaves your skin soft. It is edible not that you can drink it but if you lick your lover. I think it taste good, i think it taste like donuts.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells incredible. It&#x27;s dead on for french vanilla. I haven&#x27;t really eaten it but I&#x27;m sure it would taste fine given the smell. My girlfriend loves getting backrubs with this and at the end of the day that&#x27;s what matters. If you&#x27;re looking for some pampering items at a good price - go with this. You&#x27;ll be happy you did. Also, I have relatively sensitive skin that gets acne easily and this didn&#x27;t cause a problem. However, I did wash it off pretty soon after applying it.</li>
    <li> Great value, but very bland. I can deal with that though. At least it didn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>

    <li> Not tasty and wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it.  I&#x27;d&#x27;ve been better off buying pure coconut oil and adding sugar to it or something.  This stuff is gross</li>
    <li> Strong scent of French vanilla, but a faint taste of it.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend eating its more of a scent thing. It&#x27;s great for vegans as well!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, my boy love it too !!!</li>
    <li> Light flavor, a little sticky. Wish it was more slippery.</li>
    <li> This is okay, but dont matter how much I test the scent to last. It does last for long. :(. It smells great but I only wished it lasted on my skin longer. Within 20-30 minutes the smell have faded away.</li>
    <li> use it on my girl friend every chance i get,she loves it..great message oil none staining tastes ok..</li>
    <li> This thing smells amazing! My boyfriend loves it! Not sticky at all and stays oily so you dont have to keep reapplying. Definitely gona order more in different flavors</li>
