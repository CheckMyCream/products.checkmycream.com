    <li> BEST POMADE ON THE PLANET!</li>
    <li> Bought this as an Xmas gift for my boyfriend as he loves this pomade. All was fine until a few weeks ago he opens it and the entire tub is full of white mold. He closes it tightly after each use so that leads me to believe that in this size the packaging is defective and does not seal properly. He usually uses the regular sized small tub and had never had this problem. While the product is great do not buy this size.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for my hair and love the no more greasy pillows leaves my hair with a nice pump</li>
    <li> Best bang for the $ water based pomade.  Good hold, easily washes out, great hold. Medium strong hold</li>
    <li> Good product came on time thank you</li>
    <li> Product just as good as the small 4oz container but at a much better price, small one nice for traveling.</li>

    <li> Great smell, easy to use like a gel, but holds like pomade. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> stuff works great and smells good too</li>
    <li> The product is great, the container doesn&#x27;t seem to properly seal so it does seem like it is &amp;#34;drying up&amp;#34; a bit. I think that I will just buy a air tight container for it so that I can continue to use it, since it is such a large quantity.</li>
    <li> Thanks! It was a good product</li>
    <li> Smells good, works well. I have fine hair, styling with a boys cut, faded on the sides, long on top. Works better if your hair is a little more dry tho.</li>
    <li> Words can&#x27;t explain how great suavecito is I don&#x27;t even have a pomp I have long hair about 7 inches all around and curly I used to slick it back but now I just get some on my Palm and do water for that all day non great non fell but nice sheen shine. Gosh... this is like the greatest stuff for hair ever invented with beeswax and castor oil which is good for your hair, I am embarrassed to think I ever used Murray&#x27;s hair pomade lol x)</li>
    <li> I enjoy suavecito pomade a lot. For those rockabilly user&#x27;s its a must. Thank you suavecito.</li>
    <li> BUY THIS!!!! Save yourself a ton of cash and go big. You know you love Suavecito. Maybe it&#x27;s the ladies that love it. Whatever, buy this!&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t had any issues.. other than my wallet being heavy with all the cash I saved buying in bulk. It&#x27;s also been great to not have to order a small tub every week or so.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is good value</li>
    <li> Great Price. My husband loves it</li>
