### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This formula is excellent for drying up the seb derm on my face.  </li>
      <li>I have never been so instantly impressed by a product.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>oh yeah, priceless.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results, there has been a noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>Good price too!</li>
      <li>Made good on its promise: relieved the flaking in my daughter&#x27;s face!</li>
      <li>Very pleased with results!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it dries my combo skin out at all, and my skin is looking great.</li>
      <li>Great soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>I have received this Noble Formula ZnP Bar and utilized it one time.</li>
      <li>The Noble zinc cream is great too and is absorbed into the skin immediately so a good value.</li>
      <li>and my skin became very smooth within 4-5 days.</li>
      <li>A WEEK AFTER USING ZNP BAR MY REDNESS AND FLAKINESS  LOOKED BETTER .</li>
      <li>Love there is no odor  </li>
      <li>and since I already have oily skin, it would make my face appear even more oily as the day would go on.  </li>
      <li>After a month, more than 3/4 of the bar still remains.  </li>
      <li>Great soap, kills bacteria and cleans skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this soap for anyone with Tinea Versicolor, or Athletes who need protection from Atheletes foot or Jock strap Iche</li>
      <li>glad, I came across this soap.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>So I poked around the awesome r/skincareaddiction subreddit and saw that redness and flakiness is usually related to either Eczema or Seborrheic Dermatitis and saw that Noble Zinc was highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>best it&#x27;s ever been in his life.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had much less acne since I started using it 4 months ago.</li>
      <li>Good product however, it gets kind of slimy if you don&#x27;t allow it to fully dry between showers.</li>
      <li>Factor this with a happy teen girl...</li>
      <li>Works great for the acne on my daughters back</li>
      <li>Recommended by my derm, so far so good.</li>
      <li>I would prefer if it were compacted, as it softens up and get gunky in the shower, but other than that is a great product.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin, and most soaps and cleansers irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>This soap seems to calm my rosacea.  </li>
      <li>It was worth the purchase price</li>
      <li>Just the itching relief makes it worth the price.</li>
      <li>I love that it makes my skin feel so soft..</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it so far.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely nothing special.</li>
      <li>i did some research and found noble formula, i&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 months and those patches are long gone.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle on my skin,does not cause break outs and clears my skin right up.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>With the first use my itching has been relieved dramatically.</li>
      <li>Really small bar, but good value since my skin is clearer.</li>
      <li>I think it has really helped with my body acne and some of the blemishes I had on my face.</li>
      <li>The soap has really helped my acne/malassezia.</li>
      <li>However, I still have some spots close to my hair line that have yet to really improve.  </li>
      <li>Seriously no burning.</li>
      <li>My face has been acne-prone for most of my life, but recently it has been sahara-dry, red, and SO irritated.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this soap bar.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my fault for assuming the high price meant I&#x27;d be receiving a normal sized bar of soap, at the minimum.</li>
      <li>Purchased for my teen who was having troublesome, small-scale acne on a near-continuous basis, not responding to diet modification, aggravated by nearly all soaps and cleansers (even those formulated for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin), and worsened by most topical &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; products.  </li>
      <li>Ultimately, I have found that no soap is gentle enough to provide a clean feeling without removing the protective outer layer of skin cells....</li>
      <li>Right now literally all I am doing to my face is washing once with this soap gently at night and patting dry.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe these 2 products have relieved my symptoms and given me my calm, natural skin back.</li>
      <li>When it went off the market I tried Noble Formula, and it works equally well, if not better for eczema.</li>
      <li>Helped clear my seborea.  </li>
      <li>Her complexion is finally clear and</li>
      <li>I have redness &amp; flakes on my face &amp; ever since I started using this product about a month ago, the flakes are completely gone</li>
      <li>Skin problems suck, and they ruin your confidence in everything: but this thing is the closest thing to a natural skin clearing miracle that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>, they would heal and then come right back a week or two later.  </li>
      <li>WITHIN A MONTH I WAS BACK TO NORMAL.</li>
      <li>The only downside so far is it does feel slightly drying after washing but that feeling goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>No other products are needed.  </li>
      <li>so prior to getting the Noble Zinc Bar Soap I tried rinsing my face with Dead Sea Salt 2x daily and tried minimal lotions.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised on how well this bar of soap actually works.</li>
      <li>my skin is softer, less red and spotty, and really i will never stop using this soap!  </li>
      <li>the only drawback is if you accidentally get it in your eyes it burns pretty badly, like way more than regular soap would.  </li>
      <li>I hardly ever write reviews, but this one was worth it.</li>

<li> I hardly ever write reviews, but this one was worth it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of products to try and cure my flaky beard over the years with no success, but the seborrheic dermatitis was relatively new.</li>
<li> Picked up this soap after a google search and both symptoms are gone as long as I use this soap daily.</li>
<li> Seems to last a long time too!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even gone a few days without it to see if the effects are lasting, and they completely are.</li>
<li> I really wished there was something that was gentle enough to use on those occasions when you are truly dirty from working in the garden, etc...not the case.</li>
<li> I needed something with pyrithione zinc in it, but I will not be repurchasing this since I need something that will last longer than two uses, and I&#x27;m not paying $13 for something I can find elsewhere in larger sizes for half the price.</li>
<li> I was afraid to use ZnP on my face, because my face is super sensitive.  </li>
<li> It helped with my dry, flaky skin and acne.</li>
<li> I keep it in a soap holder with holes to dry out.  </li>
<li> for me at least, the only option for clear, non-oily, non-dried out, non-bumpy skin is water-only cleansing for my face.  </li>
<li> This soap relieves itching / dry skin.</li>
<li> and now I only have slight redness.  </li>
<li> My skin is much less red and irritated.  </li>
<li> , the soap is extremely expensive but with proper care of the bar itself, very little is actually needed for cleansing, and the bar is lasting much, much longer than I anticipated.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical of the price for a bar of soap but after seeing the results it was totally worth it.</li>
<li> Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
<li> I even use it on this small red itchy pimple area on my ring area on my finger and they are gone.</li>
<li> So I did some research online and started using this soap in conjunction with Era Organics face moisturizer cream, also sold on Amazon, and the redness, bumps and irritation calmed down by day 2.</li>
<li> I have been using this soap for 3 weeks now and my skin is less flaky and irritated.  </li>
<li> I may need to wait a little bit longer for the zinc to do its work.</li>
<li> This worked a little bit, but wasn&#x27;t 100%.</li>
<li> Then they were gone within a few days.</li>
<li> I have been using this product twice daily and have noticed a decrease in itchiness and flakes on my face and behind my ears.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m against using harsh products (stuff</li>
<li> Everything I tried not only did not help but made my acne worse.</li>
<li> Even plain water seemed burny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But I stopped using it in the morning because it leaves a very slight oily feel</li>
<li> I have had pretty bad seborrhea for the past two years</li>
<li> Cleared up my tinnea versicor in a few weeks, also healed a wart on my hand that multiple freeze treatments failed to cure.</li>
<li> I use this every morning for the past month.</li>
<li> I have small under the skin bumps and my pocketderm doctor told me to try this.</li>
<li> It makes you feel clean without overly stripping the skin and drying it out so bad!</li>
<li> Less irritating than some soaps, but did not work for me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Purchased for my teen who was having troublesome, small-scale acne on a near-continuous basis, not responding to diet modification, aggravated by nearly all soaps and cleansers (even those formulated for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin), and worsened by most topical &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; products.  That&#x27;s a tall order to fill.  This is the only product I have found to date that has NOT caused an allergic flareup and has actually helped not only the acne itself but the allergic flareups and smoother, even-toned skin.  Her complexion is finally clear and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the soap is extremely expensive but with proper care of the bar itself, very little is actually needed for cleansing, and the bar is lasting much, much longer than I anticipated.  After a month, more than 3/4 of the bar still remains.  No other products are needed.  Factor this with a happy teen girl...oh yeah, priceless.</li>
    <li> Yes this product has made a difference!  The itching stopped after 3 uses!  I have Tinea Versicolor.  (Sun Fungus). I would highly recommend this soap bar. Love there is no odor  And it moisturizers !!</li>
    <li> I have redness &amp; flakes on my face &amp; ever since I started using this product about a month ago, the flakes are completely gone and now I only have slight redness.  Initially I was using it twice a day - in the morning and at night.  But I stopped using it in the morning because it leaves a very slight oily feel and since I already have oily skin, it would make my face appear even more oily as the day would go on.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results, there has been a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Use to use ZNP Bar, and can&#x27;t get it anymore. Tried this and it&#x27;s great! It may seem a bit expensive, but one bar lasts me a year.</li>
    <li> Great soap, kills bacteria and cleans skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this soap for anyone with Tinea Versicolor, or Athletes who need protection from Atheletes foot or Jock strap Iche&lt;br /&gt;No Smell, 5 Stars!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had redness and flakiness around my nose and underneath my eyes for what seems like months now. I&#x27;m against using harsh products (stuff that&#x27;s alcohol based or steroid-type creams) so prior to getting the Noble Zinc Bar Soap I tried rinsing my face with Dead Sea Salt 2x daily and tried minimal lotions. This worked a little bit, but wasn&#x27;t 100%. So I poked around the awesome r/skincareaddiction subreddit and saw that redness and flakiness is usually related to either Eczema or Seborrheic Dermatitis and saw that Noble Zinc was highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not kidding when I say this thing cleared up my face within a week. I&#x27;m blown away. I&#x27;ve even gone a few days without it to see if the effects are lasting, and they completely are. Skin problems suck, and they ruin your confidence in everything: but this thing is the closest thing to a natural skin clearing miracle that I&#x27;ve found so far. I hardly ever write reviews, but this one was worth it.</li>
    <li> Helped clear my seborea.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of Formula ZnP until I saw it while I was browsing the Amazon Website for Purpose skin cleanser.  I have super sensitive skin, and most soaps and cleansers irritate my skin.  I decided to try one bar of Formula ZnP and use the wait and see approach for a reaction.  I have showered and I constantly wash my hands with the ZnP bar since I received it, and I have not had any itching or burning.  I was afraid to use ZnP on my face, because my face is super sensitive.  However, this morning I decided to wash my face with ZnP, and I did not get a bad reaction.  Even though the Formula is very expensive, I will order this product again because it did not make my skin itch, or burn. It has also started to close the open skin lesions I have after only two showers.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised on how well this bar of soap actually works. I have had pretty bad seborrhea for the past two years and I was sick of applying four different creams every night even though I would still get flare ups from time to time. After using this for a week and without any of my prescribed creams, all of my redness and peeling is gone. I was skeptical of the price for a bar of soap but after seeing the results it was totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my tinnea versicor in a few weeks, also healed a wart on my hand that multiple freeze treatments failed to cure.</li>
    <li> I have never been so instantly impressed by a product. My face has been acne-prone for most of my life, but recently it has been sahara-dry, red, and SO irritated. It felt like it was burning/chafed all of the time. I had assumed it was dryness causing the irritated feeling, so tried to treat it as such. Everything I tried not only did not help but made my acne worse. Even plain water seemed burny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a last ditch hope before going to a dermatologist I decided to try out this soap, thinking maybe it would soothe my skin. Well. Imagine my surprise - not only did it soothe it, but the burny feeling disappeared after ONE use. It has been three days. The dryness is almost gone. Seriously no burning. The acne is disappearing before my eyes and is already about 50% improved. It must have been fungal-related all this time and I just never realized it. Right now literally all I am doing to my face is washing once with this soap gently at night and patting dry. That is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is a miracle product. The only downside so far is it does feel slightly drying after washing but that feeling goes away quickly. I hope it continues to work for me and can maybe help someone else too.</li>
    <li> Had an outbreak of dermatitis on my face and drugstore cleansers were exacerbating the rash. Did not want to go to the dermatologist and get toxic creams and cleansers prescribed. So I did some research online and started using this soap in conjunction with Era Organics face moisturizer cream, also sold on Amazon, and the redness, bumps and irritation calmed down by day 2. Use both am and pm. Very pleased with results! Can&#x27;t believe these 2 products have relieved my symptoms and given me my calm, natural skin back.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my derm, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for only 3 weeks and I absolutely love it so far. I love that it makes my skin feel so soft.. I purchased this soap for my tinea versi color and my spots are fading away.. I definitely recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 3 weeks now and my skin is less flaky and irritated.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> This formula is excellent for drying up the seb derm on my face.  I followed up with Cerve moisturizer and Derm Essentials and my skin became very smooth within 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely nothing special. I was stunned when I opened the package expecting a legitimate bar of soap, only to see something that looked like the size of a sample soap you&#x27;d get at a motel. It&#x27;s my fault for assuming the high price meant I&#x27;d be receiving a normal sized bar of soap, at the minimum. I needed something with pyrithione zinc in it, but I will not be repurchasing this since I need something that will last longer than two uses, and I&#x27;m not paying $13 for something I can find elsewhere in larger sizes for half the price.</li>
    <li> I have small under the skin bumps and my pocketderm doctor told me to try this. Just started this soap and I like it. I use it every morning, I don&#x27;t find it drying at all. I use my hands to suds a bit and leave it on for a minute, then rinse. I keep it in a soap holder with holes to dry out.  Update: I use this every morning for the past month. I don&#x27;t find it dries my combo skin out at all, and my skin is looking great. I even use it on this small red itchy pimple area on my ring area on my finger and they are gone.</li>
    <li> Works great for the acne on my daughters back</li>
    <li> this soap saved my face.  i was suffering from intermittent scaly, pimply rosacea patches on my chin and cheek.  the same spots would erupt over and over and they looked terrible!  nothing i did got rid of them, they would heal and then come right back a week or two later.  i did some research and found noble formula, i&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 months and those patches are long gone.  my skin is softer, less red and spotty, and really i will never stop using this soap!  the only drawback is if you accidentally get it in your eyes it burns pretty badly, like way more than regular soap would.  i think next time i may try the vegetarian formula since the emu oil makes me feel a little weird, but not too weird.</li>
    <li> Works well for Seb. Dermatitis.  I have been using this product twice daily and have noticed a decrease in itchiness and flakes on my face and behind my ears.  It was worth the purchase price and I look forward to continued improvement.</li>
    <li> glad, I came across this soap. It works and has not at all irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the suggestion of my dermatologist through PocketDerm.  I think it has really helped with my body acne and some of the blemishes I had on my face.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my skin,does not cause break outs and clears my skin right up. I&#x27;m I my second bar.</li>
    <li> I have received this Noble Formula ZnP Bar and utilized it one time. With the first use my itching has been relieved dramatically. I hope it will relieve my facial and scalp flaking with continued use. Just the itching relief makes it worth the price.</li>
    <li> This soap seems to calm my rosacea.  I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> The soap has really helped my acne/malassezia. It makes you feel clean without overly stripping the skin and drying it out so bad! Seems to last a long time too! Good price too! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Less irritating than some soaps, but did not work for me.  Ultimately, I have found that no soap is gentle enough to provide a clean feeling without removing the protective outer layer of skin cells....for me at least, the only option for clear, non-oily, non-dried out, non-bumpy skin is water-only cleansing for my face.  I really wished there was something that was gentle enough to use on those occasions when you are truly dirty from working in the garden, etc...not the case.</li>
    <li> Really small bar, but good value since my skin is clearer.</li>
    <li> Product exceeded expectations.  The redness, itchiness, and flakes improved immediately. Then they were gone within a few days.</li>
    <li> I like how this zinc soap didn&#x27;t irritate or burn. It helped with my dry, flaky skin and acne.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was looking for. It did get here on time. I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> Not only does this bar work for facial dryness and flaking, but it lasts forever. I use it in the shower every morning and 1 bar lasts me well over a year.</li>
    <li> Great soap. I use this two times a week in place of my regular cleanser and it has helped a lot with lessening redness and inflammation.</li>
    <li> I had a flaky beard and a red, scaly patch of skin between my eyes (I believe it was seborrheic dermatitis, but I&#x27;m no dermatologist). I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of products to try and cure my flaky beard over the years with no success, but the seborrheic dermatitis was relatively new.Picked up this soap after a google search and both symptoms are gone as long as I use this soap daily. Great product!</li>
    <li> Used to use ZNP bar.  When it went off the market I tried Noble Formula, and it works equally well, if not better for eczema.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  My dermatologist prescribed a steroid cream for my dermatitis, and it did nothing.  This soap did the trick!  My skin condition is now under control.</li>
    <li> This soap relieves itching / dry skin. I would prefer if it were compacted, as it softens up and get gunky in the shower, but other than that is a great product. While it does work it&#x27;s expensive for my budget so I don&#x27;t use it daily. The Noble zinc cream is great too and is absorbed into the skin immediately so a good value.</li>
    <li> This soap cleared up my friends seborrheaic dermatitis in a week; it&#x27;s been 6 months that his skin has been &amp;#34;the best it&#x27;s ever been in his life.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had much less acne since I started using it 4 months ago. My husband just started using it too to reduce the greasiness of his skin.</li>
    <li> i WAS USING ALL THE EXPENSIVE LOTIONS AND SOAPS THE DR. RECOMMEND AND NOTHING HELP. A WEEK AFTER USING ZNP BAR MY REDNESS AND FLAKINESS  LOOKED BETTER . WITHIN A MONTH I WAS BACK TO NORMAL. IT&#x27;S THE ONLY THING I USE  WITH ALITTLE  COCONUT OIL AFTER.</li>
    <li> Good product however, it gets kind of slimy if you don&#x27;t allow it to fully dry between showers.</li>
    <li> I just started using this last week and I can already tell a difference in my skin.  My skin is much less red and irritated.  However, I still have some spots close to my hair line that have yet to really improve.  I may need to wait a little bit longer for the zinc to do its work. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Made good on its promise: relieved the flaking in my daughter&#x27;s face!</li>
