<ol>
      <li>A great quality wig!  </li>
      <li>This hair is so, so wonderful.</li>
      <li>I got the orange one, the color and curls are beautiful!</li>
      <li>Perfect color, perfect length, and very good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>Also it comes with a great wig cap</li>
      <li>I got this last-minute for a costume, and it worked GREAT--</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really great quality for the price, I just wish it was as orange as the picture.</li>
      <li>(Is very warm, but welcome to wigs)</li>
      <li>Over all, for the price, this is an insanely good wig.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Even if it wasn&#x27;t a good wig-</li>
      <li>so everything fits perfectly and stays on comfortably.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly and is gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Already it&#x27;s incredibly frizzy and matted on the underside, which is a huge problem.</li>
      <li>love it tho!</li>
      <li>Yes, the bangs are not yet styled, but I liked that</li>
      <li>but it works nice.</li>
      <li>I own a lot of wigs for my cosplays</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautifully made and worth 3x what you pay for it.</li>
      <li>The quality would be great, if it was thicker and more accurate to the photo.</li>
      <li>like if you dyed your own hair so i dont mind it love this wig and</li>
      <li>Perfect for asuka from nge, it&#x27;s like the most natural, yet vivid, ginger wig, very happy with the thickness and appearance, expedient shipping too, about 2 weeks</li>
      <li>looks great, bought it for a costume im going to be wearing at comic con.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok but not for anything</li>
      <li>This wig is ok</li>
      <li>Wore this as part of a costume and looked fabulous!</li>
      <li>The top netting is EXTREAMLY visable though which was a bummer.</li>
      <li>i absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>cery life-like, the hair is full without teasing and with teasing looks even better.</li>
      <li>Firstly it looks great on her- very realistic and not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; looking like some wigs can be.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s cheap the scalp</li>
      <li>Luckily, the character I&#x27;m cosplaying has a hat.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>Wore it up in a bun and curls as Lucy in Despicable Me 2 and had gobs of positive comments!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only worn it about 5 or 6 times since I bought it, and each time I was mostly just sitting still while I recorded some things.</li>
      <li>I bought the orange wig, and it came exactly the colour it showed in the picture.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re only out $10 at the most.</li>
      <li>I got a lot of positive comments on it.</li>
      <li>The fibers are super soft.</li>
      <li>This wig was very pretty!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for cosplay/crossplay!</li>
      <li>I really like this wig (orange), it is rather shiny</li>
      <li>This wig doesnt fit over my head, I dont reccomend buying this if you have a big head.</li>
      <li>come this soft right of the package.</li>
      <li>Alot of people have mentioned that their wig isn&#x27;t full enough?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased from this seller before and not had any major issues, this is the first time.</li>
      <li>I needed to apply a light amount of straightening iron to get it to the wave as pictured, and trim the bangs, but total effort was only 30 mins.</li>
      <li>First off let me say I&#x27;ve bought alot of wigs in my short life, but I&#x27;ve always seen them and tried them before I bought them.</li>
      <li>Over-all it&#x27;s soft and the right colour, but it&#x27;s extremely messy and you can see right through it to the cap underneath.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ignores the bad reviews I love this wig.</li>
      <li>The wig was overall great quality and did not look too fake &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The bangs are much longer and the wig was much curlier than expected.</li>
      <li>my only complaint is its veryy tangled so you wont be able to really re model</li>
      <li>It is not as vibrant as the picture, which is what I wanted but it will work well enough.</li>
      <li>but let&#x27;s see you try to keep your hair ever straight if it were as long as this wig.</li>
      <li>Other then that it&#x27;s a pretty wig and using it for my DOA Kasumi</li>
      <li>At first there was only a minimal amount of tangle,</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to straighten those beautiful curls and eventually cut it :(</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is long and think but not thick enough.</li>
      <li>the only thing that wound up being wrong with it was my own fault, since I was trying to straighten the wig.</li>
      <li>it was much thicker than i was expecting it is a little thin on the top though, however it sort of looks like regrowth</li>
      <li>This wig is extremely thin, prepare to wear a hat if you buy it you can see the cap easily.</li>
      <li>less than 5 mins of teasing and shaking it around it looked big and real.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ll likely still buy short wigs from this seller, but it&#x27;s up in the air as to whether or not I&#x27;ll be buying any long wigs from them again.</li>
<li> The bangs are long so I would have to cut and style them myself.</li>
<li> what you would expect from a long curly wig.</li>
<li> The only problem is that the bangs bug me a little bit, but I&#x27;ll be figuring out whether to cut those or not later.</li>
<li> The wigs in the past were short wigs, whereas this is obviously very long.</li>
<li> As expected from other reviewers.</li>
<li> Very messy, it gave me lice, and the product was later than expected.</li>
<li> She says it got a little roughed up in the shipping but came well packaged and only needed a little maintenance to get it into shape.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never really been let down by these kinds of wigs before, though.</li>
<li> but my hair is dark and it covered it</li>
<li> (I got the orange wig, none of my dark brown showed).</li>
<li> I was skeptical about buying one offline for such a cheap price and with the bad reviews.</li>
<li> If you order it a few weeks in advance of when you need it you&#x27;re set.</li>
<li> But it isn&#x27;t so bad that it&#x27;s unwearable just give it a little tease in the back to help fluff it up a little</li>
<li> The wig is a little thin</li>
<li> It looks just like the picture, but it is a little thin.</li>
<li> The wig is long, yes its gonna tangle like crazy</li>
<li> The wig itself is incredibly thin.</li>
<li> If you won&#x27;t wear a hat with it, its too thin.</li>
<li> It looks like the hair is pulling up from the base of the wig a little bit, and that does worry me.</li>

    <li> I bought the orange wig, and it came exactly the colour it showed in the picture. At first there was only a minimal amount of tangle, what you would expect from a long curly wig. I&#x27;ve only worn it about 5 or 6 times since I bought it, and each time I was mostly just sitting still while I recorded some things. Already it&#x27;s incredibly frizzy and matted on the underside, which is a huge problem. It looks like the hair is pulling up from the base of the wig a little bit, and that does worry me. The wig itself is incredibly thin. I&#x27;ve purchased from this seller before and not had any major issues, this is the first time. The wigs in the past were short wigs, whereas this is obviously very long. When it comes to this wig though, I suppose you do get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll likely still buy short wigs from this seller, but it&#x27;s up in the air as to whether or not I&#x27;ll be buying any long wigs from them again.</li>
    <li> Wore this as part of a costume and looked fabulous!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Very messy, it gave me lice, and the product was later than expected. But overall, I&#x27;d buy from the company again.</li>
    <li> it was much thicker than i was expecting it is a little thin on the top though, however it sort of looks like regrowth like if you dyed your own hair so i dont mind it love this wig and every wig iv bought from them</li>
    <li> The wig was overall great quality and did not look too fake &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34;. The bangs are much longer and the wig was much curlier than expected. I needed to apply a light amount of straightening iron to get it to the wave as pictured, and trim the bangs, but total effort was only 30 mins. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Ordered the orange wig for a cosplay. Arrived very quickly and is gorgeous! Yes, the bangs are not yet styled, but I liked that so I could just sweep them to the side and not have bangs. Worn it several times, holds up well. Comes with wig cap and the wig itself is adjustable so everything fits perfectly and stays on comfortably. (Is very warm, but welcome to wigs)</li>
    <li> A great quality wig!  Wore it up in a bun and curls as Lucy in Despicable Me 2 and had gobs of positive comments!</li>
    <li> Over-all it&#x27;s soft and the right colour, but it&#x27;s extremely messy and you can see right through it to the cap underneath. I&#x27;m going to have to find someone who can help style it because it&#x27;s resisting my styling. The quality would be great, if it was thicker and more accurate to the photo. It also lacks bangs. I might buy from them again, but not for cosplaying.</li>
    <li> The fibers are super soft. I own a lot of wigs for my cosplays and I&#x27;ve never had one come this soft right of the package. The wig is a little thin so I would suggest buying two and sewing them together. But it isn&#x27;t so bad that it&#x27;s unwearable just give it a little tease in the back to help fluff it up a little and it&#x27;ll be fine. The color is about the same and it&#x27;s gorgeous. I would buy it again i absolutely love it. Also it comes with a great wig cap</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for! Perfect color, perfect length, and very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this last-minute for a costume, and it worked GREAT--the only thing that wound up being wrong with it was my own fault, since I was trying to straighten the wig. For the record, this wig can be straightened by putting your straightener on the lowest heat setting.</li>
    <li> This wig doesnt fit over my head, I dont reccomend buying this if you have a big head.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture, but it is a little thin. Luckily, the character I&#x27;m cosplaying has a hat. If you won&#x27;t wear a hat with it, its too thin. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> looks great, bought it for a costume im going to be wearing at comic con. my only complaint is its veryy tangled so you wont be able to really re model</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend&#x27;s Halloween costume so I&#x27;ve only seen pictures and heard from her what this wig was like. Firstly it looks great on her- very realistic and not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; looking like some wigs can be.  She says it got a little roughed up in the shipping but came well packaged and only needed a little maintenance to get it into shape. Over all, for the price, this is an insanely good wig. Even if it wasn&#x27;t a good wig- sheesh you&#x27;re only out $10 at the most. I&#x27;ve never really been let down by these kinds of wigs before, though.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really great quality for the price, I just wish it was as orange as the picture. It is not as vibrant as the picture, which is what I wanted but it will work well enough.</li>
    <li> This hair is so, so wonderful. If you order it a few weeks in advance of when you need it you&#x27;re set. It&#x27;s beautifully made and worth 3x what you pay for it. I highly recommend it for cosplay/crossplay!</li>
    <li> This wig is ok but it&#x27;s cheap the scalp part shows throw here and there it just does not look good.&lt;br /&gt;I guess for a Halloween wig it&#x27;s ok but not for anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It is long and think but not thick enough. -_-</li>
    <li> I really like this wig (orange), it is rather shiny but I was expecting it to be so.  The only problem is that the bangs bug me a little bit, but I&#x27;ll be figuring out whether to cut those or not later.</li>
    <li> This wig was very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to straighten those beautiful curls and eventually cut it :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it tho!</li>
    <li> cery life-like, the hair is full without teasing and with teasing looks even better. less than 5 mins of teasing and shaking it around it looked big and real.</li>
    <li> Not like picture at all. The bangs are long so I would have to cut and style them myself. Other then that it&#x27;s a pretty wig and using it for my DOA Kasumi</li>
    <li> Perfect for asuka from nge, it&#x27;s like the most natural, yet vivid, ginger wig, very happy with the thickness and appearance, expedient shipping too, about 2 weeks</li>
    <li> As expected from other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Received this item today. First off let me say I&#x27;ve bought alot of wigs in my short life, but I&#x27;ve always seen them and tried them before I bought them. I was skeptical about buying one offline for such a cheap price and with the bad reviews. But I went ahead and said what the hell let&#x27;s just do this. I&#x27;m glad I did. Alot of people have mentioned that their wig isn&#x27;t full enough? They must have gotten some messed up ones. I inspected my wig no its not like my head of hair but my hair is dark and it covered it (I got the orange wig, none of my dark brown showed). It came with the wig cap never seen a cap like this but it works nice. The wig is long, yes its gonna tangle like crazy but let&#x27;s see you try to keep your hair ever straight if it were as long as this wig. It goes almost all the way to my butt. All and all I&#x27;m glad I ignores the bad reviews I love this wig.</li>
    <li> This wig is extremely thin, prepare to wear a hat if you buy it you can see the cap easily.</li>
    <li> I got the orange one, the color and curls are beautiful! I got a lot of positive comments on it. The top netting is EXTREAMLY visable though which was a bummer.</li>
