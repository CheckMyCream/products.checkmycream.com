### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am very impressed with its quality.</li>
      <li>If you do not have a stippling brush buy one, it is the best way to apply this blush.</li>
      <li>This blush is awesome.</li>

      <li>Great cream blush.</li>
      <li>and it looks great.</li>
      <li>The color is more coral, which I find brightens my skin, (I have a very fair complexion).  </li>
      <li>Insanely bright not like the picture</li>
      <li>The color is bright</li>
      <li>This is a good product.  </li>
      <li>Work&#x27;s really good.</li>
      <li>I read good reviews on this</li>
      <li>i really loved it.</li>
      <li>and it compliments my fair skin tone nicely.</li>
      <li>It looks great on my face , it&#x27;s by far the best blush I have ever tried .</li>
      <li>I absolutely am in love with this blush!</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I just love it!</li>
      <li>First of all, the color density is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love this blush!</li>
      <li>More bang for my buck!  </li>
      <li>An amazing product for the price.</li>
      <li>nice consistency&lt;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice blushie rose color</li>
      <li>I use the Real Techniques Stipple Brush and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Really nice for summer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally very fair and freckly, and found this colour works really well with my complexion.</li>
      <li>It is a good color and very economical.</li>
      <li>I love it :</li>
      <li>I tried using a brush to apply, I tried using a brush to blend, I tried using a powder on top of the blush, I tried two finger application/blending.  </li>
      <li>It glides on nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>so be sure to use sparingly.</li>
      <li>Instead, I look more like I have a fever or a rash because the redness is so patchy and pigmented.  </li>
      <li>A wonderfully cheap, creamy blush!</li>
      <li>so make sure you use a teeny bit</li>
      <li>But love all the powder blush from e.l.f.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>Make sure to practice, practice, practice before you put this on to go out.</li>
      <li>I finally tried a brush, and that has worked the best.</li>
      <li>I want to like this more</li>
      <li>And hopefully longer-lasting wear!&amp;#34;  Well, application required much more finesse than I thought.  </li>
      <li>Staying power is ok with this blush.  </li>
      <li>The color stayed on my lips through most of the day.</li>
      <li>very pigmented and feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
      <li>I have combination skin that is very acne-prone, and this does a good job of not breaking me out or drying out my cheeks</li>
      <li>Works great and arrived super fast</li>
      <li>I read the other reviews on this, and knew it would take some time to figure out the perfect amount to use.</li>
      <li>- A nice cream blush like this one is hard to find and the price is excellent</li>
      <li>Too easy to get over pigment.</li>
      <li>Out of package it is dense texture and strong color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it works fine.</li>
      <li>Clearly shown, this product has a pump to easily get a good amount of product out.</li>
      <li>but once I figured it out it was love at first sight!</li>
      <li>so go lightly -</li>
      <li>It blends as smooth as any face cream.</li>
      <li>Headliner is a great light, cool-toned pink that flatters most skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Headliner gives me a nice, subtle flush - I layer it over Doublewear (for skincolor reference, I am a 2 in DW light and a 2W2 in DW) and it works great; I&#x27;ll also do a very light layer over a BB or tinted moisturizer for a natural/summerish/casual day</li>
      <li>You only need a very small amount of product to get great color payoff and good blendibility on your cheeks; just a dab of your finger (like I use, it&#x27;s easier) or a stippling brush, and blend it well across the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The staying power and finish of this product are great.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this liquid blush because powder blushes, for me, tend to fade away during the course of the day.  </li>
      <li>I was excited when I ordered the blush in the pump.</li>
      <li>Headliner shade looked great with my natural coloring, giving the appearance of a natural and healthy blush.</li>
      <li>so worth a try!</li>
      <li>Living in a dry climate and being in my 40&#x27;s with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; fair skin means that Aquaphor is just fine to use sparingly.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
      <li>Of all the shades, I thought this (headliner) was the most natural and easy to wear on a day-to-day basis.</li>
      <li>Love the color but even with a nice setting powder, it never seems to dry and set!</li>
      <li>in all, a great shade and formula, but be sure to experiment with it before you add it to your routine, as you&#x27;ll make yourself look like a clown at least once until you get used to the amount.</li>
      <li>Use sparingly and blend quickly</li>
      <li>This is defiantly worth</li>
      <li>The color is exactly the same as shown in the photo, and it sits nicely on the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Goes on so nice and doesn&#x27;t look dry on your skin.</li>
      <li>very soft looking smooth blusher</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t spread well unless you&#x27;ve first moisturizer or put it over a moisture-based foundation.</li>
      <li>If you want more color this blush is totally buildable!</li>
      <li>The color is pretty.</li>
      <li>It gives your cheeks a healthy glow without looking overdone, especially if you have a tan.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it was cheap because I haven&#x27;t touched it since a few weeks after I purchased it.</li>
      <li>Plus, for dry skin, it looks good throughout the day, no dry caking.</li>
      <li>I like the Headliner color since anything straight up &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t work on me..  </li>
      <li>I also got double use of it, because it makes a fabulous lip stain.</li>
      <li>but I really like the product.  </li>
      <li>I still really like this blush because I feel like it lasts longer than any powder blush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I pressed as I would a foundation, and I received too much product.</li>
      <li>I could have painted my whole body....</li>
      <li>I read the reviews about this blush being very pigmented</li>
      <li>and it was really glittery wich</li>
      <li>There is not as much in the container as you would assume there would be</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>The pink color is soft and build-able, very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I am just have more difficulty with this than some of the other reviewers.  </li>
      <li>Blends great when contouring, a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>Pretty sure I will have this blush forever with as little as I need every day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My fave cream blush so far.  Use sparingly and blend quickly and it looks great.</li>
    <li> Sincé I read good reviews on this, I decided to order it. I bought it in Supertar shade and when I first applied it, I realized that one pump size was too much for the results I was looking for, so, for me, using a very Little dot size does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;Is very pigmented and feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, this is my boyfriend account lol.</li>
    <li> I love this blush , it&#x27;s a small container but it says to use only a tad bit and literally that&#x27;s all you need is a very small bit . It looks great on my face , it&#x27;s by far the best blush I have ever tried . Such a pretty pink &amp; it came on time .</li>
    <li> I hated this product didn&#x27;t cone in right color and it was really glittery wich I didn&#x27;t like  at all</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this liquid blush because powder blushes, for me, tend to fade away during the course of the day.  I read the reviews about this blush being very pigmented but I thought &amp;#34;Oh, great!  More bang for my buck!  And hopefully longer-lasting wear!&amp;#34;  Well, application required much more finesse than I thought.  I carefully squeezed a chalky dot of blush onto my finger, dabbed the apples of my cheeks and tried tried tried to blend the blush evenly.  It was hard for me to make this blush look like a natural flush.  Instead, I look more like I have a fever or a rash because the redness is so patchy and pigmented.  I tried using a brush to apply, I tried using a brush to blend, I tried using a powder on top of the blush, I tried two finger application/blending.  I just can&#x27;t make this work for me to way I want it to.  Maybe it&#x27;s the wrong color, or I&#x27;m not up to this level of makeup expertise yet, and for that reason, I give you 3 stars.  If you can make this work for you ... you go girl!  It&#x27;s just not worth the time over traditional powder blushes.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of using it. I tried my fingers, that didn&#x27;t work. I tried a make-up sponge, and that worked even worse.  I tried to even out the spotchy parts with powder and I ended up looking very flushed… even 4 hours later. I finally tried a brush, and that has worked the best. I also agree with other posters that the pump is sporadic, sometimes giving too much product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still really like this blush because I feel like it lasts longer than any powder blush I&#x27;ve ever used. The color is pretty. Plus, for dry skin, it looks good throughout the day, no dry caking.</li>
    <li> A little hard to get the right amount.  Kind of hard to put on compared to powder blush. Not sure if its worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Insanely bright not like the picture what a shame</li>
    <li> This Headliner HD blush is a high quality cosmetic. First of all, the color density is wonderful. It is so totally concentrated that you will take quite some time to finish the little bottle in comes in. I also got double use of it, because it makes a fabulous lip stain. The color stayed on my lips through most of the day. It might take a bit of practice to make this work for you. I strongly recommend putting a tiny dot of it on the back of your hand and working from that. If you find that you have put on too much, you only need to add a tiny bit of foundation to blend the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Headliner shade looked great with my natural coloring, giving the appearance of a natural and healthy blush. This is an excellent product at a bargain price -- so worth a try!</li>
    <li> It is unbelievable how just a little bit of this product produces a lot of color.  The color stays on long too.  An amazing product for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product once you realize it only takes a very very small amount - it blends well for a natural affect - A nice cream blush like this one is hard to find and the price is excellent</li>
    <li> Works great and arrived super fast</li>
    <li> Love the color but even with a nice setting powder, it never seems to dry and set! Disappointed in E.L.F. on this one.</li>
    <li> Great cream blush. You don&#x27;t need a lot. Be careful. Goes on so nice and doesn&#x27;t look dry on your skin. Especially In the winter when you can have dry skin , powder blush can make dry skin look worse.</li>
    <li> I absolutely am in love with this blush! It took a few tries to figure out the easiest way to apply it but once I figured it out it was love at first sight! It&#x27;s a simple pink that can build able to a much darker shade. Plus it stays on all day!</li>
    <li> This was very hard to use. Too easy to get over pigment. I&#x27;m glad it was cheap because I haven&#x27;t touched it since a few weeks after I purchased it. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This blush is awesome. It&#x27;s a nice blushie rose color and it compliments my fair skin tone nicely. This is so pigmented but when you put it on, it tones down and I think that is great. If you want a hint of blush, apply it once. If you want more color this blush is totally buildable! This is defiantly worth it&#x27;s price and I am very impressed with its quality.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  A little bit goes a long way and you just need to be careful with how hard you press on the pump but I really like the product.  It gives your cheeks a healthy glow without looking overdone, especially if you have a tan.</li>
    <li> A little goes a LONG way, it&#x27;s not as light as the picture looks, it&#x27;s a very dark pink.  I use a makeup brush and then put a light amount of powder over it, and that tones it down a bit.</li>
    <li> As good as Benefit, and much less expensive.  I squirt it on a makeup brush, carefully, because too much comes out - then lightly brush it on my cheeks and eyelids. It&#x27;s a soft pink that gives you natural color.  Really nice for summer.</li>
    <li> A little goes a LONG way!! I read the other reviews on this, and knew it would take some time to figure out the perfect amount to use. I started by dabbing a TINY bit on my middle finger, rubbing it against my other middle finger, and then lightly dotting along the apples of my cheeks, back to my temple. I then use my ring fingers on both hands, and blend both dotted cheeks in small circles in the same direction (towards temples). This blush is all about blending, so play around with it a bit.  I&#x27;m naturally very fair and freckly, and found this colour works really well with my complexion.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but I have found it difficult to dispense in appropriate amounts, and to blend on my face. It is inconsistent - maybe I need to shake it every time, but still I have found it hard to use. I will finish the blusher, but I will not purchase it again. Maybe I am just have more difficulty with this than some of the other reviewers.  UPDATE: I gave this another star after using it for a couple months. I have learned how to manage it, and will be using it long term. It is a good color and very economical. I put it over foundation but under my powder finish and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Use a little! This pink is VERY high coverage for a blush.</li>
    <li> A wonderfully cheap, creamy blush! A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! Two tiny pinpoint dots are all I need for a full day&#x27;s coverage.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to dispense.</li>
    <li> very soft looking smooth blusher i really loved it. I felt that it moisturized my skin a bit. however it is a bit smaller than i expected.</li>
    <li> Super super pigmented so use very very little or you&#x27;ll look like a clown but great stay power and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have never used liquid blush before, but after trying this elf one I am hooked. The color is bright so make sure you use a teeny bit, it goes a long way and still manages to look natural. If you do not have a stippling brush buy one, it is the best way to apply this blush. I use the Real Techniques Stipple Brush and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This blush is great. Of all the shades, I thought this (headliner) was the most natural and easy to wear on a day-to-day basis. Headliner is a great light, cool-toned pink that flatters most skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blush is supposedly a dupe for Make Up For Ever&#x27;s HD blushes that look very similar to these in terms of content and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product is a creamy, thick consistency, kind of like a thick concealer from a tube. Clearly shown, this product has a pump to easily get a good amount of product out. You only need a very small amount of product to get great color payoff and good blendibility on your cheeks; just a dab of your finger (like I use, it&#x27;s easier) or a stippling brush, and blend it well across the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The staying power and finish of this product are great. It lasts all day (doesn&#x27;t need to be set with a powder and can be applied after powder) and the finish is very natural. Though almost undetectable, Headliner has a very fine shimmer that highlights the cheeks a little. I love it :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this blush is that without shaking it before I use it, it comes out as a separated liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-GREAT PRICE, so affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Good finish and lasting power&lt;br /&gt;-Great packaging&lt;br /&gt;-Nice color as well as color payoff/opacity&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to blend/nice consistency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Separates if not shaken</li>
    <li> I love this blush! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it is very easy to get too much, I wish it was a little thinner.</li>
    <li> this is bendable blush but highly pigmented so go lightly - I ordered a stipple brush by elf and will see if that makes the blush easier to apply -</li>
    <li> This blush is HIGHLY pigmented and difficult to apply.  It&#x27;s either too dark and I look like a clown or not noticable.  Its just too much work to apply especially since it dries before you&#x27;re done blending.</li>
    <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do this color...justice. It is VERY pink. As soon as you start to dab it in, WHAM! Pink in your face. Make sure to practice, practice, practice before you put this on to go out. For fair skin I really only recommend two SMALL dabs for a natural blush. Otherwise you&#x27;ll have an insane pink mess on your hands. I gave this 4 stars because the packaging was ripped (box) then taped shut which isn&#x27;t what I wanted to see for a brand new product.</li>
    <li> I want to like this more but it comes out so thick and fast that I end up wasting it. The color is also a little more pink than i wanted. I use barely any at a time or otherwise I end up looking like a clown.  I guess the plus side is it may last longer.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I ordered the blush in the pump. But when I got it, it didn&#x27;t work! But love all the powder blush from e.l.f. That is the only blush I use now. I just love it! I like the shine it gives my cheeks.</li>
    <li> Blends great when contouring, a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Product way too thick, doesn&#x27;t come out easily.  Doesn&#x27;t spread well unless you&#x27;ve first moisturizer or put it over a moisture-based foundation.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER purchased liquid cheek color before, ever!  I have always used powder.  But I have been wanting a fresher look to my face so I figured I would try this and I am so glad I did!  The pink color is soft and build-able, very easy to apply.  It is not as difficult to apply as a &amp;#34;stain.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Color is beautiful but did not last as long as I expected. It blends as smooth as any face cream. Will buy this again</li>
    <li> Great product.  A little goes a long way so be sure to use sparingly. I usually use a few dots on my cheeks and then blend it in with a Mac brush.  There is not as much in the container as you would assume there would be but that&#x27;s ok because again, you only need a little.  The color is more coral, which I find brightens my skin, (I have a very fair complexion).  Staying power is ok with this blush.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good value.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Like everyone says - mix this with face lotion!  I use the tiniest amount - as in once the blush liquid starts to exit the bottle, that&#x27;s enough - and mix it with a dime size amount of Aquaphor.  Living in a dry climate and being in my 40&#x27;s with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; fair skin means that Aquaphor is just fine to use sparingly.  I like the Headliner color since anything straight up &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t work on me..  This is just enough color and it doesn&#x27;t smudge off/wear off for hours.  Pretty sure I will have this blush forever with as little as I need every day and I really like it.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s really good. Stays all day. But just a little advice very little goes a long way! So be careful on how dark you order your color.</li>
    <li> The color is exactly the same as shown in the photo, and it sits nicely on the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;One warning: be very very careful when pressing the pump to let the stuff out. I pressed as I would a foundation, and I received too much product. I could have painted my whole body....&lt;br /&gt;Great blush.</li>
    <li> I have this in headliner, and it&#x27;s an awesome &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; blush. I suggest trying it out in the evening before you wash your face because you will inevitably put on WAY too much. you don&#x27;t need a pump or a half pump, you need a barely-there-swipe. I find that this stuff layers pretty well over itself - you don&#x27;t end up with weird splotches or weird patches of color/super-duper-intense color if you layer it in thin layers. It glides on nice and smooth. I have combination skin that is very acne-prone, and this does a good job of not breaking me out or drying out my cheeks (esp during the winter) and I don&#x27;t notice dry flakes (I also moisturize and prime under my foundation or use a BB/tinted moisturizer, so YMMV).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Headliner gives me a nice, subtle flush - I layer it over Doublewear (for skincolor reference, I am a 2 in DW light and a 2W2 in DW) and it works great; I&#x27;ll also do a very light layer over a BB or tinted moisturizer for a natural/summerish/casual day look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great shade and formula, but be sure to experiment with it before you add it to your routine, as you&#x27;ll make yourself look like a clown at least once until you get used to the amount.</li>
    <li> I prefer a cream blush over this liquid blush.</li>
    <li> Out of package it is dense texture and strong color.&lt;br /&gt;BUT!&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that allowing a few pumps to dry out in a makeup tin, results in soft unique texture and &#x27;rich&#x27; color.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest trying it, even one application. It feels revolutionary.</li>
    <li> Color is too harsh- I was expecting a softer pink.</li>
