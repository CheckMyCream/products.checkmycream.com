### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works perfectly as described</li>
      <li>I started using this spray along with the Frizz Defy styling lotion &amp; it is working great for now!  </li>
      <li>Not the best hairspray I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I love this spray!!!</li>
      <li>Great seller, great price, great product!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect and pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Great for frizz, but not for hold.</li>
      <li>Great product, could not find this in the stores.</li>
      <li>This was perfect and it holds OK.  </li>
      <li>The smell is the best of all the Nexxus hair sprays - smells tropical, I love it.</li>
      <li>The hold is good and the scent is very nice.</li>
      <li>I was scared that it would not smell good.  </li>
      <li>Another good hairspray.</li>
      <li>While this is good for keeping hair in place, it did not save my hair from frizzing at an outdoor wedding in VA in June.</li>
      <li>Frizz defy is definitely superior.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great but could hold better.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray!  </li>
      <li>Great hold, but feels light.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m deleting a star because this seems to be leaving a film or some kind of residue on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Guess depends on what kind of hold you are looking for.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, feels nice, doesn&#x27;t leave that shiny look like cheap hairsprays do.</li>
      <li>Very light hairspray.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, but not too strong.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>add to that the fact that it actually does what it claims to do, and you have an almost perfect hairspray.</li>
      <li>Perfection would be if it was labeled as Vegan :-)</li>
      <li>Hold is ok.</li>
      <li>Bottom line, love this hair spray.</li>
      <li>Glad I found it on here.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Love Nexxus Frizz Defy hairspray.</li>
      <li>Smell is a bit overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this.</li>
      <li>I used Nexxus products for two reasons: Most important to me is the fact they</li>
      <li>fragrance - overly fruity and floral - the smell is so powerful that I cannot use my own perfume</li>
      <li>It uses oil (coconut and argan) to seal the hair from moisture (which causes frizz), but the smallest amount will weigh fine hair down.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>Fine mist, not sticky.</li>
      <li>Great product, especially for the price!</li>
      <li>and I can even lightly brush or comb my hair</li>
      <li>Not as original formula.  </li>
      <li>Is a soft, lighter hairspray good for a finish but not so much hold.</li>
      <li>It provides great hold without being too sticky and stiff.</li>
      <li>If you have an occasion that you really need high hold for, then I would say use a layer of this first and top it with a stiffer finishing spray.  </li>
      <li>it will hold your hairstyle for a long time is amazing.</li>
      <li>so I spray my baby hair first with the hair spray than I brush it up to make a ponytail and</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
      <li>I like doing a big bun on top</li>
      <li>Nexus has a similar-looking product that is a comb-through level of control, but it does not perform as well, and to me it smells funny.  </li>
      <li>I would really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>My hair did not have any frizzy look to it and it stayed in place the whole day.  </li>
      <li>I have long, fine curly hair</li>
      <li>It looked ok, but I can&#x27;t stand that weighed down greasy feeling in my hair.</li>
      <li>the humidity is high and it causes my hair to frizz.</li>
      <li>so  I highly recommend ladies.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a soft hold, so don&#x27;t expect everything to stay in place in the wind, but I can tell that the humidity doesn&#x27;t bother my hair quite as much......</li>
      <li>I love that it holds your hair in place but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff.  </li>
      <li>Plus it has a nice scent and this bottle is big enough to last a long time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not stiff or sticky, it smells like coconuts, and blocks out humidity, thus saving my hairstyle no matter what the weather.</li>
      <li>--I barely know I have it on.  </li>
      <li>In fact the grease will weigh you hair down and take away any shape you&#x27;ve installed in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;4)  </li>
      <li>It holds with just the right amount of stiffness (not sticky or overly firm) and definitely keeps the frizz at bay.</li>
      <li>Hard to find locally and the price on Amazon is several dollars less than I have paid when I am able to find it on the retail shelf.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells nice, feels nice, doesn&#x27;t leave that shiny look like cheap hairsprays do. Is a soft, lighter hairspray good for a finish but not so much hold. Would recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but could hold better.</li>
    <li> Great for frizz, but not for hold.</li>
    <li> The humidity here this summer has been unbearable &amp; my hair is out of control.  I previously used John Frieda Frizz products, but they just aren&#x27;t working anymore.  I started using this spray along with the Frizz Defy styling lotion &amp; it is working great for now!  Hoping it holds up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m deleting a star because this seems to be leaving a film or some kind of residue on my hair.  I used a clarifying shampoo and tried over again, but by the end of the day my hair just seemed yucky.  It looked ok, but I can&#x27;t stand that weighed down greasy feeling in my hair.</li>
    <li> Smell is a bit overwhelming. Not the best hairspray I have ever used. Hold is ok. Guess depends on what kind of hold you are looking for. Have it a try but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not as original formula.  doesn&#x27;t hold hair as well or help with Frizzies</li>
    <li> Another good hairspray. The hold is good and the scent is very nice.</li>
    <li> Very light hairspray. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair! Smells nice, but not too strong. Great product, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!  It provides great hold without being too sticky and stiff. I have long hair and it still has movement and I can even lightly brush or comb my hair and it keeps it&#x27;s shape.  And it definitely helps keep the frizziness at bay in this gulf coast humidity!</li>
    <li> It makes her hair less frizzy during the extremely humid NE Ohio Summers, she likes this hair spray very much.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  I use it as a finishing hairspray.  It&#x27;s not stiff or sticky, it smells like coconuts, and blocks out humidity, thus saving my hairstyle no matter what the weather.</li>
    <li> I used Nexxus products for two reasons: Most important to me is the fact they this product is NOT tested on animals....add to that the fact that it actually does what it claims to do, and you have an almost perfect hairspray. Perfection would be if it was labeled as Vegan :-)</li>
    <li> Only hair spray I know that controls frizz but you can still run your fingers through it--I barely know I have it on.  Fine mist, not sticky. Nexus has a similar-looking product that is a comb-through level of control, but it does not perform as well, and to me it smells funny.  Frizz defy is definitely superior.  My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it everywhere when I need it.  Thus the necessity to stock up so that I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Love Nexxus Frizz Defy hairspray. Great hold, but feels light. Hard to find locally and the price on Amazon is several dollars less than I have paid when I am able to find it on the retail shelf.</li>
    <li> Here are my issues with it:&lt;br /&gt;1) fragrance - overly fruity and floral - the smell is so powerful that I cannot use my own perfume&lt;br /&gt;2) It uses oil (coconut and argan) to seal the hair from moisture (which causes frizz), but the smallest amount will weigh fine hair down.&lt;br /&gt;3) It will not provide hold!  In fact the grease will weigh you hair down and take away any shape you&#x27;ve installed in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;4)  did i mention fragrance - it really does smell awful and cloy.</li>
    <li> It is not working for me here in Memphis TN. the humidity is high and it causes my hair to frizz.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  I usually search at least two stores looking for it. Glad I found it on here.</li>
    <li> I was scared that it would not smell good.  I do not do well with flowery scents. This was perfect and it holds OK.  Bought it for my daughters gymnastics, we will see how it holds up there.</li>
    <li> Bottom line, love this hair spray.</li>
    <li> have used this brand several years, it is not sticky but it keeps hair firm in place.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great price, great product!!!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly as described</li>
    <li> Great product, could not find this in the stores.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m convinced that there is nothing that can save my hair from humidity.  While this is good for keeping hair in place, it did not save my hair from frizzing at an outdoor wedding in VA in June.</li>
    <li> I love this spray!!! it will hold your hairstyle for a long time is amazing. I like doing a big bun on top so I spray my baby hair first with the hair spray than I brush it up to make a ponytail and this spray holds that baby hair for long time. Plus it has a nice scent and this bottle is big enough to last a long time so  I highly recommend ladies.</li>
    <li> This spray definitely does help keep frizz under control.  It&#x27;s a soft hold, so don&#x27;t expect everything to stay in place in the wind, but I can tell that the humidity doesn&#x27;t bother my hair quite as much......and I&#x27;m in Florida.  I&#x27;m really glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Perfect and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine curly hair and it is prone to frizz.  This stuff really works!  It holds with just the right amount of stiffness (not sticky or overly firm) and definitely keeps the frizz at bay. The smell is the best of all the Nexxus hair sprays - smells tropical, I love it. If you have an occasion that you really need high hold for, then I would say use a layer of this first and top it with a stiffer finishing spray.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love that it holds your hair in place but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff.  I think it helps with frizzing too.</li>
    <li> Used this for my nieces wedding on a windy/moist day.  My hair did not have any frizzy look to it and it stayed in place the whole day.  I would really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t do anything...I&#x27;m not sure why this product has such hi reviews. I literally didn&#x27;t notice a difference...it&#x27;s like spraying air on your hair. There is no noticeable hold or shine.</li>
