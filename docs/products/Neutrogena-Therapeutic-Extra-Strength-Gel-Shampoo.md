### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this is an excellent price</li>
      <li>Scalp was incredibly itchy, and if I put my hand through my hair, it looked like a snowstorm.</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>I have washed his hair and the smell will stay on my hands even with washing with good smelling</li>
      <li>not smell good (</li>
      <li>/&gt;Makes your hair feel kind of funky/</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>still right after you rinse (but that&#x27;s what a good tea tree conditioner is for, right?)&lt;br</li>
      <li>much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>As usual the T Gel shampoo for scalp problems like Psoriasis is the best and effective shampoo that I have used.</li>
      <li>Scent is fine.</li>
      <li>My son has been using this for over a month and we have seen a huge improvement with the dandruff as well as the itching.</li>
      <li>I would think that they could put some kind of decent fragrance in this</li>
      <li>For some reason I&#x27;ve found this product to be far superior to the traditional scalp drops I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Make sure it&#x27;s that EXTRA Strength T/GEL.  </li>
      <li>Once a week at most is enough to keep it at bay.</li>
      <li>I scrub it in good and leave it in for a few minutes while I wash the rest of my body.</li>
      <li>We also use it on a Golden Retriever with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it because after a couple weeks I noticed my dry and itchy head was completely back to normal!</li>
      <li>It keeps my scalp completely clear.</li>
      <li>Been using this product for almost 20 years and it is the only one that consistently beats back dandruff and keeps it from coming back.</li>
      <li>The regular strength doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
      <li>This has been the only shampoo we have found that&#x27;s worked so far.</li>
      <li>but I still feel the thin layer,,i will be back in the morning buying more</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Purchased this at Target, but will write a review here as I see very few. Going to do this a little reversed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not smell good (but hey, it&#x27;s essentially a medicine. When does medicine smell or taste good?)&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair feel kind of funky/still right after you rinse (but that&#x27;s what a good tea tree conditioner is for, right?)&lt;br /&gt;It looks nothing like shampoo (brown liquid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;HOLY $()%) CRAP DOES THIS STUFF WORK!! I had some serious dandruff issues. Scalp was incredibly itchy, and if I put my hand through my hair, it looked like a snowstorm. Put up with it for about 5 days and finally went to the store and bought this. After one use, ONE USE of this stuff this morning, I have no more itching, and there are probably 95% fewer flakes. I&#x27;ve tried H&amp;S Medicated before, and it would eventually work, but nothing like this. I had been using other H&amp;S products to get rid of dandruff, and nothing was working. This stuff is the BEST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend using this if you&#x27;ve tried other products and have had no success, or have very bad dandruff or a very itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have moderate scalp psoriasis. If I use nothing, I get thick scabs on my scalp (especially around my hairline) and they itch. I pick at them when I sleep or when I&#x27;m nervous. For some reason I&#x27;ve found this product to be far superior to the traditional scalp drops I&#x27;ve used. It smells awful, but I don&#x27;t really care. It&#x27;s medicinal tar, you can&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses. I use it twice per week and leave it on for 3 minutes each time. It keeps my scalp completely clear. If I miss a week, I notice big time. The regular strength doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s been a staple product in my shower for 5 years now.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This is my preferred shampoo and it works well for Dandruff control!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband at the recommendation of our doctor.  We also use it on a Golden Retriever with sensitive skin.  Eliminates dry flaky skin on my husband, and the dog.  Thanks to Amazon, delivered to my door so I don&#x27;t have to waste time shopping at the store.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist suggested for scalp itch &amp; after 10 days... much more comfortable. Will continue using.</li>
    <li> I get terrible itching on my scalp. this is the only shampoo I have found that stops the itching.</li>
    <li> Helps me w my dandruf</li>
    <li> Nothing works as well for dandruff.  Make sure it&#x27;s that EXTRA Strength T/GEL.  Accept no substitutes.  Scent is fine.</li>
    <li> As usual the T Gel shampoo for scalp problems like Psoriasis is the best and effective shampoo that I have used.</li>
    <li> This product came recommended to me after head and shoulders didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m glad I tried it because after a couple weeks I noticed my dry and itchy head was completely back to normal!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item along with the overnight dandruff treatment. My son has been using this for over a month and we have seen a huge improvement with the dandruff as well as the itching. The smell is not great but if the product works then we will deal with it. I have washed his hair and the smell will stay on my hands even with washing with good smelling soap.&lt;br /&gt;I will definetely get this for him again because it has been working so well. This has been the only shampoo we have found that&#x27;s worked so far.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for almost 20 years and it is the only one that consistently beats back dandruff and keeps it from coming back. Once a week at most is enough to keep it at bay.</li>
    <li> works well, gets rid of itchy scalp</li>
    <li> Helps with the itching, but bristles your hair and dryness still builds.</li>
    <li> Helps with itchynes and flakes</li>
    <li> the smell is horrible.  I would think that they could put some kind of decent fragrance in this</li>
    <li> I moved tp a dry climate, especially in the winter, and this is the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that controls my itchy head. It never itches anymore. I scrub it in good and leave it in for a few minutes while I wash the rest of my body. I&#x27;ll be buying this forever.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the only shampoo that helps my husbands&#x27; dandruff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this periodically for years.  this is an excellent price</li>
    <li> I use this not just on my scalp but anywhere my psoriasis is acting up. I just apply in the shower. So grateful to have it. Other family members even without skin problems use it by choice.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this for my scalp psoriasis. It works great. Shipped and delivered on time</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with this for years ..wow ,,picking thick layers of crust out of my head and it gotten worse.i can sleep tonight ...I used a lot,,and I see it got rid of the thick layer but I still feel the thin layer,,i will be back in the morning buying more ,,it works...I just wander can you perm your hair later</li>
