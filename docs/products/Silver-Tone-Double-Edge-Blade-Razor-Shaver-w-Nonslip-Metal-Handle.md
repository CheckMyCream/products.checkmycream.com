### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought this over 4 months ago, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>Build quality isn&#x27;t the greatest.  </li>
      <li>The blade that came with it is not the best.  </li>
      <li>Looks great!  </li>
      <li>It was the perfect blades for my skin.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect razor for my son who travels with his job on the weekends.  </li>
      <li>It even has a mirror, which is not the greatest, but it&#x27;ll work in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great way to get a introduction to the world of safety razors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try, as a great starter.</li>
      <li>Plastic case isn&#x27;t awesome, but it works just fine.</li>
      <li>Good razor for the money.</li>
      <li>But if you just want to try it out or get a cheap one for travel or something, this is excellent.</li>
      <li>These shave just as good as the ones with 4 blades</li>
      <li>For being a cheap, Chinese-made razor, I am fairly impressed.</li>
      <li>it arrived in a fair amount of time.</li>
      <li>: I used this razor for over a year, to the point that I forgot what a good razor felt like.</li>
      <li>yeah, it&#x27;s okay!  </li>
      <li>Nice box tho</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say anything nice about this razor, and caution all against purchasing it for use on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works ok, good price.</li>
      <li>Nice razor.  </li>
      <li>the price is good deal:)</li>
      <li>it was really cheaply made but it works with good blades in it.</li>
      <li>Really pulls the hair, even with good shaving cream!</li>
      <li>I have a very light beard.</li>
      <li>Shave was okay</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, it came in a plastic case that I still managed to get use out of, by modifying it and then buying better razors to gift.</li>
      <li>Are there better shaving razors?</li>
      <li>I would buy again, and the carrying case makes putting it away a safe alternative.  </li>
      <li>I get a better with a Bic $1.00 razor.</li>
      <li>and it did a better job.</li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay alot</li>
      <li>Buy something better not this razor</li>
      <li>The mechanism is mostly cast zinc.  </li>
      <li>And I do love the $4 Weishis, so I&#x27;m not being snobby.  </li>
      <li>Its cheap and effective and give a nice clean cut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase, it was so cheap to begin with</li>
      <li>works easily in my hand</li>
      <li>the price, it is pretty nice.  </li>
      <li>Yes, but this does a pretty nice job.</li>
      <li>The first shave I really liked</li>
      <li>Even it it wasn&#x27;t smashed, the case is cheap junk and wouldn&#x27;t hold up to travel.  </li>
      <li>again, it was cheap.</li>
      <li>It feels incredibly cheap.</li>
      <li>Cheap razor.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>It just feels cheap when you pick it</li>
      <li>Really cheap material</li>
      <li>So glad to be back to a good one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shaving my neck, below the beard, is just as quick and easy as it is with those multi-blade cartridge razors and disposables.  </li>
      <li>original was 5 star I chaneed to a 1 star.</li>
      <li>Great first traditional razor to buy!</li>
      <li>and I had a full refund.</li>
      <li>But other than that this razor is a great tool for the price.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I explained the situation in an e-mail to Amazon</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made, spend a little more and get one better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not something I would keep using if I regularly used this kind of razor, but I just wanted to try out this style without dropping a lot of money on it.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t feel I got my money&#x27;s worth for this.</li>
      <li>Nice razor, blue box came all scratched and used looking.  </li>
      <li>I was going to sell them to customers in my barber shop, but instead I&#x27;ll give them free to see if they want to try a double edge before buying a better one</li>
      <li>, it was my first time ever using a double edged razor, I shaved my legs first because I didn&#x27;t want to hurt my more sensitive armpits until I got the feel for shaving with a new kind of razor.</li>
      <li>And the handle rusted a lil after the first use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, if you like this style of razor and know you will use it every day, I would suggest looking at a higher quality one.</li>
      <li>While I love the carry case and the look of it, the razor itself was of incredibly low quality.</li>
      <li>ok but not enough blades.</li>
      <li>so if you order do have some higher quality blades on hand.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how people can give more than one star, low quality and the blade which is included is just trash.</li>
      <li>Better quality on actual shaver than the included blade.  </li>
      <li>Pretty junky,</li>
      <li>Overall im okay with my purchase</li>
      <li>Bought as a gift, thanks!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky to unscrew the top to replace the blade without putting your fingers on the blade, but I guess you could just use a towel and be fine.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had such a clean shave in years!</li>
      <li>The actual razor itself looks good, is a touch flimsy, but it is Chinese manufactured, once I get some new razors that should be here any day then I will update.</li>
      <li>I know it was cheap, but only after one shave and it got rust.</li>
      <li>There is really nothing fancy about it.</li>
      <li>And I really like the results of</li>
      <li>Very flimsy sheet steel tops it off.  </li>
      <li>Very sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
      <li>Too much pulling and scraping.</li>
      <li>And I have to say, it will take some getting used to, but I really do like the weight to the razor.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rattly and unsafe</li>
      <li>Definitely NOT my &amp;#34;Father&#x27;s Razor.&amp;#34; This version is a cheaply manufactured &amp;#34;pot metal like&amp;#34; casted razor.</li>
      <li>Not for real men, maybe for boys.</li>
      <li>Also the blade is flimsy, it doesnt feel like a real blade.</li>
      <li>very unsteady, (NICK WARNING)  , but gets the job done&lt;br /&gt; :D</li>
      <li>this one is a real bargain and works just as well.</li>
      <li>Really garbage.  </li>
      <li>It does not sit well and is protruding too much.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t terribly large, but still manages to carry some decent heft, to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One side of the razor I got has more space under the blade then the other, upon closer inspection, it was built that way.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered other blades.  </li>
      <li>Very cheap just threw mine in the garbage when the new other one came in.</li>
      <li>The gap on this thing is huge vs my Merkur Long Handle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;No way I&#x27;m going to use this particular razor.  </li>
      <li>The quality of the razor itself is decent.</li>
      <li>Make sure you plan to buy replacement blades in advance as the one its sent with does not last very long.</li>
      <li>Shaving with this was the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, my legs were nice and smooth, so this razor isn&#x27;t bad to shave with at first.</li>
      <li>It was advertised to be new but the razor has a lot of scratches on it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this over 4 months ago, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Better quality on actual shaver than the included blade.  The included blade is cheap and dull so if you order do have some higher quality blades on hand.  Otherwise, this item exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> As far  as I can  tell you can&#x27;t adjust the blade height. But other than that this razor is a great tool for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, blue box came all scratched and used looking.  Had to buy a different box as it was for a gift.</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT my &amp;#34;Father&#x27;s Razor.&amp;#34; This version is a cheaply manufactured &amp;#34;pot metal like&amp;#34; casted razor. Blade and razor made in China (as expected). Upon opening, I shrugged with an &amp;#34;oh well&amp;#34; and tossed it into the recycle bin. No way was I putting that thing to my face.</li>
    <li> Razor is poor quality I can not recommend.</li>
    <li> I know that this is a cheap razor, so getting a cheaply made travel case was fine with me, but I was still disappointed. The first shave I really liked, it was my first time ever using a double edged razor, I shaved my legs first because I didn&#x27;t want to hurt my more sensitive armpits until I got the feel for shaving with a new kind of razor. Shaving with this was the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, my legs were nice and smooth, so this razor isn&#x27;t bad to shave with at first. After my first shave I rinsed out the razor, took it apart and dried each piece with a towel, then allowed it to sit out for a bit longer. I then placed the blade back into the handle tightened it and put it in its travel case. The next time I went to shave the blade and the head were rusted. I was disappointed because I took the time to dry each piece individually and it still rusted. I know it was cheap, but only after one shave and it got rust. Disposable razors take longer to rust than this did. I just don&#x27;t feel I got my money&#x27;s worth for this.</li>
    <li> This thing is terrible and dangerous!</li>
    <li> the price is good deal:)</li>
    <li> I think it would do justice to include a quality blade with this product. I litteraly couldn&#x27;t shave with this.</li>
    <li> It was the perfect blades for my skin.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect razor for my son who travels with his job on the weekends.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> cheap not worth the money</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this because it reminds him of when he first started shaving as a teen (50+ yeas ago).</li>
    <li> Really garbage.  Cheap razor.  Go with the 20 dollar one I bought here recently at amazon.  This blade is a butterfly type of blade, after a while, it goes kaput.  Really cheap material, the butterfly knob will soon quit turning the worm gear inside and open or close the butterfly gizmo.Also, the blade inside flops around, really hard on your face, not precision.  Very cheap just threw mine in the garbage when the new other one came in.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars because although it arrived on time and was what I ordered the mirror in the case was broken and a circlure part on botter was off and had to be popped back on. Which did not affect the performance of product.&lt;br /&gt;My original was 5 star I chaneed to a 1 star. Because it rusted and then the screw part broke. After 6 months of use</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how people can give more than one star, low quality and the blade which is included is just trash.</li>
    <li> Was tired of paying high prices for razors and decided to go back to this. These shave just as good as the ones with 4 blades</li>
    <li> This is just a waste of money.  Within 2 weeks it completely rusted and there it goes to the trash.  Buy something better not this razor</li>
    <li> I guess I should have known by the price that this would be junk.  I first time I used it; it didn&#x27;t shave well, It rusted in 24 hrs and it fell apart the second time I used it.  I like the case.</li>
    <li> does what is should.  Build quality isn&#x27;t the greatest.  One side of the razor I got has more space under the blade then the other, upon closer inspection, it was built that way.  it does hold a razor and it does allow you to shave with said razor.  I think, unless I am crazy that that was the whole point of this item.  Therefore, if your looking for a something to hold a razor (I recommend buying the Gillette stainless razors, they are sharp as heck, and last through allot of shaves) then this is just what you are looking for.  I have seen similar items in the stores (yeah still made in china), for around twenty bucks, so this one is a real bargain and works just as well. Not that it has a choice, its the blade that does the work, not the handle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but praise for safety razor shaving and decided to try it. While I love the carry case and the look of it, the razor itself was of incredibly low quality. Pulled my hair out rather than shave and then rusted while in its case! The actual razor itself looks good, is a touch flimsy, but it is Chinese manufactured, once I get some new razors that should be here any day then I will update.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a CHEAP devise with a worse blade than a dull AXE. Too much pulling and scraping. I have a very light beard. I get a better with a Bic $1.00 razor. I guess you get what you pay for. Amazon should consider taking this Item of of their web-store (because it&#x27;s a reflection on them).I give it NO STARS, but I had to click on at least the first star to move over to this comment area.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM !!!  Ruben</li>
    <li> Shipped fast.  Nice razor.  The blade that came with it is not the best.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered other blades.  My husband seems to like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to get a introduction to the world of safety razors. Its cheap and effective and give a nice clean cut.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk!</li>
    <li> it arrived in a fair amount of time. This was a gift and I wrote the gift message but when I opened my package there was no gift message. It was advertised to be new but the razor has a lot of scratches on it. Also the blade is flimsy, it doesnt feel like a real blade. Overall im okay with my purchase but I dont think I will ever buy this product again.</li>
    <li> ok but not enough blades.</li>
    <li> Good razor for the money. It&#x27;s not something I would keep using if I regularly used this kind of razor, but I just wanted to try out this style without dropping a lot of money on it. It&#x27;s a little tricky to unscrew the top to replace the blade without putting your fingers on the blade, but I guess you could just use a towel and be fine. Plastic case isn&#x27;t awesome, but it works just fine. It even has a mirror, which is not the greatest, but it&#x27;ll work in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you like this style of razor and know you will use it every day, I would suggest looking at a higher quality one. But if you just want to try it out or get a cheap one for travel or something, this is excellent.</li>
    <li> Bad knockoff of a Weishi 9306 (which is a knockoff of a Gilette, but a good one).  This razor is marked Nanjie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety bar show serious casting defects.  As though it was made from a mold made from another razor.  Or maybe the casting sucked and it was ground smooth by a shaky hand.  It&#x27;s really that bad.  Also there is an odd mix of metals.  The handle appears to be aluminum (Weishi&#x27;s is brass).  The mechanism is mostly cast zinc.  Very flimsy sheet steel tops it off.  It&#x27;s very rattly and unsafe looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No way I&#x27;m going to use this particular razor.  And I do love the $4 Weishis, so I&#x27;m not being snobby.  I&#x27;m just not going to cut my face over a few bucks.  This isn&#x27;t up to the standard set by the Weishi.  It&#x27;s over twice the money, which I didn&#x27;t mind because I wanted a travel case.  But the case came broken, and the mirror inside was glued on but came off in transit.  So now I don&#x27;t even have a travel case.  Even it it wasn&#x27;t smashed, the case is cheap junk and wouldn&#x27;t hold up to travel.  Very sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot recommend this one.  I got mine from seller AHAOMG, so you may get a different item.  Still, go for something with a brand name:  Weishi.  Don&#x27;t bother with this junky Nanjie one.</li>
    <li> Not sure how ppl like my grandfather did it with these blades. Blades made me bleed like crazy. And the handle rusted a lil after the first use. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay alot</li>
    <li> This was not made for a normal sized human...maybe its a prop. Not for real men, maybe for boys. Nice box tho</li>
    <li> Pretty junky, but it&#x27;s cheap. Feels like a plastic handle, sharp edges on the underside of the blade fitting, the mirror was broken on mine when I got it, but...again, it was cheap. No replacement for my Merkur but a decent short term solution  UPDATE: I used this razor for over a year, to the point that I forgot what a good razor felt like. I finally got a new Merkur, and wow, what a difference. The gap on this thing is huge vs my Merkur Long Handle. I had so many gouging uncomfortable bloody shaves over the past year. So glad to be back to a good one.</li>
    <li> The blade it came with is bad, but the tool itself is very nice. I like that it opens up like a flower!</li>
    <li> This razor - which was not the one I thought I was buying - is abysmal. I bought three of them to give as gifts. I expected the same razor I had gotten before (which was -my- first razor), but instead got a butterfly model that... honestly is just terrible. Pieces don&#x27;t line up, they jump around and are loose in actuation... I can&#x27;t say anything nice about this razor, and caution all against purchasing it for use on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it came in a plastic case that I still managed to get use out of, by modifying it and then buying better razors to gift. Sort of an expensive mistake to make, but those lemons made some drinkable lemonade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, thanks!</li>
    <li> Took some getting used to but now I like it alot</li>
    <li> very unsteady, (NICK WARNING)  , but gets the job done&lt;br /&gt; :D</li>
    <li> This is a very basic and low end razor. There is really nothing fancy about it. It feels incredibly cheap. Make sure you plan to buy replacement blades in advance as the one its sent with does not last very long.</li>
    <li> So I got this, with the intent to shave my head with it.  And I have to say, it will take some getting used to, but I really do like the weight to the razor.  It isn&#x27;t terribly large, but still manages to carry some decent heft, to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving my neck, below the beard, is just as quick and easy as it is with those multi-blade cartridge razors and disposables.  And I really like the results of this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go for a 5 star rating, but for one thing.  The blade, shipped with the razor, appears to be a poor quality one.  It did not do the job well at all, but a stop to a local pharmacy chain store provided some quality blades.  And I was instantly a fan, thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is pretty nice.  I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try, as a great starter.</li>
    <li> Works ok, good price.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, the handle is short,  the bottom cap came off when I opened the package, Included blade is to flexible Is not what I was expecting form this product.</li>
    <li> The quality of the razor itself is decent. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a world class shave at this price point. As long as you keep in mind that this is a cheap razor, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. For being a cheap, Chinese-made razor, I am fairly impressed. Are there better shaving razors? Yes, but this does a pretty nice job. I give it 4 stars because the case that was included doesn&#x27;t fully shut with the razor inside; so really, it kinda feels like a waste on that end.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was 2 to the package. so they end up charging you for 2. and there not good quality.</li>
    <li> Shave was okay but it rusted out in about a month and a half.</li>
    <li> works easily in my hand</li>
    <li> I received it on time. The razor has a dangerous blade angle. It does not sit well and is protruding too much.  I actually stopped shaving, before cutting myself. I am very familiar with this method of shaving and it was disappointing. Luckily, I explained the situation in an e-mail to Amazon and I had a full refund. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Kinda low quality!  It just feels cheap when you pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the blade that came with it seems dull.</li>
    <li> The shaver arrived today.  It fell apart in the box in shipment.  The reason is the pot metal is so thin and lacking sturdiness makes it able to fall apart in transport.  I reassembled the shaver.  I am somewhat scared to use it give it is fragile and could fall apart while shaving.  Amazon should mystery shopper this.  it looks good in photos but is nothing but fragile thin pieces of pot metal in a box.  It is not fit for its intent and purpose.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made, spend a little more and get one better. I was going to sell them to customers in my barber shop, but instead I&#x27;ll give them free to see if they want to try a double edge before buying a better one</li>
    <li> Looks great!  Does not shave as well as expected!  Really pulls the hair, even with good shaving cream!</li>
    <li> This was everything I&#x27;d hoped for. Haven&#x27;t had such a clean shave in years!</li>
    <li> The razor was so poorly designed that I couldn&#x27;t even use it!!!!! It felt like dragging a piece of rock across my face. I went out and got a (10 for a dollar) disposable razor and it did a better job.</li>
    <li> it was really cheaply made but it works with good blades in it.</li>
    <li> Great first traditional razor to buy! I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase, it was so cheap to begin with but it helped me decide on what to upgrade to. Would definitely recommend for first time buyers.</li>
    <li> I used to shave with one just like this, only after receiving did I find the older model, yeah, it&#x27;s okay!  I would buy again, and the carrying case makes putting it away a safe alternative.  The blades, however, buy the persona made in USA.</li>
