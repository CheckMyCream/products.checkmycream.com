<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works pretty well eliminating breath.. can start hurting tongue after a while if you scrape to hard, so no fault in product, just for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was skeptical at first but after having tried it I am now a believer.  My tongue is pink and feels squeaky clean.  Much better than a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well! I&#x27;m impressed. Have been using Orabrush for the past couple months, just ordered some more. High five!</li>
    <li> My tounge tastes clean.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Hey Orabrush guys, any possibility you could make a cap or something to protect the bristles while I take it travelling?</li>
    <li> thank you i&#x27;m using it and i have a long way to go but it is very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seeing the effect every time I use it</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s cleaning properly or not....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a regular tongue scraper for years, but my tongue was never as pink as I wanted it to be. (My breath felt clean though). One day I saw an ad for this product and I decided to give it a shot. I have to say i&#x27;m disappointed. A regular tongue scraper did a better job scraping white stuff from my tongue, and the foam comes with this product did nearly nothing. I suggest you use a regular tongue scraper over this.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a while now, very effective at getting all that nasty gunk off of your tongue.</li>
    <li> Love Ora-Brush :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have come from nothing and had great sucsess on youtube with great videos :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ora-brushs really work and work a lot better than other tounge cleaners :) amazing :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also im from UK ad i got first post in USA BOO YEAH ;D</li>
    <li> This toungue cleaner is amazing! Compared to the other ones you don&#x27;t just scrape off all the gunk in your toungue you brush it so it causes a deep clean in your toungue making your breath fresher ! I will continue buying this product because of the amazing results. Thanks Orabrush !</li>
    <li> The Orabrush has to be one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;It is simple and only takes about a minute to use, and it give you fresh breath all day long. Although the gunk that I find on the brush puts me off my tongue!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone and anyone.</li>
    <li> 100 years ago, no one brushed their teeth. Gross! In another 100 years, I think we will look back with just as much disgust at the fact that no one brushed their tongue. 90% of bad breath comes from the tongue after all. Join the Orabrush revolution!</li>
    <li> I have an uncle that is a dentist so I have known about tongue hygiene for years.  I have used all kinds of tongue scrapers and tongue brushes over the years. This is the best of both worlds.  It is both a tongue scraper and a tongue brush.  The tongue foam is one more way to clean your mouth.  It has a very mild flavor and I find that I can use it even when my allergies are acting up. A great and needed product for mouth hygiene.</li>
    <li> I do love this except for my wanting to gag everytime I use it on the back of my tongue, but I cant really hold that against the product~</li>
    <li> Have to say, this product does exactly what it says on the &#x27;tin&#x27;. My Tongue is now cleaner that ever thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> no complaints. customer service was great, product is great... i bought the large pack (4 back of foam and brushes)</li>
    <li> works for me!&lt;br /&gt;although, i am noticing tiny rips on my tongue after using this. but not a huge issue.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve scrubbed and scrubbed away at nasty plaque buildup on my tongue, trying everything, but nothing ever worked. My toothbrush was just helpless. Then I heard about Orabrush and decided to give it a shot. It&#x27;s brilliant! The little feelers carefully loosen plaque and a tiny scraper at the end catchs it and drags it off your tongue. My mouth feels fresher just talking about it, thanks Orabrush!</li>
    <li> when you scrape your tongue it makes you cough and choke, and nothing comes on it, trust me it isn&#x27;t good.</li>
    <li> It is an easy product to use and the YouTube instruction videos are great.  The brush does the job fast.  NOBODY WALKS AWAY FROM ME!!!</li>
    <li> It works! It can definitely eliminate bad breath. Scrub this bad boy against the toungue and it really scrubs off the white looking gunk. You can even taste the diffirence!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I wish the flavor had a little more pazazz (spelling???).  Maybe &amp;#34;mild mint&amp;#34; should be &amp;#34;medium mint&amp;#34;???</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It feels great on your tongue. It&#x27;s like a ticklish massage. Haha. After using it, my tongue definitely feels fresher. It&#x27;s an odd unfamiliar sensation. I always brush my tongue when I brush my teeth, but the Orabrush was like an entirely different school of brushing. It just made my tongue feel great! I&#x27;m sure my breathe smelt better too. It&#x27;s crazy the gunk that is inside your tongue that this thing reveals, even after brushing with a toothbrush. It definitely makes my mouth feel cleaner! I love this product and recommend it to anyone! It takes almost no time at all and is kind of fun! Try it!</li>
    <li> I grabbed the orabrush because I got it free, but after using it for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ll be replacing mine every time it gets old! I&#x27;ve always been a bit sensitive towards that morning taste, and even after brushing, it was still there. The orabrush, with brushing, completely cleans your mouth, removing that morning breath, and all the terrible tastes that come with it.</li>
    <li> Orabrush tongue cleaner is very useful in my mornings,I can really offer for anybody to use it!&lt;br /&gt;At the first time Iwas afraid that it will irritate my tongue,but not at all!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning and I love it!</li>
    <li> It cleans your tongue, but then so can my Sonicare toothbrush and it doesn&#x27;t gag me. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 18 months. I really like the Orabrush and how it takes the crap off your tongue and winds up making &#x27;morning breath&#x27; a thing of the past. I sometimes use this product when it is about to be 12 hrs since last using it, and it works @ night to keep my breath from going south when I am &#x27;out on the town&#x27;. Excellent product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Italy, and I bought it just to give it a try. I took a special offer from their site, meaning that i could take one for me, one for my mother, and two for my girlfriend and her young sister. I also bought 4 tubes of foam. And yes, the shipment costed me a bit, and so did the waiting, but was intercontinental shipment, so no rant about it.&lt;br /&gt;Results after 4 months:&lt;br /&gt;- I use it from time to time, and (obviously) can&#x27;t see really heavy improvements; I&#x27;m not the one who really was in need of a Orabrush, though;&lt;br /&gt;- My mother has bad breath, but she couldn&#x27;t stand for long the unpleasant sensation of scraping through the mouth too deep to the end of the tongue, so she stopped using it after some tries;&lt;br /&gt;- My girlfriend sometimes has bad breath problems deriving from digestive issues, and she really needed one, paired with the foam: in this case, it&#x27;s a success;&lt;br /&gt;- Her sister, even if young, has already started the goddamned habit of smoking cigarettes: she really thanked me for buying her an extra Orabrush (she already knew what it was), and is really enjoying both the scraper AND the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that not every problem can be solved by the Orabrush scraper, because bad breath can be caused by different factors (bad alimentation behaviour, digestion, bad mouth care, smoking), but combined with the foam, the battle (not the war) can still be a daily win.</li>
    <li> Ok, let&#x27;s be honest, how often do you worry about bad breath? Every day, every hour, every second?!? In my case, bad breath was always on my mind, it affected my social, work, and family life, until a few weeks ago when my Orabrush was delivered. Since then, a clean tounge has given me surprisingly fresh breath, and newfound confidence. So really, buying an Orabrush is a no brainer! :)</li>
    <li> I got a free orabrush and tried it out. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really working, but my tongue feels better I guess. It&#x27;s better then using my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lot of different tongue scrapers, mouthwash, dental floss, but none of them worked as good as The Orabrush. I&#x27;ve been struggling with bad breath for years, getting that \\&quot;ugh...\\&quot; from girls when kissing, but after using The Orabrush the bad breath was gone! At first, I had to use it a few times in a row to get all that gunk from my tongue, and just after a week - the results were magnificent, especially if you order the Tongue Foam, like I did. In the end, even though I&#x27;ve used it only for two weeks, I am satisfied with the quality, the effectiveness of it, and will definitely get more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> This product truly does what it says, after the first use I could notice a huge different now I will not go a day without using the orabrush!</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day everyday.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gag reflex that much, but then you get used to it after a while.  It can reach far and brushing the stuff out.  However, you ought to replace or somehow sanitize it often because the bottom of the brush gets mold and mildew easily and you can get them out.  I leave it in the same place as my tooth brush, but my tooth brush doesn&#x27;t get that kind of mold.</li>
    <li> keeps my tongue nice clean and fresh. The foam is a great addition to have too. Great product to have with your dental arsenal.</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t write this but my wife was avoiding me because I had bad breath. She finally told me one day and I knew I had to do something about it.... I remember this viral video from way back when about a tongue toothbrush... and then I found ORABRUSH. It was the same product as that funny video I remembered. So I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out this product totally helps! My wife and I are like honeymooners again thanks to Orabrush. Could there be any more ringing endorsement than that? It works. I added this product to my regular oral hygiene routine of floss, brush, orabrush, mouthwash for full effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some learning where I figure out how to stick this thing far enough in my mouth to be effective, yet not so far that I tickle the uvula and puke, but you get used to the gag reflex and think about the benefits. Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> At first when I heard about the orabrush I was a little skeptical on whether it was legitimate or not but was I proven wrong! The orabrush is amazing! I use it everyday and am completely pleased with it. Removes bad breath almost instantly. Worth every penny you pay for it! Definetly a must have item and I am in love with it!</li>
    <li> I used it once &amp; the Orabrush removed all the muck on my tongue leaving me in a state of mouthly cleanliness I never thought possible!!! :)</li>
    <li> Used it and abused it! and now my tongue looks so pink and clean and leaves me feeling nice and fresh every morning and night.. i even had to buy one for the family so we can all be FRESH TO DEATH!</li>
    <li> To all future users of the Orabrush, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product. It works really well and, with the tongue foam, I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with my oral hygiene. At last, products that don&#x27;t mask odours but get to the bottom of the problem by removing the bad germs.</li>
    <li> Well this tounge cleaner really works great, I don&#x27;t have bad breath anymore and that weird feeling on my tounge after brushing is GONE! The foam is highly recommend taste good and no burn buy this if you have bad breath!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a toothbrush but it is NOT as effective as this brush.  I am amazed at the amount of debris I get from my tongue.  I recommend it to my friends, especially the smokers. Why didn&#x27;t I patent this little sweetheart?  I use it throught the day and feel much more confident. Thank you, HAMoerke</li>
    <li> Easily the best tool in my bathroom. It clearly gets all the gunk off your tongue and leaves it feeling and smelling clean.</li>
    <li> Hello ,&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks ago I got my Orabrush package and it&#x27;s AMAZING !  After one week I felt much more confident  \\&quot;feels clean\\&quot; and I&#x27;m planing to buy it again :D</li>
    <li> Before the Orabrush, I&#x27;ve realized not only the texture of my tongue, but also the disgusting color of yellow. Besides brushing, flushing, and using a mouthwash, using the Orabrush is comfortable on my tongue, easy to use, and that disgusting color I&#x27;ve mentioned simply disappears. I feel that change in my mouth after using it. I&#x27;m impressed!!</li>
    <li> I love my Orabrush! I use it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;It kills time on tongue brushing, and oral cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, and very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and would recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> I thought this brush barely did anything.  I have been using Supersmile tongue cleaners for a couple years now and thought it was much more effective than this brush.  I feel the brush is just too soft and I did not notice any gunk or white removal like I do with tongue scrapers.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the effectiveness of this product, the foam wakes my taste buds and the brush is the final wash and a rinse with water does it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.  The texture on the brush really penetrates deep and pulls bacteria from your tongue.  Additionally, the tongue foam moisturizes and freshens your mouth.</li>
    <li> Ode to Orabrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orabrush Orabrush you are so fine&lt;br /&gt;You make my breath smell just divine&lt;br /&gt;My mouth is happy&lt;br /&gt;It thanks you too&lt;br /&gt;As do all the friends&lt;br /&gt;I am talking to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006YPXACU Orabrush Tongue Cleaner with Tongue Foam]]</li>
    <li> it actually does work better than my toothbrush for cleaning my tongue. Coffee makes the tongue brown &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this brush would make much of a difference but it&#x27;s incredible! Every morning I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;I need it asap!&amp;#34;. Nothing is more disgusting to me than a dirty mouth and this takes care of that right away. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> love this product, cleans your tongue.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem anymore affective that using a tooth brush honestly. I believe anyone that&#x27;s overwhelmed by how great this is under the power of suggestion or hype of those viral videos. My dentist isn&#x27;t too impressed with these either and says brushing the tounge and roof of your mouth and using a good mouth wash when you brush is just fine. I would recommend it for the curious however; especially when you can get it at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually pretty handy if you eat or drink something terrible and the bad taste lingers in your mouth. I&#x27;d say this about a 3.5</li>
    <li> I am really, really happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I hate the white gunk on my tongue and bought this to wage battle on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orabrush tongue cleaner isn&#x27;t sold in my area. I know you don&#x27;t need to clean your tongue but I feel a need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, within a few days there was less white gunk on my tongue each day. The amount of crap this thing removes is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or cut my tongue like other scrapers. This one is gentle and does the trick. The tongue foam doesn&#x27;t do anything for me I prefer to just use toothpaste. The brush however is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This works fantastically well. Great product. Does its job as advertised. A must have. Highly recommended if you are looking for a brush design tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says it does. Nice and easy been using it for a week and my mouth just feels cleaner. The bristles do not hurt and also the foam has a good Mintie taste.</li>
    <li> I am terrified of the dentist and therefore do everything in my power to make sure I am free of cavities. This product does the job in a way that gets the gunk off in a pain free manner, unlike using the actual toothbrush brushes.</li>
    <li> My parents always told me to brush my tongue, so I did. Unfortunately the toothbrush was never a great tongue brush. Enter the Orabrush... it is much more effective than a toothbrush when it comes to cleaning the tongue. The plastic bristles do a great job loosening up the gunk, then you can wipe it all up with the scraper. I haven&#x27;t used any of the other scraper-style tongue cleaners so I cannot compare them, but this is definitely better than using the toothbrush. And it&#x27;s cheap too. I don&#x27;t know how much the tongue foam helps, might just be a sales gimmick. I&#x27;ve used this with leftover toothpaste and with the tongue foam, doesn&#x27;t seem to be much difference.</li>
    <li> Have had this for a little over 6 months and its still going strong, i&#x27;m gonna replace it  though, just &#x27;cause it&#x27;s plastic and bacteria growth and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The tongue foam was really great!&lt;br /&gt;The experience when it finished wasnt as good but the cleaner still got the job done!&lt;br /&gt;Good tongue cleaner</li>
    <li> My grandson kept telling me about this tongue cleaner that he saw advertised on TV &amp; asked if he could have one. He said: Nana, bad breath comes from a not so clean tongue.......lol.....found it on Amazon &amp; he was ecstatic when he received it in the mail yesterday &amp; I happened to be with him when he got it!</li>
    <li> The Orabrush seems to be okay. I will say it does not hurt and I am thinking I once bought something similar years ago. Using it along with the foam, results are not that much different than using a small tooth brush with toothpaste. I was mainly using Arm &amp; Hammer since it is milder. I will try the brush one day with toothpaste to see if tongue looks more cleaner. Sometimes I tend to forget to clean my tongue unless I really look at it. Coffee and oatmeal, especially the oatmeal, will coat your tongue and needs cleaning.</li>
    <li> After using another type of tongue brush, and a separate scraper, this is 2 in 1. Not to mention it comes with the foam, which works very well. Using one of these lets you maintain very good oral hygiene. I will continue to re buy the foam when it runs out and brushes as i feel necessary.</li>
    <li> i like the foam better than the brush</li>
    <li> Simply amazed as how mild tasting and works so well. Will order it again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this long. A novility type brush. If used every day it would be great however I referred back to my regular daily brush. Worth the money</li>
    <li> There is a lot of advertisement around this product, but to me, it&#x27;s overrated. I don&#x27;t see how that kind of scooper can clean the tongue. Plus, is that foam really useful? How about using a regular toothpaste?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product, but not what I expected it.  It helped a lot with cleaning the tongue and taking away the bad breath.  I recommend it.  I wished it had stronger foam or stronger product</li>
    <li> i knew the ora brush would make a difference but it totally amazed me how BIG that difference was. when you first start using it you can see white stuff coming out of your tongue which shows you that it really works but the more you use it, the amount decreases. i saw a huge difference in my breath and also the color of your tongue becomes less white and more pink :) i love this brush and will probably keep using it for EVER:)this is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Let me be straight up honest first.  I only bought the Orabrush because I&#x27;m a HUGE Toby Turner fan.  After I watched Toby (Tobuscus) Turner&#x27;s video, I immediately bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it arrived, my kids and husband wanted to try it too.  So, we shared it at first. That might sound really gross to a lot of people, but oh well.  Anyhoo.  I&#x27;ve come to really like using the Orabrush.  It&#x27;s much gentler on the tongue than using a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Daughter likes &amp; uses this thing.  I&#x27;ve never used one in my life, but hey - if it helps kids with oral hygiene, I&#x27;m all for it!</li>
    <li> The OraBrush definitely left me with a clean feeling tongue and really provides fresh breath.  With fresh breath also comes confidence when you have those important face-to-face encounters at work or in social encounters.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Just give one a chance and see what you think.</li>
    <li> I bought Orabrush because I liked the marketing, which is an unusual reason for me to buy something.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and on the whole I&#x27;m sure it works as advertised.  The first time I used it, it definitely scrubbed my tongue clean very effectively.  Every subsequent use it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything.  And I think the reason for that is that the first time I used it, it was like getting a new tongue.  After that, there&#x27;s hardly anything *to* clean away.  I use it morning and night as part of my usual toothbrushing routine and I&#x27;m sure my breath is a lot better.</li>
    <li> Who would&#x27;ve known that this little brush can cure bad breath? This thing did wonders for me. And even better, there is one for DOGS too! My dogs have horrible breath so I&#x27;m going to definitely invest in one of those as well. You should consider selling in stores again. I would seriously love that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for inventing such a beautiful Device. (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using orabrush for one year. Two weeks ago i ordered foam and together with ora brush it gives great result.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, as I think that the &#x27;bristles&#x27; do a good job of getting some gunk off the tongue without being abrasive. I prefer the [[ASIN:B00064JGBO Dr. Tung&#x27;s Products: Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner]], though. That device is stainless steel and does a great job of pulling nastiness off the tongue without triggering a gag reflex. The Orabrush, I feel, lacks in the area of scraping stuff off. The upper ridge that one uses to skim the brushed gunk off is fairly low-setting (I assume to allow the brushes to work unimpeded). Unfortunately, I think it makes it tough to angle this ridge downwards and use it for debris removal. A better design may be to place a larger scraper on the reverse side of the bristles so one can be more aggressive in using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is certainly better than nothing, but I feel there are better alternatives out there (for me, anyways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> The Orabrush is a brilliant tool for oral hygiene. It is as essential as a toothbrush. It&#x27;s simple, easy to use, nice to look at, and effective. I hope everyone I ever kiss uses an Orabrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks now and don&#x27;t have bad breath ever anymore. The foam that comes with it works really well too.</li>
    <li> The product works amazing! I got one for my wife too and since she is pregnant and her mouth smells way gross lol She end up liking the product too. We both enjoy using the oralbrush. Thanks again</li>
    <li> I like it I can deffinatly feel a difference, I use it once in the morning and i feel like it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The Orabrush should be available everywhere. Its idiot proof and very effective. the orange foam is also great and I&#x27;d recommend anybody add both the brush and foam to the oral hygiene regimen.</li>
    <li> I think it realy helped! When i wake up i use it and BAM! No bad breath, after brushing teath of corse, i realy LOVE it! definitely will Re-purchase !</li>
    <li> Benzoic acid / sodium benzoate causes breast cancer and other cancers.  They could have used citric acid  or harmless preservatives yet these dummies choose a cancer causing preservative.  Google it and you will see the research.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather sensitive about my breath, and sometimes I just get a bad taste in my mouth and think &#x27;I bet my breath is really foul right now&#x27;. I brushed my teeth a lot, and it helped, but only because the scent of toothpaste masked any nastiness. I was on youtube, watching &#x27;Rhett and Link&#x27;, and they mentioned how they both have orabrushes to help bad breath. I went to the website, watched the infomercial-esque youtube video, and it was pretty good. Taught me some stuff, and it was pretty funny. They a great deal (free orabrush, just pay shipping) so I got one. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 weeks, and it does pull all kinds of junky stuff off my tongue, and makes my mouth feel cleaner. I don&#x27;t know how it affects my breath, since I can&#x27;t smell my own breath. It made my tongue look better, too. I didn&#x27;t realize that &#x27;white gunk&#x27; stuff was actually bacteria, and led to bad breath. The orabrush doesn&#x27;t seem to get it all, but sometimes it gets almost all, sometimes hardly any (perhaps it depends on what I&#x27;ve been eating, maybe some food leads to more resilient bacteria?). Theres some build-up of this stuff on the sides of my tongue (sorry, this review is getting a little gross, but, if you&#x27;re looking at reviews for this, you probably want this info) which the orabrush can&#x27;t get, because there&#x27;s just not really any practical way, the brush is way to wide for something like the side of my tongue. All in all, it does pretty well, not quite as great as the video claimed, but still much better than I&#x27;d expect (it looks like a gimmick). And, your mileage may vary. Maybe my tongue is just harder to clean, or maybe it would be better with the tongue foam stuff they sell. I do wish they had more colors and selection, but that&#x27;s just nit picky. It does make me gag a little bit, but I&#x27;ve found that if I stick out my tongue just right, it doesn&#x27;t make me gag, and I&#x27;m getting better at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product does what it says, and they explain everything very well about why you need it, how it works, and what it does. It may not work quite as well as they claim, but it&#x27;s a lot closer to the ad than most products are.</li>
    <li> I love the orabrush it makes my mouth feel clean and fresh all the time! I used to be self-concious about my breath(just in case something I ate made it smell) so I didn&#x27;t like to get to near to people&#x27;s faces but now I&#x27;ve gained more confidence and I can get as close as I want, within reason:L It defiantly is the best tongue cleaner out there and does it&#x27;s job fantastically.</li>
    <li> This is a great tongue cleaner, it does a pretty good job. I have used it daily now and my mouth always feels fresh and clean!.</li>
    <li> love this my toungue feels cleaner going to dentist soon to ask him about the foam if it&#x27;s necessary or not</li>
    <li> This is very useful for people who have mouth issues.  My mom needed this since she no longer can do her own oral cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;We can easily clean her tongue since she accumulates a lot of residue while sleeping with her mouth open.</li>
    <li> It is a good product!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the new Orabrush Tongue Cleaner with Tongue Foam and I must say it works GREAT!  I am always very concerned about my breath, and in the past finally realized that it comes from your tongue.  I had purchased tongue scrapers in the past, but they didn&#x27;t really do the job.  I came across a U Tube video showing this funny looking guy with the Orabrush Tongue Cleaner and it definitely piqued my interest.  He explained how this brush gets into the little grooves in the tongue to get to all of the bacteria on the tongue.  That made complete sense to me, so I decided to try it from their offer.  I have had amazing results with the scraper AND the tongue foam.  It has made a big difference in my breath and the foam is wonderful!  A big plus is how hilarious their commercials and all of their correspondence is....great job!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work like I wanted it too.  To me it doesn&#x27;t take off anything on your tongue, it seems like it combs rather than brushes.</li>
    <li> I had no idea how much gunk I would scrape off my tongue! I not only have fresher breathe but I may have lost some weight getting rid of all that gunk. The tongue scraper on my toothbrush does you nothing compared to this!</li>
    <li> This thing works just OK. After trying it, I think it should be wider, at least the width of an average tongue :)</li>
    <li> I previously used a metal tongue cleaner. It wasn&#x27;t more than a thin, flat, curved piece of metal with handles on the ends. It was more tough on my taste buds. I didn&#x27;t feel like it could get deep in the crevices. This isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it&#x27;s a huge improvement from the other cleaner. There is a noticeable difference. I feel like my tongue is much cleaner after using this. Particularly effective on the back of the tongue where a lot of food particles always seem to accumulate.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my Orabrush!  I have given one to every member of my family (not in an offensive manner of course).  They are easy to use and are amazing. We are hooked!!!  Thanks Dr. Bob for inventing such an awesome product!  Can&#x27;t wait to get my new shipment and to get the Dog one too for our new puppy!!!</li>
    <li> When you remove the wrapping from the can of orabrush foam, the can is completely blank (without any text). Any identification , ingredients and directions are gone.  So, I guess you have to remember or re-label the container yourself..... not good.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Really does clean better then a tooth brush however, they really need to come up with a better size bottle for foam.</li>
    <li> I hate mint, so that rules out most toothpaste and mouthwash. I also have a lot of sinus issues, so that doesn&#x27;t help anything.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using the standard plastic scrapers before, and they worked alright.&lt;br /&gt;After using the orabrush cleaner just once, my gf immediately noticed much, much better breath (independently, didn&#x27;t know anything had changed).&lt;br /&gt;The brushes definitely scrub deeper on the tongue. And since the scraper is smaller, you can scrape more surfaces of the tongue. With the standard plastic one, the effective scraping is really only in the middle. But the orabrush enables you to scrape effectively over the entire top surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gets my two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Very  nice. Cleans tongue well.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, it is soft and after using it with the foam you feel your tongue is fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it a week ago and I would recommended it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Good product indeed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $4 (w/o the tongue foam) at Wal-mart because my wife wanted to solve her bad breath problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it out as well and after I used it once, I didn&#x27;t feel or notice anything different. In fact, I didn&#x27;t see any gunk that others have mentioned from their use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble justifying that this costs more than a decent toothbrush and if you don&#x27;t have bad breath, I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just continue brushing 2x a day and floss daily and you&#x27;ll be set just like me.</li>
    <li> I love my Orabrush and tongue foam. It doubles as a tongue scraper which allow me to completely clean my tongue. Also the flat shape prevents gagging when reaching to the back of my tongue. The foam is pleasant tasting and it works.[[ASIN:B006YPXACU Orabrush Tongue Cleaner with Tongue Foam]]</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t leave the bathroom without brushing my tongue. Otherwise, I won&#x27;t talk unless I&#x27;m at least two feet away from someone! Now, using a toothbrush on your tongue sometimes doesn&#x27;t feel like the most hygienic thing, does it? That nasty white stuff gets stuck in the brush if you don&#x27;t clean it well enough! Not only does it clean your tongue better, it cleans off better. Another point, sometimes brushing your tongue is a little painful after eating fruits like pineapple or kiwis; or if you burn your tongue! This Orabrush is gentle enough to not irritate a raw tongue, but it still gets the job done, better even :) Those long, soft bristles really get in between those taste buds.</li>
    <li> This product does clean your tongue, but so does your toothbrush. I do both now just because I&#x27;m obsessive compulsive about my breath - but it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference even with the cleansing foam.</li>
    <li> I bought my entire family an Orabrush to use (got the 4 pack), and I started using mine right away.  I love the way it makes my mouth feel so clean when I&#x27;m through using it!  Just using my toothbrush on my teeth and tongue doesn&#x27;t do as well.  The Orabrush foam is very tasty and light and easily rinses away, leaving my tongue minty fresh and clean.  I highly recommend this product, especially for those who have problems with their breath due to allergies, like me.</li>
    <li> I tried orabrush because their video got me pumped! I think it does what they claim and it helps fight bad breath, and if it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m at least enjoying the use of my orabrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science in the video was enough to convince me to try it out.</li>
    <li> I was genuinely excited about the Orabrush. I will say this. It does work. However the only problem is that if you have a crazy gag reflex like me, a tongue brush is going to be torturous. The tongue foam does keep my mouth feeling clean at least a few hours longer than just brushing my teeth. Why do I give 4 stars? Well, because gagging isn&#x27;t fun for one, and the pump on the foam dispenser tends to leak. Its not a good seal. Other than those two qualms, its a nice product.</li>
    <li> Perhaps its just me but I stopped using this after a few months of use because frankly, I&#x27;m not sure if it works. I brushed following the instructions but didn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; feeling afterwards. I used it regularly but can&#x27;t be sure if the result is there.</li>
    <li> Never used a tongue scraper, everyone said that toothbrush works. Not true, tried it with only 3-4 brushes and used the scraper and this nasty white saliva mucus stuff came out of my tongue! Gross, but better down the sink then on my tongue.</li>
    <li> Best product to keep your toung clean and refreshing long lasting breath. I certainly recommend for the whole family dental care.</li>
    <li> I have heard for years that you should clean your tongue so I got this. It does work. My breath is better, and plaque does not build up on my teeth as quickly. Just incorporate the use of the tongue cleaner into your dental regiment and it will improve the effectiveness of all your other dental products. It is not a miracle cure for anything but it helps.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying this product but at such a great price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  I was using a tongue scraper before and thought this would be less effective but I was sure wrong!  It is very easy to use and I am completely satisfied with the results.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> These things not only make your mouth feel a whole lot cleaner and your breath fresher, but they have also helped with preventing illness.  My wife works in a hospital, and we were constantly getting sick every other month or so with the various bugs she would be bringing home on her clothes.  Ever since getting the orabrushes 3 years ago or so, neither one of us can remember the last time we got sick.  They last a long time too, our first ones lasted us 3 years, and I just ordered replacements, although I could have easily kept using my old one.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, didn&#x27;t work as well as the tung brushes I&#x27;ve used for years. Too soft for me,it&#x27;s comfortable to use,just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Provides temporary relief for bad breath. This is not a cure all. I&#x27;m starting to think you need a combination of treatments for fresher breath.</li>
    <li> This product takes a while to get used to but it performs as advertised.  I noticed a significant decrease in plaque and use it twice daily now.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!! Please start selling in France!!</li>
    <li> Since I started using the Orabrush my mouth has been cleaner, my breath is fresher and I&#x27;m a whole lot happier! Everyone should have an Orabrush as much as they have a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> This thing really cleans your tongue. I use it twice a day after brushing and noticed a different in a couple days. Great to use before and social activity to keep your breathe from smelling bad.</li>
    <li> For years I have been experiencing dry breath, especially in the morning. I would often try to cover it up with either gum, mouthwash, or even food! Honestly it was quite embarressing because I was self conscious sometimes when I would be talking to someone wondering if my breath stunk! All of the dentists I went to said I have one of the cleanest teeth they had ever seen, so I couldnt figure out why my mouth still got dry and stail. About a year ago I purchased the Dr. Tungs stainless steel tounge cleaner and that worked fine, but it was sort of awkward because of the shape. When I saw this advertisement I honestly thought it was an exaggeration, but after I suffered the embarressment of my fiance handing me a piece of gum in church(After I ate and brushed my teeth) I thought what the heck I need to try something different. I received the product two days ago and I have to say it works quite amazingly. For the past two days I have had the freshest breath ever and I never thought anyone could have decent morning breath, but I still can feel the freshness of it the day before! Im not sure exactly what the foam does, but it tastes good and keeps my breath fresh. I would recommend this product to anyone who experiences dry breath.</li>
    <li> The Orabrush was a great addition to my dental hygiene routine! My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean without using it daily! When you use the Orabrush, you can taste the difference, smell the difference, and the most noticably, SEE what was sitting on your tongue! There is so much nasty build up there that you just can&#x27;t get off with a tooth brush. Definitely, DEFINITELY recommend this!</li>
    <li> Orabrush got rid of my bad breath and now I&#x27;m recommending it to everyone I know! Thank you! I also love your you-tube video and entire story!</li>
    <li> I never thought that using a specific &#x27;tongue cleaner&#x27; would be different to brushing my tongue with my toothbrush but it is completely different! If it hadn&#x27;t been for seeing this one on facebook I would never have tried it, but I love mine. I would highly recommend this, if you tend to wretch when you brush your tongue, this doesn&#x27;t seem to make me and I usually do.</li>
    <li> Orabrush is awesome for removing germs and bacteria on the tongue. Bad breath is a thing of the past. Orabrush did such a great job, I wonder if they could make something designed specifically for the roof of the mouth...Thanks Orabrush</li>
    <li> I first saw this product in the video given in a marketing seminar. I am always conscious of having fresh breath, so I thought I would give it a try. I really like it and learned why it is important to not only have a clean mouth, but a clean tongue. It&#x27;s not just socially accepatable, it is a way to be even healthier! Great product!</li>
    <li> Since using the orabrush I am more confident about myself. This product is truly worth the money! I love it! It really works!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I each ordered an orabrush after seeing a review on youtube.  I am a dental hygienist, and I absolutely love it; I have been recommending it to my patients, because many of them need it! My daughter loves it too, she takes it everywhere she goes (well, not exactly everywhere, but she does take it many places) It seems very effective for removing debris from the tongue and I love the way it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Orabrush Tongue Cleaner with Tongue Foam is the most amazing product I have ever tried. It changed my life. Now I show more confidence because I feel that my breath is always fresh.</li>
    <li> At the beginning I wanted to find a replacement of my old tongue scraper, which head was made by rubber, clean and comfortable, however failed to find or not available in the market anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product through internet, then I ordered 2 pcs.  I found the soft plastic texture is too soft for me, and the built in scraper at the back is made by same material but too hard, because my tongue was hurt when I scrapped my tongue.  If the built in scraper can be improved that the material replaced by rubber. Then this product is perfect. However, I watched the promotional video in your website that the guy is holding the one which is similiar to what I want - the built in scraper looks like rubber, and not the same as I bought from you.  Could you pls clarify if you had modified your product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my opinion help.</li>
    <li> so I watched the Orabrush ad after clicking on it on YouTube. And Oh boy did I get exited about getting one. and so I did! because I thought I&#x27;ve tried other products to kill bad breath causing bacteria before, which cost a ton! man! and which did not work for me! so I said \\&quot;why not give this Orabrush product a shot!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s how I went about getting it. and I got a deal of course! when I was ordering and got the tongue foam for free, which is awesome. And now to the point: I have used the tongue cleaner for about a month now along with the tongue foam and thought of it as a fair product, better than other tongue scrappers I&#x27;ve used, but not good enough. When suddenly one day, about 3 days ago, I realized the Orabrush tongue cleaner had a little build-in scrapper which prevents the brushes next to it from working. So what I did to solve this problem was awesome! I got a sharp blade and cut out the build-in scrapper from the Orabrush and voila baby! it worked for me beautifully. I just Like it. I like it a lot NOW! because the Orabrush works at 100% and do effectively brush away bacteria from my tongue. Just for the Emphasis of this statement here&#x27;s how you can picture it. My tongue looks white right after I wake up and get ready for the day and when I finish brushing my tongue with my custom-cut Orabrush my tongue turns pink and I am happy to see this result. I recommend cutting off the scrapper off the Orabrush to anyone who wants the most out of this great Product.</li>
    <li> I have used my Orabrush only a few times, but so far I have been satisfied with the result! It actually makes me feel a bit more comfortable in social situations knowing that I have used my Orabrush.&lt;br /&gt;But I do think the Orabrush could get even better. I would like to have the \\&quot;scraper\\&quot;(?) on one side and the actual brush on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;I also think the brush is very soft, perhaps a bit too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thanks for a good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria, Finland</li>
    <li> Thanks Orabrush ! after recent radiation treatments for neck cancer my taste buds were slow to return, I had just about given up hope for a faster recovery when I found out about Orabrush, for all those people out there trying to recover from head or neck cancers here is a way to help snap your taste buds back to attention, and get some taste back in your meals sooner than you expected.</li>
    <li> I heard about Orabrush through a daily vlog that I follow and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I got it free and purchased some tongue foam to go along with it. I have to say that I love the way that it makes my mouth feel so fresh and clean! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to using regular toothpaste and a toothbrush or mouth wash. It doesn&#x27;t leave such a harsh taste in your mouth like the alternatives do.</li>
    <li> Orabrush really works. The first time I used it I could instantly feel a clean sensation in my in my mouth.</li>
    <li> After having paid a fortune in postage I was positively surprised about the effect of the Orabrush. It does improve your breath heaps, especially in the morning which results in a fantastic xxx life!! (kidding, just hoping to get a free Orabrush for this comment).</li>
    <li> The orabrush itself is great. It really helps keep bad breath away, but I am not as impressed with the foam. It works okay, but to be honest there is a better product available. The TUNG Gel that I bought at the same time works much better. I have tried it with water, the foam and the gel, and the gel gets your tongue cleaner, but it seems to last longer as well.</li>
    <li> Note: Still quite a new user. Only a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the spoon-test, and seems to work. Toungue not as pink as I&#x27;d hoped, but at least the breath is taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still have a gag-reflex, but experimentation has made it easier to cope with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the Orabrush...I couldn&#x27;t see how this simple brush was going to do a better job than just my toothbrush alone.  Man was I wrong.  It works!  I use I t everyday, and I know my wife is thankful for that ( I know I appreciate it when she kills her not-so-pleasant breath in the morning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, the Orabrush is inexpensive, stylish and IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> The item is okay. It&#x27;s really nothing my regular toothbrush can&#x27;t do. The platform is a little wide so I can&#x27;t completely brush the very back of my tongue. The foam is great though. But we&#x27;re reviewing the orabrush, not the foam.</li>
    <li> This the one that works well, Try other tongue scraper before with poor result, the design, the brushes is smooth and does what is&#x27;t supose to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the orabrush  cleaner it&#x27; remove the white stuff on my tongue,&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day for complete oral cleanup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultra soft bristles clean where other fails, Like more when use with&lt;br /&gt;mint cleaner.</li>
    <li> The brush is VERY soft.  It feels good against my tongue because it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive like a toothbrush.  Also, you can use it farther back on your tongue where the germs congregate the most.  I love the taste of the foam.  My mouth is left feeling clean and minty fresh.  I am VERY, VERY happy with these products.  I can assure you that I will remain a customer!</li>
    <li> In general I love tongue cleaners, they are an essential part of my dental hygeine. I&#x27;ve been using these particular tongue cleaners for a year (since my favorite tongue cleaner was discontinued). I cannot give this product more than 2 stars because I feel this cleaner does an average job. Does it clean your tongue? Yes it&#x27;s a tongue cleaner. Something is MUCH better than nothing.    The one thing I love is the handle. It has a wonderful shape that holds my fingers comfortably wothout being ackward. Its a tongue cleaner, my favorite thing should not be the handle.    With this particular tongue cleaner, I find it nearly impossible to get to the very back of my tongue without completely gagging myself. This is a huge issu for me that bc so much bacteria resides in the back of the tongue and throat. The outside lip of the tongue cleaner is much wider than it needs to be and gives unnecesary bulkiness to this product (most likely the reason I gag). Also the thickness of the lip makes it hard to get a close tongue scrap. For example: I have to press down with a moderate amount of pressure and go over each area 5x times to get the same type of clean I could achieve in 1 scrape with the other cleaner. Can you imagine my disappointment? I&#x27;m very meticulous so I make it work, but I&#x27;m avidly on the search for a new product.</li>
    <li> The Orabrush cleans so much crap that is stuck on your tongue! The stuff that comes of (trust me) is sooo gross. I&#x27;m glad I got this ;) recommended!!</li>
    <li> The orabrush worked. It cleaned my tongue well and helped with bad breath. However, when getting that good clean, I was opening my mouth pretty wide (granted I might just be doing it wrong :/ ) and I ended up straining my temporal mandibular muscle. After a week of ibuprofen and jaw stiffness, I would just recommend that you be careful. Don&#x27;t open your mouth too wide and if it starts to hurt, stop.</li>
    <li> I really like the product and the foam serves as a nice minty refresher for your tongue. It complements the oral routine I have.</li>
    <li> I came across the product,ORABRUSH, through some beauty gurus on YOUTUBE. I started watching some reviews online and the people were giving positibe feedback so I decided why not? Now that I&#x27;ve tried it I can no longer live without using this on a daily basis. I highly recommend people with braces like myself because it&#x27;s already hard enough to keep your mouth clean and this improves it greatly! TRUST ME! Very easy to use, not expensive at all, and very effective! I also recommend purchasing the foam cleanser because it is minty and leaves your breath fresh (:</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Has a scraper on the end .. Lets ya scrape all the nasties :) -- works great!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought lots of scrapers over the years but have found none as awesome as this.  Finally someone gets it right!! :):)</li>
    <li> Ive seen videos of others using the orabrush, and saw how much gunk its supposed to remove from your tongue. When i got mine and tried it, it didnt seem to work. I took several swipes with it and it didnt take anything off. My tongue didnt look any cleaner...however my tongue doesnt seem that dirty to begin with, so its hard to tell if my tongue is already clean or if the product doesnt work.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have tried for tongue cleaning. I am sensitive to SLS and many chemicals but the foam cleaner is amazing. It works and does not cause an allergic reaction or heartburn like most tooth pastes do. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I like this thing. I was a bit skeptical about using it but now that I own it - I love it. And it works. The foam seems like it will last a very long time. One or two drops is a very small amount. It makes my tongue look better and my breath fresher. Feels good too. I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> The Orabrush is simply AMAZING. I never realized how much cleaner my mouth could be after a good brushing. With the Orabrush, I have the cleanest mouth ever! It just feels better and makes me want to smile more often. I highly recommend this product, especially if you are trying to get rid of bad breath! 5 stars! :)</li>
    <li> The scrapper is nice, and I feel like it does a nice job getting the crud off my tongue.  The included foam tastes very bad.  I used it for about a week and could not take it.  In the trash it went, it had a strange salty taste, but as we all know everyone likes something different.  So you could all like the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars because the scrubber was works very well and I can&#x27;t think of one thing to say negative about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone</li>
    <li> Good product for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> For a while I&#x27;ve known that my toothbrush was definitely not doing the job in getting my tongue clean. So when I saw Orabrush, it seemed like the obvious solution: I needed a brush specifically designed for my tongue in order to get the clean mouth and clean breath feeling I&#x27;ve wanted for so long. I can say that the Orabrush has definitely exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;m a huge fan! The bristles are just soft enough to be sensitive to your tongue but just firm enough to be able to scrub the grossness away. The tongue foam is a must have with this product too, as they work all too well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been just slightly sad at the longevity of the product. I&#x27;ve been using this brush for just about a month, and it&#x27;s starting to show some signs that I should use a different one. I wish it would last longer, but other than that, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> This product looked amazing and the reviews mostly only had good things to say. I use the tongue foam and orabrush thoroughly twice a day just like it says. However, it did nothing for me. I have fairly gross breath-trust me. I brush, floss, use mouthwash, and chew gum and my breath still stinks. I was hopeful that this would finally be the answer. Don&#x27;t get to excited.</li>
    <li> It really is just like the commercial says. It works well, and cleans efficiently. Definitely get it with the Tongue foam.</li>
    <li> this brush does a marvelous job on the tongue .my husband a smoker i gave him 2 and kept 2 for myself..I can&#x27;t smell that stale odor that lingers  in his mouth nor taste that cigarette taste when he kisses me. yes 2thumbs up...kiss kiss</li>
    <li> I had been using the same metal tongue scraper for the past 6 years and I decided to give the Orabrush a try. I saw the commercial for it about 2 years ago and I finally gave it a shot about 3 weeks ago. The main reason why I bought it was the proclamation from Orabrush that the soft bristles would catch food particles, saliva and bacteria that a regular tongue scraper wasnt&#x27;t - one problem - the soft bristles are delicate and, in my case, the bristles are already falling away from the base. I would expect the bristles to last 3 months not 3 weeks. Maybe the best that anyone can do is create a really good tongue scraper, the bristles are a waste.</li>
    <li> This product is literally amazing. I can already feel a huge difference of cleanliness in my mouth! I love it!</li>
    <li> After using my Orabrush for the first week and taking pictures each day, I have seen a dramatic change in my tongue brightness and amount of pink vs. white gunk. This really works! The tongue foam is a great taste for after you brush your teeth with its light mint after taste and makes your tongue feel like it can taste fresh air. I must warn you all beforehand, at then end of scratching your tongue with the fibers, you must roughly scrape forward with the tongue scraper and voila! All of the crap that&#x27;s been collecting on your tongue during your 8 hour sleep is now on your Orabrush.</li>
    <li> Great Tongue Cleaner. It has a scraper on the back so you can brush and scrape your tongue with it. The foam is great too, it doesn&#x27;t have a super strong mint flavor to it but when I&#x27;m done it gives me a clean feeling. This will be replacing my standard tongue scraper and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been used this tongue cleaner for years...I love it. It s work!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for good product :)</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product if you enjoy having a super clean mouth.</li>
    <li> exactly what it says it is, arrived quickly and it does the job</li>
    <li> Was not what it was purported to be and I would never buy it again. I thought I was buying for my dog and the little brush they sent was not was it showed on the product and was way too tiny for my 70 lbs dogs</li>
    <li> I use this to brush my tongue twice a day after I brush my teeth and before I floss and mouthwash. I have never had such fresh breath, now im not afraid to talk to people without being afraid that my breath stinks!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to get rid of the guck on my tongue in the morning.  Works great and will buy another one when needed.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t care for the tongue cleaner, i find it a bit painful, and the bristols don&#x27;t seem to get in the cracks of the tongue as they advertise, i prefer a table spoon. tongue foam seems to hurt a sensitive gum, so i don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but this product did not meet my expectations. I would not order it again. I think you need to go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> keeps my tounge nice and pink and muh breath from havin a wicked stank</li>
    <li> The Orabrush cleans the tongue differently from a scraper, and its flat shape allows you to clean further back without eliciting a gagging reflex. The foam has a very pleasant flavor and I think it works better than mouth rinses. Based on family feedback it seems to make quite a big difference for bad breath.</li>
    <li> I found that I have some green stuff growing on my tongue, so I bought this brush at a store to get rid of it. The green stuff is still there but but does look neater and more cultivated. I am wondering if I put my tongue under a light would the green stuff conduct photosynthesis? I know that it would be wicked cool, but also a little gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am brushing three times a day, and although the green stuff is not going away it is looking nicer like a well manicured lawn.</li>
    <li> The Orabrush tongue cleaner did scrap stuff off the tongue, but I did not feel it made my breath fresh or even eliminate bad breath.</li>
    <li> The Brush has been Great! Really works well...Buy two or more they do ware out after a while. Don&#x27;t buy the spray it is too watery and doesn&#x27;t stay on the brush. I found a tube of &amp;#34;Toung&amp;#34; gel for $2 at big lot&#x27;s in town that works great! I finally have a way to kill bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Like they say, you don&#x27;t need to brush your tongue too hard.</li>
    <li> I underestimated this brush when I first heard of it. After looking at reviews I&#x27;ve decided to give in. I&#x27;m pleased to say that the orabrush works efficiently. It scraps off every gunk-y particle on your tongue and leaves your breathe extra fresh after routine brushing. Great buy</li>
    <li> As an always-curious consumer, I was eager to try this product, but was a little bit skeptical about its effectiveness. Well, a few nights ago, I put it to the true test. I made a salad for dinner with big ol&#x27; hunks of raw red onion in it. That night, I brushed my teeth, but forgot to use my Orabrush. The next morning I woke up feeling like a red onion was camping out in my mouth. So I got up, brushed my teeth, and used the Orabrush on my tongue. Voila! No more onion breath-- it was gone right away.</li>
    <li> Great product! It helped me to get rid of bad breath just in a few steps. I strongly recommend this thing! Thank you Oralbrush!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! My boyfriend and I have no complaints! I recommend this product to anyone that wants to have fresh smelling breath!</li>
    <li> I am using product past 10 days but its not proving to be effective for me. Really life is same with orabrush. I am tired of my bad breath. Please help</li>
    <li> I was not expecting the Orabrush to be that effective, but it really works.. It makes my mouth feel extra clean! I love this product.. I hope it stays around forever because I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it now. It&#x27;s become part of my daily oral routine. Love :)</li>
    <li> Was worried about condition of my tongue but Orabrush has helped clean it and I like the outcome. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The tongue foam works good for geographic tongue. It won&#x27;t get rid of it completely but it definitely makes a difference.You have to use it every day though and maybe even twice a day. Worth it though and not expensive plus you can get it at walmart for about 5 bucks.</li>
