<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product, thanks.</li>
    <li> It  makes my scalp so greasy and I have had no sign of new hair growth, so will not be ordering any more.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  It is very thick and has a &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; aroma.  The product arrived in time.  My hair is braided and I used this around my hair line to prevent breakage.  I will say I did see a length difference.  It keeps my hair hair well conditioned.</li>
    <li> This is a good product in my opinion. The only critical feedback I have is that it is very thick, so daily use is impossible without washing my hair daily. The bottle is rock hard so its difficult to use too much of the product, so over use isn&#x27;t the issue.Hoping they make a similar version with oil that is healthy and absorbable but light and not as oily. Otherwise, I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Used this and it&#x27;s ok, I think it helps but bottle is small and I would like to buy more to continue use but it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product but it&#x27;s just way too greasy for my type of hair which is fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It does everything that it claims and more!</li>
    <li> I thought I was receiving 3 bottles.  I don&#x27;t know if it works since I&#x27;ve just received it.. Very small for the price</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for only a week so obviously I am not seeing anything yet. I will continue to use daily and update my review if I see any changes.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair...wanted something that was natural and had great reviews.  BeanStalk is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;....while I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks, faithfully I might add...I have not noticed a HUGE blast of hair growth, but I HAVE noticed my hair does appear to be a little thicker.  I am going to my Salon next week and I think for me, the real test will be IF my hair stylist notices anything new! Regardless....I am already on my second bottle of the product...I&#x27;m going to give it a few more months to see for sure :)</li>
    <li> I like it my hair is starting to grow and looks a lot thicker so I&#x27;ve been massaging more now and it seems to have been waking up my roots so I want to say it grow half an inch in a week. So I recommend it too people who want a quick result.</li>
    <li> This oil is very thick and has a &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; aroma. It makes my scalp so greasy and I have had no sign of new hair growth. As per the picture I thought I was receiving 3 bottles, but, only received one small bottle for the price.  It would of been easier if the bottle came with a dropper as it shows on picture.</li>
    <li> Makes the hair grow fast. I&#x27;m amazed. The thinning has stopped. Thank you for such a great product!!!!</li>
    <li> The best product for edge hair. After use it for 2 weeks I started seing hair growing on my hair line. Sticky, smelly but I&#x27;m getting my hair&#x27;s line back. Only using it 3 times a week, the night before I&#x27;ll wash my head. Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive but it works and it last. I went from bold to hairy.</li>
    <li> Toooooooo heavy and greasy! Feels like petroleum is main ingredient!</li>
    <li> Have not notice any hair growth as of yet. will keep using it</li>
    <li> Only just after 2 week using BeanStalk I need to tighten my braids so much new growth. You have to try BeanStalk this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> I am giving this product three stars because the advertisement is deceiving. You only get one bottle not three. The product comes with no instructions. The bottle is very small and is only 1/2 full. I do not yet know if it works because I do not know how to apply it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, but they don&#x27;t give you nearly enough for the price. You wold have spend a pretty penny to have a month&#x27;s supply. So I am not sure if I will buy it again because I need more than they are giving.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Well I just got mine today and I&#x27;m hoping that it do something good for my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother - in- law.  Can&#x27;t wait to see him open the X&#x27;mas gift and try it~</li>
    <li> Only used for 1 week. Yes, it has an odor, but that doesnt bother me. The description says price slashes 55%. That is not true. The price has gone up $5 since I purchased it. I can wait to see if it works and hopefully another sale because it is too thick to get out 1 drop. I need more!</li>
    <li> The oil is too  heavy and interferes with hair styling.  I can only put it on my scalp when I&#x27;m taking a shower the next morning.  I expected three vials (as pictured) and only received one.</li>
    <li> This oil is really sticky and I&#x27;m not even sure How to use it. It does not come with instructions. I do not recommend. I&#x27;ve used it faithfully since I&#x27;ve gotten it and no results. Not worth it to use it anymore since it makes your hair feel weird and oily.</li>
    <li> a little bit sticky, kind of applying honey to my hair,  No funny smell ~</li>
    <li> too sticky,and you only get one bottle not 3</li>
    <li> My hair is very short and I have bald spots everyone. My hair also does not appear together but are separated into tiny little thread like clumps that breaks off easily and is very dry. One thing I noticed about this product is that it moisturizes very well and helps to keep my hair strands together so that they do not look frizzy and clumped. I wish however that the manufacturers will make a bigger bottle. The amount in the bottle is too small for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using it, haven&#x27;t see any result yet .</li>
    <li> Good one to use with no strong smell. Not showing sign of strong growth since i only use one bottle but so far I like the item</li>
    <li> I love the product.  I have had an area in the top of my head that just refused to grow.  I have been using Beanstalk for about a month and this is the most hair I have had in that spot in about 2 years.  I will continue to purchase and use it faithfully.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working great! Was disappointed that it was out of stock but happened to log on 2 weeks ago and was able to purchase! Awesome product!  Keep it in stock please!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was okay..to small of amount to be effective....</li>
    <li> Used one bottle haven&#x27;t see any results one month in</li>
    <li> Small change but not sure it&#x27;s helping..</li>
    <li> Great product....it arrived early. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I used beanstalk for about two weeks straight, and now I just do it about once or twice a week because I forget; ever since I&#x27;ve used it though, My hair is crazy healthy! It might not be growing like I would like, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not doing it as much as I should. But just using it once or twice a week strengthens my hair, it&#x27;s a lot thicker too! When I did keep up on it every day, (I would just sleep with it in at night and than wash it out or condition it out) I noticed that it grew a lot! But when I don&#x27;t use it every day I notice the next week it doesn&#x27;t grow as fast as the week before. But, I&#x27;m in love with beanstalk! I had to shave my head and start over a few months ago and I just found it online a few weeks ago and beanstalk is just getting me through these tough times!! (:</li>
    <li> Great product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Junk...just castor oil...my scalp is red in the areas where I used it...</li>
    <li> This product was difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t seen any changes</li>
    <li> too small for the prioce</li>
    <li> Its 2 strong it took my hair out</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant about this product since I have purchased others that made the same claim which I had with no results. This is different, it really works. I had lost hair around my edges due to excessive braiding and low iron levels. My iron levels were corrected four years ago but my dermatologist said my hair was dormant and could take years to come out of that phase. I used braiding as a way to mange this phase but the braiders were braiding too tight. The first two weeks after using this product, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it were working or not. The third week I could see hair growing in the spot I focused on. Now there is measurable hair in that spot. No other product has done this. As others have mentioned, there&#x27;re is a smell but it is not too bad. My only complaints are the bottle I was sent has a twist top that you have to squeeze the oil through onto your hair. The bottle is very hard to use and would be better if it we in a bottle with a dropper like was advertised. The other complaint is I wish the cost were lower but the oil is lasting a long time since I use it twice a day (most days).</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product for my hair.  I use it for my  eyebrow and eyelash. It&#x27;s seems work out.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My hair is so manageable since I&#x27;ve started using the product. I even think my hair had grown about an inch i will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I used this product for three months and i didn&#x27;t notice any change. Too much money for a small bottle. The shipping was excellent always arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my fiance&#x27;s hair. He has a area in the front of his head that has been slowly thinning. After 3 weeks of using this 3-4 times a week his thin spot has almost filled in, almost looks like the rest of his thick coarse hair. Just make sure you water and massage your scalp daily.</li>
    <li> Great product. First, I recommend using it every few days as it is thicker solution. Just a little goes a long way. I massaged it into my scalp and at the roots in hopes to help with my damaged hair. I have noticed that my hair hasn&#x27;t been breaking as much as it has been. Second, I use the infusion after washing my hair. I towel dry my hair so that it is damp and not dripping wet. I found that it applies better. I like that it is more on the natural end and no harmful chemicals. The scent is not pleasant but it is tolerable. I am trying to get my dad to use some, so hopefully next time I see him, I can share with him so he can test it out, and maybe thicken up his thinning hair. I will update more after using it longer. But so far so good.</li>
    <li> Shipped quick and seems to work well. Have not had too much time to test but it does make my hair feel really soft. Looking forward to seeing results.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t grown my hair yet but a little goes a long way. My scalp is moisturized and thank goodness it does not have an odor. It works well with my other products. I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a couple of weeks . The smell is not great, but my hair seems to feel softer and appears a little fuller.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see this product available on here; this is my fourth bottle! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a master license cosmetologist.  I have a few clients dealing with moderate alopecia or severe hair because of improper braids and  weaves. My clients are amazed. I will be ordering this in large quantities.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;B.J.Williams</li>
    <li> Why would you put a picture of 3 bottles when in fact you only get one.  Very disappointed.  I would have bought anyway to try..  Just seems like false advertising to me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really notice any big difference as of yet. The product is very thick, but you need to be careful not to waste it on your clothes. Each time I have applied it I have some how managed to get a drop on my shirt...no matter how careful I have been. I&#x27;ll give another update after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This product you can actually feel working and I like the fact that it&#x27;s safe for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say it&#x27;s working in thickness and my hair feels fuller. I can&#x27;t wait to see the length change. Hopefully soon. I even bought a second bottle today..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I def see some positive results. I would like to use it for a little while longer before I leave a more detailed review but so far I am pleased with this product and look forward to making another purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m noticing the difference</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if product work, but please advertise one bottle instead of three, since you only get one bottle. The bottle was only half way, instead of full. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have used the product a few times. I see less hair in the drain. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase .</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  The bottle is very small.  The oil is very heavy. It is insufficient (for me) to use just 1 or 2 drops in your scalp - per the instructions.  No change in my hair condition yet.  I am confused by the dispenser...</li>
    <li> This Product BeanStalk Hair Growth Infusion the results are none totally a misrepresentation of what the product maker claimed this product doesn&#x27;t do anything, it&#x27;s messy and difficult to wash off. It&#x27;s a waste of money and irreplaceable time.</li>
    <li> WOW! Where do I start? My hair is showing vast improvement.I can see hair beinning to grow where it was totally bald scalp showing.I was diagnosed with alopecia areata two years ago.I had tried EVERYTHING or so I thought. I have been using Beanstalk for one month and its awsome! I can&#x27;t believe one tiny bottle can reverse two years of pain and struggle. I have replaced every hair care item with Beanstalk and I use ONLY Beanstalk products.</li>
    <li> Very oily, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Well, obviously this stuff isn&#x27;t something you can quickly review, because it takes time to work. That being said, I&#x27;ll review what I know: it doesn&#x27;t smell weird, leave a residue on the pillow and my husband likes it. Time will tell if it works, but we&#x27;re hopeful!</li>
    <li> Just received this product &amp; have high hopes after reading the good reviews. I plan to use in addition to Pura D&#x27;or shampoo - which has been moderately helpful with thickening and speeding up growth.  Hoping this product will help give it an extra boost - I lost a lot of hair after pregnancy and then more with a lupus flare.  Plan to update this review with results after consistent use.</li>
    <li> This item works great! I can already tell this is not only regrowing lost hair, but adding a bit of volume. From the other reviews, I would say the smell is a little off putting, but there are a couple ways to dull the smell down to something more tolerable. A lot of reviewers are adding that when you put this with a little bit of conditioner, it helps drastically. I&#x27;m not sure if this dulls the effect of this serum, so I would recommend putting it on your scalp alone.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product long enough to provide a proper review.</li>
    <li> Poor packaging, came to me leaking from the cap ! Tossed this leaky mess right out !</li>
    <li> it isn&#x27;t making make hair grow, so I guess it is not stimulating my hair follicles. I bought two bottle I am not convinced it works.</li>
    <li> well if my hair isn&#x27;t growing back at least its stopped falling</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:869682d9f324a639fb9688c32b693cc3]] I started using this product years ago and recently went back to it after a terrible haircut.  So glad I did.  It makes the inversion method for hair growth work even better!</li>
    <li> extremely disappointed, I actually opened the wrapping this time and there was the oil leaking EVERYWHERE. Also, it makes my room smell like an old woman. I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product at all please save your money, I wish I did</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft, stop the itching and helped my hair to grow.</li>
    <li> great product with great results!!!</li>
    <li> To be honest i have not seen any difference yet... I am using it once a day at night. I use 2 drops on 3 different areas (from the crown towards my forehead). I massage my scalp for around 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My wife says that she can start noticing some difference but maybe she is just being nice to me.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it until I finish the bottle wihout worrying too much. i will take a picture and compare it to the first one to took when I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, its been a while (august 2015) and I admit I have not used it every day. However, i almost finished the first bottle and to be honest, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. My wife does though... She says that my hair looks thicker on the top side... Maybe she wants to make me feel good!!&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how to rate it... I think I will give it try maybe with another bottle and continue this review in a few months.</li>
    <li> Super quick delivery. Im balding on top of my head and used this every day and every night before going to bed. And notice tiny hairs growing out. My hair is thick and strong now! No more hair falls in the shower and hwhile combing! . Got this item for honest review.</li>
    <li> This has some really good ingredients that I had found earlier from doing scalp growth searches on the internet. It has some other good ingredients that are also not listed on this website. But the bottle is so little that I only got 1 1/2 application out of it. So I only buy and use this every once in a while, and the other times I use other scalp serums. So I couldn&#x27;t tell if this particular product is working, since I use so many different products. It is also quite thick and sticky, so I had to put it in a small bottle and pour some oil into it, to mix it together, to make it more liquid so I could apply it to my scalp.</li>
    <li> I am LOVING this stuff. I don&#x27;t have thinning hair, but do use a high lift blonde to lighten every 4 to 5 weeks on my roots. Any lifting of color can be very damaging &amp; can irritate the scalp, so this has been a big help in maintaining my the health of both my hair &amp; sensitive scalp.I have also noticed my roots are showing sooner than usual, which shows the effectiveness of this product for hair growth. I also am impressed by the natural ingredients. I am super sensitive to so many hair products and have so much trouble finding natural hair products without all the chemicals and fragrance that irritate my eczema or give me a hives rash.This one has proved to be chemical free with minimal scent.The only scent i can pick up is a slight castor oil smell that is fine by me because that is natural. I am very HAPPY &amp; am about to order my second bottle!!!!</li>
    <li> I feel that it is working well and it&#x27;s consistency even though is thick does not bother me.</li>
    <li> Not bad after all I purchased my second bottle without the discount</li>
    <li> This product is not as fast acting as others claim. I have used for two weeks now following the end directions closely. I use other essential oils and castor oil so I am familiar with massaging these things ino the scalp. Such a small bottle and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get even a drop out. I have also tried Gro-Aut Oil and Liquid Gold with better success. I stopped using Liquid Gold cause they changed the formula and it smells too much like sulfur now. I recently am using Groveda on one half of my head and this product on the other half. Groveda is working beautifully but I am seeing nothing on the side that I have applied this to. I will not purchase again. I also hate how this pricing fluctuates so much for the entire same amount of ounces. Buy Grove da and I am not a paid spokesperson or anything.</li>
    <li> I would like to first say how wonderful beanstalk hair growth products is as a company.  I just received the package and it was damaged in shipping, it leaked inside the box but still had more than enough for me to try.  I contacted them immedaitely and within an hour recieved a response back saying they will be sending me a new one.  That was very very cool of them, just a great company.  Now I just started using this product so there will be many updates coming in upcoming weeks.  Here are my early observations of this hair product: It is very easy to use unlike other products It doesnt require much of the product to spread to the area needed Unlike other products the stick like feature makes it very easy to apply to the area you want  See you guys in a few weeks with updates on what I hope will be many more hairs!</li>
    <li> I received a discount on this product in return for my review.  I love the way this product smells.  I also like how it has a thick consistency so it doesn&#x27;t drip and get all over the place.  You only use 2 drops so there is quite a bit in the bottle.  So far very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have heard wonderful things about it and it really does work. You apply it to the spots where you would like hair growth and it stimulates the growth. I received a discount for the review of this product and am so happy that i did. I have had some problems with hair thinning and this formula does wonders. The smell is user friendly and provides the customer with a good sensation. I am very pleased with the product and will reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I would recommend it t9 anyone. I give it a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> i just started using this, but it&#x27;s too greasy</li>
    <li> I suffer from alopecia, I decided to purchase this item, only been using it for 2 months, I see a very very small difference, I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Way too thick and greasy to use daily. Difficult to distribute and messy.</li>
    <li> Picture is deceiving it&#x27;s not 3bottles only one and it is extremely small. Just got it and searched the box then called only to find out that it&#x27;s supposed to be ONE!!!  Amazon I&#x27;m disappointed in the false advertising on your site which I trust...... No longer!!!!  Could have easily purchased castor oil for much less and the same  One Beanstalk $20. 10 bottles of castor oil $20.  You decide</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. In 2 weeks it has made my hair thicker and softer. Will definitely purchase again. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have only been using this about three weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the length of my hair.  My hair does look and feel healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a little over a month I believe I&#x27;ve saw results. It absolutely does soothe the scalp,since the cold weather has started I&#x27;ve been doing protective styling and I&#x27;ve been using this to keep my scalp moisturizer and to tame an itch since I&#x27;ve taken down my last style my hair was so big and I believe it was bigger than the last time I took my hair down but I&#x27;ve taken pictures so maybe next month or so I can gauge the growth. I only put 4 stars bc of that reason and my hair grows fast naturally anyways but I do love how it soothes the scalp so I will purchase again :) and I put drops of this in other products I use I think that has/Will help</li>
    <li> ITis good i use 2× a week  but only 1 bottle is not enghou .</li>
    <li> I have had a issue with my edges for years, my hair is typically very fine in those areas. I use one drop on each side nightly and will massage it in to my scalp. The consistency is very thick, like castor oil, and it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh or strong smell. I have noticed the difference and I can see my hair growing in really well in these spots. I&#x27;m glad I made the choice to buy this.</li>
    <li> Small bottle for the price though, so I mix it 50/50 with quality emu oil to stretch it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not actually seen new growth as yet; however, the Pro is,&#x27; I love the texture of my hair after using the product&#x27;, and I will purchase again for that reason alone.  The Con is that, &#x27;I was disappointed with quantity&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.used it for 15 days sn hair&#x27;s falling still ... no new growth!</li>
    <li> My hair grows slow even if I take vitamins. Using this product, I saw a difference in my hair. It is much smoother &amp; I see some growth. The smell is not as pleasant, but it does not bother me much. This product is very sticky as well. Since nothing else has worked for my hair growth, I will be buying again soon!</li>
    <li> Did not grow my hair and yes I used it correctly, clean scalp, massage and still nothing. What a ripoff</li>
    <li> To be honest I bought it due to good reviews. But I don&#x27;t see things happening in my hair. I apply it as directed on the bottle. I rub it 10 minutes into my scalp but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working i guess i will try giving it more time.</li>
    <li> a little goes along way! i have used this product on my scalp when going  natural! usually after shampooing and conditioning (or cowash) my hair looks great but my scalp tends to dry out ...this does just the trick! i also used this prior to flat ironing at the scalp as i dont like alot of oil in my hair and it gave me just the right of moisture i needed as well. will def buy again</li>
    <li> Just ordered, can&#x27;t wait to receive! hoping for great results.</li>
    <li> I used this product in my nape have yet to see any growth but its only been a couple of weeks but I do like the feel of this oil will use this bottle and then come back to review Ok I colored my hair a week ago so now I can tell you this stuff works I have a lot of new growth</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for about a month, it&#x27;s moisturizing on my natural hair and I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all so I would use it again or recommend it to women with dry natural hair. As far as this 150% growth that it advertises as well as its claim to help grow hair due to alopecia I have yet to experience this following my twice a day application and mixing a lil in my deep conditioner. I actually have scarring alopecia in some parts of my hair and traction alopecia on my edges from lace front wigs and I&#x27;ve seen no significant growth on any of these areas. It&#x27;s a small bottle and it&#x27;s only been about a month so it may take longer time to see results.</li>
    <li> This came with no directions. I got a call from the company and that did not seem to help. This is like putting molasses in your hair and they say to work in an amount smaller than a dime over your whole scalp. I am not sure how anyone with HAIR is going to be able to accomplish this. I returned it after trying twice with major frustration. It also smells like tree sap, feels like it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2mo. I have noticed my bald spot starting to fill in with hair.  Please remember to give the product about a fair 3mo. to actually see some good results. It may take your scalp time to adjust to the vitamin boost. I held down the new hair so you could see it because it&#x27;s starting to grow in where you can notice it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost through with my first bottle of this infusion. I can&#x27;t rave about new hair growth although I do feel that my hair is thicker and growing faster where I am applying it. I am thinking of buying my next bottle to continue using the product because I have seen some; although minimal, improvement. The reason I gave it four stars is because I don&#x27;t like the cap on the bottle. It leaks, wasting valuable oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is REALLY thick and sticky. I can&#x27;t really go anywhere once I put it on because it makes my hair look awful. I put it on about 30 minutes before I take a shower and then rinse it out. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference so far.</li>
    <li> its smells good and leaves your hair soft.</li>
    <li> I had 3 inches of growth in the back and 4 inches of growth in the front. This product really does work. Just a little too pricey for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> I thought for the money I spent that 3 bottles would come but it was only one; I probably didn&#x27;t read it correctly but with only one bottle I cant gage whether it worked or not</li>
    <li> Have not notice any hair growth.  I AM ALSO TAKING THE BIOTIN pills.  Suspected some thickening around the edges but haven&#x27;t seen anything.</li>
    <li> Like trying to put syrupy glue on you scalp- Yuk!&lt;br /&gt;I tried, glued my hair together,thought I would have to cut it out of my hair it dried so stiff and thick. hard to shampoo out. Have no idea how it works as I will never put it back on my scalp!</li>
    <li> I am a natural and have been dealing with a balding spot in my crown area for some time. I started using this product 2 weeks ago as directed. Today I noticed hair sprouting out no joke. I will keep you posted on my progress. The quantity could be better. It does has a castor oil smell but not bad. It is not too thick in my hair once I messaged it in.</li>
    <li> It calms my sensitive and very flaky scalps.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay, doesn&#x27;t grow anything!</li>
    <li> I started using this product 30 days ago. I have seen a slight increase in hair growth/thickening. Since it has an oil, sticky residue I apply it after a shower for overnight application. I recommend showering before and after use to prevent hair from looking oily. Works great though; wish the bottle supply was bigger..quite pricey but give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from hair loss for quite some time.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s stress related because of my care giver role which spanned several years.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products with no results.  well, today I am a bean stalk believer.  I have hair growing where there was none.  It&#x27;s not a speedy process but his product is a sure process.  It will take time, but these days time is all I&#x27;ve got.  I&#x27;ve not been given free products for this review.  I have been given visible hope for healthy growing hair.  Put your patience to work, add a couple of months and use BeanStalk.</li>
    <li> I have just started using it. The product is very thick, greasy, but, it seems to be doing the job. My scalp is not as dry before using. I wash my hair with a conditioning shampoo, mix the beanstalk with a good conditioner or either pure protein. After one use, I have noticed the texture of my hair has become a lot thicker. I have places on my head that hasn&#x27;t grown in for years, but, I believe if I keep doing what I am doing and keeping beanstalk in my regimen, I do believe I will get the results I am looking for. Will respond again when I see some results in a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any results from this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.however you must be patient.</li>
    <li> Saw some new growth and my hair texture got thicker</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for a month and a half. We have not noticed any difference. Other reviews mentioned that the product made their hair sticky. We did not notice this. However, my husband does have really short crew cut. He will continue to use this daily till it&#x27;s gone. If anything changes I will update the review.</li>
    <li> It has only been over two weeks and no new hair growth or new follicles. It softens the  scalp and keeps your hair hydrated Many reviewers complained about the smell. I don&#x27;t mind it; it has earthy, medicine like smell but it is not awful. However, I must admit that my hair loss has reduced as evidenced by my comb. I am giving it a three star because I bought it to repair my receding hair line. I have seen no improvement in that regard.</li>
    <li> My edges were thinning and I wouldn&#x27;t dare put my hair in a bun for almost a year. After 2 weeks of using this product I kid you not my edges are filling in. I only use it once a day and a little goes a long way, I only wish it came in a bigger container. I love this oil it worked great for me.</li>
    <li> My first time using it the smell was horrible But it really does work. I use at night when i approach bed time. After  2weeks i seen a fuller hair.before I had very little to no hair there for about 4 years. Now thanks to this product I&#x27;m very Please with it.  Very happy i also got the bottle of pills from  the same product.</li>
    <li> My hair grows slow and lost a lot after I gave birth to my son. Using this product, I saw a difference in my hair. The smell is not as pleasant, but it does not bother me much. This product is very oily so I only use it when I am home.</li>
    <li> It is really thick. Hard to get in your hair to the scalp.  The only way I can use it is to put it in my conditioner and leave it in for a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen really seen a surge in hair growth but my hair is a bit longer than it normally is.</li>
    <li> I have only had it for less than a month. I have not been able t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> No instructions on how to use, then I find out I could of gotten three bottles for a cheaper price than what I paid for one...:/&lt;br /&gt;Did NOT work for me at all.....disappointed</li>
    <li> Gummy. Not easy to use</li>
    <li> Ok.. I was a bid discouraged after I ordered this product. All the reviews I saw on u tube were from the black community.  I wast sure it would work on Caucasian hair.. but I swear on my life my hair has grown an inch in 2 weeks. New hair growth were it was thinning. . This product is amazing amazing I would recommend to anyone. I&#x27;m 29 I just had a baby and my hair was falling out all over the place I mean hand fulls in the shower. I&#x27;m barley loosing any hair in the shower now. Now because of the oily texture of this product I can&#x27;t wear it out during the day. But I put it in at night and  leave it in until I take a shower and I was suprised how easy it was to wash out.. I know lots of mom that loose hair after a baby. I&#x27;m telling all of my friends about this.. it&#x27;s a life changer for sure</li>
    <li> It really works am growing hair in patches that had became clean. And now my hair is starting to grow back. GREAT PRODUCT will order again..........</li>
    <li> let me start off by saying I am NOT I repeat NOT paid to write a review I am a 22 year old male that I was experiencing receding hairline this product is growing back my receding hairline and is growing the rest of my hair like freaking crazy I don&#x27;t have measurements because I haven&#x27;t really recording it but two weeks ago my hair was barely touching my ears well I stay two weeks more like a month and now it&#x27;s touching my earlobes I did not expect this I have used Wild Growth I&#x27;ve used nutri-ox I use his hand pues I use biotin conditioners im use hair scalp treatments everything I can to slow in reverse the process this is really struck gold for me I&#x27;m on my third order and still seeing positive results</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help at all</li>
    <li> I love this product and will continue to use this.  My hair is soft, fuller, and manageable.  I have hair growth and it has only been about a month.</li>
    <li> I am always in search of products, tips, and ideas on how to magnify by natural beauty. One of those products I am always on the hunt for is products for my hair. So needless to say when I saw this I had to try it. I am Hispanic, and my hair is long. My hair is full but easily damaged. Which can cause shedding, breaking, and frizzy hair at times. So I started using this product for several weeks now at night. Just a couple drops at night massaged into my scalp and off to sleep I go. I have noticed more shine, less breakage, less shedding, and more control. Needless to say I am a fan. The key ingredients like Zinc, Biotin,Tea Tree Oil, Vitamin B and Vitamin E are truly infusing my hair with health. Love love it. Glad I glad I received a free sample of this to try. I will soon be buying my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. The serum is extremely thick &amp; heavy on my hair even from just applying it directly to my scalp. Makes my hair very limp &amp; stringy &amp; the smell is less than desirable. Not sure how it would do on my hair growth because I stopped using it after 2 applications. Hopefully they can do something better with this product.</li>
    <li> I have not seen results yet because I just got it but hopefully it will do what it suppose to do for my hair.</li>
    <li> Using product now.  Too soon to notice hair growth.</li>
    <li> Omg. This stuff really works..my husband has thinning hair and in only 2 weeks we see a difference in not only growth but also thickness. I was nervous to buy at first but now I&#x27;m glad I did buy it.  Its a small bottle but a little goes a long way. Looks like I will be using it for a while and definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> a little bit sticky....but so far so good~</li>
    <li> I see a lil new grow has only been one week.</li>
    <li> I used a product for a month and I notice a little hair growth.  The product is a little thicker and heavy for everyday use so I used it every other day in small quantities.  I noticed a little bit of hair growth around the edges of my face.</li>
    <li> this product has a good smell, great texture , only problem is not enough in the bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks, and see a huge difference already!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received my first bottle on Dec 1, 2014 and back then this product had less than 10 reviews. I was desperate to find something that would help my thinning hair, so i gave this a try. When i first bought this product it was $15, and that is a bit high considering the size but i decided to buy good quality products and not be frugal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GENERAL COMMENTS&lt;br /&gt;Initially i noticed the smell, which didn&#x27;t bother me much, since it fades after a few hours and the consistency was very thick so a little goes a long way. Do not use too much or you will weight down your hair with this product and your hair will become sticky. The idea is to apply it as you would lotion, use just enough for the affected area and massage it in thoroughly. I think its an amazing moisturizer, especially for those of us with very dry hair or people living it very dry climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR GROWTH&lt;br /&gt;This product does promote the appearance of healthy hair. I noticed that my hair was more shiny and my scalp absorbed this well.  However i did not see a &amp;#34;150% Boost In Hair Growth in 90 Days&amp;#34; like the product guaranteed. Since everyone&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t grow at the same rate, i postponed writing my review on day 90 to see if prolonged use would give me hair growth results. Unfortunately that is not the case for me as yet; but I will update my review by the end of April if i notice any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE COST&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased four bottles of this product for my hair journey. I would continue to use it, since it is an excellent moisturizer, however the current price is way too high for the size of this product. $20 for one ounce of hair serum is way too expensive. If you are like me and apply this product to your entire head it will not last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide my final update in April (which will make it 5 months using this product). At that time, if the price still isn&#x27;t within my budget i will switch to a mixture of emu oil and castor oil in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Just started using the product and I don&#x27;t really see any growth</li>
    <li> Have been using once a day for about two weeks.  I was diagnosed with frontal fibrosing alopecia, so I was looking for something to work in conjuction with Minoxidil.  BeanStalk is very thick...Other posts suggest combine with conditioner and then lightly rinse.  I noticed my hair was definitely felt thicker and looked really healthy.  I alternate a scalp massage where there is hair loss with straight BeanStalk serum and the conditioner/serum mix ( everyother day).  As for areas where there is hair loss, have seen a little progress, but hair growth takes a few months.</li>
    <li> See absolutely no difference at all</li>
</ol>
