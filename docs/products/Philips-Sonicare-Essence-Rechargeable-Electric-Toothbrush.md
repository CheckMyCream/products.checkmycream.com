    <li> A Sonicare toothbrush..... what can you say.  They work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these toothbrushes.  One works great.  The second one, does not seal correctly and develops mold constantly with routine use at the sink.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my oral hygiene, or so I thought, but when I tried this toothbrush I couldn&#x27;t believe the results. My teeth feel clean instantly just like when I go for a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than anywhere else...  I was a Sonicare convert when my hubby got me one for Christmas, left mine in a hotel on vaca.  An investment we should all make...  Your teeth will never feel as clean, you can&#x27;t use a normal toothbrush after this!!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned. My periodontist recommended it over Rotodent, which I had been using for years. If I feel the need to floss, I will brush with this first and it almost always dislodges whatever caused me to feel the need to floss. I wish I had bought the model that has the two minute timing feature because that is how long one should brush with it. I fear I stop too soon, but I do brush with it several times a day because it makes my mouth feel so good.</li>
    <li> Faster Delivery. GREAT TOOTHBRUSH. Recommended!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years &amp; love them.</li>
    <li> great product and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> Takes some time getting used to this new toothbrush versus a manual, but once I got used to it, I love it! My teeth have never felt cleaner and I feel no plaque on them at all. I still find it hard not to splash everywhere while I am brushing.</li>
    <li> Works great and a great buy!</li>
    <li> What a dud! Stopped working after 4 months</li>
    <li> It works greatly, only it uses 110VAC input voltage, and I use it in China, I have to purchased a voltage exchanger.</li>
    <li> Died after 2 weeks of use, got a replacement from Amazon, I hope the replacement is much better.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this &amp; makes me wish I would have bought 2</li>
    <li> The absolute best toothbrush on the market at the absolute best price! I recommend this to all my patients and they love it!!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd sonicare, I won&#x27;t use anything else and buying from Amazon is cheaper</li>
    <li> Loved the color and the product&#x27;search high quality standards are totally intact.</li>
    <li> The best quality for the price! My first Sonicare and I think it&#x27;s a great starter! Highly recommend!</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have some of the features of my previous model - but I love how the sonicare cleans my teeth - my dental hygienist can tell the difference.</li>
