      <li>Really nice product.  </li>
      <li>is amazing and CE Ferulic is a pivotal part of that.</li>
      <li>and size does not matter.. :)</li>
      <li>I totally love this product and what it does for my skin.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite skin care products.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product, which was recommended to me by my doctor.  </li>
      <li>Satisfied.</li>
      <li>I read many good reviews about this product and had high expectations.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product as well as other Skinceutical brands for years and have been very happy with them.  </li>
      <li>Perfect little size for travel</li>
      <li>product arrived on time and seems to be original.</li>
      <li>Leaves my aging skin looking healthy and young.</li>
      <li>I very much like these travel bottles.  </li>
      <li>and I sure hope I can find them again at such a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>and I have actually been eating a lot better in this time.</li>
      <li>First, the smell:</li>
      <li>I have ordered more since, and did not have the same issues.</li>
      <li>decent price /indispensable product for peeps over 40/ much more money for a full size bottle and sample size stays fresher longer because once you open the bottle it needs to be used within a certain time frame.</li>
      <li>The package came early and the product was fresh!</li>
      <li>I was very desappointed because this is not a travel pack, but a SAMPLE pack and should not be sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I kept mine on top of my dresser where it has been since last September; still as clear as the day I got it.  </li>
      <li>I realize there are other factors that could contribute to this, but I have not switched up too many items in my normal routine</li>
      <li>I have used and reviewed Skinceuticals CE Ferulic for years, and I have to say-this must have been a less potent batch.</li>
      <li>I love it because it is so convenient and affordable for the same product as the larger size.</li>
      <li>However, when I used this batch-my skin looked like it normally does when I discontinue use for a period of time.</li>
      <li>Over the years CE Ferulic has made my skin clearer, less red, and overall more even.</li>
      <li>First of all, some of the liquid in some of the little bottles had an odor sort of like dirt and rotten coffee....</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on exactly what is missing from this product, it is just not the same I have used for 5+ years.  </li>
      <li>Was worried to receive fake ones but looks like it&#x27;s brand new and original content.</li>

    <li> I love this product, Itworks great on my face.</li>
    <li> Love it! It works!... and size does not matter.. :)</li>
    <li> Really nice product.  Can tell a difference in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> These are samples that are not supposed to be resold. They also made me break out.</li>
    <li> I very much like these travel bottles.  They save space in suitcase.</li>
    <li> Convenient size, excellent product.</li>
    <li> Loved the travel pack!  Exact same product as regular size bottle and small dropper makes it easier to control the amount used which will make it last alot longer.</li>
    <li> I have used and reviewed Skinceuticals CE Ferulic for years, and I have to say-this must have been a less potent batch.

    <li> I read many good reviews about this product and had high expectations.  First, the smell: people commented about the smell of the product yet this had none.  I read that it gradually yellows and to keep in the refrigerator to keep it from deteriorating and darkening.  I kept mine on top of my dresser where it has been since last September; still as clear as the day I got it.  I have stopped using it, as it did not seem to be helping my skin at all... I do not think this is the product described.</li>
    <li> I love it because it is so convenient and affordable for the same product as the larger size.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite skin care products.  It is made of the finest ingredients and is helpful against anti-aging.</li>
    <li> The 5 step face care program from Skinceuticals is amazing and CE Ferulic is a pivotal part of that. I have been using it for a long time and my face loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as well as other Skinceutical brands for years and have been very happy with them.  Nothing is going to make me look 30 again, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> First of all, some of the liquid in some of the little bottles had an odor sort of like dirt and rotten coffee....that is what it smelled like to me.</li>

    <li> Great product.  Speedy delivery.  Exactly as I expected.  Leaves my aging skin looking healthy and young.</li>
