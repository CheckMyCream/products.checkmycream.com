      <li>all Deva products I have tried I have loved.</li>
      <li>As a curly girl, I have done my fair share of experimenting with products.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I found the best way to use this is too smooth it onto my hair &amp; then scrunch it</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>love it, works great on my out of control hair.</li>
      <li>The feel was nice in my hand, and it smelled good, but it&#x27;s just not doing the job.</li>
      <li>This gel has effective hold, does not add crunchiness to hair, and is lightweight.</li>
      <li>I had already tried (and liked)</li>
      <li>I would have liked to have received an email stating that so I could make the decision on my own as to whether or not I wanted a substitute.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of volumizing hair product there is, and ArcAngel is by far the best!  </li>
      <li>I have been so happy with the Devacurl line &amp; so worth the price.</li>
      <li>love it so much and great for when it is humid</li>
      <li>I love the Deva Curl line of hair care products.</li>
      <li>and it has more frizz.</li>
      <li>Love the hold, love the definition, love the lite feeling.</li>
      <li>I love this gel.  </li>
      <li>Glad I got this instead of the lite gel.</li>
      <li>It really is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Loooooove love love this stuff i bought for</li>
      <li>I use the no poo, then the conditioner in the shower and leave most of that in.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I was expecting more from this product.  </li>
      <li>At last I found a great hair gel!  </li>
      <li>and it worked way better.</li>
      <li>Love the ingredients, but it did not support my curls well.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I am sticking to my favorite, OGX Argan defining cream.</li>
      <li>That is much better than this Deva gel or any gel for that matter, which don&#x27;t provide needed moisture like creams do.</li>
      <li>I even told them that if they reimburse me, I&#x27;ll let it go, and won&#x27;t write a review, and I&#x27;ll even continue to purchase from them, because I&#x27;m sure its a fluke.</li>
      <li>I have found some that I like a LOT, but I think this is the first that I LOVE!</li>
      <li>It truely does melt in my hair, but then I can&#x27;t differentiate between the gel and water, so I use more.</li>
      <li>Makes curls super bouncy!</li>
      <li>if this is what you want from a hair product,  just skip this product and go for cheap drug store hair gel.</li>
      <li>I would love to be able to afford to use the whole line of DevaCare.  </li>
      <li>I have tried hundreds of curly hair products - some super cheap, some pricey.</li>
      <li>It does get on my body, and I am not crazy about that, but I try to just rinse it with water and it seems fine.</li>
      <li>It gives amazing frizz free definition and leaves my hair super soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>I have pretty fine, shoulder-length hair, and it&#x27;s pretty curly (not too kinky/tight, but definitely more than wavy).</li>
      <li>This product works amazing with my natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>My hair even stood up to my 5 year old daughter \\&quot;playing\\&quot; with my hair (and she doesn&#x27;t play nice).</li>
      <li>My cousin has long curly hair that looks gorgeous all the time.</li>
      <li>The only thing I will say negative about this is that if your using set it free spray or Mister right it will make your hair wicked sticky so beware, otherwise it&#x27;s a really great gel with a good hold</li>
      <li>This is the first product that I have used with my curly hair that does not get my hair frizzy!  </li>
      <li>When I first opened it, flipped it over to squeeze out the gel, liquid came out!</li>
      <li>It really is fantastic!am not crazy about that, but I try to just rinse it with water and it seems fine.</li>
      <li>So the 1st time i used this product I put too much in because I&#x27;m so used to the cheap stuff &amp;</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, though after the second day it sort of smells perfumey and gives me a bit of a headache.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s a natural product not tested on animals</li>
      <li>Maybe I should try adding a second gel into my routine to stretch it farther, but that kind of defeats the purpose.  </li>
      <li>Your hair will have a stuff cast on it that you will need to scrunch once it is dry to break the cast and create beautiful, soft, defined curls.</li>
      <li>Great curl defining without being sticky and leaving my hear stiff.</li>
      <li>(I haven&#x27;t tried 3rd day because I love clean hair).</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t know the right method/combination yet)</li>
      <li>Anyway, if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product and you have the money, watch a video on youtube for the right method and give it a try.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t applying it right.</li>
      <li>Anyway, if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product and you have the money, watch a video on youtube for the right method and give it a try.</li>
      <li>Afterwards I spray on Mist-er Right &amp; it enhances the curls.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been in a never-ending search for the right styling product ever since Graham Webb Making Waves gel was discontinued.</li>
      <li>The next time I used way less &amp; it was perfect.</li>
      <li>This is the 1st product I have tried that I didn&#x27;t have to use half the bottle to get good results.</li>
      <li>Well, I was at a trip in NYC when I first used this bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this brand and especially this gel.  </li>
      <li>I thought with my coarse curly hair this would be better gel than the ultra defining.</li>
      <li>and this is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that controlled the curl but</li>
      <li>Not greasy, yet provides a good amount of hold without making the hair feel prickly and stiff.  </li>
      <li>Ehhhh... doesn&#x27;t really do much for my curls.</li>
      <li>I really, really wanted to like this product, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>It really works - even in humid weather.</li>
      <li>Put this gel in while your hair is sopping wet, the wetter it is then the better the curls.</li>
      <li>I figured I would need a lot because it really wasn&#x27;t sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>I prefer the light citrus scent of this line to the scent of the regular DevaCurl line.</li>
      <li>I have very curly and frizzy hair</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
      <li>and I ended up using more than the other times because my hair seemed frizzy.</li>
      <li>Make sure you only use a tiny bit or</li>
      <li>My main problem is I have &amp;#34;Botticelli&amp;#34; type curls</li>
      <li>Flip my head, add gel and scrunch with a paper towel, add a little more gel and scrunch.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, soft hair.</li>
      <li>While my hair starts out looking nice, as the day goes on the frizz gets unbelievable!  </li>
      <li>I work up with defined curls with a very soft texture.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve alternated back &amp; forth between this gel and the Ultra Defining Gel, and at first when I used this it was way too strong and seemed to way my hair down; HOWEVER, when I recently had a Deva Cut, I tried it again &amp; used a diffuser</li>
      <li>I, so far, have not had a problem with the conditioner or gel causing a breakout.</li>
      <li>I do advise you to use it directly as stated in the directions.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to take time from my busy schedule to stand in line at the US Postal</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like using a diffuser because my hair doesn&#x27;t dry as pretty</li>
      <li>She highly recommended the entire Deva Curl line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my hair was super stiff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love it so much and great for when it is humid</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years. Love it. My curls stay long using this gel and are very soft still.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my thick tight curly hair.  It left it dry and so much shrinkage.  Maybe for someone with looser and longer curls.</li>
    <li> Hydrates curls -- as described.</li>
    <li> I thought with my coarse curly hair this would be better gel than the ultra defining. I found it a little too sticky. A very small amount is alright once in awhile.</li>
    <li> Ehhhh... doesn&#x27;t really do much for my curls. I tried it since I heard great things about this brand. It has a very nice smell. But gels just don&#x27;t cut it for me. I am sticking to my favorite, OGX Argan defining cream. That is much better than this Deva gel or any gel for that matter, which don&#x27;t provide needed moisture like creams do.</li>
    <li> I love the Deva Curl line of hair care products. I used to use Aveda and a few other Target curling products but was left with frizzy, undefined curls.  Now that I use the Deva Curl gel, my curls look great, not frizzy or crunchy.  I&#x27;m very happy that I made the switch.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really do the job. I have pretty fine, shoulder-length hair, and it&#x27;s pretty curly (not too kinky/tight, but definitely more than wavy). I&#x27;ve been in a never-ending search for the right styling product ever since Graham Webb Making Waves gel was discontinued. Several of my curly-haired friends swear by Deva, so I tried this firm hold gel - my only reservation was that the firm hold might be too crunchy. And just the opposite occurred. It has ZERO hold and my hair is as frizzy as if it had no product in it. The feel was nice in my hand, and it smelled good, but it&#x27;s just not doing the job.</li>
    <li> Does not help my hair curl, gives it a very small amount of body if used when my hair is slightly wet.</li>
    <li> As a curly girl, I have done my fair share of experimenting with products. This gel has effective hold, does not add crunchiness to hair, and is lightweight. I have been using it for over 6 months.</li>
    <li> Love the hold, love the definition, love the lite feeling. For a ultra holding gel, it&#x27;s not like a thick gel at all! You get your hold and definition, but also moveable curls. No flaking at all. Glad I got this instead of the lite gel.</li>
    <li> love it, works great on my out of control hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seached for a product to replace one that is no longer made. This one worked for me. Has enough hold for my fly-a-way curls--keeping them in shape without plastering them down with other &#x27;hold&#x27; products.</li>
    <li> Loooooove love love this stuff i bought for my (almost) 2yr olds crazy unruly curls &amp; its like magic😁 &amp; a little goes along way with this product! I loove it!</li>
    <li> I have dry curly, frizzy hair that is difficult to manages in Florida&#x27;s humid hot weather. My cousin has long curly hair that looks gorgeous all the time. She highly recommended the entire Deva Curl line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love that it&#x27;s a natural product not tested on animals, that&#x27;s simple to use and WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Once I understand the technique it transformed my hair routine and saved me 45 minutes of blow drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A purchase you&#x27;ll never regret!</li>
    <li> This is the first product that I have used with my curly hair that does not get my hair frizzy!  It really works - even in humid weather.</li>
    <li> switched from other products years ago. sets hair without leaving a sticky stiff or flaky feeling behind. once dry,i toussel my hair for the relaxed look and it holds its shape</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> Good product for curly hair. I prefer the light citrus scent of this line to the scent of the regular DevaCurl line.</li>
    <li> Made my hair crunchy.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and especially this gel.  My husband and I both use it, for his super-straight black hair and my curvier grey.  If our hair gets smooshed down by hats during the winter, running wet hands through brings it back to life!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I heard about this through a friend and had to try it. I have very curly, soft hair. When I use other firm gel products, my hair becomes crunchy or straw like. If I use the flexible gel, my hair is too frizzy with undefined curls. I do advise you to use it directly as stated in the directions. Your hair will have a stuff cast on it that you will need to scrunch once it is dry to break the cast and create beautiful, soft, defined curls. I also purchased the shampoo and conditioner but have not used it yet. Waiting until my other products run out. Once I am using all Deva Care products, I can&#x27;t imagine the improvement!</li>
    <li> Great product it gives my hair that shiny look I want without a sticky feel. I use the product as a part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using deva products for over 10 years and I love it. But this gel stays hard when your hair is dry. I use it when I pull my hair back or wear it up and want it to hold but not when I wear my hair down.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like this product, but I don&#x27;t.  While my hair starts out looking nice, as the day goes on the frizz gets unbelievable!  It also seems to really dry out my hair.  Just not a good product for my curly girl hair....</li>
    <li> Got it in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> excellent product, the best gel for curly hair</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Not greasy, yet provides a good amount of hold without making the hair feel prickly and stiff.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I was expecting more from this product.  I guess it was all of the glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect some miracle curly hair product. It literally is just another hair gel and works just like any hair gel. It makes your hair stiff and leaves your hair dry and with residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price,  if this is what you want from a hair product,  just skip this product and go for cheap drug store hair gel.</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome for fine curly hair! It holds it even for the day after and with me going to sleep on it!</li>
    <li> Great curl defining without being sticky and leaving my hear stiff.</li>
    <li> So the 1st time i used this product I put too much in because I&#x27;m so used to the cheap stuff &amp; my hair was super stiff. I figured I would need a lot because it really wasn&#x27;t sticky feeling.The next time I used way less &amp; it was perfect. This is the 1st product I have tried that I didn&#x27;t have to use half the bottle to get good results. I have been so happy with the Devacurl line &amp; so worth the price. I just wish I would have known of it sooner</li>
    <li> Let me begin by stating that I have never written a product review. Ever. I often say, &amp;#34;oh, I should totally review it!&amp;#34; but life gets in the way and I don&#x27;t get around it. But this time, the seller got me so darn peeved that I felt I owe it to curly women everywhere to put this warning out--DO NOT BUY FROM THIS LYING, CHEATING SELLERS.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product form ASAP several times in the past without complications. The last shipment I received, I used about 2 months after I got it. That&#x27;s because I always like to keep a stash of products, so I don&#x27;t run out. Well, I was at a trip in NYC when I first used this bottle. When I first opened it, flipped it over to squeeze out the gel, liquid came out! The product was watered-down! what is this--China?!?!? Give me a break! I was stuck on a trip without my gel. Ya&#x27;ll know that is awful, right? I know there&#x27;s a Deva store in NYC but I wasn&#x27;t going to tell my entire family--sorry, I have to go across town for gel. So, I suffered in frizzy silence. When I got back in town, I emailed them and asked for a refund and that I do not plan on sending the product back for two reasons--1) its been used for several days in NYC (I just used tons of the liquid form...barely worked and 2) I&#x27;m not going to take time from my busy schedule to stand in line at the US Postal (OMG are you kidding me?!?!) or pay UPS/FedEx for the mistake of the seller! I even told them that if they reimburse me, I&#x27;ll let it go, and won&#x27;t write a review, and I&#x27;ll even continue to purchase from them, because I&#x27;m sure its a fluke. Well, the jerks...they said--return it and we&#x27;ll see about a credit.&lt;br /&gt;long story short--I&#x27;m not going to mail it back, I&#x27;m just going to stop buying from them. And you should do. Lest you end up with a liquid version of this gel. Crooks!</li>
    <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair and this is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that controlled the curl but didn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy.  I followed the previous reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to just wrap hair in a towel after applying product  I slept with the towel on overnight to let my hair dry.  I work up with defined curls with a very soft texture.  It controlled about 90% of the frizz and lasted a couple days.</li>
    <li> I ordered Arc Angel but got the defining gel instead. I had already tried (and liked) the defining gel but I wanted to try another product. This company seemed to think the two products are interchangeable (are they?) and sent me the defining gel instead. When I contacted them as to why I did not receive the Arc Angel, they said they were out of the product. I would have liked to have received an email stating that so I could make the decision on my own as to whether or not I wanted a substitute. So...no review for Arc Angel, because I never got it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve alternated back &amp; forth between this gel and the Ultra Defining Gel, and at first when I used this it was way too strong and seemed to way my hair down; HOWEVER, when I recently had a Deva Cut, I tried it again &amp; used a diffuser and it worked way better. My main problem is I have &amp;#34;Botticelli&amp;#34; type curls and when my hair gets too long it just goes limp and I wasn&#x27;t applying it right. I found the best way to use this is too smooth it onto my hair &amp; then scrunch it &amp; then when dry to use a little Argan/Moroccan oil to break the cast. The only thing I will say negative about this is that if your using set it free spray or Mister right it will make your hair wicked sticky so beware, otherwise it&#x27;s a really great gel with a good hold</li>
    <li> So I have 3b/c botticelli curls. Well, let me rephrase that, when I have product in my hair. Without product, due to years of abuse, I have cotton candy hair. I have tried hundreds of curly hair products - some super cheap, some pricey. I have found some that I like a LOT, but I think this is the first that I LOVE! It does everything I want. It gives amazing frizz free definition and leaves my hair super soft and bouncy. It gives me 2nd and probably 3rd day hair (I haven&#x27;t tried 3rd day because I love clean hair). My hair even stood up to my 5 year old daughter \\&quot;playing\\&quot; with my hair (and she doesn&#x27;t play nice). The smell is nice, though after the second day it sort of smells perfumey and gives me a bit of a headache. I use the no poo, then the conditioner in the shower and leave most of that in. Flip my head, add gel and scrunch with a paper towel, add a little more gel and scrunch. Then I add some clips for volume and let my hair air dry. Here is the problem with that; it takes my hair 2-4 hours to dry that way. I don&#x27;t have time for that. I don&#x27;t like using a diffuser because my hair doesn&#x27;t dry as pretty and it has more frizz. Here is another BIG problem, (and it is possible I just don&#x27;t know the right method/combination yet) I have to use a lot of the gel. I have used this bottle 3 times and it is 1/3 gone! I cannot afford to buy this stuff every 2-3 weeks! It truely does melt in my hair, but then I can&#x27;t differentiate between the gel and water, so I use more. I tried using less today and I ended up using more than the other times because my hair seemed frizzy. Maybe I should try adding a second gel into my routine to stretch it farther, but that kind of defeats the purpose.  Another thing to mention- I was worried about using this as the videos directed. I usually wash my hair first in the shower and wash my body last. That way I don&#x27;t get breakouts. I, so far, have not had a problem with the conditioner or gel causing a breakout. It does get on my body, and I am not crazy about that, but I try to just rinse it with water and it seems fine. I don&#x27;t feel sticky or anything. Anyway, if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product and you have the money, watch a video on youtube for the right method and give it a try. It really is fantastic!am not crazy about that, but I try to just rinse it with water and it seems fine. I don&#x27;t feel sticky or anything.

    <li> My curly hair is fine and thin.  Absolutely no body unless I put product in.  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of volumizing hair product there is, and ArcAngel is by far the best!  I actually get &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; hair when I use it!  I do use a root booster, too, though...usually Paul Mitchell.  I would love to be able to afford to use the whole line of DevaCare.  But this girl&#x27;s splurge can only be the gel.</li>
    <li> This product works amazing with my natural curly hair. Don&#x27;t put your hair up in a towel when you get out of the shower. This will cause your hair to dry. Instead, just scrunch the towel to your hair and dry it that way. Put this gel in while your hair is sopping wet, the wetter it is then the better the curls. Afterwards I spray on Mist-er Right &amp; it enhances the curls. Love Deva Curl!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, wish I would have found this years ago!! It holds without being sticky or stiff. Makes curls super bouncy!</li>
    <li> I love this gel.  It works so well with my curly hair.  all Deva products I have tried I have loved.</li>
    <li> At last I found a great hair gel!  Its not sticky or smelly and holds my wavy hair just enough.  Make sure you only use a tiny bit or you will end up with a mess in your hair</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients, but it did not support my curls well.</li>
