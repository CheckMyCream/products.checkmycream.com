### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent except that it stings the eyes in the pool and when you sweat.</li>
      <li>and man I was impressed!</li>
      <li>This is great as it is not greasy on my face and works!</li>
      <li>Very nice!</li>
      <li>great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience</li>
      <li>Really great consistency, perfect for the face because it&#x27;s not greasy and smells decent.</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen!</li>
      <li>and I really love this brand!</li>
      <li>, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
      <li>Favorite sunsceen.</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and absorbs great on my skin.</li>
      <li>Because My Face Is Senstive i Tend To Break Out Easily.</li>
      <li>This was far more superior.</li>
      <li>I wanted an oil free SPF cream for my face because I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t make my face shine, but it still shines.</li>
      <li>so I stopped and grabbed a cheap bottle of Coppertone Oil Free Faces ($6)</li>
      <li>It has the same non-greasy, easy to apply consistency that I love about Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free line, stays on well in the water/when I sweat, and better protects me in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as good as Neutrogena sheer for faces.</li>
      <li>Quality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had a price much lower than CVS, so I bought it :)</li>
      <li>So i Was Glad Amazon Had It &amp; For A Decent Price.</li>
      <li>This product is super oily on my combination skin..hated it..</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>It is useful for the nose, but I would not recommend putting it on your forehead unless you do not plan to sweat or go into the water.</li>
      <li>i wondered if a 50 spf formula might be too thick, but this one is fine -- very smooth and creamy; easy to apply</li>
      <li>I religiously wore Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Face and Body Sunblock SPF 30 because I liked its non-greasy, easy to apply consistency, but found I still got quite dark with it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better to buy from a store locally where one can check the product before buying.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite facial sunscreen  brands.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that sunblocks don&#x27;t make a difference above SPF 30, but found I don&#x27;t get as many visible tan lines with this stronger SPF50</li>
      <li>I have pretty oil skin</li>
      <li>I really need it keep me from getting sunburned!</li>
      <li>I think my face wants a higher SPF on beach days though.</li>
      <li>I used the spray-on sunscreen before, but they were really oily and greasy.</li>
      <li>I Really Like This Sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I still recommend this product because it works very well.</li>
      <li>I bought a bottle of the oil free Neutrogena sunscreen ($13) and liked it, other than the odd smell.</li>
      <li>I have very dry, light, acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I have light yellow Asian / Spanish skin that can get quite brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Faces SPF 50+ works very well; you only need a small amount to apply to your face.</li>
      <li>- they don&#x27;t seem to carry it in our local pharmacies in New York.</li>
      <li>I apply it right after my serum and moisturizer, wait a little bit and proceed to do my makeup.</li>
      <li>it helps, I use Coppertone&#x27;s Sunscreen Lotion Ultra Guard Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion SPF50 for my body and find the same results - I like the Ultra Guard</li>
      <li>After about a half hour, it soaked in enough to where I could not see oil on my hands but was still very shiny.</li>
      <li>I train for long distance triathlons (Half Ironman and Ironman distances) and am an avid scuba diver</li>
      <li>Broad much more than the Coppertone Sensitive Skin, 50 SPF, which was thick, hard to apply and left white streaks on my skin.</li>

<li> Why I get the wrong production!I order 5 coppertone oil free faces</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m spending just as much time in the sun, if not more!</li>
<li> No odd smell, not overly greasy (people, this stuff is sunscreen and will have a slight greasyness no matter what) and no breakouts!</li>
<li> I purchased the CeraVe AM with sunscreen and that stuff made me WAY too oily, even with my dry skin.</li>
<li> but if you are buying it because it says oil-free for your face, I would consider other products.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> Most products are never completely oil-free but this is the worst sunscreen I have ever used in regards to that.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or feel heavy on my face.</li>
<li> It felt like a oil slick on my face.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also hard to wear make-up on oily sunscreen.</li>
<li> such a disappointment...</li>
<li> Coverage is thin.</li>
<li> It protects without irritating my skin.</li>
<li> I was so looking forward to trying this product and was so disappointed.</li>
<li> This sunscreen is awful for the face.  </li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or feel heavy on my face. Very nice!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised - no complaints!</li>
    <li> Why I get the wrong production!I order 5 coppertone oil free faces SPF50,but I get four SPF50 and one SPF30!</li>
    <li> great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
    <li> I have very dry, light, acne prone skin. I use CeraVe lotion daily and needed something with an added spf. I purchased the CeraVe AM with sunscreen and that stuff made me WAY too oily, even with my dry skin. I bought a bottle of the oil free Neutrogena sunscreen ($13) and liked it, other than the odd smell. We left town and I forgot my bottle of sunscreen so I stopped and grabbed a cheap bottle of Coppertone Oil Free Faces ($6) and man I was impressed! No odd smell, not overly greasy (people, this stuff is sunscreen and will have a slight greasyness no matter what) and no breakouts! I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I Really Like This Sunscreen. It&#x27;s The Only One i Can Use For My Face. Because My Face Is Senstive i Tend To Break Out Easily. However Using This Sunscreen It Doesnt Cause No Breakouts. I Couldn&#x27;t Find It In Any Drug Stores So i Was Glad Amazon Had It &amp; For A Decent Price. I Would Recommend It, It&#x27;s Not Oily And Applies Well To The Skin.</li>
    <li> Burns if you get it to close to your eyes whIle out in the sun.</li>
    <li> Favorite sunsceen. Use instead of moisturizer under makeup.  Always return to this after trying others.</li>
    <li> I used the spray-on sunscreen before, but they were really oily and greasy. It&#x27;s also hard to wear make-up on oily sunscreen. That&#x27;s why I choose this one. I buy Coppertone in every summer and I really love this brand! This lotion you can carry-everywhere with it in your purse. I really need it keep me from getting sunburned!</li>
    <li> This is great as it is not greasy on my face and works!</li>
    <li> Not as good as Neutrogena sheer for faces. Coverage is thin. Product is watery. Not worth the money. Better to buy from a store locally where one can check the product before buying.</li>
    <li> Really great consistency, perfect for the face because it&#x27;s not greasy and smells decent. I think my face wants a higher SPF on beach days though.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! Great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I train for long distance triathlons (Half Ironman and Ironman distances) and am an avid scuba diver so I&#x27;m in the sun almost every day of the week! I religiously wore Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Face and Body Sunblock SPF 30 because I liked its non-greasy, easy to apply consistency, but found I still got quite dark with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend suggested I up my SPF and I found this online - they don&#x27;t seem to carry it in our local pharmacies in New York. This was far more superior. It has the same non-greasy, easy to apply consistency that I love about Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free line, stays on well in the water/when I sweat, and better protects me in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that sunblocks don&#x27;t make a difference above SPF 30, but found I don&#x27;t get as many visible tan lines with this stronger SPF50 and I&#x27;m spending just as much time in the sun, if not more! I have light yellow Asian / Spanish skin that can get quite brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it helps, I use Coppertone&#x27;s Sunscreen Lotion Ultra Guard Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion SPF50 for my body and find the same results - I like the Ultra Guard Broad much more than the Coppertone Sensitive Skin, 50 SPF, which was thick, hard to apply and left white streaks on my skin.</li>
    <li> No sunburn, and no epic breakouts few days later, that&#x27;s a first for any sunblock.</li>
    <li> Excellent except that it stings the eyes in the pool and when you sweat.</li>
    <li> I am using the Coppertone SPF cream for years; always helps to protect the skin on my face.  Quality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had a price much lower than CVS, so I bought it :)</li>
    <li> Like water baby sunscreen products.</li>
    <li> This product is super oily on my combination skin..hated it..such a disappointment...</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is awful for the face.  We all got burning eyes after using this product.  It is useful for the nose, but I would not recommend putting it on your forehead unless you do not plan to sweat or go into the water.</li>
    <li> i wondered if a 50 spf formula might be too thick, but this one is fine -- very smooth and creamy; easy to apply</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite facial sunscreen  brands. It protects without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> Holy Grail sunscreen for my combination skin. Cannot beat the price! It is very lightweight and absorbs great on my skin. I apply it right after my serum and moisturizer, wait a little bit and proceed to do my makeup.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to trying this product and was so disappointed. I have pretty oil skin so I always buy oil-free products. Most products are never completely oil-free but this is the worst sunscreen I have ever used in regards to that. It felt like a oil slick on my face. After about a half hour, it soaked in enough to where I could not see oil on my hands but was still very shiny. I only used it twice and it seemed to protect from the sun but if you are buying it because it says oil-free for your face, I would consider other products.</li>
    <li> still feel oil,can only use for body</li>
    <li> Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Faces SPF 50+ works very well; you only need a small amount to apply to your face. I wanted an oil free SPF cream for my face because I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t make my face shine, but it still shines. I still recommend this product because it works very well.</li>
