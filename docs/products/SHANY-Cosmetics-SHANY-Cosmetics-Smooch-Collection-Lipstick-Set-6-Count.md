<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Mmmmm keep shopping.  These colors do not last. Tops break off. Containers are cheaply made.... Wanted to like these.  But I&#x27;m not quite sure what I was putting on my lips........gave it. A 2 for the concept but product lacks in quality</li>
    <li> Please do not buy.....it fell apart instantly</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LIPSTICKS THEY ARE REALLY SMOOTH AND THE QUALITY IS GOOD FOR THE CHEAP PRICE AND PLAN TO GET MORE !!!!!</li>
    <li> thry wanna more of it.</li>
    <li> Super Matte have had them for 2 years and still great!</li>
    <li> Great seller. Very hogh quality product</li>
    <li> i love 4 out of 6 shades</li>
    <li> These have a hint of color like chapstick wich is fine bc its not m.a.c or sephora products you can count on. I use them as chap sticks when im wearing jeans nothing extravagant.</li>
    <li> was really excited for this item, but when received, all of the gold-tops of the lipstick lids were broken off. i stuck them back on, but they still fall off. the colors and quality of the lipsticks themselves is very nice, however, one of the lipsticks is broken and wobbles around when i try to use it. disappointed with this item.</li>
    <li> The colors are very sheer and do not dry out my lips. Will definitely try this brand again. Would say that antone who wants just a touch of color would would like them.</li>
    <li> All makeup junkies will love this assortment. Six different beautiful creamy colors that can match your mood/makeup/outfit etc. wish it was a little more pigmented but overall it&#x27;s great for the price. And would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Very cute colors! The lipstick itself isn&#x27;t that remarkable but works as expected!</li>
    <li> Not incredibly impressed with the quality of these lipsticks but all factors (price) considered, it&#x27;s an alright purchase if you&#x27;re not looking for high pigmented lip color.  As many others have noted, the lipstick tops (gold plating) arrived in the box vs where they should have been, on the lipstick. Also, if you&#x27;re trying to judge color tones, take a very close look at the photos of the lipsticks and NOT the colors indicated on the box set. Again, cost factored in, you can&#x27;t expect too much but it&#x27;s a decent buy, worth exploring/testing for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE: Set 1 and Set 2, are identical.  Amazon (mistakenly) shipped box set 2 instead of box set 1.  When the replacement order arrived, I expected vast differences, and was highly disappointed because upon inspecting them all (collectively) I noticed that they are EXACTLY the same.  Upside, the replacement order had all the tops on.</li>
    <li> Stains lips in an uneven way. It is very pigmented, but, isn&#x27;t evenly pigmented. Threw out after 3 months as they were &amp;#34;leaking&amp;#34; oil. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> although the lipsticks themselves go on nicely, one came with no lipstick in the tube, the light pink one,&lt;br /&gt;and the cases are very cheap. Colors are not true to what you see. I received as a gift from my wish list</li>
    <li> The array of colors cant be beat. For women of color these lipsticks are beautiful. I will be ordering the second set in this collection.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the colors. N the colors are exactly how they were described are how they look. The colora are great n how so in fashion right now. Super happy with my purchase also the colora stay on long so its lasting.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shades!  Packaging a little cheap but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE LIPSTICKS, IN GENERAL.  SPECIFICALLY, I LOVED THAT THERE WERE SHADES TO COMPLIMENT VARIOUS FACE COLORS, RATHER THAN JUST DARKER AND LIGHTER SHADES OF ONE COLOR.  TRY THESE!!!!</li>
    <li> I found one color for this six lipstick set that works for me but they fade away fast or are too bright</li>
    <li> The colors don&#x27;t show up well. They look nice, but they just suck plain and simple. It was a good price for 6 lipsticks, and the delivery was great, but the quality and the actual product on a scale of 1-10 gets a 0 from me to be honest.</li>
    <li> Poor quality!! Hate it!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s say you get what you pay for.  More suited for play makeup for your little sister.  Only a couple of the colors go on smooth enough not to look costumey.  I would not purchase these again, as I can get 1 or 2 sticks I really like in the place of 5 that are really marginal.</li>
    <li> But I would have liked a deeper variety. The colors are pretty light, but lat long and don&#x27;t smear easily. Looks great on lips!&lt;br /&gt;Very nice, especially if starting a makeup collection! I recommend!</li>
    <li> Ok first of all.. ORDER FROM SHANYCOSMETICS.COM they are cheaper and with free shipping and samples with orders over $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them directly from them and came in perfect condition. They are really pigmented and last a fair amount of time which is something I expect for the price. I feel most of the other reviews are people expecting something too good for the price they are paying but this is just perfect for what it is! The quality of the product is amazing because they cut expenses in the quality of the package and that is just perfect for me! I LOVE THEM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I bought these set especially because of the super light pink I really wanted a color like that and the pigment is amazing! Super happy about my purchase!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the  lasting color I was looking for, but it does have the shine. The colors are all beautiful.</li>
    <li> i just got my lipstick on friday.i dont like it. the colors was very sheer in it don&#x27;t show up well. the quality of the lipstick are cheap. i give the lipstick a 1 out of 10. i think wet in wild lipstick is better than shany.</li>
    <li> I love how smooth the lipsticks felt on my lips, I also love that the color stays for hours. But there is one thing i disliked and that would be the color collection. Out of the six i found that I only liked 3.</li>
    <li> Great colors and love the price.  Caps fly off too easy though.</li>
    <li> Not a good set! Completely dissatisfied ! The colors are not pigmented they are more like gloss and at that they all come out to be similar colors to each other !</li>
    <li> i love this lipstick but if kept the wrong way it will fall apart. which sucks since it is going on a ride in my purse. overall it&#x27;s smooth and vibrant but not all shiny.</li>
    <li> Lipsticks are what&#x27;s expected for the cost. Packaging is cute but cheap. Gold tops fall off so I put a dab of super glue too keep them on. Great product for price!</li>
    <li> They are very nice n tru to colors but only thing the gold tops keep falling off and some of the lipstick was stick to the cover had to push them down with my fingers but apart from that they are sooo lovely cant expect more the price</li>
    <li> I love each and every color. They stay on and make my lips look great. Only issue is the casing that they come in have a gold top and the tops keeps falling off. But other than that..great product</li>
    <li> for the cost this is a nice set. the colors are vast and good ones.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging isn&#x27;t the best but for the product and cost worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love Shany products, however this lipsticks look cheap. The gold piece of the cap gets separated easily. I´m sad about the quality of this product but I still love the Shany politics and other products for example their nail polish.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Not too dry.</li>
    <li> I was missing one of my lipsticks and the they&#x27;re very small won&#x27;t last long at all. Gave it one star</li>
    <li> Tops of lipsticks are cheap and lipstick ends up smeard all over your purse...&lt;br /&gt;Great colors though!</li>
    <li> DO NOT GET THESE. When they arrived the packaging was already broken. When I open the colors they had multiples of the same color in the box. Very disappointing. The lipstick its self is okay goes on smooth, but that didn&#x27;t make up for the rest of it. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> ok, so i cant begin the disappointment on this one. This is why you should always read the reviews people, because i ignored them and got this trash on my mail. First, the quality(which has none) the package breaks by just looking at it, its a pretty package and it LOOKS fancy, but touch the cap and itll break apart. Second, the actual lipstick, the colors are hideous, too shimmery, and barely any pigmentation, not to mention they all look the same. I suggest you dont buy this thing, maybe for like...a 13 year old or something, because thats the type of quality you are getting on this one.</li>
    <li> Lip stick casing falls apart. I like most of the colors, some were too bright. Lip stick goes on smooth</li>
    <li> The SHNAY smooch collection lipstick are okay they are very sheer if your into tht kinda thing but for me who like a bit of pop of color.. it isnt my favourite.... I thought they were bright and pigmented but when they came they were so sheer that i had to use other colours to get them to pop a bit more</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a high quality, but in fact they are high quality, didn&#x27;t know they have aloe vera and vitamin E in them. And it says on the box, ingredients from Paris, I didn&#x27;t know that until I got them in my hand, the quality is great, it&#x27;s like buying CG lipstick in pack of 6, the different is I paid only $15 for all 6 of them, could it be any better? Maybe, the lipstick tubes are very light, usually I only buy the ones that are heavy, but these are very lights, my mom likes them, since she likes the light tube. But I would say this is not for me, colors are great, but I like more of pinkish colors, these are variety pack, in the picture showed 6 colors, 3 of them are close to pink and purple, and other 3 are shades of red. I gave the shades of red to my mom, I&#x27;m happy with the left 3 colors, since at my age, you don&#x27;t wanna put glossy Red, unless it&#x27;s a prom night or something. Overall good purchase, as always Amazon packed well and shipped on time, would recommend to who look for quality. By the way the case is lovely, it looks very nice on my dresser. Would I buy them again? I would say , No, because they are not my colors :), I wait for the next round of colors.</li>
    <li> This is my first shany purchase. I put the lipstick on and it&#x27;s very pigmented and it last a very long time. I&#x27;ve ate drunk obscene amounts of juice and took a nap. The lipstick stayed on. I&#x27;m more than likely ordering again</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. Definitely a great purchase for the price. Will be buying the second set as well. My only issue was with the packaging for the lipstick itself, it is a bit cheap and sometimes opens up on its own when its in my bag. That being said, I&#x27;d purchase these again in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I use mine everyday and I love it!! Goes with any brand of lip liner and looks great!! I recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been adding a lot of SHANY products into my kit lately and I have been bowled over by the high quality of their products, especially given their low prices.  Their pressed shadow pallettes are amazingly vibrant and highly pigmented; I haven&#x27;t had any problems with spotty application or chalky texture.  I decided to see how their lip products matched up, and unfortunately my experience there wasn&#x27;t nearly as positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off is the packaging.  SHANY does a great job of using standardized, inexpensive plastic packaging for the products themselves rather than putting a ton into developing their own packaging; this means a greater savings for the customer. The products are then put into SHANY&#x27;s personalized cardboard packaging for a sleeker, more branded look.  In the case of these lipsticks, the SHANY paper packaging is amazing - a thick cardboard box with an attractive design advertising the product and the company - but the cheap plastic packaging of the product itself is actually a detriment to the product in this case.  The tops don&#x27;t fit well and come loose easily and are asymetrical, so you may have to rotate it to get a correct fit.  The color stickers are also not very well matched to the product.  Two of the stickers look pretty much identical, but the lipsticks are actually quite different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging problems are entirely forgivable if the product performs well; unfortunately, this lipstick just doesn&#x27;t wear all that well.  I found 4 of the 6 to be very sheer, only slightly more impact than a tinted gloss.  The other two were slightly better, but had a very shiny, almost oily appearance.  They could be useful if layered with other products, but the coverage and color is not consistent enough for it to become a staple in my kit.  I was disappointed by this product because SHANY has emerged as a new contender in the makeup world, delivering good quality products at very inexpensive prices and this product just did not live up to their usual standard.  I&#x27;m hoping they will work with this product to bring it up to the same high level as their other products.their usual standard.

    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations but colors are vibrant.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical but shany cosmetics really doesnt get enough credit. The lipsticks feel really nice and the colors are very pigmented. Also the color selection is very nice.</li>
    <li> Just came in today. A lot of reviews I read said these colors were very sheer, however that&#x27;s not what I experienced. I found them to be very pigmented and true on my lips. Very nice colors but again, they&#x27;re very pigmented. There&#x27;s a very light pink, two similar berry colors, a brown-ish color, and two orangey colors. I feel they&#x27;re be hard to wear often.</li>
    <li> Light colors of pink shades.Very smooth going on. Wonderfully compact to travel well.Recommend to those who like to reapply on the go.</li>
    <li> Some of the colours were not suitable to my skin tone, other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> Really generic case, the gold was falling off as soon as i opened it, but the actual lip sticks are amazing! I love it! Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I like Shany products their quality is great. I love the colors of the lipsticks but sometimes the caps fall off easily especially if their in your purse. Received them fast.</li>
    <li> Everything was really nice. The lipsticks are really pigmented and moisturizing. The packaging is very cheap though :( alot of the tops are not staying on. and the golden plastic pieces are falling off the tops. But the lipstick is nice.</li>
    <li> Ok so this is my first purchase of this item/product. I love the colors, however I expected a larger size since it stated full size. Im not sure if this is the norm.</li>
    <li> this is so not worth the price.  Colors are nasty and the quality of case is so cheap.</li>
    <li> I received my package in the mail on time. As I look each lipstick case I notice that my pink lipstick came defective! There was no stick inside the case as for the other colors they came in good condition. If amazon could just replace my one pink lipstick that would be great but I doubt it because they want me to return my whole package! What a hassle.</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> Great price and product, lip colors are nice and was packaged so nicely,&lt;br /&gt;I want to reuse the box they came in! I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> It was NOT what I expected. Very disappointed. Product was really small I barely found it in the box. Was not happy.</li>
    <li> i RECEIVED THESE LIPSTICKS..AND WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THEY WERE DAMAGED..ONE TUBE THE LIPSTICK WAS BROKEN..IN ANOTHER THE STICK WAS STUCK TO THE TOP OF THE TUBE AND IN ANOTHER THE STICK WAS BROKEN AND STUCK TO THE TOP OF THE TUBE..AND THEY WERE ALL NOT TURNED DOWN IN THE TUBES PROPERLY. SO I EXCHANGED FOR NEW COLLECTION BECAUSE i LIKED THE COLORS..WELL THE NEW COLLECTION WAS THE SAME WAY THE SAME DAMAGE..THIS TIME I JUST GAVE THE COLLECTION TO MY GRAND DAUGHTER..WHO IS ONLY 15..SHE LOVED IT..SO ALL THIS TO SAY..I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANY MORE LIPSTICKS FROM SHANY COSMETICS.</li>
    <li> i didnt like this product it is very Similar to lip balm not a lipstick .. i dont recommend .</li>
    <li> These colors really brighten up my face - love them! Go on smooth and last long! I have a hard time finding lipsticks that I like so I am really pleased to have found these! I will stock up!</li>
    <li> The gold things fell off of the top of 4 of the lipsticks as soon as I opened the box they were packed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the colors are much lighter than I thought they would be. They also aren&#x27;t very thick. They are more like colored lipgloss than lipstick. It&#x27;s a good beginner lipstick so I gave it to my little sister to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price does fit the product.  I don&#x27;t regret the buy because my little sister likes them, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for myself.</li>
    <li> Was very excited to receive this product in the mail and after reading the reviews I felt very comfortable making this purchase.  Unfortunately, I was not very satisfied after using these lipsticks and had many issues with them:&lt;br /&gt;1. As soon as I received them I tried on all of them and one broke in half.&lt;br /&gt;2. We&#x27;re very dry.  Also if your used to using MAC lipstick this is nothing like their colors and I could definitely tell that these were way cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;3. The caps and lids just popped off all the time. I couldn&#x27;t even take them with me anywhere in my purse because the lids came off and ended up everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I ended up throwing them all away.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is not bad at all...it don&#x27;t last all day but its good enough..I love the different colors and its fun to change up my look everyday..if Shaney adds one more color that is..But I am a full time college student and I do go to school to learn but it&#x27;s a fashion show at Texas State University..so it&#x27;s a win win looking good while learning this lipstick is A1...</li>
    <li> Great colors just not exactly the colors u think I are getting. One pink, one red, one orange, one brown and two purples</li>
    <li> the color doesnt last long and the melt like quick i left it in my bathroom over night in a shelve and i came back in the next morning it was all in and over the shelve</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it !! The cover is losse!! I need to put it in a plastic bag !! I will never buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even it this itam?</li>
    <li> the colors work for me.</li>
    <li> The only &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; I use on a daily basis is lipstick, so when I came across this set of six I thought why not give it a try.  I wanted to purchase some of the colors included in the set anyway and so far have used four of the six.  I always prep my lips with some type of lip balm and I&#x27;m presently using Carmex.  After rubbing in the balm a bit so it&#x27;s not sitting on top of my lips, I apply the lipstick, blot with a tissue and apply again.  The lipstick goes on creamy smooth both times and provides adequate coverage. The black tubes are sleek looking, giving them an expensive look.  I really like MAC brand lipstick, but buying six at once...not in my budget.  These do nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a breat value for your money.  The product is great and the price is even better.  Comes in a nice case.</li>
    <li> Product looked just like in the photos the colors show up really well, but the casing however that the lipsticks are in are rather cheaply made the tops fall off very easy so ladies watch your purse -__-</li>
    <li> I was very excited about buying these, I had recently purged my cabinet of old makeup and wanted a few different go-to colors to replace the older lipsticks I got rid of. I really like the colors, they are bright and pretty, but a few are too dark for my skin tone and they are mostly purple-ish shades, which can be hard to pull off for a lot of people. They also fade very fast, which is a shame, because the few that do look good on me I really love, and it&#x27;s annoying to have to re-apply them so often, especially while at work. I have not used them with a lip primer, so I&#x27;m sure that would make a difference. I&#x27;m glad I have them- they definitely come in handy, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing them again.</li>
    <li> I sort of bought this item by mistake. I was attempting to buy the Fairytale Kisses set but I had this item in my cart instead. First of all, the product was in a very nice black box packaging. The glosses went on very smoothly but three of the glosses was very light and sheer in color which was a total disappointment. The ones that did have color was not vibrant either. But since they are glosses I can always build the color on my lips up with lipsticks and other glosses.</li>
    <li> In my package i found a set of lip gloss rather than what i have ordered. I had ordered for a set of lip stick as described in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;I really did not like it and so i rated service for this product as very bad.</li>
