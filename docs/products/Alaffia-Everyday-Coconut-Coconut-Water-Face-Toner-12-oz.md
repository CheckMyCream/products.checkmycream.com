    <li> great product.  will order it again!</li>
    <li> Yes at first the smell is off putting because it&#x27;s coconuty with papaya and neem but by the second or third day it grows on you. The bottle is huge and will last you a long time, ingredients are high quality and as a toner this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, not to mention this brand does a lot for its workers and the environment, worth every dollar in my opinion.</li>

    <li> I love this product. I use it every morning after I shower and before moisturizing. It&#x27;s so refreshing. In the summer months, I use it later in the day to refresh my hot and sweaty face!</li>
    <li> There is no negative star, so I&#x27;m giving it a &amp;#34;one:&amp;#34; this product stank, gave me an allergy attack.  You might say I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Great product received it very fast!!</li>
    <li> Burns very badly, my skin turned dark red - washed it off within 5 minutes, but it burned for hours afterwards. I&#x27;ve never had this reaction to any skincare product. I wanted to love this, it sounds so awesome - but alas, it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I adore all of Alaffia&#x27;s products with the exception of this one. It totally burned the skin on my face to the point that it was red and parched like a sunburn. I tried using it in my hair, per recommendation of the salesgirl at Whole Foods, but it destroyed my hair too. There is just something in this that doesn&#x27;t agree with me. Had to toss it out!</li>
    <li> Im not sure if its from the product, but I&#x27;ve used it several times and broke out in a small rash with some whiteheads.  Could be a coincidence, but not sure until I try and use it again.  It also has a weird fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> Incredible stuff :) I use it everyday and night and it is so refreshing and hydrating for the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Leaves my skin feeling amazing and after I add lotion, my skin glows.  Very Pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in &#x27;&#x27; with this new product and wonder why it hasn&#x27;t been in my beauty regiment all my life!</li>
    <li> not very good for my skin ,i don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff! I spritz some on after cleansing my face. Leaves my skin cooled and refreshed :)</li>
    <li> I love these products. I was scared to switch because my skin is extremely sensitive to everything. This works perfect on my sensitive skin. I use it at night &amp; during the day under makeup with night cream.</li>
    <li> Great product, but spray nozzle busted after having it for only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase, recommend!</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for some previous reviews that mentioned this toner would smell bad if the concentration of neem was too high, I would have thought that all the other reviewers gushing about it&#x27;s amazing smell were crazy. I unfortunately got one of those &amp;#34;bad bottles&amp;#34;. It smelled so stank. Like body odor. And it lingered....... I used it twice and sent it back in for a refund because I could not get past the smell. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s an amazing product, I LOVE the ingredients that are used. Even neem, for all it&#x27;s stankness, is supposed to be wonderful for your skin. But I don&#x27;t feel like getting into a back and forth with Amazon until a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; bottle is sent to me.</li>
