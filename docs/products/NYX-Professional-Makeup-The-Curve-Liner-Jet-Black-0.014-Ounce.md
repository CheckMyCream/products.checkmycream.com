<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The shape takes a little getting use to, and I don&#x27;t think it particularly matters.  The eye liner itself works fine.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive the NYX the curve eyeliner because I really wanted to try it and it was 5 bucks cheaper on amazon than the NYX&#x27;S website, so I go it on here. When I got it I noticed right away that it was a replica. It feels really cheap. But I will say that it works amazing. And my wings come out great everytime. So next time I&#x27;ll just buy it off of NYX&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> Excellent work all the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent eyeliner is easy to applicate and it lasts without smudging. The shape helps to draw a perfect line in your eye.</li>
    <li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t find that the shape made any difference for me as far as ease of application; I noticed in the reviews that some people did find it made a difference, so maybe you want to try it and see if it does for you. For me it really didn&#x27;t. But I did like the substance, itself: it really did stay on for a long time, and I felt it had a bit of a charcoal look but with the bold darkness of a liquid eyeliner. I thought it looked pretty. Still just as challenging for me to apply as other liquid eyeliners, though, and I still made mistakes.</li>
    <li> Great colour and true black. The applicator is certainly ergonomic and allows for easy application to the eye. Good buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on yourself however impossible to put on others. It&#x27;s ok as far as quality goes but there are definitely better eyeliners out there. I&#x27;d this for beginners learning how to use eyeliner but for experienced users I&#x27;d steer clear from it.</li>
    <li> I love how its very easy to hold but... the eyeliner is very dry. It&#x27;s very hard to use on your top eyelid. I dont recommend this product if you are aiming for the cateye look.</li>
    <li> Easiest eyeliner to use ever. Makes even the winged eye almost foolproof. Goes on very smoothly and stays for days.</li>
    <li> If there would be an option for cero stars, that&#x27;s what I would&#x27;ve given this seller. Since November 14 I&#x27;ve been contacting them, they are advertising a pack of 10, and all I got was one single eye liner. This seller has not given me a response, a refund or a redelivery. They are very unprofessional, please don&#x27;t buy from them, they are promoting false advertisement. This review will stay as is if I don&#x27;t get a response, ripoffs.</li>
    <li> This is the first curved liner i have tried- i LOVE it! it&#x27;s also pretty awesome that NYC products are cruelty free. I wear glasses so i really like that i can get closer to the mirror to apply this- the shape of it was no issue for me, i just hold it the same way as a pencil. i will defiantly buy more when i run out.</li>
    <li> Exactly like a marker except eyeliner. Great precision &amp; ergonomically sound. Recommended for beginners. Even so, I would get it anyways for days when you are in a crunch and need to line your eyes real quick!</li>
    <li> It smears on my upper eye lid, but very easy to apply! Easy to hold and very dark black.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Love it, glides on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t bleed or run... great product.</li>
    <li> 45 MINS AFTER I PUT THIS ON MY EYES LOOK ALL BLACK AND RUNNY NOT WORTH THE 15 PRICE! BETTER BUYING HARD CANDY FOR 5 BUCKS! THIS LINER IS HORRIBLE</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve involved but once you figure it out your eyeliner is perfect every time. It&#x27;s so easy to use! Symmetry isn&#x27;t a problem either.</li>
    <li> Way too dark for me.  Looks painted. Not easily smudged.&lt;br /&gt;I got it because it looked good on someone else, but typically eyeliner looks harsh on me unless it is smudged.</li>
    <li> I used to use the pen type eyeliner from a different brand, until I found this. The curve makes it really easy to hold while applying. I use it for my eyelid, it gives me a sleak, straight, and thin cat eye every time. It lasts for about five months, and that was with daily use. I highly recommend this product. NYX is a great brand, I also use their eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> the shape of it is really unique and it makes it 100x easier to apply eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how thin the line is too and it&#x27;s also not hard to make it thick either.</li>
    <li> Love this liner!  Very easy to apply, as it offers great control.</li>
    <li> I bought boxes of the eyeliner because it would be a great gift for my friends when they come to visit me after my baby shower.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product but it actually seems to not contain very much eyeliner in it. I have only had it for a short time and it&#x27;s already completely run out. It gets 4 stars for being a quality product but I feel tricked for having spent so much on so little product.</li>
    <li> After using this for about 2 weeks I noticed it was drying out. Good for the first few weeks but would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved the design, great for product application  but, the liner did not wear well for me. I tried this product once.</li>
    <li> this is a great eyeliner!  it is very smooth and glides on evenly and very easy to use will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected at all!  The curve actually makes it more difficult to put on! Guess I will be going back to cheaper drugstore brands that are very similar in the eyeliner.  Paying for the curve is not worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> Loved this! But idk if I&#x27;d buy it again. I liked the curve part and how it went on. But I am bias to MAC and Dior so I got this just to try it.</li>
    <li> Good eyeliner easy to use and went on well but fades and does not last after a days wear. Also this dries out very fast so you have to store it correctly. Unfortunately I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner is not anything as described..first of all its dry I payed 10.00 for a worthless not even waterproof eyeliner marker..the curve doesn&#x27;t make it easy to apply it sucks plain and simple dnt wase your money</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this eyeliner for the last year and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. It glides on seamlessly and is perfect for the cat eye look. If your having problems with it drying out then I suggest you return it. I haven&#x27;t had this problem unless the bottle is almost empty.</li>
    <li> Love to have a small line of eyeliner and the shape and angle of the eyeliner works wonders.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye liner. Luckily I was able to buy it on Amazon because they never stock it in my local grocery store. This liner creates flawless lines with a unique grip and great color. It&#x27;s great for everyday wear, and even a more glamorous look.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim. Just something to try. I saw it in Target, but it was around $13 so I didnt get it from there. I love eyeliner. Especially doing a cat eye. I&#x27;ve tried it all - pencil, gel, liquid. Where was this stuff years ago?! It&#x27;s AMAZING. The simplest and quickest way that I&#x27;ve been able to do a cat eye, and with the felt tip applicator, there&#x27;s no mess. I plan on purchasing a few more, because I never want to be without this product. It&#x27;s a gem. Perfect for on the go. So easy, you could apply it in the car!</li>
    <li> The product is fabulous. Really easy to apply and it lasts without smudging. It&#x27;s met my expectations. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of NYX cosmetics and I&#x27;m happy with both purchases.  As far as the Curve Waterproof Felt Tip Liquid Eye Liner goes... the shape of the bottle is ergonomically designed to make it easy for application.  Lashes don&#x27;t get in the way because of the angle of the tip.  I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite liquid eyeliner.  The ergonomic design really makes application easy.</li>
    <li> Very slick, sleek look. A little odd shaped at first, but once you angle it right your eyeliner comes out clean! Love it!</li>
    <li> Too difficult to use. Too weak. It is definitely not the liner for oily skin or warm weather. It smudges all over the place. I wish it had better staying power.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I would definitely buy this again. It goes on smooth and lasts all day. I love how easy it is to use and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s super dark and precise</li>
    <li> Love it!!! BEST EYELINER I ever used...</li>
    <li> have been looking for a great liquid eyeliner to use fo a long time and when I came across this one I decided to try it because of its cool shape. I am 100% in love with it and it is very easy to use if you are an eyeliner pro like myself.</li>
    <li> Very neat.  Easy to hold, great black.  Liner was dark, smooth  and easy to use.  Helps those that don&#x27;t have the best application techniques.</li>
    <li> This product is not for me! I&#x27;m not a person with sensitive eyes or allergies, but this liner makes my eyes tear. Would not recommend to anyone with sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Loveeee it! I am not a pro when concerns eyeliner but NYX curved design is helping me doing my cat eyes with confidence and precision. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Goes on smoothly and accurately. Stays on literally until you wash it off. Love this product.</li>
    <li> It ok, but not so easy as i expected! I wont buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrive on time, in good shape.</li>
    <li> A bit harder to use then it seems but I will continue to try! Very good eyeliner and long lasting! Although it feels cheap. (the container) I love it though!</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift for my friend and she loves it. she always had issues w/ drawing nice clean lines for her liner, and now she says it is super easy. the design of this liner makes it easy to apply. also the formula is pretty good and doesn&#x27;t crumble, smear, or fade.</li>
    <li> I struggle with eyeliner because my left eye has a small scar and this glides perfectly over it like its not even there. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t find it years ago!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to apply, good control due to shape.  I would recommend this product to everyone who loves a liquid liner.</li>
    <li> Love this ! Last pretty much all day, easy to apply, and leaves you with a dramatic eye.</li>
    <li> I love this! my favorite liquid liner. It was so much cheaper. It&#x27;s 15.00 at CVS!</li>
    <li> My little sister requested liquid eye liner as a christmas gift. I thought it was a pretty lame request considering you can go to any store and buy decent eye liner for a decent price. I wanted to make it seem a little &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; than regular liquid eye liner so, of course, I hit up amazon and this is what I find: the coolest looking eye liner ever. I feel guilty saying this but, I tried it out when it came in the mail, and the felt tip thing it just amazing. It&#x27;s really easy to hold too with that awesome curved shape. Highly recommended. I must buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> Sounded like a great idea.....but....doesn&#x27;t work any better then others.&lt;br /&gt;And the brush kept coming off . Don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> A little awkward to hold but it&#x27;s great line</li>
    <li> I do like this product. It gives me the look i am looking for!!!!!! I would highly  recommened this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is easy to use and stays on all day. If you a first time eyeliner user this is the one</li>
    <li> i didnt know what to expect but it has a comfortable feel and it come on really really easily . i loved it!</li>
    <li> I have been a liquid eyeliner user for years now. (I am a big fan of the swooped cat eye look.) I have tried every brand from $5-$40 and this has been by far my best find yet. I live in Florida, where the humidity has no mercy, and this liner doesn&#x27;t smudge, run or smear. (Sometimes liquid liner in high heat conditions will smudge to the upper eyelid...this has never happened and it&#x27;s July!!) - It can be easily removed with makeup remover wipes and the shape of the pen makes the application process a breeze. I highly recommend this product. The only advice I can give is to let your liner dry for about 30 seconds after application!</li>
    <li> It dries out, the tip is NOWHERE near as pointed as in the picture (so don&#x27;t be fooled), while it&#x27;s easier to apply due to the shape, I will agree... It isn&#x27;t worth buying. If you&#x27;re looking for noticeable eyeliner, look elsewhere. Sorry guys.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a hard time putting eyeliner on. This is so easy to use and she does not smear it all over the place. She said this was her answer. They NYX Cosmetics for making her life a little easier when getting ready in the morning!</li>
    <li> great liner, is very percise liner, great quality. no dislikes used on the eyes love how black it is. a keeper</li>
    <li> Good for beginners to learn liquid liner, gives you a super thin line and easy to hold!&lt;br /&gt;Love all NYX products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard that this had a really easy-to-control applicator, and I would agree with that. I just expected it to be blacker than it is since it&#x27;s advertised as a liquid liner, so even though it&#x27;s easy to use, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This was advertised as the best and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;There are others better and easier for less Monet.&lt;br /&gt;The flow is not good.</li>
    <li> I put the cap on and the flimsy thing fell off and it dried out after one night</li>
    <li> The way the wand is shaped makes this product very easy to handle/use and control. The product also has staying power. It&#x27;s still on at the end of the evening, even if I rub it a little. I bought several.</li>
    <li> I bought mine directly from NYX when I couldn&#x27;t get it locally.  The felt applicator is similar to [[ASIN:B002LFRRIK Maybelline New York Line Stiletto Ultimate Precision Liquid Eyeliner, Blackest Black 501, 0.05 Fluid Ounce]] but drier and darker.  Ultimately, I found the Maybelline and other liquid eyeliners easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Possible to create a fine line right next to the lashes&lt;br /&gt;- Did not smear when I curled my eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;- Color lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;- No flaking&lt;br /&gt;- Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- I see no advantage in the curve.  I actually prefer a long thin brush (5/0).&lt;br /&gt;- Drier than my Mabelline and Almay liquid waterproof liners.&lt;br /&gt;- By the end of the first day it was smeared above and below my eyes.  I&#x27;ve never had an eyeliner do that.  When I use a powder based foundation rather than a cream or only lightly moisturize my eyelids, it reduces but doesn&#x27;t eliminate the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11 Months later: I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner dozens of times and the curve has NOT grown on me.  I find my liquid eyeliners easier to apply but they don&#x27;t last quite as well as this one.  At the end of the day, this eyeliner is just as dark as when I started while the others have worn off in places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite eyeliner is [[ASIN:B000Q4VBDA Almay intense i-color Play Up Liquid Liner, Black Pearl 023, 0.8 Ounce Package]].  It is easy to apply, is easy for me to smudge to give it a natural look, stays put, and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I recd this eyeliner as a gift from an event and struggled to find it in the stores. The prod is so good it stays on and is easy to apply that I ordered two. package arrived quickly prod was fresh and billing was perfect. shipping fees nominal.</li>
    <li> Smudges HORRIBLY. After a two hour meeting I looked like a raccoon. It&#x27;s highly pigmented and easy to apply--if it didn&#x27;t smudge it would be great! But it does...</li>
    <li> I love the design. Super easy to apply. The staying power was just not there. It smudged, and transferred to my upper eyelid</li>
    <li> Liquid eyeliner is not easy for me,  and I saw this in a couple of magazines,  so I wanted to give it a try.  I did all right on one eye but it isn&#x27;t any easier for me with my non-dominant hand than any other brand I have tried,  and my eyelash curler wipes some off every time.  Maybe someone else would have better luck--it does have staying power once it is dry.</li>
    <li> The only problem I had is the shape. It takes a while to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I do not see the point of this eyeliner.  I bought it because it came up as hypoallergenic on Amazon and I was getting over an eye infection.  I do not understand why it curves, plus it got erased no joke within like an hour of my putting it on.  Am definitely free cycling it.</li>
    <li> I recommended this to anyone that never used liquid liner before! The design really made it easy for you to apply on you eyes lid!! make you life much easier love love it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s palm friendly shape really does what it says to fit comfortably in your hand, and indeed you can get a precise, straight line with that tip, the only con for me is that with my super oily skin, it would run.  Again, that was the only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Kind of large for my hands. I wish it came in other colors. Would love a brown color.&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone wears black.</li>
    <li> Really good product nice packaging it came just when it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is it smudges alot (I have oily eyelids)&lt;br /&gt;Other than that Its ok for non oily eyelids, my friends find the shape of it interesting and I get asked about this product alot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Karen Mendiola</li>
    <li> The biggest problem I had with this eyeliner is that after a couple hours, it begins to stick to your eyelid. So after a while you&#x27;ll have this big ol&#x27; black line on your eyelid that will ruin your whole makeup. Other than that, it&#x27;s okay. Milani sells an eyeliner just like this one and it&#x27;s for half the price and works twice as better. I love NYX Cosmetics but this product is a bad one. Unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I liked it only got it because I saw Yolanda Renee on You Tube use it.</li>
    <li> I have used them all, pencils, liquids, cremes.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the design of the Curve allows me to put on a very thin line, which I desire. Also, it is long lasting. Even using eye primers, most liners end up in my crease, but I think partially because I can get such a thin line, I have not notice this being much of an issue as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought my second liner and will continue to buy it. I have spent a ton looking for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; black liner and my purchase previously was for a $25 brush to put on a $28 creme liner. Wish I would have seen this sooner! Very happy....</li>
