### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The \\&quot;tan\\&quot; shade is perfect for me</li>
      <li>Perhaps the best thing about the Hydroxatone Anti-Aging BB Cream is the SPF 40 sunscreen factor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this product provides excellent SPF&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>This is an awesome product</li>
      <li>Coverage is very good.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this product blended in with my skintone perfectly.</li>
      <li>providing the look and feel of a desired type of foundation while still providing an attractive</li>
      <li>An SPF of 40 is great.  </li>
      <li>BB cream is very popular in Asia.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice product.  </li>
      <li>and it gives good protection and looks great ðŸ˜Š</li>
      <li>I have a fair to medium skintone.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and the \\&quot;tan\\</li>
      <li>They contain all the products you would need for good skincare in one cream.</li>
      <li>ThIs beauty balm goes on nice and easy, it provides a great coverage, you can feel the moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>and it seems like every brand has their own version.  </li>
      <li>this is a nice sunscreen that keeps me protected and kept me hydrated, it has some properties of a foundation, and gave me a tad darker skin tone</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was nice to have a moisturizer and cover-up all in one and knowing there is some SPF protection helps in keeping the wrinkles</li>
      <li>It looks like I have a nice tan.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re wondering about the price, just add up the price of your make up foundation and moisturizers and you&#x27;ll see that this is cost effective while still providing the protection/coverage for every day use.</li>
      <li>It is nice and seems to work for me</li>

      <li>this is tan then the lightest shade must be suitable for alabaster skin.</li>
      <li>BB Cream is the latest \\&quot;it\\&quot; thing in the beauty world</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>&quot; creams are the latest fads in \\&quot;beauty creams\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I was impressed that this did not cause a similar reaction.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worked OK</li>
      <li>still love this cream, and in fact was going to order some...</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t been able to test</li>
      <li>However this is meant to be used as more of a sunblock with a skin tone tint, than used as an every day makeup foundation.</li>
      <li>Instead, I use Oil of Olay underneath to make sure I don&#x27;t get too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I have always enjoyed an all in one beauty cream and have used them for years before they were called beauty balms.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many a BB and CC cream and this is not one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel that my face is better toned or a clearer canvass.</li>
      <li>The color was perfect for my olive colored skin and it disappeared quickly, leaving no thick residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives my skin a nice glow and very little coverage which is what I love because it just looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing and that my skin just looks flawless.</li>
      <li>The coverage is smooth and very light.  </li>
      <li>Its average at best.</li>
      <li>and I have to say I am not super impressed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tall order for this to fit into all categories:  </li>
      <li>It kept my face hydrated and went on smooth.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand this product to be honest.  </li>
      <li>It has a light color to it</li>
      <li>This is so light and comfortable to wear, doesn&#x27;t feel like anything but moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This was a silky smooth cream and coverup</li>
      <li>My powder is Light Translucent Lucidity by Estee Lauder.  </li>
      <li>All of these are fantastic products that I would recommend.  </li>
      <li>What drew me originally to this product was its multifunctional nature.  </li>
      <li>The color is nice--enough to give tint but light enough to work over a good spectrum of \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It is nothing special.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair naturally, and if in the sun at all tend to tan prolificly, suncreen or no</li>
      <li>Its penetrative moisturizing properties are effective for leaving an evenly distributed, soft and supple skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a really nice silky feel, and did not irritate my sensitive</li>
      <li>The hydration feeling also kept my feeling cool</li>
      <li>I make sure it&#x27;s on nice and thick to get that kind of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And the whole point of the product is to avoid a tan anyway.  :)</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m guess that&#x27;s just because I tan quickly after the suncreen wears off?).  </li>
      <li>It goes on without any greasiness and has a mild scent.  </li>
      <li>For under 30$ (at the time of this review), I think it is a pretty good value for all of the above that were mentioned that it can do.</li>
      <li>results have actually been pretty good.  </li>
      <li>What makes this different is they&#x27;ve added a bit of a color to it, so that instead of applying bright white sunblock to your face, it blends into skin better like a makeup foundation.</li>
      <li>Actually, CC Cream is more like a smooth lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to worry much about aging naturally, but for those who do this nice coverage this cream provides is a plus.</li>
      <li>B008C130XS Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Fresh BB Cream]]</li>
      <li>My only problem is that if you look close in the mirror, it can look kind of cakey.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a nice product but back off on the fragrance!</li>
      <li>It spreads on smoothly and absorbs quickly, which is nice, but leaves my skin feeling odd...</li>
      <li>So light neither of us looks made up, which is appropriate for a girl her age, and for me, a older mom who prefers a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>&quot; was just right for me.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, her skin is sensitive and rather fare, so the slightly higher SPF protects her skin</li>
      <li>This is great for the weekend when all you really want is a moisturizer and SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin that is often red and blotchy</li>
      <li>Since there are only 3 shades, it&#x27;s not going to be a perfect match like you would get when you typically chose a makeup.</li>
      <li>My personal preference is for something significantly lighter feeling than foundation and this is not as light as I prefer.</li>
      <li>They have little to do with this product except to illustrate how fair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now that warmer weather is finally here, I will probably use it more just for the SPF 40 protection but when falls comes, I&#x27;ll return to just tinted moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my first time using a BB cream</li>
      <li>It thought BB Cream was more like Olay Total Effects CC Cream.  </li>
      <li>so was interested to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wish the suncreen benefits lasted longer!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this as I really like the results!</li>
      <li>and I think they are more hype and not enough results for the price of the product.</li>
      <li>FIRST, LET&#x27;S TALK COLOR.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You do not need much!</li>
      <li>In fact, after this was finished she actually bought more.</li>
      <li>and my skin feels smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I use it every single day with a little blush and it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
      <li>Smart to have all in one package, you&#x27;d think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does nothing much for my face.</li>
      <li>This is a sunscreen and tinted moisturizer in one so it can serve as makeup too if you only need light coverage.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t water resistant, but doesn&#x27;t wash off readily.</li>
      <li>The Tan color blended with my skin tone very well.  </li>
      <li>I assume those are based on the SPF, but if you are looking for shear coverage that is gentle and not shiny, try this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
      <li>I rubbed it in as much as I could</li>
      <li>really</li>
      <li>I have the Hydroxatone day and night cream, and I really like it, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Meh! I have tried many a BB and CC cream and this is not one of my favorites. It does nothing much for my face. I don&#x27;t feel that my face is better toned or a clearer canvass. Perhaps it works well for others, but for me it is one BB cream I know I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m in the sun a lot and it gives good protection and looks great ðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> My complaint is NOT with the product.  It is with the quantity.  I intended to order a total of three (3) boxes (tubes) was nowhere on the form to list quantity.  When I finally got through to a human (or robot), I was told the order &amp;#34;was already being processed&amp;#34; and I would have to re-order (this was within 15 min.).  Seems ridiculous to have to place 3 orders to get 3 of the same item!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product</li>
    <li> Well, it does cover, I&#x27;ll give it that. I have dry skin and the thick heavy consistency of the BB cream reminded me of the bad old days when I used to have to put thick greasy emollient on my skin, before manufacturers came out with lighter fresher creams, even for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, especially since I have to reapply every two hours, apply if I get it wet or go swimming, and it goes on like something that should be applied by a trowel. It also smells a little funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage was good, but as thick as it is it should be, it&#x27;s like putting plaster putty on my face, no wrinkle would dare crack through! the tan is dark and a little orange on my skin. I would probably go back to a high spf sun screen and regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> What drew me originally to this product was its multifunctional nature.  You get the moisturizer with a tint that protects from sun damage while preventing aging.  Smart to have all in one package, you&#x27;d think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, this may be one of those cases where one might just prefer having the separate products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to say this doesn&#x27;t work.  It provides plenty of moisture.  I trust its sunscreen qualities.  The color is nice--enough to give tint but light enough to work over a good spectrum of \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.  Granted, the anti-aging is definitely something that will take awhile to test, but all the necessities seem to be in order for it to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I complaining? I don&#x27;t like putting this stuff on.  It&#x27;s incredibly thick and heavy, no doubt the result of all the aforementioned nice qualities.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, per say, but there&#x27;s definitely a constant reminder there is something on my face and it&#x27;s difficult to adjust amount for color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars because yes, I believe, the product does what it sets out to do.  But only three stars as it&#x27;s just not pleasant for me.  I&#x27;ll stick to separate products, thank-you.</li>
    <li> ThIs beauty balm goes on nice and easy, it provides a great coverage, you can feel the moisturizing.  I like that it has a 40 SPF.  I have always enjoyed an all in one beauty cream and have used them for years before they were called beauty balms.  I couldn&#x27;t tell you if the cream works at anti aging, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  My only draw back was that this cream was a little more peachy then my skin tone actually is.</li>
    <li> BB Cream is the latest \\&quot;it\\&quot; thing in the beauty world and it seems like every brand has their own version.  I typially wear tinted moisturizer rather than foundation and have used some of the Hydroxatone skin care products so was interested to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has a fair amount of color (for someone of Scandinavian descent) and I tan easily.  The Tan color blended with my skin tone very well.  My issue is that this product feels heavier (and slightly greasier) than tinted moisturizer -- and the reason I wear tinted moisturizer is for a very light product to even out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that warmer weather is finally here, I will probably use it more just for the SPF 40 protection but when falls comes, I&#x27;ll return to just tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t mean the 2-star rating to indicate this is not a good product.  I find that make-up, and how women want it to feel on their faces, is a fairly personal thing.  just because I&#x27;m not wild about the feeling of this product shouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone else from trying it.  My personal preference is for something significantly lighter feeling than foundation and this is not as light as I prefer.</li>
    <li> BB\\&quot; creams are the latest fads in \\&quot;beauty creams\\&quot;. They contain all the products you would need for good skincare in one cream. They contain sunscreen, moisturizer, anti-aging properties and foundation in the convenience of one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen in this product is Titanium Dioxide (7.72%) which is a physical sunscreen. I like that. I try to avoid products with chemical sunscreens. I prefer products that contain the physical sunscreens Zinc Oxide or Titanium Dioxide. Physical sunscreens work immediately when you put them on your skin. Chemical sunscreens take about Â½ to 1 hour before they are effective. Just as a FYI, the instructions say to apply 15 minutes before sun exposure. I&#x27;m not sure what benefit that would have as this is a physical sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried the tan color of this product would be too dark for my skin. I have a fair to medium skintone. Currently, my summer tan is completely faded away. Surprisingly, this product blended in with my skintone perfectly. But it also seemed to blend in too well and not give the coverage a foundation would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is not bad, but not great either. I think I still prefer to have separate products and have control over how much of each I apply.</li>
    <li> It thought BB Cream was more like Olay Total Effects CC Cream.  Actually, CC Cream is more like a smooth lotion.  BB Cream is more like a thick cream.  It&#x27;s very thick.  In fact, it&#x27;s so thick it&#x27;s dry.  I don&#x27;t feel the moisturizing quality in it.  Instead, I use Oil of Olay underneath to make sure I don&#x27;t get too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream can be used as a foundation.  Coverage is very good.  It evens out my skin tone and fills in my pores so that my skin shows fewer blemishes.  It looks like I have a nice tan.  An SPF of 40 is great.  I make sure it&#x27;s on nice and thick to get that kind of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I prefer Olay CC Cream, because it&#x27;s thinner so I can just throw it on.  And it&#x27;s moisturizing.  BB Cream loses a point on not truly being an all-in-one as it claims, but it&#x27;s a better \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; than CC Cream.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It is not irritating to my eyes, which is unusual for a sunscreen.  It is a tinted product and evens out skin tone a little, but it is not a concealer by any means, and if you usually use foundation, I don&#x27;t think this will replace it. The \\&quot;tan\\&quot; shade is perfect for me and I&#x27;m a little darker than average for a Caucasian.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to test it&#x27;s sun screening powers because it&#x27;s been a dreary cold winter and now the rainy season is here but it&#x27;s worked OK so far.&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive than I like but because it doesn&#x27;t irritate I will probably consider buying it again.</li>
    <li> I think the choice to use an expensive product like this comes down to if you are particular about your foundation type.  Because this looks and goes on just like make up foundation.  Some prefer less oily, cleaner foundation and some prefer stronger, thicker foundation with more coverage.  Others just want/need a loose powder.  It&#x27;s a tall order for this to fit into all categories:  providing the look and feel of a desired type of foundation while still providing an attractive finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I think I&#x27;d rather stick to a moisturizer under my preferred makeup foundation. I prefer something lighter, water based, and without the scent of this particular product.  But if I didn&#x27;t have that preference, I think I&#x27;d definitely switch to this all-in-one product.  If you&#x27;re wondering about the price, just add up the price of your make up foundation and moisturizers and you&#x27;ll see that this is cost effective while still providing the protection/coverage for every day use.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work.  I usually put it on before going out to work in the yard or anytime when I plan to be in the sun.  It protected me from the sun and kept my face hydrated.  It has a light color to it (makes me look a little darker), but that is OK since it does its job at protecting me from the sun.  It kept my face hydrated and went on smooth.  It is a tad thick (like an older sunscreen, not the newer spray on invisible).  I rubbed it in as much as I could and you could still feel it on there, however, this is to be expected from sunscreen.  I cannot talk about the anti aging, since I still have wrinkles and other blemishes, but for the most part it does keep my face hydrated while outside in the sun and I did not sunburn.  The hydration feeling also kept my feeling cool when outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end this is a nice sunscreen that keeps me protected and kept me hydrated, it has some properties of a foundation, and gave me a tad darker skin tone (that washed off with the cream).  It is nice and seems to work for me, I like the hydrated feeling it gives, and that helps keep me cooler in the sun.</li>
    <li> With it&#x27;s broad spectrum SPF 40 formula, I can see using this cream for days when you&#x27;re sitting out on the beach, or maybe while taking the kids to the water park. Any time you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun and don&#x27;t want to get sunburn. The cream is thick, like you would get if you were just applying sun block in an SPF 40 strength. What makes this different is they&#x27;ve added a bit of a color to it, so that instead of applying bright white sunblock to your face, it blends into skin better like a makeup foundation. Since there are only 3 shades, it&#x27;s not going to be a perfect match like you would get when you typically chose a makeup. However this is meant to be used as more of a sunblock with a skin tone tint, than used as an every day makeup foundation. Pefect for keeping in the beach bag or with your water park gear.</li>
    <li> This was a silky smooth cream and coverup but it had a heavy perfumy kind of smell. The color was perfect for my olive colored skin and it disappeared quickly, leaving no thick residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to have a moisturizer and cover-up all in one and knowing there is some SPF protection helps in keeping the wrinkles away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest drawback is that it is heavily scented which I kept smelling all day as I was wearing it. Because of that, I will be hesitant to use it taking away any benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice product but back off on the fragrance!</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin in the winter.  Although I use a humidifier in the house, I find that my skin still shows that winter dryness.  It goes on without any greasiness and has a mild scent.  It&#x27;s also a foundation, so it&#x27;s tinted, but seems to blend well with my skin tone.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I can already see a difference.  With daily use, I&#x27;m finding that my skin seems to be less dry.  There have been no winter flakes and my skin feels smooth and soft.  I&#x27;m going to continue using this as I really like the results!</li>
    <li> This product does what it says.  It is tinted and virtually hides all the flaws on your face.  My only problem is that if you look close in the mirror, it can look kind of cakey.  So use sparingly.  You do not need much!</li>
    <li> I have the Hydroxatone day and night cream, and I really like it, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m not accustomed to wearing foundation, but I really don&#x27;t like it. It spreads on smoothly and absorbs quickly, which is nice, but leaves my skin feeling odd... a little tight, like it&#x27;s dry, but oily at the same time. I&#x27;ll give it a pass.</li>
    <li> BB cream is very popular in Asia.  It stands for blemish balm or blemish base.  It is sort of a combination of moisturizer, foundation, sunscreen and powder.  If you use a combination of those products, a BB cream is supposed to do it all.  Almost everybody has entered the BB market, even giants like J&amp;J.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression on this BB cream is that it does smoothen the skin.  The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but it is very subjective as some who tried it  thought it was abhorrent.  Sunscreen will only provide limited protection (40 spf), but that is a tad higher than some BB creams in the market that only provide 30 spf.  For under 30$ (at the time of this review), I think it is a pretty good value for all of the above that were mentioned that it can do.</li>
    <li> This stuff works nicely as a foundation; softening hard wrinkles, it applies smoothly and blends well with my deep tan complexion, without leaving a pancake surface in need of concealment. Its penetrative moisturizing properties are effective for leaving an evenly distributed, soft and supple skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a protective sunscreen, its broad-spectrum rating is SPF 40. The package instructions advise use in conjunction with a waterproof sunscreen if swimming or sweating, and reapplication of the product every two hours, a rather short-term for protection from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube contains only one and a half ounces of cream; however, a small amount of the product seems to go a long way when applied and blended away from only trouble spots - for myself the t-zone, the bridge of my nose and at the edges of my eyes - as the cream&#x27;s consistency is rich. It is a pricey little bottle, but it performs nicely and I have not experienced any adverse reactions to the ingredients.</li>
    <li> FIRST, LET&#x27;S TALK COLOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, tan?  They call this tan?  Much paler than any \\&quot;tan\\&quot; foundation I&#x27;ve ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty true to my mix of Irish, Scottish, and Cherokee roots, I suppose.  I&#x27;m pretty fair naturally, and if in the sun at all tend to tan prolificly, suncreen or no (I&#x27;m guess that&#x27;s just because I tan quickly after the suncreen wears off?).  Since I&#x27;m rarely outside these days, I stay pretty pale.  My current foundation is Buff 230 in Lancome&#x27;s 24 hour foundation.  That would be near lighter end of their spectrum.  My powder is Light Translucent Lucidity by Estee Lauder.  My concealer is #2 Boing by Benefit.  All of these are fantastic products that I would recommend.  They have little to do with this product except to illustrate how fair this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is tan then the lightest shade must be suitable for alabaster skin. If you have a \\&quot;Tan\\&quot;--this product will no doubt be pretty pale.  If I had a tan, it would be too pale!  Suits my current skin color well, though.  :)  And the whole point of the product is to avoid a tan anyway.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, LET&#x27;S TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, if you wont be in the sun long.  I really don&#x27;t understand this product to be honest.  It seems to seems to be a suncreen that could stand in for a sheer foundation--but it doesn&#x27;t last long as a sunscreen.  But it needs to be applied every two hours.  I really wish the suncreen benefits lasted longer!  (But, sunscreens in general need reapplication, so that&#x27;s not unusual).&lt;br /&gt;As for the color cover, it is minimal, lightweight, and somewhat natural.  If I AM going to have to reapply sun protection every few hours, it&#x27;s nice that this isn&#x27;t the goopy white stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It has a really nice silky feel, and did not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best thing about the Hydroxatone Anti-Aging BB Cream is the SPF 40 sunscreen factor. I&#x27;ve never been one to worry much about aging naturally, but for those who do this nice coverage this cream provides is a plus. It does have a little tint to it (I have the tan) and goes on quite nicely. Just a small amount covers the skin readily and I didn&#x27;t have any problem with absorption. It isn&#x27;t water resistant, but doesn&#x27;t wash off readily. I still noticed a slight tint after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is expensive, but I think for the small amount I used on my face this tube will last a long while. Another type of sunscreen can be used on extremities and other exposed parts of the body, but I prefer to use a high-factor sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be outside for extended periods of time. I used this in the tropical sun of SW Florida recently and didn&#x27;t burn. I didn&#x27;t stay out for hours, but any exposure longer than a half hour can burn. No burn at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titanium Dioxide 12.16% (sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Phenyl Trimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprate, Glycereth-26, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Dimethicone, Alumina, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein/PVP Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Alcohol, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Potassium Hydroxide, Boron Nitride, Methicone, Sodium PCA, Propanediol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Urea, Silica, Disodium EDTA, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Triethyoxycaprylylsilane, Adenosine, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Oligopeptide-68, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Lecithin, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Foeniculum Vulgare (Fennel) Fruit Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Beta-Glucan, Xanthan Gum, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Sodium Oleate, Sodium Phosphate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, sh-Polypeptide- 7, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Fragrance, Potassium Sorbate, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Methylparaben, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, Iron Oxidescerin, Oligopeptide-68, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Lecithin, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Foeniculum Vulgare (Fennel) Fruit Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Beta-Glucan, Xanthan Gum, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Sodium Oleate, Sodium Phosphate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, sh-Polypeptide- 7, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Fragrance, Potassium Sorbate, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Methylparaben, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, Iron Oxides</li>
    <li> UPDATE:::April 10th&lt;br /&gt;I still love this cream, and in fact was going to order some... when I saw the price.  YIKES!  The current price point is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few BB Creams and absolutely hated them.  I tried [[ASIN:B008C130XS Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Fresh BB Cream]] and it was dreadful.  Made my daughter&#x27;s face break out and I didn&#x27;t like the texture.  I tried another one (sorry, can&#x27;t remember the name at the moment) and it was grossly oily and left both of us shimmering like a layer of oil on a puddle after a storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hydroxatone cream tops them both.  The coverage is smooth and very light.  So light neither of us looks made up, which is appropriate for a girl her age, and for me, a older mom who prefers a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging claims.  I assume those are based on the SPF, but if you are looking for shear coverage that is gentle and not shiny, try this product.</li>
    <li> I picked this up for my wife, who is (obviously) interested in facial creams, cleansers and anti-aging creams.  Hydroxatone is a brand that she uses frequently, which is why she jumped at the chance to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have actually been pretty good.  It&#x27;s tough to review a product like this in a short time frame because you have to give a product like this time to actually work; within a few weeks, it did manage to help conceal smaller wrinkles.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any unpleasant residue, and of course it is easy to use.  What&#x27;s more, her skin is sensitive and rather fare, so the slightly higher SPF protects her skin and there were no side effects or redness after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She recommends using this product and the brand in general.  In fact, after this was finished she actually bought more.</li>
    <li> My go to! I live in really humid climate and I have extremely sensitive skin and this product is the only tinted moisturizer/bb cream that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. I use it every single day with a little blush and it&#x27;s just perfect! It gives my skin a nice glow and very little coverage which is what I love because it just looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing and that my skin just looks flawless. I even once used Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and it was horrible, I broke out like a teenager and it cost a fortune but this BB cream is nothing like that and I highly recommend this product to anyone that is just looking for a tiny bit of coverage and that is looking for an every day bb cream that is just high quality.</li>
    <li> I like this product and the main reason is the feel of it on my face. This is a sunscreen and tinted moisturizer in one so it can serve as makeup too if you only need light coverage. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and you don&#x27;t need another moisturizer with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because some sunscreens can be irritating or stinky and this is not. Regular makeup also tends to feel heavy and starts to dry my skin out by the day&#x27;s end and this does not. This is so light and comfortable to wear, doesn&#x27;t feel like anything but moisturizer. It&#x27;s not heavy or bothersome in anyway. It&#x27;s not enough makeup coverage for going to work or out on the town but for just around the house, it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have fair skin and the \\&quot;tan\\&quot; was just right for me.</li>
    <li> This is great for the weekend when all you really want is a moisturizer and SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin that is often red and blotchy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product provides excellent SPF&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and provides light coverage for the weekends but also a great base for weekdays / evenings out (ie a great base for foundation or powder)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; products that irritated my skin.  I was impressed that this did not cause a similar reaction.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products from Hydroxatone and I think they are more hype and not enough results for the price of the product. Its average at best. It is nothing special. I am 40 and lucky that I don&#x27;t have the dried look yet, but I am trying to keep it that way. But I don&#x27;t see any noticeable results with this. If you are buying this with the idea of it actually doing something great to your skin, I think you may be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a BB cream and I have to say I am not super impressed. It&#x27;s very thick, and you really have to rub it in to make it look good, and doesn&#x27;t seem to offer much coverage. The moisturizing is not great and the scent is not very pleasant. The sun protection is decent, but this is an expensive product to use as an actual skin sun protector.</li>
