      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>Nice job Nivea!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight lotion with a pleasant citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>Nivea never disappoints and this is a really good tanner.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re fair skinned then self tanning can become an experiment in varying shades of orange.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes good too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a nc20 in Mac and the fair</li>
      <li>good moisturizer, it gives a nice sun kissed look after a couple of days of use.  </li>
      <li>Rally liked the color turn out though.</li>
      <li>Its nice if your keeping a tan or want a boost without a deeper tan.</li>
      <li>Also, a very effective moisturizer, in its own right.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, but don&#x27;t like to get too much sun</li>
      <li>Nivea&#x27;s Sun-Kissed Radiant Skin lotion is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far for the body.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a true &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; look, this will not provide it!!  </li>
      <li>The lotion starts off with a sweet scent that is not overpowering and in the world of sunless tanning lotions, quite pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Also the smell is very pleasant :) I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Very light orange</li>
      <li>I am naturally very light skin and don&#x27;t like to experiment with tanning lotions</li>
      <li>It worked for the most part.</li>
      <li>I love nivea</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good gender-neutral self-tanner, as there&#x27;s not as much sparkle or sheen as comes in some brands; it&#x27;s just a nice, even glow, with brightness but not shimmer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Im satisfied with my tan</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>After 3 days I used the lotion again and my skin now looks more darker but</li>
      <li>I used to use the jergens gradual tanner when I needed to, and thought it was okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of tanning lotion and this is the best.</li>
      <li>but there is better out there.</li>
      <li>LOVE that it moisturizes too.  </li>
      <li>Love this and will reccomend.</li>
      <li>I think ideally I&#x27;d recommend it be used to about 2/3 of its fullest extent, as it looks more natural that way.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smell, moisturizing, good to cover white strap lines.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was how good it smells, like a grapefruit,citrus.</li>
      <li>SO moral of the story, amazing amazing amazing product, but ALWAYS apply evenly.</li>
      <li>as realistic as i&#x27;ve seen and a good moisturizer too.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very golden glow, and I was hoping for something more beige or tan (light bronze).</li>
      <li>Have tried several similar products, and like this one best - good color, goes on evenly and with no telltale odor.  </li>
      <li>Normally I don&#x27;t mind being fair skinned</li>
      <li>But if you scrub and remove the excess then its fine.</li>
      <li>It looks genuine and is easy to apply, just like lotion.</li>
      <li>The color of Nivea Sun-kissed Radiant Skin, Fair to Medium, blends so well into ankles and feet, leaving very natural color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s relatively cheap, gives a natural color with a pleasant smell, and won&#x27;t leave you looking like a splotchy pumpkin in July.</li>
      <li>Very gradual tanning, takes days to develop into a nice tan color.  </li>
      <li>The scent is quite light (citrus-y maybe?)</li>
      <li>but this one is lightly scented.</li>
      <li>It actually goes on with a nice fragrance, smells like the kind of tropical drink that should come with an umbrella in it</li>
      <li>I understand the golden choice, given that it&#x27;s for fair skin tones, but just be aware if you&#x27;re buying that it will be noticeable slightly golden or sunny, as opposed to bronze.</li>
      <li>The BEST does not dry out your skin and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>Fades to something with a bit more chemical in it, but very unobtrusive.</li>
      <li>Most sunless tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried end up giving me a very orange shade-</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to the sweet smell of the grape seed oil.  </li>
      <li>it smells good but everytime I took a shower it came off and was gritty.</li>
      <li>My skin is very fair and almost pale looking.</li>
      <li>I love being able to use this for a week or two and have enough color to wear shorts or a skirt without being embarassed.  </li>
      <li>I put it off as a coinecdence but quickly found out this stuff is doing the damage.</li>
      <li>The smell is so easy to live with and the color was light.</li>
      <li>But it smells very close to a regular lotion that might be beach-scented, or to a mild sunscreen that is pleasantly scented.).</li>
      <li>but you could see it in certain light.</li>
      <li>I have very dry, fair skin.</li>
      <li>Like, lightest shade of most foundations kind of pale.</li>
      <li>right before summer so that I will not burn.  </li>
      <li>I love the results I get with this product and love how much money I&#x27;m saving compared to other self tanners I used.</li>
      <li>You have to be very very close to catch it.</li>
      <li>So my first night applying this I thought &amp;#34;ok it won&#x27;t do anything yet</li>
      <li>and I finally feel better about my legs.</li>
      <li>The smell was nice as compared to other self tanners.</li>
      <li>It simply gives a nice natural glow.</li>
      <li>Its OK takes to long to tan</li>
      <li>True to form as far as not staining clothes.</li>
      <li>This stuff does have a nice subtle sun kissed look but a day after use it clogs my pores and causes huge pimples.</li>
      <li>Have used once a day after shower, washed my hands after application and made sure my skin is dry before putting clothes on.</li>
      <li>I woke up the next morning with the most subtle yet gorgeous tan glow.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s got a slight smell, as to be expected, but it&#x27;s by far a very tolerable and almost pleasant self-tanning smell (it definitely smells like self-tanning, which is why I say \\&quot;almost\\&quot; pleasant.</li>
      <li>My skin was much softer and the tone was \\&quot;sunkissed\\&quot; like the bottle says.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
      <li>I love this product because it has minimal to no smell.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this item...</li>
      <li>I really like this because it doesn&#x27;t give your skin the orange look</li>
      <li>It never streaks or creates too much color at one time.</li>
      <li>If it had a squeeze top or had ridges or some other \\&quot;grip\\&quot; option, it would be 5-star.</li>
      <li>all of this sounds pretty good, the reason I only gave it three stars is because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color.</li>
      <li>Because is seems to work a bit more gradually, I also haven&#x27;t had issues with sudden changes in skin color where I didn&#x27;t apply quite enough-</li>
      <li>This lotion is very easy to apply and I&#x27;ve had no issues with color build-up around dry areas such as elbows or knees.  </li>
      <li>it seems to blend much more seamlessly than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
      <li>The color is a natural looking gentle tan.</li>
      <li>Okay let me start off by saying that I am EXTREMELY pale.</li>

    <li> good moisturizer, it gives a nice sun kissed look after a couple of days of use.  no streaks at the beginning.  After few days the skin looks orangy kinda of like build up .  But if you scrub and remove the excess then its fine.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re fair skinned then self tanning can become an experiment in varying shades of orange. Nivea&#x27;s Sun-Kissed Radiant Skin lotion is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far for the body. It&#x27;s gradual, which is important because fast-developing lotions can make pale skin turn traffic-coned colored before you can say \\&quot;where&#x27;s the exfoliant.\\&quot; And it&#x27;s less streaky than other products I&#x27;ve tried. Best of all though, it smells pleasant for a self-tanner. It actually goes on with a nice fragrance, smells like the kind of tropical drink that should come with an umbrella in it and it&#x27;s not too strong. Fades to something with a bit more chemical in it, but very unobtrusive. You have to be very very close to catch it. Nice job Nivea!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it has minimal to no smell. Most smell badly but this one is lightly scented. It never streaks or creates too much color at one time. It moisturizes good too. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale and often feel self conscious during the summer about the shade of my skin, particularly on my legs.  Most sunless tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried end up giving me a very orange shade- something I think is a result of just how pale my skin is.  I&#x27;d never tried Nivea and decided to give it a shot.    After three applications I&#x27;m very happy.  This lotion is very easy to apply and I&#x27;ve had no issues with color build-up around dry areas such as elbows or knees.  Because is seems to work a bit more gradually, I also haven&#x27;t had issues with sudden changes in skin color where I didn&#x27;t apply quite enough- it seems to blend much more seamlessly than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.    As for scent, it far surpasses any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried so far.  The lotion starts off with a sweet scent that is not overpowering and in the world of sunless tanning lotions, quite pleasant.  After the lotion has set, it does have a slight chemical scent, but not overpowering or anything that made me feel self-conscious.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with run-off onto clothes or fabric, but I do let the lotion dry for about ten minutes before letting it rub on to anything.  The extra bonus is the drying component of the lotion- it lasts all day and my skin feels soft and silky, no greasy.    If you&#x27;re looking for a new sunless tanning lotion to try I&#x27;d recommend giving this one a shot.  It&#x27;s relatively cheap, gives a natural color with a pleasant smell, and won&#x27;t leave you looking like a splotchy pumpkin in July.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good gender-neutral self-tanner, as there&#x27;s not as much sparkle or sheen as comes in some brands; it&#x27;s just a nice, even glow, with brightness but not shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little longer to kick in than the bottle says, at least in my experience - over a week as compared to three to five days. True to form as far as not staining clothes. Have waited 5-10 minutes before dressing and it&#x27;s done fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a slight smell, as to be expected, but it&#x27;s by far a very tolerable and almost pleasant self-tanning smell (it definitely smells like self-tanning, which is why I say \\&quot;almost\\&quot; pleasant. But it smells very close to a regular lotion that might be beach-scented, or to a mild sunscreen that is pleasantly scented.). The smell also fades after a bit and isn&#x27;t really noticeable, at least I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all of this sounds pretty good, the reason I only gave it three stars is because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color. It&#x27;s a very golden glow, and I was hoping for something more beige or tan (light bronze). It comes out slightly more yellow than the dark shade appears on the bottle. I understand the golden choice, given that it&#x27;s for fair skin tones, but just be aware if you&#x27;re buying that it will be noticeable slightly golden or sunny, as opposed to bronze. I think ideally I&#x27;d recommend it be used to about 2/3 of its fullest extent, as it looks more natural that way. That way you get a glow and some color, but it&#x27;s not layered on so heavily that you start to look noticeably yellow, as in my experience happens when used every day for 10 days+ or to its fullest development.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical If this stuff would really work or not but to my surprise it did! Definitely recommend it to anyone that has pale skin. Now I am not totally dark yet but I definitely have color and it hasn&#x27;t washed off or came off my skin. Tomorrow makes 5 days and I finally feel better about my legs.</li>
    <li> I love the results I get with this product and love how much money I&#x27;m saving compared to other self tanners I used. This is perfect for people with fair complexion!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  With all the adverse things we hear about actual sun exposure, this allows you to LOOK like you&#x27;ve gotten the sun exposure, WITHOUT the adversity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of tanning lotion and this is the best. I use it almost every day and it looks great. Im satisfied with my tan, it&#x27;s not orange and never streaky looking. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;m extremely pale - in the summer i look grey (reflecting the color of buildings). This is perfect for me. It shows up gradually over the course of a few days and never streaks. The color is a natural looking gentle tan. Not a hint of awful orange, and never goes deep bronze no matter how many applications are put on (i.e. it stops at a light natural medium color).  I hope they never stop making this stuff.</li>
    <li> I get plenty of sun on my upper body during the summer, but my legs are always three or four shades paler since I&#x27;m not a shorts girl.  I wanted to get them &amp;#34;caught up&amp;#34; before I donned my swimsuit, but I didn&#x27;t want the orange-y look that a lot of self-tanning products give you.  This does the job.  It won&#x27;t give you a dark tan, but just enough color so you don&#x27;t look pasty.  It&#x27;s a lightweight lotion with a pleasant citrus scent.  I was always careful to wash my hands after applying it and let the lotion dry thoroughly before getting dressed, so I didn&#x27;t have any issues with brown palms or stained clothes.</li>
    <li> Nivea never disappoints and this is a really good tanner. The smell is so easy to live with and the color was light. That is what I like, as I can decide just how dark I want my skin to be.</li>
    <li> i have a hard time finding formulas for fairer skin tones, so glad to see this. works well, consistantly and reliably. as realistic as i&#x27;ve seen and a good moisturizer too.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and I get a base tan (via tanning bed - don&#x27;t judge) right before summer so that I will not burn.  I use this lotion and it extends my tan and I LOVE that it moisturizes too.  The smell is not the worst but it goes away after awhile.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I used to use all products from Nivea and I wanted to test this one as well. I am naturally very light skin and don&#x27;t like to experiment with tanning lotions but I thought that this one might be different and not so drastic. After two applications my skin started to turn orange. Very light orange but you could see it in certain light. I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or what but I was following all instructions. Have used once a day after shower, washed my hands after application and made sure my skin is dry before putting clothes on. I will not buy this again. It also has really odd smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Amazon about a week ago.  Received it, and it is not even what I thought I was ordering.  I had my heart set on getting this self tanner so I could have some what of a tan before I left for vacation on June 6.  It is a completely different looking bottle than shown.  It also smells funky.  I was looking forward to the sweet smell of the grape seed oil.  Upon further review of my new self tanner, it is expired.  It expired 05/2013.  What a let down.  Can not believe I paid full price for something I should have walked in to CVS and could have gotten for a mark down price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have very fair skin, but don&#x27;t like to get too much sun (skin cancer runs in the family).  I love being able to use this for a week or two and have enough color to wear shorts or a skirt without being embarassed.  I hope they never discontinue it!!  If you are looking for a true &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; look, this will not provide it!!  It simply gives a nice natural glow.</li>
    <li> My skin just does not tan, even though I spend hours in the sun each day. Have tried several similar products, and like this one best - good color, goes on evenly and with no telltale odor.  Also, a very effective moisturizer, in its own right.</li>
    <li> I felt like this did not work as well as other sun tanning products I have used-I did not care for the scent and while it was skin softening, it was blotchy in color-</li>
    <li> Its OK takes to long to tan and I didn&#x27;t see hardly any tanning!!!</li>
    <li> It worked for the most part. It didn&#x27;t turn me as orange as other ones do, but it still did a little. Using a dry wash cloth helps it not be streaky</li>
    <li> Love this and will reccomend. The first thing I noticed was how good it smells, like a grapefruit,citrus.My skin was much softer and the tone was \\&quot;sunkissed\\&quot; like the bottle says. There isnt streaking.Its nice if your keeping a tan or want a boost without a deeper tan. I use this almost daily.</li>
    <li> My skin is very fair and almost pale looking. I used this sunless tanning lotion and with the first application I could see a little color but nothing too dramatic. After 3 days I used the lotion again and my skin now looks more darker but again nothing drastic it just looks like I was out in the sun. I really like this because it doesn&#x27;t give your skin the orange look and it&#x27;s very hard for the lotion to cause streaks. Also the smell is very pleasant :) I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell, moisturizing, good to cover white strap lines. Very gradual tanning, takes days to develop into a nice tan color.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a top-notch lotion for gradually adding color. The scent is quite light (citrus-y maybe?) and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin that often gets itchy from various products.&lt;br /&gt;Though seemingly a small complaint, the one downside is an issue with every application. Because of the shape of this bottle, when your hands are slippery (with lotion, duh), it&#x27;s really hard to hold onto. If it had a squeeze top or had ridges or some other \\&quot;grip\\&quot; option, it would be 5-star. Other products from other brands (like &#x27;Oil of...&#x27;) are in squeeze tubes or other easier-to-handle shapes.&lt;br /&gt;If you think that will drive you a little nuts, I&#x27;d suggest you try something else.</li>
    <li> I am retired and not a sun worshipper. However, when summer rolls around I like to look a little tan in my capris.  I discovered this product last year and am using it again this summer. It looks genuine and is easy to apply, just like lotion.I am very fair and the Jergens product looked &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The BEST does not dry out your skin and looks natural.  My ONLY COMPLAINT. IS THAT IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this item...it smells good but everytime I took a shower it came off and was gritty. Rally liked the color turn out though.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> I love nivea but this was a let down, the smell is off the color is off. i get that its self tanning lotion but there is better out there.</li>
    <li> The smell was nice as compared to other self tanners. I&#x27;m a nc20 in Mac and the fair to medium color was perfect for my skin tone. Color showed up on the second day, and my husband said it looked very natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff does have a nice subtle sun kissed look but a day after use it clogs my pores and causes huge pimples. I put it off as a coinecdence but quickly found out this stuff is doing the damage. would not recommend to anyone with larger pores.</li>
    <li> Okay let me start off by saying that I am EXTREMELY pale. Like, lightest shade of most foundations kind of pale. Normally I don&#x27;t mind being fair skinned but I wanted to give myself a nice subtle tan before summer rolls around so I don&#x27;t blind people on the beach. I used to use the jergens gradual tanner when I needed to, and thought it was okay. I decided to get this since it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ll admit this to you all--so far I&#x27;ve only used this once. And I messed up big time. I read all the reviews for this product and almost everyone said the tan takes a while to actually show up. So my first night applying this I thought &amp;#34;ok it won&#x27;t do anything yet so no need to apply evenly.&amp;#34; WRONG. I woke up the next morning with the most subtle yet gorgeous tan glow. Just unfortunately, very splotchy and uneven. It&#x27;s been a couple days and I&#x27;m just letting the tanner fade off so I can redo it. But I can&#x27;t wait!! SO moral of the story, amazing amazing amazing product, but ALWAYS apply evenly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and was pleased but this bottle which was  the old style bottle not the new style, must have been from last year and was no good, it did nothing to color my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale, and every other self-tanner I&#x27;ve used left me orange, streaky, and it rubbed off onto ALL my clothes the second I would start to sweat. Being as it&#x27;s summertime, I wanted a tan, so I tried this out. THIS LOTION IS WHITE. WHITE! No heavy bronzers that rub off! I was amazed by this, and I think this is why it works so well. It doesn&#x27;t rub off onto ANY of my clothes, even if I sweat. Plus, it smells GOOD! It also leaves my skin soft and hydrated, just like a normal lotion. AND NO STREAKS! I&#x27;ve found my self-tanning product and I&#x27;m sticking to it! I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, fair skin. I have tried a variety of self tanners in all price ranges, including expensive brands from cosmetic counters. This product does NOT streak. It does not require a lot work to apply.  It has not darkened elbows or knees.  Most important to me, my dry skin does not start to flake off in big patches (leaving diseased looking skin) after 10 or 12 days. In the past, I would have to scrub off these dark, flaky patches, taking about 5 days to completely remove, only to start over again. The color of Nivea Sun-kissed Radiant Skin, Fair to Medium, blends so well into ankles and feet, leaving very natural color. It won&#x27;t give you a \\&quot;sun\\&quot;tanned\\&quot; look, but gives enough color to eliminate pasty, white skin.</li>
