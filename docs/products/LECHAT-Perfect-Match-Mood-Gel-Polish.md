      <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Very happy thanks</li>
      <li>Very cool!</li>
      <li>I am a licensed Nail technician and I own many Lechat mood gel polishes.</li>
      <li>The sparkle is rainbow colored and is very fine not chunky.</li>
      <li>but I had no issue with it :)</li>
      <li>My clients love them.</li>
      <li>the polish stayed in better than Gelish for me.</li>
      <li>Looks really awesome when your tips are long</li>
      <li>This one really shows a difference from the warm and cool temperature on me!  </li>
      <li>So cool.</li>
      <li>The warm is clear with glitter and the cool is blackish with greenish glitter.</li>
      <li>Fun color.</li>
      <li>It is a clear/ white sparkly color when warm.</li>
      <li>I wish it could be more silver or clear, so as not to have the look it does.</li>
      <li>I have multiple colors and love every color.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I will wear it in the wintertime when it will be more likely to show the darker color.</li>
      <li>But delivery was extremely fast!</li>
      <li>White to Black sounds great, but the execution of this mood isn&#x27;t the best... Not happy with this one.</li>
      <li>Not only can you use this by itself, I use it over other colors to give it a a very nice sparkle look.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
      <li>Would definitely get the full effect with longer nails...</li>
      <li>its really cool to watch as you first put it on its black and then changes right away to a clear color with glitter in it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE Lechat mood polishes, and this is the only one that I have not liked the color when &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>When cold, it is a beautiful black with sparkles, however when warm, it is a light grey that has a dirty appearance.</li>
      <li>I first thought it was white to black.</li>

<li> Goes from clear with glitter to opaque black...</li>
<li> Sparkly white to sparkly black.</li>
<li> It worked as expected.</li>
<li> This gel polish is thicker in consistency due to the amount of sparkle in it.</li>
<li> Other gel polishes peel</li>
<li> I was a bit skeptical when I was first putting the gel on.</li>
<li> Disappointed because I was so excited to use it when I received it.</li>

<li> Polish was EXTREMELY THICK!</li>
<li> but it was very hard to come off</li>
<li> It changes to black with sparkles when cold.</li>
<li> Ran them under cold water to see if it worked and it did!</li>

    <li> LOVE this stuff! Bought 4 different mood changing colors, these stay on the entire 2 weeks if u do it correctly.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this color!!!  Not only can you use this by itself, I use it over other colors to give it a a very nice sparkle look.  I will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> Polish was EXTREMELY THICK! Cannot even use. I have to buy a gel thinner and see how it goes from there. Disappointed because I was so excited to use it when I received it. But delivery was extremely fast!</li>
    <li> the polish stayed in better than Gelish for me. I loved the color as well as the mood effect. Highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> It is a clear/ white sparkly color when warm.It changes to black with sparkles when cold. If you have longer nails you will get the gradient effect . The sparkle is rainbow colored and is very fine not chunky. This gel polish is thicker in consistency due to the amount of sparkle in it. Thin coats is key when applying! If applied properly stays on for 3 weeks! I am a licensed Nail technician and I own many Lechat mood gel polishes. My clients love them. A great product!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I was first putting the gel on. It is a bit thick but I had no issue with it :) its really cool to watch as you first put it on its black and then changes right away to a clear color with glitter in it! Would definitely get the full effect with longer nails... but mine are kinda short at the moment. Ran them under cold water to see if it worked and it did! 5 stars! So cool. Will add pics!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the nail technician didn&#x27;t know what she was doing but it was very hard to come off</li>
    <li> Very cool! Goes from clear with glitter to opaque black... I first thought it was white to black. Looks really awesome when your tips are long so you get that french tip look.</li>
    <li> It worked as expected.</li>
    <li> Now this is my second color from this brand. This one really shows a difference from the warm and cool temperature on me!  It&#x27;s truly like night and day.  The warm is clear with glitter and the cool is blackish with greenish glitter.</li>
    <li> Sparkly white to sparkly black. Fun color.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Lechat mood polishes, and this is the only one that I have not liked the color when &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;. When cold, it is a beautiful black with sparkles, however when warm, it is a light grey that has a dirty appearance. I wish it could be more silver or clear, so as not to have the look it does. That being said, I will wear it in the wintertime when it will be more likely to show the darker color.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!! I have multiple colors and love every color.  Other gel polishes peel but this one does not.  I now have a girl night with my gel nail set and change my mood color every week.  Very Great Brand!!!!</li>
    <li> The white is too sheer and the frost is not sparkly enough.  White to Black sounds great, but the execution of this mood isn&#x27;t the best... Not happy with this one.</li>
    <li> works great looks great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Very happy thanks</li>
