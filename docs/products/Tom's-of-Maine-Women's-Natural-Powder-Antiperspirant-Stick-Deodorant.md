### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For me the scent is not the best</li>
      <li>Great heading for my review, huh?</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
      <li>It also works great.</li>
      <li>For me, this is a great deodorant although it does contain aluminum as one of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I am happy with it and it works well</li>
      <li>When given the opportunity to try this I thought it was a great idea.  </li>
      <li>The odor was pleasant and it looks like it would be a good product otherwise.</li>
      <li>Smells good too, but no overpowering.</li>
      <li>I loved that feel--so it must be the antiperspirant ingredient, which is the aluminum, I believe.  </li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it does quite as good a job as my ol&#x27; standby, Lady Mitchum.</li>
      <li>The staying power is good.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasant and it went on fairly smoothly.</li>
      <li>liked how it felt.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice scent and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When using this product, I found myself feeling a bit self-conscious by the end of some days, as I felt like I could smell my own body odor.  </li>
      <li>and it has a nice scent that we both like.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong but pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was *slightly* more effective, because I like the brand</li>
      <li>The scent is very light</li>
      <li>- Great smell - light and fresh, not overpowering or too perfumy</li>
      <li>I tend to perspire more than most</li>
      <li>I used to use the deodorant rock, then I got a job that required me to move around a bit more, a deodorant was going to cut it, I needed an antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>It mostly disappears once it’s on</li>
      <li>First off it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this....</li>
      <li>so this one is a favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>However, it did provide good wetness protection and  was pleased with the “fresh meadow” scent.  </li>
      <li>I have never used Tom&#x27;s before but after trying out this deodorant I will be buying it more often.</li>
      <li>I appreciate being able to get more information from their website: www.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also contains Aluminum as do most antipersperants</li>
      <li>I like using more natural products, and I&#x27;ve always found Tom&#x27;s of Maine to offer quality products, so I was happy to be able to try this.</li>
      <li>It worked well in that I didn&#x27;t notice any dampness during the day, and even when working out it held up pretty good.</li>
      <li>It has a mild scent, which is nice.</li>
      <li>Nothing strong or overwhelming.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, the scented has a bit too strong of a scent - but I would assume the unscented one would be great.</li>
      <li>This Tom&#x27;s of Maine women&#x27;s naturally dry anti perspirant has been enjoyed by my wife and has found it to be effective and pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Try to do your own research (as much as you can) to be more informed.</li>
      <li>This works well to reduce odor without creating an additional layer of strong scent.</li>
      <li>However, I have seen the more natural brands over the years and have debated giving them a try, and have heard good things about the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand</li>
      <li>Oh well... this smelled nice and worked pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It works fine.  </li>
      <li>When I first opened it up, I thought the scent was really perfect, relatively light but definitely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>And I love the Fresh Meadow scent of this product.  </li>
      <li>The stick applies smoothly and evenly, and does not gunk up&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I know why it&#x27;s so important</li>
      <li>&#x27;s has great products, even though they are not the same company they used to</li>
      <li>So it goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>The fresh meadow is okay.</li>
      <li>She indicated applicator did not apply smoothly and the stuff flaked.  </li>
      <li>I am somewhat of a freak about body odor, and the antiperspirant I had been using for years is no longer available, so  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line - So far, so good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a successful product, but the scent will keep me from going with this scent in the future.</li>
      <li>Also, it is always the case that using more natural ingredients costs more than cheaper chemical alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Work great, keeps you dry without all the chemicals.</li>
      <li>Nice gentle fresh scent.</li>
      <li>okay if it&#x27;s a cooler day but towards the end of the day, even with this double application, my own odor comes through.  </li>
      <li>sure how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; this is, but it seems well made, the scent is pleasing and works very well.  </li>
      <li>It smelled so fresh &amp; light.</li>
      <li>My guess is that this relates to the lack of strong chemicals in the deodorant and this is a price one pays for the more natural composition.</li>
      <li>This Naturally Dry product is pleasant, almost unscented.</li>
      <li>I would prefer to buy more natural products when they are a available.  </li>
      <li>Dove tends to be my preferred brand for this reason - I don&#x27;t get a rash or irritation with that line, while many other popular brands haven&#x27;t done well for me.</li>
      <li>to do your own research (as much as you can) to be more informed.ng soda, etc....they just seem to roll off the garment unless you take the time to actually scrub, rinse and repeat (and rinse and repeat AGAIN, until it breaks</li>
      <li>I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, and this new deodorant is no exception.</li>
      <li>I think this is great because we live in Florida and have been having a very hot spell, upper 80&#x27;s to 90&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Many deodorants have a certain smell that I&#x27;m sure others are familiar with, but Tom&#x27;s of main smells completely natural.</li>
      <li>made entirely from ingredients derived from plants and minerals that meet our stewardship model for safe, effective and natural.</li>
      <li>It also says no artificial fragrance or preservatives.</li>
      <li>This antiperspirant actually works, but that&#x27;s because it still contains aluminum (nice fragrance).</li>
      <li>And of course the brand is Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which is associated with safe, natural products.</li>
      <li>and I think its called Fresh Meadow.  </li>
      <li>trying this Tom&#x27;s product, I liked several things right away.  </li>
      <li>The scent wears off during the day, but right after I put it on, he backs away from me.</li>
      <li>All right, I will admit right away that I always buy antiperspirant/deodorants &#x27;blends&#x27;</li>
      <li>Advanced Care Anti-Perspirant Deodorant, Revive]], which was decent, but there were some things I did not like about it as well.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, I found the \\&quot;Fresh</li>
      <li>far as the scent goes, it&#x27;s fine in the Fresh Meadow scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The two downsides to this are the scent was a bit much for me - I could smell it even while it was on, which wasn&#x27;t so great even a few hours after application.</li>
      <li>My only downside was that the scent, was more medicinal than fresh meadow.  </li>
      <li>I liked how dry I was.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great alternative to major brands that have all sorts of unknown chemicals in them</li>
      <li>We currently use several of Tom’s of Maine products (i.e.Toothpaste, Mouthwash et al) , and, are more than satisfied with all.  </li>
      <li>The scent is faint and very pleasant.</li>
      <li>There are natural toxins on our great planet and while aluminum is the key ingredient that we are warned to stay away from (especially in antiperspirant)</li>
      <li>Tends to take on more of the scent as you perspire, but you are basically staying dry.</li>
      <li>It was selected because of its use of natural ingredients, particularly in the fragrances, while still being an effective personal care product.</li>
      <li>I find that it does a fairly good job of keeping me dry - and it definitely has been put to the test during this Los Angeles &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; weather.</li>
      <li>It rubs on dry and easily although not as smoothly as some of the major (non-natural) brands.</li>
      <li>, however, it is still a few steps above most traditional antiperspirants with no animal testing, preservatives and the fact that Tom&#x27;s donates to charitable and worthy causes.</li>
      <li>I like Tom&#x27;s natural products; I really appreciate no artificial frangrance or preservatives..  </li>
      <li>, I just wish there was another way, because I really would prefer not using aluminum on my skin, even if it is sustainably resourced.  </li>
      <li>Before I write my impression of this product, it&#x27;s important to note that I&#x27;m not an especially sweaty person.</li>
      <li>Maybe after 10-12 hours, but by then, I&#x27;m done with my day and it doesn&#x27;t much matter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would rate this Tom&#x27;s antiperspirant/deodorant 3 1/2 stars, recommending it only for light day or perhaps winter use.</li>
      <li>I was really impressed/surprised by how well this product works, considering that it is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; antipresperant.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer the unscented version of this antiperspirant rather than any of the scents.</li>
      <li>Just because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good for you.</li>
      <li>That being said, when it&#x27;s super hot, or I anticipate being involved in high levels of physical activity, I will use this antiperspirant and it does its job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought Tom&#x27;s was anti-aluminum?  Oh well... this smelled nice and worked pretty well.  Nothing worse than 24 hour protection wearing off in only 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s has great products, even though they are not the same company they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great alternative to major brands that have all sorts of unknown chemicals in them</li>
    <li> The label says, &amp;#34;Learn more about our Stewardship Model an what we mean by &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. It also says no artificial fragrance or preservatives. And of course the brand is Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which is associated with safe, natural products. So, why does this contain aluminum? I have to confess that I can&#x27;t tell you how it works because there is no way I am using this. Yes, aluminum is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s also toxic. Sheesh!</li>
    <li> I like Tom&#x27;s natural products; I really appreciate no artificial frangrance or preservatives..  I feel like I&#x27;m doing myself and the planet a favor.  And I love the Fresh Meadow scent of this product.  I noticed that the antiperspirant deodorant doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the plain deodorant--I loved that feel--so it must be the antiperspirant ingredient, which is the aluminum, I believe.  I notice that the label says Naturally Dry.  I appreciate being able to get more information from their website: www.Ttomsofmaine.com .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, another family member whom I let try the antiperspirant deodorant said that she thought that this deoderant product was harder to wash off for some reason.</li>
    <li> We currently use several of Tom’s of Maine products (i.e.Toothpaste, Mouthwash et al) , and, are more than satisfied with all.  When the opportunity to order Tom’s Naturally Dry Antiperspirant Deodorant for Women, I jumped at the opportunity for my goto lady to try the “Fresh Meadow” no artificial fragrances or preservatives.  She indicated applicator did not apply smoothly and the stuff flaked.  However, it did provide good wetness protection and  was pleased with the “fresh meadow” scent.  In addition, she was surprised the antiperspirant was not in her opinion up to Tom’s standard she expected. Would not purchase!</li>
    <li> I mistakenly got this for myself not realizing it was for women. I tried it a few times nonetheless and then passed it on to my wife for her input. The smell is strong but pleasant and not overpowering. It’s a feminine scent but not overly so and it reminds me of original Secret. It rubs on dry and easily although not as smoothly as some of the major (non-natural) brands. It’s a small price to pay though for better ingredients. It mostly disappears once it’s on and  it doesn’t leave any marks or stains. Neither of us had any irritation and it worked just as effectively as our usual antiperspirants. We both recommend it and would use it again.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes to buy all natural products but he&#x27;s never tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine antiperspirant.  The deodorant he&#x27;d been using started irritating the skin under his arms and it broke out in a rash.  I picked this up for him to try and it&#x27;s been great.  It hasn&#x27;t irritated his skin at all and it has a nice scent that we both like.</li>
    <li> This works really well, so far it&#x27;s kept me dry when I need it to. The scent is very light so it&#x27;s not overpowering. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, this is the one.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed/surprised by how well this product works, considering that it is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; antipresperant.  When I first opened it up, I thought the scent was really perfect, relatively light but definitely noticeable.  It works fine.  However, when I looked over the ingredient list, I noticed a lot of ingredients that didn&#x27;t seem particularly natural, a bunch of terms I was unfamiliar with and the active ingredient being aluminum, which from what I know is one of the main ingredients people are trying to avoid when they don&#x27;t want to use mainstream deodorants.</li>
    <li> Ive tried this twice now, different times. I do not like it. It doesn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
    <li> I am happy with it and it works well</li>
    <li> The scent is faint and very pleasant. I hate perfumy deodorants so this one is a favorite of mine. It goes on smoothly. I don&#x27;t put on deodorant very heavily, but this one kept me dry all day. I think this is great because we live in Florida and have been having a very hot spell, upper 80&#x27;s to 90&#x27;s. We work outside at least part of the day because we have horses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problem with underarm stains on my shirts, but it&#x27;s something to watch. For me, this is a great deodorant although it does contain aluminum as one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product is keeping me dry.  I have not noticed the stains that others have reported in these reviews yet, but I will monitor that situation and edit this review if I do notice it.&lt;br /&gt;The one I received has a fragrance and I think its called Fresh Meadow.  Pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Not terribly excited...thus a 3 rating.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but I have some reservations and am keeping an open mind in case problems might occur after using for a while.</li>
    <li> Work great, keeps you dry without all the chemicals. Smells good too, but no overpowering.</li>
    <li> I would prefer to buy more natural products when they are a available.  I used to use the deodorant rock, then I got a job that required me to move around a bit more, a deodorant was going to cut it, I needed an antiperspirant.  When given the opportunity to try this I thought it was a great idea.  So it goes on smooth.  That&#x27;s pretty nice, some natural deodorants are a little rough.  The staying power is good.  No wet armpits after walking dogs, mucking kennels, cleaning house and chasing kids.  My only downside was that the scent, was more medicinal than fresh meadow.  Normally I wouldn&#x27;t care one way or the other, my underarms are dry, yea!  But my husband was quite turned off by the smell, he said it smelled like I had put eucalyptus and vapor rub on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked how it felt.  I liked how dry I was. The smell was a bummer, since it&#x27;s my husband I like to snuggle with.  The scent wears off during the day, but right after I put it on, he backs away from me.</li>
    <li> Great heading for my review, huh? Just because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good for you. There are natural toxins on our great planet and while aluminum is the key ingredient that we are warned to stay away from (especially in antiperspirant) some people really need it for the dry aspect when they perspire. I&#x27;m really not one of those people. That being said, when it&#x27;s super hot, or I anticipate being involved in high levels of physical activity, I will use this antiperspirant and it does its job. As another review mentioned, checking EWG&#x27;s website for toxicity ratings, is something I frequently do and this product was low on their list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cut and pasted directly from the description of this product on Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s website:  Tom’s of Maine Naturally Dry antiperspirant sticks provide clinically proven 24-hour wetness and odor protection made entirely from ingredients derived from plants and minerals that meet our stewardship model for safe, effective and natural. Naturally Dry AP contains a wetness protection ingredient made from recycled aluminum (which was originally derived from natural mineral bauxite ore). The product also contains anti-microbial olive leaf extract, 100% natural fragrance and is free of artificial preservatives and animal ingredients, just like all our products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scent. I much prefer the unscented version of this antiperspirant rather than any of the scents. The baby powder is just gross. The fresh meadow is okay. Tends to take on more of the scent as you perspire, but you are basically staying dry. It goes on a bit drier (harder, or rougher, if you will) than deodorant. As with pretty much any antiperspirants (at leas that I have found), they tend to be more difficult to wash off your (your body, as well as your clothing). They seem to make the underarm are of tops stained, while taking on a &amp;#34;shell&amp;#34; coating that is pretty difficult to penetrate with spot removers, vinegar, baking soda, etc....they just seem to roll off the garment unless you take the time to actually scrub, rinse and repeat (and rinse and repeat AGAIN, until it breaks through).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to do your own research (as much as you can) to be more informed.ng soda, etc....they just seem to roll off the garment unless you take the time to actually scrub, rinse and repeat (and rinse and repeat AGAIN, until it breaks through).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to do your own research (as much as you can) to be more informed.</li>
    <li> My biggest need with deodorants, besides the obvious of actually working, is finding ones that don&#x27;t break my skin out from use. Dove tends to be my preferred brand for this reason - I don&#x27;t get a rash or irritation with that line, while many other popular brands haven&#x27;t done well for me. And on that front, this one hits the mark. It goes on smoothly, though it does leave a bit of a residue behind so not so little black dress appropriate. But I didn&#x27;t get any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two downsides to this are the scent was a bit much for me - I could smell it even while it was on, which wasn&#x27;t so great even a few hours after application. So if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, the scented has a bit too strong of a scent - but I would assume the unscented one would be great. The other downside was the above mentioned residue. As for working, I didn&#x27;t feel like this stopped working too early. Maybe after 10-12 hours, but by then, I&#x27;m done with my day and it doesn&#x27;t much matter. It&#x27;s not really a 24 hour product, but that suits my needs just fine.</li>
    <li> I have never used Tom&#x27;s before but after trying out this deodorant I will be buying it more often. First off it smells amazing! Next it goes on easily and protects all day long - everything you want in a deodorant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, perspire a lot, and usually use Secret Gel Deodorant which works well.  I&#x27;ve been using this at night after I shower and again in the morning.  It works okay if it&#x27;s a cooler day but towards the end of the day, even with this double application, my own odor comes through.  It has a nice scent and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains Aluminum as do most antipersperants and I think that Secret is a better value for my money.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat of a freak about body odor, and the antiperspirant I had been using for years is no longer available, so  I decided to give this Tom&#x27;s product a try. Initial impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Great smell - light and fresh, not overpowering or too perfumy&lt;br /&gt;2 - The stick applies smoothly and evenly, and does not gunk up&lt;br /&gt;3 - No irritation to my skin, which has been an issue with other aluminum based products&lt;br /&gt;4 - No white streaks on my clothes - note* I put on deodorant after I get dressed, but sometimes still manage to get the white streaks - Not with Tom&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;5 - This product does contain aluminum, which I am a little techy about. Not sure what sustainable aluminum is, but there you go&lt;br /&gt;6 - The protection level from the dreaded body odor seems high. I have not had any problems since starting to use the Tom&#x27;s product. Even through hot flashes and night sweats, I stay pretty dry and odor-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - So far, so good. The Tom&#x27;s deodorant is a bit more expensive, but it works well, and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Nice gentle fresh scent. Not overpowering. Smells like soap.  Works well. I normally use secret and didnt notice any difference.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant actually works, but that&#x27;s because it still contains aluminum (nice fragrance). I would give it 5 stars if it worked and didn&#x27;t contain any aluminum, however, it is still a few steps above most traditional antiperspirants with no animal testing, preservatives and the fact that Tom&#x27;s donates to charitable and worthy causes. I&#x27;d buy this product in future.</li>
    <li> This Tom&#x27;s of Maine women&#x27;s naturally dry anti perspirant has been enjoyed by my wife and has found it to be effective and pleasant. It was selected because of its use of natural ingredients, particularly in the fragrances, while still being an effective personal care product. It is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> All right, I will admit right away that I always buy antiperspirant/deodorants &#x27;blends&#x27; (I currently use Dove). However, I have seen the more natural brands over the years and have debated giving them a try, and have heard good things about the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand so I thought I&#x27;d try te Tom&#x27;s of Maine Women&#x27;s Naturally Dry Antiperspirant. Now I know why it&#x27;s so important that *I* always get both antiperspirant/deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand went on smooth if a little thick (I noticed later that it &#x27;beaded&#x27; a little after time, but I always prefer to put on too much than too little, I&#x27;m paranoid that way). Steady usage will teach you how much you need to apply, but it&#x27;s probably less than you initially think. It has a mild scent, which is nice. It worked well in that I didn&#x27;t notice any dampness during the day, and even when working out it held up pretty good. What I did notice that led to the loss of stars? I was wearing a sweater and while I didn&#x27;t feel overheated at all, I noticed as the day went on a &#x27;musty&#x27; smell that made me wonder if I hadn&#x27;t washed the sweater properly. Nope, that was me - especially after I worked out. Apparently, I really need that deodorant part, so while I think this is probably a four stars with the wetness protection, it loses some on the odor part. Sorry, I&#x27;ll be going back to my Dove.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t just deodorant, it is an antiperspirant which has materials/chemicals that actually help stop you from sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; this is, but it seems well made, the scent is pleasing and works very well.  Only downside is there seems to be a bit of transfer on to clothes unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I was immediately interested in a Tom&#x27;s of Maine antiperspirant, because I like to keep my bathroom products as natural as possible, and yet I have trouble finding a natural deodorant that really works for me.  I tend to perspire more than most people.&lt;br /&gt;So far this is working well, however, in extremely hot weather or when I exercise I need to reapply often.  I like the scent, it does not bother my allergies, like some scents do.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it bothers me that this Tom&#x27;s of Maine antiperspirant still has aluminum in it.  I realize it&#x27;s hard to make an antiperspirant without aluminum, I just wish there was another way, because I really would prefer not using aluminum on my skin, even if it is sustainably resourced.  Since it has aluminum in it, I would say this isn&#x27;t a true &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant, but is a cross between natural deodorant and basic drugstore anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> Before I write my impression of this product, it&#x27;s important to note that I&#x27;m not an especially sweaty person. I don&#x27;t need heavy duty wetness protection. My main concern is odor control. I cannot speak to how this would work for someone whose body chemistry is different or who sweats a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of my concerns, this deodorant functioned very well. I didn&#x27;t have any body odor issues or wetness. The scent is very pleasant and it went on fairly smoothly. I think it&#x27;s a little less &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; and goes on slightly dryer than bigger name deodorants like Dove, Sure, etc. My guess is that this relates to the lack of strong chemicals in the deodorant and this is a price one pays for the more natural composition. This is slightly more expensive than some other similar products, but you are getting the peace of mind in terms of the ingredients. Also, it is always the case that using more natural ingredients costs more than cheaper chemical alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers have mentioned staining. This was no more of an issue for me with this than any other deodorant. I always experience staining on items that I put on directly after applying a deodorant (which is why I put it on at night - only the nightgown gets stained).</li>
    <li> This works well to reduce odor without creating an additional layer of strong scent. You know how some deodorant masks sweat but its own smell is equally distasteful? This Naturally Dry product is pleasant, almost unscented. It goes on dry and leaves no marks on clothes.</li>
    <li> I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, and this new deodorant is no exception. It smelled so fresh &amp; light. Many deodorants have a certain smell that I&#x27;m sure others are familiar with, but Tom&#x27;s of main smells completely natural. It also works great. I work 12-13 shifts, so I need a deodorant that can last all day.</li>
    <li> The opportunity to try this product came just as I was thinking about switching to a new antiperspirant/deodorant.  (Previously, I had been using [[ASIN:B00GY2B6NS Dove Advanced Care Anti-Perspirant Deodorant, Revive]], which was decent, but there were some things I did not like about it as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon trying this Tom&#x27;s product, I liked several things right away.  First, I found the \\&quot;Fresh Meadow\\&quot; fragrance, a very subtle floral, to be pleasant.  Second, I like that the product applied smoothly, with none of the flakiness that I have gotten from other antiperspirant/deodorants.  Similarly, the product did not flake off during the day, another plus.  On the down side, I found that this product did leave white streaks on my clothing if I was not careful getting dressed, but that has been true of virtually every antiperspirant/deodorant I have ever tried, even the ones that claim to leave no residue (this one does not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an antiperspirant, this product seemed to work quite well, keeping me dry through all day yoga trainings and other vigorous exercise.  As a deodorant, however, it didn&#x27;t perform quite as well.  When using this product, I found myself feeling a bit self-conscious by the end of some days, as I felt like I could smell my own body odor.  This is certainly NOT what you want from your antiperspirant/deodorant!  It&#x27;s too bad, because otherwise, I really liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would rate this Tom&#x27;s antiperspirant/deodorant 3 1/2 stars, recommending it only for light day or perhaps winter use.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this.... As a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I thought this might be aluminum-free. But it isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s a deal breaker for me and deodorants. The odor was pleasant and it looks like it would be a good product otherwise. I realize you probably need that ingredient for &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; protection however, you cannot claim &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; then.</li>
    <li> This product works. Sometimes natural products can be hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Did well on an average day, and did well on a hot sweaty day outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;  I was sweating in various places,  but not under the arms.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- For me the scent is not the best but it does dissipate a few hours later.&lt;br /&gt;  It goes on a little chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a successful product, but the scent will keep me from going with this scent in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a decent antiperspirant. I like using more natural products, and I&#x27;ve always found Tom&#x27;s of Maine to offer quality products, so I was happy to be able to try this. I find that it does a fairly good job of keeping me dry - and it definitely has been put to the test during this Los Angeles &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; weather. However, I don&#x27;t think it does quite as good a job as my ol&#x27; standby, Lady Mitchum. Occasionally I feel like I need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scent goes, it&#x27;s fine in the Fresh Meadow scent. Nothing strong or overwhelming. It does not irritate my armpits or make them too dry, so a plus there. I just wish it was *slightly* more effective, because I like the brand and I think the price is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note - this is an antiperspirant and not a deodorant, so it does contain aluminum! If you&#x27;re a person that like to avoid aluminum, don&#x27;t purchase this!</li>
