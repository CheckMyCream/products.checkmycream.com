      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>This works great, 1/5 the cost.</li>

      <li>Cannot by in stores anymore, but very happy that it is available online.</li>
      <li>It is perfect it has no taste when it gets on your lips pleasant aroma and very foamy</li>
      <li>Something nice about the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; way of doing things.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
      <li>Been using this for 50 years, haven&#x27;t found a better soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you will be ready to get up a good lather without prep.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some of the ritual that makes blade shaving an event rather than a duty is lost but I am tempted to use conditioner even when the mug is available,</li>
      <li>this is good shaving soap especially for the price</li>
      <li>With the right brush and a little bit of practice, you will get an incredible shave.</li>
      <li>Along with a shaving brush it provides nice, warm, long lasting lather.</li>
      <li>Might take a little bit longer to work up a lather, but a bit more rewarding.</li>
      <li>Good price but lather is too &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; it foams and breaks down once on face compared to higher priced soaps.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Even using an old blade you forgot to change, conditioner gives a smooth close shave.  </li>
      <li>Wish it was little wider to fit my cup, but OK.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only way I shave because it leaves my skin smooth with no irritation.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it does not take up much space in the suitcase when traveling and is never questioned at airport security.</li>
      <li>few reviewers mentioned needing to soak the soap before use to get a nice lather.  </li>
      <li>It is almost impossible to find now in stores, so I was delighted to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Plus, a bar/package of this lasts a very long time, making it a super value.</li>
      <li>I have old Colgate and Burma-Shave glass mugs I found in grandpa&#x27;s attic years ago.  </li>
      <li>It arrived as promised and was exactly what we expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used expensive British &amp; German shaving soaps sold by boutique shaving emporia, but Williams is superior.</li>
      <li>I bought six, and based on how long the first puck has lasted, my children&#x27;s children will be fighting over the other five.</li>

    <li> Williams Shaving soap is the very best.  I have used it for 40+ years.  Cannot by in stores anymore, but very happy that it is available online.</li>

    <li> I have been using Williams Mug Shaving Soap for probably 30 to 40 years.  It gets the job done at a very reasonable price.  It is almost impossible to find now in stores, so I was delighted to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It came when it said it would.  My husband was thrilled that I could find it for him seeing how it is next to impossible to find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive British &amp; German shaving soaps sold by boutique shaving emporia, but Williams is superior. It does not dry my skin and produces a thick, creamy lather. The cake of soap is long-lasting, and it close to being unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my after-shave.</li>
    <li> This is the soap of his choice ,  but the stories have quit selling this product, so we thank you for giving us another outlet to purchase this item. Thank You</li>
    <li> I use this without a mug.  I just rub the bar over my whiskers and shave. I get the closest shave AND there is no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Good price but lather is too &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; it foams and breaks down once on face compared to higher priced soaps.</li>
    <li> only shaving soap  I can use. I gave one  to a friend that was having trouble and he loves it</li>
    <li> Bought this item for a friend. It arrived as promised and was exactly what we expected. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have only tried a few shaving soaps and creams for wet shaving but this is the best of those and quite satisfying.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.  Could no longer find it in the drug store.  He is just delighted with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent and easy to work with</li>
    <li> My husband loves these.</li>
    <li> Very good soap. Wish it was little wider to fit my cup, but OK.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  That&#x27;s the only way I shave because it leaves my skin smooth with no irritation.  It last for such a long time too!</li>
    <li> Hard to find so bought in bulk. Its all my husband will use. He swears by it!</li>
    <li> this is good shaving soap especially for the price</li>
    <li> It is perfect it has no taste when it gets on your lips pleasant aroma and very foamy</li>
    <li> Been using this for 50 years, haven&#x27;t found a better soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few reviewers mentioned needing to soak the soap before use to get a nice lather.  I have old Colgate and Burma-Shave glass mugs I found in grandpa&#x27;s attic years ago.  They have screw tops and keep the soap moist.  Find a jar that fits the soap and you will be ready to get up a good lather without prep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flew for a living and kept a mug in my working kit.  About 10 years ago, the Geheime Staatspolizei (TSA) at airport security pulled me out of line while they tried to decide if the soap was a gel or a liquid.  When you go through security 5-6 times a day, it&#x27;s enough of a hassle that you don&#x27;t need to have something that attracts attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife had been using hair conditioner for shaving her legs, said it worked well.  Gave it a try and it does do a very good job.  Even using an old blade you forgot to change, conditioner gives a smooth close shave.  Also leaves dry skin a bit of moisture.  And the hotel always has a little conditioner in the bathroom.  Some of the ritual that makes blade shaving an event rather than a duty is lost but I am tempted to use conditioner even when the mug is available,</li>
    <li> I have been using Williams mug shaving soap for at least 40 years. Along with a shaving brush it provides nice, warm, long lasting lather. Plus, a bar/package of this lasts a very long time, making it a super value. Plus, it does not take up much space in the suitcase when traveling and is never questioned at airport security. Can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would use one of the ubiquitous aerosol products.</li>
    <li> Works well, cheaper than buying the canned stuff all the time.  Something nice about the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; way of doing things.  Might take a little bit longer to work up a lather, but a bit more rewarding.</li>
