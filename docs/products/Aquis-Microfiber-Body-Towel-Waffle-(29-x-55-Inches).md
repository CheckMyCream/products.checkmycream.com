      <li>Not at all impressed.  </li>
      <li>Great service!</li>
      <li>They are so wonderful,  </li>
      <li>To me they are the best towel on Earth.</li>
      <li>Although this towel does do a very good job of drying you off.......there is something about the touch that does not appeal to me....</li>
      <li>This is a great towel.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>And they did a great job of drying me off after my \\&quot;shower\\&quot; each morning.  </li>
      <li>I have about five of these towels and they are GREAT.</li>
      <li>If you shower at the gym this is a great product to carry with you.</li>
      <li>This is a real nice Micro Fiber towel, BUT there are others that are just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Fina Waffle Weave towel.</li>
      <li>The towel does do the job and does launder very nicely.</li>
      <li>Its a good size towel that does wrap around your body, great purchase.</li>
      <li>you good</li>
      <li>Good product that I have used before.  </li>
      <li>Aquis makes good quality microfiber towels.</li>
      <li>These towels are very nicely sized but the fabric is kind of sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>Kind of amazing</li>
      <li>I were carrying my own towel somewhere</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice towel</li>
      <li>super happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>As the ones I own wear out I will be ordering more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far the best travel towel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Not as comfortable as a cotton towel, but really good for someone who travels and doesnt want a towel that takes up a lot of space.</li>
      <li>Love love love this towel - who knew!</li>
      <li>Great large towel for the gym.</li>
      <li>this towel is okay.  </li>
      <li>the waffle weave  :)</li>
      <li>i have used the hair towel for years, and love them.</li>
      <li>have them both and for the money the Fina is a way better deal.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>I wish it came in more colors.</li>
      <li>like the Fina better.</li>
      <li>; x 55&amp;#34; Aquis Microfiber Towel in the Waffle Weave is ok.  </li>
      <li>I love Aquis towels.  </li>
      <li>This is now my favorite towel ever.</li>
      <li>These towels are remarkable in absorbency, weight, quick drying, gentle, light-weight but exceptionally durable, perfect not only for the bath, but for travel as well (as a scuba diver, such a light yet absorbent towel is truly a great find).</li>
      <li>I just wish more colors were available.</li>
      <li>They are easy to pack in bags, easy to wash, quickly to dry and are my best travel companions!</li>
      <li>The Aquis is a good towel but way too much money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Aquis towel has a real towel feel, dries me off  great and then dries out quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a neutral color, so it doesn&#x27;t show dirt that easily.</li>
      <li>Given the fact that they last so many years, the price is a bargain for sure!!  </li>
      <li>All the others work fine for water absorption, but neither the chamois-style nor the terry style works as well in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The waffle style absorbs water more quickly and thoroughly and also dries more quickly.  </li>
      <li>The waffle weave makes a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>they are light weight and  </li>
      <li>I need light weight because of my arthritis so these work well in that regard.</li>
      <li>Is light weight.  </li>
      <li>Just lightly pat, and</li>
      <li>This towel is light and absorbent.  </li>
      <li>Only the best for a body towel for drying fast</li>
      <li>cuz I&#x27;m gonna need more than one right?  </li>
      <li>They are very absorbent but very light.</li>
      <li>Very absorbent, dries quickly, and very light.  </li>
      <li>All you have to do is wrap this wonderful, soft towel around you and you are dry.</li>
      <li>I love this towel because it is super absorbent,  lightweight and fast drying.</li>
      <li>I have bought nearly every brand of quick dry towels and can say that this is the best.  </li>
      <li>I bought these towels primarily because I needed to fit 4 bath towels into the space I had been allocating to 2 large bathsheets.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly on a hangar.  </li>
      <li>They are super absorbent.  </li>
      <li>I have even wrapped my hair in a regular towel FIRST, then wrapped it in this towel so it wouldn&#x27;t be overwhelmed with water, but it wasn&#x27;t remarkable.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this Aquis Microfiber Body Towel, Waffle, Linen, (29 x 55-Inches) for travelling, but finally I am using it at home, and it is getting better and better after each wash.</li>
      <li>Bought one for myself and one for the cars, Super iowels.</li>
      <li>Same fabric but better hems and more color choices</li>
      <li>It would be great if they could improve that, but it&#x27;s not worth compromising the absorbency if it&#x27;s a trade-off factor.</li>
      <li>Not as great as your regular bath towel, but better than the flat microfiber towels we have.  </li>
      <li>I have had the other kind of microfiber towels, not the waffle weave, and they get dingy very quickly and seem to lose their nap - and attract all kinds of lint that inhibits their absorption.</li>
      <li>Well made and worth the money.</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth in quality.</li>
      <li>It saves a bit of time every day and I find it totally worth</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been perfect as it dries me off yet mysteriously never seems to be wet when I take it out of the gym bag.  </li>
      <li>The towel wraps easily into the &amp;#34;turban&amp;#34; I have wrapped forever, and my hair seems to dry a fraction more quickly.  </li>
      <li>and she actually (yea) was thrilled to get them.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They don&#x27;t seem to come in any fun colors.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>This one is far and away my favorite to use at home.</li>
      <li>but no way is it worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll reserve this towel for extra special drying moments I guess!!</li>
      <li>It was amazing how dry my hair was after just toweling off.  </li>
      <li>Aquis towels make all the others seem like they are just pushing the water around on one&#x27;s skin rather than quickly and gently wicking it off oneself.</li>
      <li>These towels manage that task perfectly absorbing excess water extremely quickly.</li>
      <li>This towel does both very well!</li>
      <li>My hair is much drier when I use the microfiber towel than a normal cotton towel or a smooth microfiber towel.  </li>
      <li>I also tried a variety of sizes, since smaller is better for travel.    </li>
      <li>However, I also have the Lisse Crepe towel from the same company, Aquis, and in my opinion, it works a lot faster and is more absorbent.</li>
      <li>Softer, more luxurious, like standard towels?  </li>
      <li>I bought these to use for the pool and for anytime that we visit cabins with hot tubs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For a body towel it works quite well.  Dries quickly on a hangar.  Packs small in luggage.  Is light weight.  No complaints.  Have used a much smaller auto parts version in the past for the bath.  This one is more than big enough to wrap around the waist and performs very well in all respects.</li>
    <li> This larger sized towel is a good size, but the overall texture does not seem to be as absorbent as the smaller, smooth surface one I have for my hair.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00005NATZ Aquis Microfiber Body Towel, Waffle, White (29 x 55-Inches)]]    If you shower at the gym this is a great product to carry with you. It is thin and light weight taking up less space than a regular bath towel. Very absorbent.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for the pool and for anytime that we visit cabins with hot tubs. I like how quickly they absorb water and dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this towel about a month ago to use as a shower towel to take back and forth to the gym.  It&#x27;s been perfect as it dries me off yet mysteriously never seems to be wet when I take it out of the gym bag.  I wash it once a week and it still looks like new.  It is soft and I like the linen color as I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything too flashy.</li>
    <li> I use this towel mainly when I shower at the gym, and let me start off by saying that this towel does dry your body instantly. Its faster than your average cotton towels, however its not as smooth as a cotton towel but you will expect this from a Microfiber towel. Its a good size towel that does wrap around your body, great purchase.</li>
    <li> Although this towel does do a very good job of drying you off.......there is something about the touch that does not appeal to me....that of course is a personal preference of mine.  The towel does do the job and does launder very nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this towel for the past 3 months backpacking around Europe and Asia. It takes up little space, is soft to the touch, durable, and dries really quickly. It&#x27;s by far the best travel towel I&#x27;ve ever used. It may be a little expensive but you&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth in quality.</li>
    <li> Great large towel for the gym. I used the smaller size for years but finally became tired of it&#x27;s small size. Good enough for wiping off but not large enough to wrap around my body. The 29 X 55 does the job but it definitely takes up more room in my gym bag - worth the larger size.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST !!! Drys you off fast,and drys fast too.. So soft and comfy on my skin!!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 different brands/styles of synthetic towels in order to compare: Sea to Summit, REI, and the Aquis &#x27;terry&#x27; style, plus this one. I also tried a variety of sizes, since smaller is better for travel.    This one is far and away my favorite to use at home. It doesn&#x27;t stick and grab when you try to slide it across your skin, the size is perfect, and it absorbs water like crazy.    For travel I&#x27;ll get a smaller one in the same style. All the others work fine for water absorption, but neither the chamois-style nor the terry style works as well in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These towels are remarkable in absorbency, weight, quick drying, gentle, light-weight but exceptionally durable, perfect not only for the bath, but for travel as well (as a scuba diver, such a light yet absorbent towel is truly a great find). As someone who has tried all the 5-star towels - pima cotton, Egyption cotton, organic cotton, Turkish cotton, etc. - Aquis towels make all the others seem like they are just pushing the water around on one&#x27;s skin rather than quickly and gently wicking it off oneself. Try one, you&#x27;ll likely be back to order more.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent towel. I use it for the gym because my gym doesnt have towel service or lockers.. so i have to bring my gym bag to work afterwards. I wanted a light, quick drying towel so it doesnt weigh my bag down or take up too much room and I didnt want a soaked towel sitting in my bag the whole day. This towel does both very well! just wish it had darker colors!</li>
    <li> this towel is okay.  Not as comfortable as a cotton towel, but really good for someone who travels and doesnt want a towel that takes up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t shop late at night on Amazon because I end up buying things I don&#x27;t need like this $20.00 towel.  It&#x27;s a nice towel but no way is it worth the money.  I used it this morning and wasn&#x27;t really getting the \\&quot;O wow!! This is some towel!!\\&quot; feeling.  I also didn&#x27;t think through the prospect of dropping a hundred bucks cuz I&#x27;m gonna need more than one right?  I&#x27;ll reserve this towel for extra special drying moments I guess!! lol.</li>
    <li> I purchased this towel for my teen-aged daughter who traveled to Europe this summer with 450 other student musicians on a trip that took them to five hotels and seven countries in 16 days.  She needed something compact, light-weight and quick-drying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This towel didn&#x27;t take much room in her suitcase, it dried quickly and served as a small blanket for mid-day lunches in city parks.  It was perfect for her trip! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I plan to take the towel with me to Alaska later this summer for the same reasons.</li>
    <li> This is the second Aquis Microfiber Body towel I have purchased.  The waffle weave makes a huge difference.  I had a plain microfiber towel and it just didn&#x27;t feel like a towel.  The Aquis towel has a real towel feel, dries me off  great and then dries out quickly.  I keep it in my gym locker and it&#x27;s dry the next time I need it.  In the summer, I use it after swimming in the morning and it&#x27;s dry by the time I teach swimming in the afternoon.  And it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my locker or gym bag.  It would be great where I used to spend my summers in Michigan where it was tough to dry out the beach towels. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Will this waffle-weave towel feel different from the other flat-weave towels?  Softer, more luxurious, like standard towels?  No - it&#x27;s still a little clingy, but I&#x27;ve bought 10 of these things - they work so well...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m stunned. My whole life I have been towel drying my hair the wrong way! I&#x27;ve used this towel three or four times so far and my hair is soooo much silkier and soft! I couldn&#x27;t find a hair towel size quick dry towel in off white, so I went w this larger towel and while its a little big, the results are amazing! Love love love this towel - who knew!</li>
    <li> I have about five of these towels and they are GREAT. As the ones I own wear out I will be ordering more.  Lightweight and highly adsorbent I actually take one or two with me while traveling.  Never go without one to the gym.</li>
    <li> Excellent....try them....no more wet towels and no musty smells the towels dry immediately they look great and last are ally long time</li>
    <li> I bought these towels primarily because I needed to fit 4 bath towels into the space I had been allocating to 2 large bathsheets. It worked, and these towels are quite absorbent, but they are extremely expensive relative to the cotton towels I replaced. So far, they have dried pretty quickly, but we&#x27;ll see how it is in the rainy spring and fall when the heat isn&#x27;t on. (Terry didn&#x27;t always dry overnight, but there was so much more material to the terry towels that you could always find a dry spot.) My husband doesn&#x27;t like these towels much because they are so thin and don&#x27;t have the feel of a plush terry towel, and they don&#x27;t add anything to the decor of the bathroom, being available in only 2 drab colors. I have had the other kind of microfiber towels, not the waffle weave, and they get dingy very quickly and seem to lose their nap - and attract all kinds of lint that inhibits their absorption. So far, the waffle towels have&#x27;t done that but it hasn&#x27;t been that long....</li>
    <li> This towel is light and absorbent.  I can wrap it around my hair and not have a head or neck ache afterwards.  My thick, curly hair has looked better than it has in a while, thanks to this towel&#x27;s quick drying power.  However, don&#x27;t expect it to dry long, thick hair too quickly - based on the reviews, I figured my hair would be dry after a few minutes, but that was not the case.  Still, it dried faster and nicer than with a regular towel.  I will definitely buy more of these.</li>
    <li> This towel is the best I have ever bought. Whilst not as compact as the more \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; microfiber towels, it is exemplary in every other way. When I received it I was slightly disappointed by the Made in China tag but this nevertheless remains an item of quality.</li>
    <li> Or at least best regular sized bath towels. I&#x27;d never tried these, but when showering at a friend&#x27;s house they suggested I try this. I was actually dry after using it. Much cooler than regular terrycloth towels. They&#x27;re also really soft. My teenaged son loves them! They also fold up quite small and so are super convenient for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides:&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t seem to come in any fun colors.&lt;br /&gt;They are small. Just regular bath towel sized.</li>
    <li> Read the other reviews before buying... Not sure what they like about these. They dont dry you off, like rubbing a shammy over your body....going back to egyptian cotten</li>
    <li> expensive but worth it...saving big on laundering associated costs...easily washed and dried in much shorter time than conventional towels...take up hardly any storage space and dry well...love the waffle weave  :)</li>
    <li> I work out of town on a weekend shift in a hospital and pack travel towels to avoid using the scratchy hospital towels when I shower. Despite doubtful first impressions, these dry you quickly and dry out faster than any other towel I have ever owned or tried. The thin microfiber material makes for a fairly compact packing towel that launders easily and get dry very fast in a low heat dryer. As a travel towel the fact that they completely dry out quickly is a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a number of these and they are holding up well over time. Well made and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Super thin and lightweight and surprisingly absorbent.  Kind of amazing how well it dries you.  Great for travel or the gym!</li>
    <li> I love this towel because it is super absorbent,  lightweight and fast drying. I wish it came in more colors.</li>
    <li> I use these when I shower at the gym after swimming. They are very absorbent but very light. When you have a gym bag full of wet swimming gear you don&#x27;t want a heavy, soggy wet towel in there too. That&#x27;s why these are the only towels I carry in my gym bag.  Don&#x27;t expect them to be cushiony soft like your towels at home.  These are lightweight but thirsty - you just need to pat yourself dry, and they work very well. Then I just roll it up and dump it in my bag and go.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and one for the cars, Super iowels. Have used them for years and the waffle texture is another improvement..</li>
    <li> Their lightweight I really like these towels they dry you good I ordered one and then ordered another one because I like it</li>
    <li> i have lost much hand use, i can hold them, and dry with them.  they are light weight and  dry fast. i have used the hair towel for years, and love them.</li>
    <li> Bought these towels for my future daughter-in-law for Christmas.  Was hoping she wouldn&#x27;t be insulted about getting &amp;#34;a towel&amp;#34; when she opened her package.  Put a note in about how wonderful I had heard they were and she actually (yea) was thrilled to get them.  She already knew about them but didn&#x27;t have any.  She even brought them with her when she traveled here to visit.  Score!</li>
    <li> The Whys: I first bought these towels years and years ago at a TJMaxx. They are so wonderful,  I wanted to have only these type at home and for travel. Specific Features: Hotels never ever provide a &#x27;hair towel&#x27; that wraps around easily. These towels manage that task perfectly absorbing excess water extremely quickly. They are easy to pack in bags, easy to wash, quickly to dry and are my best travel companions! I always travel with several of these as I dislike huge towels that leave me half dry. I cannot compare them to &#x27;similar products&#x27; as I have not seen any other than this brand and would not attempt to buy something I don&#x27;t know. To me they are the best towel on Earth. Wish they would manufacture them with a wider color palette. However, they serve the purpose I use them for and that&#x27;s sufficient for me. Given the fact that they last so many years, the price is a bargain for sure!!  I did not buy them to satisfy expectations because as a long time user I need not have expectations for a product I believe in. Best towels ever, either for hair or body.</li>
    <li> I have bought nearly every brand of quick dry towels and can say that this is the best.  The surface feels more natural and less like a synthetic.  The waffle style absorbs water more quickly and thoroughly and also dries more quickly.  Other brands feel unnatural and a lot less like a quality cotton towel.    Take one of these with you to help you with your quick dry boxers, socks, and t-shirts.  Highly recommended for all who are converting to one bag travel.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these to take to a mission trip to Haiti last fall.  They were perfect for the trip -- took very little space inside my duffle bag and dried very quickly after use, even in Haiti&#x27;s high humidity.  And they did a great job of drying me off after my \\&quot;shower\\&quot; each morning.  It was amazing how dry my hair was after just toweling off.  I&#x27;m planning on taking them with me for my annual camping trip this summer, too, and know they&#x27;ll be perfect for that as well.</li>
    <li> This 29&amp;#34; x 55&amp;#34; Aquis Microfiber Towel in the Waffle Weave is ok.  I researched it thoroughly and read all the reviews, so I really wanted to believe that it would cut drying time in half.  The towel wraps easily into the &amp;#34;turban&amp;#34; I have wrapped forever, and my hair seems to dry a fraction more quickly.  I have even wrapped my hair in a regular towel FIRST, then wrapped it in this towel so it wouldn&#x27;t be overwhelmed with water, but it wasn&#x27;t remarkable.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> Bought this towel for my teenage daughter&#x27;s  hike. It&#x27;s lightweight, takes up very little room, yet is a bath sheet when open (huge). Dries in about 1/2 the time a regular bath towel takes to dry. It&#x27;s also a neutral color, so it doesn&#x27;t show dirt that easily. Great find!</li>
    <li> We were excited to try this towel after reading all the great reviews, and were really disappointed.  We used it as a bath towel, and it&#x27;s just worthless.  It pushes the water around by doesn&#x27;t absorb--flat out, it doesn&#x27;t dry you.  Or at least, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s drying you.  Definitely not for everyone, and not for us.</li>
    <li> Very absorbent, dries quickly, and very light.  The sticky, ultra-absorbent texture is annoying to work with, feeling a bit flimsy and even cold.  Instead of a quick rub-down, I nearly have to pat myself dry - otherwise, it would probably dry me off quicker than a regular towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were carrying my own towel somewhere, I&#x27;d probably choose this because of its effectiveness.  For daily use, I&#x27;d choose a nice towel, or even a regular towel, over this one.</li>
    <li> These towels are very nicely sized but the fabric is kind of sticky feeling. I need light weight because of my arthritis so these work well in that regard.</li>
    <li> I had bought some other travel towels such as the Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel in Graphite, but this waffle weave towel is the one to get. FAR superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why this is the one to get:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s (relatively) soft, absorbent and feels more like a real towel than the other travel towels I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s big enough to wrap around me and stay covered decently while at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;3) I would say that it&#x27;s still very light and small, and whatever extra weight/bulk over the other towels is fairly imperceptable compared to the utility you get from it.&lt;br /&gt;4) It seems to dry as well or better than the other travel towels I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;If I were going hiking, this would still be the towel I would get, since I don&#x27;t see the point in saving an ounce in weight only to curse at the lighter but far less absorbent towel and work twice as hard to try to dry off.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! super happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Aquis Microfiber Body Towel, Waffle, Linen, (29 x 55-Inches) for travelling, but finally I am using it at home, and it is getting better and better after each wash.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite towel ever. All the other towels in my bath are being neglected. All you have to do is wrap this wonderful, soft towel around you and you are dry. The minute it touches your body it absorbs all the moisture. I am replacing all the towels in my house with Aquis microfiber towels...one by one. They dry so fast too- so they are always ready to use the next time. I think they cut down on laundry.</li>
    <li> I love Aquis towels.  They are soft, super-absorbant, fast drying and lightweight.  The waffle aquis is even more absorbant and quick-wicking than the regular variety, apparently because of the increased surface area. They take up less room in the linen closet and suitcase too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A lot of women with long hair have already written reviews on this towel, and they all agree that this towel saves considerable amount of time. I was wondering if this product was worth trying since I am a man with relatively short hair. Yes. It saves time with short hair as well. But not as drastically as I read on those reviews by long hair women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that, with a cotton towel, there is a limit to how dry my hair can get with towel drying, no matter how hard I try. After that point, I have to air dry. This towel can get my hair drier than the limit of cotton towel by usual towel dry effort. Same is true for the body. I can get dressed almost immediately after jumping out of shower, and my hair naturally dries so that I can apply hard gel. It saves a bit of time every day and I find it totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric feels quite differently on skin, however, and some people don&#x27;t seem to like it. The towel doesn&#x27;t slide as naturally on skin, compared to cotton. Sometimes I pat where I used to wipe. It would be great if they could improve that, but it&#x27;s not worth compromising the absorbency if it&#x27;s a trade-off factor.</li>
    <li> A set of these 29X55-inch towels and the matching hair towel make up our towel set in the RV.  They save space, are very absorbent, and hang-dry super-quickly.</li>
    <li> Only the best for a body towel for drying fast</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband and myself.  We use them as regular bath towels.  They dry quicker and terrycloth and lightweight for your washing machine.  This is the only brand towel we now use and purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great towel. As the other reviewers have said, it absorbs very quickly. However, I also have the Lisse Crepe towel from the same company, Aquis, and in my opinion, it works a lot faster and is more absorbent. However, the waffle towel is MUCH softer. There are basically pros and cons. With the softness, you get a bit less absorbancy. However, it works 10 times faster than a regular cotton towel, It&#x27;s definitely worth the price as well! Just remember, don&#x27;t wash it with fabric softener (this causes towels to decrease in their absorbancy!)</li>
    <li> Good product that I have used before.  It was easier than going back to the store.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this towel again.  Great service!</li>
    <li> Ok the censuses in our house is we hated it.  It is very absorbent but it sticks to you as you try to dry off.  It&#x27;s not soft as stated in other reviews.  Not at all impressed.  Back to the old terry cloth towels for us!!!!</li>
    <li> We have a few microfiber towels for camping.  I like the waffle texture.  Not as great as your regular bath towel, but better than the flat microfiber towels we have.  It has held up well through one camping season.</li>
    <li> This is a real nice Micro Fiber towel, BUT there are others that are just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Fina Waffle Weave towel. Better towel for less than half the money and quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I tried them all. The Aquis is a good towel but way too much money.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Fina better. Same fabric but better hems and more color choices&lt;br /&gt;I have them both and for the money the Fina is a way better deal.&lt;br /&gt;Just put Fina Waffle Weave Towel in the Amazon search to check them out.</li>
    <li> These towels are the best! They are super absorbent.  Just lightly pat, and you&#x27;re all dry. I just wish more colors were available.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this towel for my limited space RV.  It feels horrible, just like the microfiber cloths we clean our car with.  Even my guy did not like the feel.  I&#x27;ll be sending them back.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother-in-law who needs a lighter weight towel. She&#x27;s very happy with it. Aquis makes good quality microfiber towels. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> This product does help with drying time, but not as much as I had hoped, and as much as other reviews led me to believe. I would say it reduces dry time by 25% or so. I do like the fact that the towel is much thinner and lighter then cotton.</li>
    <li> I had bought one of these towels years ago for gym use but have been using it on my thick, coarse, curly hair.  I wrap it into a turban and then turn it around to the drier side after about 10 minutes. My hair is much drier when I use the microfiber towel than a normal cotton towel or a smooth microfiber towel.  I do not have to wring or rub my hair with the towel, which reduces damage to my bottom on my neck length hair. Highly recommended by Naturally Curly site and me.</li>
