      <li>I got light brown in 22inches, and the length is perfect.</li>

      <li>love them, they take forever to put in.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super soft and shiny and the color matched my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>and together they look fine.</li>
      <li>Honestly the hair blended in so well (after I cut them) ,it looks like my real hair.</li>
      <li>But I do enjoy the length.</li>
      <li>and I decided to get 2 sets since 80 grams isn&#x27;t enough volume for me.other than that the quality of the hair is great,  </li>
      <li>Just used today, so far so good.</li>
      <li>I bought light brown, but seems more like a light blonde.</li>

      <li>At first they were soft and smooth but after curling and straightening them a few times that got not soft and plastic feeling, I suggest saving money and buying better ones.</li>
      <li>Just not thick.</li>
      <li>Thin, need to layer to get a good thickness</li>
      <li>already so it blended fine with my other ones.  </li>

      <li>That is why I wanted to extend my hair to make it fuller and lively.  </li>
      <li>They are very very very think though, especially towards the ends of the hair</li>
      <li>The clips are a little loose but the hair is nice and long and soft.</li>
      <li>A little thin but length was great.</li>
      <li>It is easy to curl, but I was kind off disappointed that they were so thin and made my hair look poor in volume but great in length.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Would purchase again and again when needed and recommend to others looking to improve and define their hair.  My hair is rather thin.  That is why I wanted to extend my hair to make it fuller and lively.  These extensions did just that.  Although they were bought with the combs and as a sewed weft, I removed the combs and weft and made I-tips to attach them to my strand of hair as I-tip extensions using micro beads.  They worked out perfectly.  Unless you know what you are doing, I do recommend buying I-tips already made.  The combs on these hair extensions do not stay in place well.  But, the quality of the hair is perfect for anyone.</li>
    <li> These extensions are great! They are light on the head, and real human hair. I was a little skeptical about these extensions, especially for the price, but I&#x27;m glad I bought them! I got light brown in 22inches, and the length is perfect. On the left are my new 22 inch extensions, and on the right are my 18 inch extensions (which I paid 80$ for at Sally&#x27;s). I do suggest buying 2 packs, one doesn&#x27;t seem like enough.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE! DO NOT BUY! THEY ARE NOT 100% REAL HAIR! I TRIED TO DYE THEM 2 TIMES! THEN TOOK THEM TO MY HAIR DRESSER, AND  SHE TOLD ME I GOT RIPPED OFF. I BOUGHT 2 PACKS AND THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT COLOR. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE, THEY WOULDN&#x27;T HELP ME AT ALL. THEY GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND SO MANY TIMES. SO I TOSSED THEM OUT. BEWARE, THESE ARE NOT REMY HAIR!</li>
    <li> i added these along with the extensions I got from rapunzelrapunzel.com and together they look fine. They smell weird though when used with a hot tool. They are very very very think though, especially towards the ends of the hair</li>
    <li> Extensions were good. A little thin but length was great. Clips are still really stiff and hurt a little if worn too long</li>
    <li> At first they were soft and smooth but after curling and straightening them a few times that got not soft and plastic feeling, I suggest saving money and buying better ones.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted these for Christmas so I bought them for her and she absolutely loves them. When she has them in, no one can tell that they are extensions. She gets so many compliments on her hair. I will definitely order these again and refer them to others looking for extensions.</li>
    <li> For the price of the item I got what I paid for. The clips are a little loose but the hair is nice and long and soft. Just not thick.</li>
    <li> Same length it said. They would&#x27;ve been perfect if it wasn&#x27;t synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely everything it says but don&#x27;t get them of you don&#x27;t want synthetic. Disappointed</li>
    <li> The extensions are very thin looking and have some pieces of black plastic hair. It is easy to curl, but I was kind off disappointed that they were so thin and made my hair look poor in volume but great in length.</li>
    <li> Long human hair. Very thin. But I do enjoy the length.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the colori ordered.Also the hair sheds a lot. I would not recommend this product. Plus I couldn&#x27;t return since it was to expensive.</li>
    <li> I used them for like... maybe a week, they tangle, aren&#x27;t real, and the color is WAY redder then shown... Would NOT recomend them.</li>
    <li> For $30 this is as good as it gets! This is my second time buying and I decided to get 2 sets since 80 grams isn&#x27;t enough volume for me.other than that the quality of the hair is great,  it&#x27;s super soft and shiny and the color matched my hair perfectly. Honestly the hair blended in so well (after I cut them) ,it looks like my real hair.I have also curled and straightened them and they are still in perfect conditions. For this price,I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone</li>
    <li> cant beat it for the price! love them, they take forever to put in. but its worth it. my hair looks so full and they match my hair perfect!</li>
    <li> Thin, need to layer to get a good thickness</li>
    <li> these came earlier than expected I was happy when I see them until I got them out and notice how thin they were my hair is really thick so I need at least two packs the color was good but they did shed quite a bit. For the price I could make my own if I bought a weft without clips and sewed them on myself.</li>
    <li> Just got my extentions in the mail yesterday and I haven&#x27;t wore them yet nut the quality seems great but the color was off for my hair color looked way diffrent online when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Was a little thin but most extensions that come w. Clips usually are. The quality of the hair is good and definitely worth 30 bucks! I bought light brown, but seems more like a light blonde. I have different colors already so it blended fine with my other ones.  Just used today, so far so good. Curls nicely! Will buy again if nothing goes wrong :-)</li>
