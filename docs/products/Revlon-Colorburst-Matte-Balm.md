    <li> Nice dark mauve. Stayed on well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lipstick! On me, it is the perfect natural shade of my lips which makes it perfect for those natural makeup looks. Glides on super smooth and lasts all day without having to reapply (I always powder my lips though, so I dont know how long it would last without being set). It has a fantasticly subtle mint scent to it and tingles just a touch going on which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesnt exactly go matte by itself. But this is easily fixed with a powder so its a minor complaint. Absolutly reccomend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I uploaded several pictures of myself wearing it in different lights)</li>
    <li> Did not buy from Amazon but you have to have this. I&#x27;m going to get more in other shades. It last pretty long even without lip liner.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have about five of these now. :)</li>
    <li> product arrived in a melted gross mess/ was not able to use</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly. The only downside was the price. I paid double the price it would sell in a drugstore.</li>
    <li> The color is definitely different!  It is more pink/red.  I had to give it to someone else who could wear the color better.</li>
    <li> I love this!! The color is perfect, subtle and not to bright for someone my age.</li>
    <li> such a great color, easy to apply and if i have leftover on my lips i just dab some onto my cheeks too for matching blush! looks great!</li>
    <li> great color! it doesn&#x27;t stay on if you drink or eat something, but the matte looks really good</li>
    <li> The Revlon Matte Balm collection is probably my new favorite addiction. I have it in about 4 shades now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#225 aka &amp;#34;Sultry&amp;#34; was my first purchase and it is a really unique shade of dusty maroon. This formula is matte but moisturizing. Exfoliate your lips a bit beforehand and it will do you right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color does transfer onto other stuff like my boyfriend, dinner napkins, etc. but it also clings to my lips so that by the end of dinner I&#x27;m not left with a lip liner ring and no lip color. You&#x27;ll need to reapply but over all I&#x27;m pleased with its staying power.</li>
    <li> I love this color. A nice deep dusty pink. Goes on real smooth, but the corners need reapplying maybe twice a day. It&#x27;s a little minty, if you like that.</li>
    <li> it applies really smooth, hydrates your lips and it is such a beautiful color.  I am tan and have pigmented lips and this color really looks amazing!!!! give it a try!</li>
    <li> I love this balm so much! It is such a pretty color, lasts long, and does not dry my lips. Get it!</li>
    <li> i love the revlon colorburst matte balms this one how ever is my favorite because its a redish mauve . however these photos are a little inaccurate to the color , its looks a little brown in these pictures .</li>
    <li> adore this balm will get it again and in more colors.</li>
    <li> Very good product. More of a pinkish color than I thought, thought it looked more towards the darker side in the picture. Its a very neutral natural color. Good product overall lasted several hours before I had to reapply.</li>
    <li> Difficult to put on and dries the lips very quickly</li>
    <li> I found this on Pinterest, and it was a little deeper of a pink than I expected from the Pinterest photo...more of a cranberry...but looks as shown in this picture! I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color especially for pigmented lips! I have tan skin and this goes perfect with my complexion. Staying power is good too. It&#x27;s a little drying but nothing that Chapstick won&#x27;t fix</li>
    <li> This had 0% resenblance. I got some black glittery shoes instead</li>
    <li> Great product, extremely fast delivery,</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s like a buttery matte lipstick. It is so easy to apply and it feels great. I think it must have menthol in it or something because it feels a little cool when first applied. It lasts a good while too and I haven&#x27;t noticed it drying out my lips too bad.</li>
    <li> Good color, a bit dry.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. Not as dark as expected but I still really like it. Super smooth and easy to apply. Would look great for casual and dressy makeup!</li>
