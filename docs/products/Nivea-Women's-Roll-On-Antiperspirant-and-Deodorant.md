      <li>Very happy for the speedy process...</li>
      <li>There is no mistake with Nivea - any product - the best outthere.</li>
      <li>He loves the feel and smell of this deodorant and is not truly happy with anything else.</li>
      <li>I was happy with the time it took to get here and the quality and value.</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find it on here.</li>
      <li>Returning home, we bought the 3-pack from Amazon and are still quite happy with the Nivea product.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
      <li>Good product</li>
      <li>Good product, does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
      <li>This came nicely packaged and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>good, i like it smell</li>
      <li>Apart from the quantity, it&#x27;s pretty awesome !</li>
      <li>I ordered these for my husband and he really liked them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, but doubt I&#x27;ll buy again.  </li>
      <li>He said it really helped him stay cool in this California heat!!!</li>
      <li>Good stuff for decent price</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; so the wife was fine with using it.</li>
      <li>Smell great, goes on dry, and it works.</li>
      <li>It was very hot - walking all over Rome and all over Paris</li>
      <li>It goes on dry, smells nice but not overpowering or the scent doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; as the day goes on.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely still better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This Nivea Cool Kick Spray Deodorant has proved to be very difficult to find and I was very happy to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Very expensive and must be perfect, as well as exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, to be worth the price IMHO.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, but I&#x27;ll look for something else next time that might last longer.</li>
      <li>(I heard those dates were record high temps for Paris) -</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I must remove one star due to the fact that the product has changed significantly.</li>
      <li>First purchased this deodorant early last year.</li>
      <li>The new nozzle twists to open and close.</li>
      <li>really does work keeping you dry, but one heck of a time trying to wash it off at shower time....</li>
      <li>The size is a bit small and it doesn&#x27;t last a long time but on the other hand, it makes it nice to throw in for travel</li>

<li> Different odor than product sold in England and disappointingly small amount of product per can.</li>

    <li> good, i like it smell</li>
    <li> On time and as described</li>
    <li> I bought this 3-pack as a surprise gift for my son who began using this product several years ago in Europe.  This Nivea Cool Kick Spray Deodorant has proved to be very difficult to find and I was very happy to find it here on Amazon.  I wish it was a Prime product allowing TWO-day shipping.  He loves the feel and smell of this deodorant and is not truly happy with anything else.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, but doubt I&#x27;ll buy again.  These things don&#x27;t last long at all.  Before you know it the can is empty, seems like it lasts on  a couple of weeks.  The smell is nice, but I&#x27;ll look for something else next time that might last longer.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for decent price</li>
    <li> Bought this deodorant in Europe in May for use by all 3 of us - my teenage son, my wife, and me. It was very hot - walking all over Rome and all over Paris (I heard those dates were record high temps for Paris) - but we never once detected any body odor on any of us. It doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; so the wife was fine with using it. Returning home, we bought the 3-pack from Amazon and are still quite happy with the Nivea product.</li>
    <li> really does work keeping you dry, but one heck of a time trying to wash it off at shower time....how dow you get it off?? leaves a sticky feeling and does not wash off with soap and washcloth!</li>
    <li> First purchased this deodorant early last year. Finally ran out of the few bottles I had and reordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I must remove one star due to the fact that the product has changed significantly. The new nozzle twists to open and close. It does not last as long as it used to and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same. It&#x27;s definitely still better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried. Also, going to have to remove another star for cost. Very expensive and must be perfect, as well as exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, to be worth the price IMHO.</li>
    <li> This came nicely packaged and it&#x27;s a great product. It works well in Southern California. I am starting to see these in US stores, but not this brand. I bought some in Mexico previously so I was happy to find it on here. I was happy with the time it took to get here and the quality and value.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  It goes on dry, smells nice but not overpowering or the scent doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; as the day goes on.  The odor protection lasts all day with no problem for me.  The size is a bit small and it doesn&#x27;t last a long time but on the other hand, it makes it nice to throw in for travel or you gym bag.</li>
    <li> There is no mistake with Nivea - any product - the best outthere.</li>
    <li> Good product, does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> get compliments on its scent all the time. Good product</li>
    <li> Apart from the quantity, it&#x27;s pretty awesome !</li>
    <li> Very happy for the speedy process... i am now well stocked with the product. Thank you,</li>
