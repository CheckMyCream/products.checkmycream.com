      <li>I Love this image plate, I bought it because I wanted the big flower image, and it is awesome, all of the other images are cute too and they all pick up and work just fine for me :)</li>
      <li>I think they need to work on the plate more to get it right.</li>
      <li>I still need a lot of practice but the plate worked fine with the special nail polish from konad.</li>
      <li>Use plastic scraper even a old credit card or something of the sort will work :)</li>
      <li>images are clear and easy to use, I just make sure to use a old plastic gift card to scrape the nail polish so as not to strach the plate.</li>
      <li>Wish the designs were larger but they are super cute.</li>

      <li>I really wanted to get this plate for the plaid design and when I received it the design did not stamp well at all.</li>
      <li>I really like this plate.</li>
      <li>Nice, deeply etched designs for a solid transfer!</li>
      <li>Konad is always a dependable brand for stamping supplies, highly suggest this if you like stamping.</li>
      <li>This is probably my favorite of the half dozen plates I&#x27;ve purchased so far.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this specifically for the designs and it works nicely but very small compared to my Monster plates.</li>
      <li>The images are too small to do a full nail stamp.  </li>
