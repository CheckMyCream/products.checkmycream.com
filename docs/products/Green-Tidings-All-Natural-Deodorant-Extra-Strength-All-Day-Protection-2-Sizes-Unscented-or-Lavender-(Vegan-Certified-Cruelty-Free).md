<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In an effort to reduce my family&#x27;s intake of harmful chemicals.. we did much research on not only all natural deodorants, but ones that actually worked.. I can honestly say.. WOW.. this product works VERY well.  I like many others have tried other brands.. (many others) but this is truly the only product that we can use with 100% confidence.  Both myself and my wife are very active people that hit the gym every morning.  This is the only deodorant we need.  We have been using the product for about 4 months and would recommend it to anyone looking to reduce the intake of chemicals in deodorant and who want a product that actually works.  Also.. to address some people&#x27;s complaint about a slight reaction to the product... I too had seemingly dead skin under my arms after about a month of use.  Once it cleared, it never returned.  I feel much better knowing that I am no longer absorbing all the dangerous chemicals through my skin... If you are not aware.. look it up.. very scary!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best! Tried several other natural deodorants and none of them works like Green Tidings. Love that this product is a stick solid and not a crème or liquid. I wear a white uniform top to work and deodorants with aluminum gave me yellow pit stains. This product does not. It has a nice lavender smell. As far as perspiration goes, it keeps me as dry as those with the harsh chemicals. I am very satisfied with this product! I have reordered 2 or 3 times. I will continue to use this product as long as the manufacturer sells it. I am a very happy customer!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is a great natural deodorant. I use to get hair bumps using other deodorants but not this one. My girlfriend and I love this product . I would say don&#x27;t expect to last over 8 hrs. I do h r to reapply but it&#x27;s worth it being natural</li>
    <li> I really love this deodorant!  It works really well (and all day too).  I absolutely love that all of the ingredients are natural, non-gmo, etc.  I was nervous at first that I chose to buy the 3-pack without trying the product first, but it turns out it was a great decision, as I love this product.</li>
    <li> This has been a fantastic deodorant. After dropping the anti-perspirant side of products years ago, I noticed no apparent effect on perspiration (and I used to invest in &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; types) but a significant improvement (100%) in the yellow-stains that plagued the under-areas of my shirts. I then sought out natural alternatives as the next step in my underarm-treatment transformation. The Green Tidings Lavender variety was my first stop based on the positive reviews, and I have found no reason to continue searching for new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant, mild, and truly gender-neutral. I have yet to notice any significant conflict in odor on the rare occasion I wear a cologne. Most importantly, even at the end of the most active of days, there is no offensive breakthrough smell from my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with a single stick, but quickly reordered with a 3-pack. I would highly recommend the product to anyone looking into natural deodorants.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service! It is all natural and it works very well. I was worry that it might not be as good as other regular deodorants, but it turned out that it is even better. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Return customer. Love this product. Smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of deoderant on the face of the planet. I mean it. From normal, antiperspirant, natural, homemade concoctions, prescription strength and none work even close to as wonderful as green tidings! Someone reccommended it to me and I&#x27;ll never turn back. It truly is amazing! It&#x27;s good for you and WORKS!!! It is instantly relieving and removes nasty smelling body Oder and sweat. Immediately!!!! I&#x27;ve used it for 5 months now and by this point all my over deoderants would be doing nothing... It&#x27;s still amazing.</li>
    <li> Works so far, will let you know in the 100+ degree weather</li>
    <li> Bye-bye stinkiness...It works!!! I&#x27;ve just re-ordered GT&#x27;s natural deodorant, and I will continue to stock up because this is the ONLY &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;/sans-chemical/bad-stuff-free deodorant that has worked for me and eliminated my B.O.  Yeah, I still sweat a bit, but I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;!! Actually, I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants with similar formulations, but none have worked as well as GT&#x27;s for both odor and taming sweat.  As mentioned, my underarms still &amp;#34;glisten,&amp;#34; but much less than with other natural deodorants; more importantly, the odor is gone!!!!  An added bonus is that my underarms are never irritated and, actually, feel soothed after shaving and applying GT&#x27;s natural deodorant.  I&#x27;m a happy, stink-free, and hooked consumer.</li>
    <li> Personally use the unscented variety but I got the lavander for my daughter. Just like her dad loves the unscented she loves the lavander. Both of us agree this is the first product we&#x27;ve ever used that eliminates odor. Honestly I can play hockey for two solid hours sweating like a madman yet my armpits don&#x27;t smell</li>
    <li> Works well if you are not doing any heavy movement but stains clothing. I only use it with dark color clothing. Do not wear light colors.</li>
    <li> It works, but the batch I got is soft and I can&#x27;t roll it on without a blob attaching itself to my underarms, so now I&#x27;m using my fingers to put it on.  It&#x27;s hard to justify the price on this and with how fast it goes.  It does have a nice scent and it feels good knowing that I&#x27;m using something safe on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried many!)  and I feel good about the ingredients.  For example, it contains magnesium, which many people are deficient in.  And of course, there&#x27;s no aluminum, triclosan, or other questionable additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this product to be more effective at preventing odor (instead of just covering it up) than the commercial &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; products.  You may need to use Green Tidings for a few days to a week before achieving the full benefits.  This is what happened with me, and I&#x27;m glad I stayed with it.  The results are well worth it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super grateful that I took the plunge and purchased these gems. I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant for years but the ones I&#x27;ve tried will work in the beginning and then a month later - FAIL! I&#x27;ve been odor free with this deodorant for a few months now and I&#x27;m loving it. This is deodorant not anti-perspirant so you will have wet pits when the situation makes it so but I don&#x27;t really notice it too much. Also, another review stated that this is only for woman because it will rip your hair out - it does go on rough (hair or no hair) but only if it&#x27;s cool. Once it gets warmed up by swiping it a few times, it&#x27;s super smooth.</li>
    <li> So many natural deodorants I&#x27;ve bought and ended up throwing away because they could not do the job.  I was intrigued by the ingredients listed in Green Tidings deodorant, so I was hopeful and bought a three pack for the extra savings.  I was sold the first day I put this on and have continued to be amazed each day.  It is such high quality, and I&#x27;m so happy using it.  I&#x27;m still giving 5 stars despite how expensive it is because I love it that much!!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these small deodorants and it was non irritating and seemed to control odor fairly well.  I decided to go ahead and order a three pack of the larger size.  I looked at the ingredient list to see if gold was one of the secret additives based on the price.  Oh well, if it worked well I could overlook the cost.  I have discovered that all three deodorants have become less and less solid as I have used them.  I currently have the tops off all three in an attempt to dry them out.  I feel like I am trying to rub two parts brown sugar mixed with one part water on my armpits every day.  What a mess.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of natural deodrants, none are anything like this. it works like a dream. I have finally found one that is about as perfect as a true antiperspirant as you can get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorant and this one really does work on odors. It has a wonderful, true lavender smell, (not a fake, chemical lavender smell). It&#x27;s like a dry stick, the grainy texture is a little odd at first. It does not stain clothing.</li>
    <li> The Sad Dad is finally happy.  You never know what you are getting sometimes when you order online.  I must say that I have been completely happy with Green Tidings deodorant.  I sweat a lot, run to meetings all day long and usually have a slight body odor by let&#x27;s say, 2:00 p.m. This deodorant works for me!  I may have a little residue left in my t-shirts, but it washes away unlike the residue left by deodorants with harsh chemicals.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve thrown several t-shirts away.  But with Green Tidings, I&#x27;ve been able to save my shirts and more importantly, my image.  I no longer have an odor in the afternoon and my skin finally feels normal when I shower.  No dried or sticky residue on the skin either.  I&#x27;ve order this products a few times and now, my wife wears it too.  She is also pleased. The product can get a little pricey over time, but let&#x27;s face it, it works and I feel good knowing that I am not allowing certain harsh chemicals to enter my body under the arms.  I&#x27;m trying to be healthy.  Eating right is part of good health, but so is using harmless products for the body.  Green Tidings is a good place to start.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, a little to expensive.</li>
    <li> Works very well, better than any natural deoderant or aluminum deoderant I have ener used.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!  I researched and have purchased several other &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; and nothing even comes close to this!! Chemicals aren&#x27;t good for you and this stuff is!!  While I do sweat, I don&#x27;t smell and  that is the purpose of a deodorant. Sweating is good for you and this stuff is amazing.  Try it you will LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> So far this is the best natural deodorant i have tried out of 5 brands. The only reason for 4 stars is that I wish the price was a little more affordable compared to what i used to spend (this is priced roughly 10 times higher than what I used to pay with coupons) for deodorant, but it lasts me all day and works very well! I like that it has a great scent, has a smooth but not too sticky texture, is natural, and comes in a tube for easy application. I plan to be a customer when possible, and if the company offered regular sales or promotions, I would definitely be a regular buyer. Great product!</li>
    <li> This works well on my daughter who, in my opinion, is too young for deodorants that are not all natural. Keeps her fresh through the school day and long soccer practices.  I have tried other all natural deodorants for her, but this works the best.</li>
    <li> I like the &#x27;natural&#x27; part of this deodorant (no harsh chemicals with unpronounceable names) and the perfume is mild.  However, it leaves my armpits quite dark with regular use (seems to be temporary since things return to normal when I discontinue use for a while - perhaps a reaction to the magnesium in the product).  That said, it&#x27;s quite expensive and doesn&#x27;t deliver on the 24-hour promise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple natural deoderants and this is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve found that works and has a great smell!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is all natural. Big fan and I work out a lot. The freshness never leaves you.</li>
    <li> I have approximately 10 different bottles (containers) of natural deoderants that did not work with my hormonal, stinky, body chemistry. After complaining to my sister about my dilemma, and  explaining my convictions about using an aluminum, chemical free product, she asked her NTR doctor for a recommendation. My sister loved Green Tidings so much she sent it as an X-mas gift to all the women in our family. After my first use I loved the texure, the scent (lavender), and long lasting coverage... Yay, finally a natural deoderant that works for me!!!</li>
    <li> Amazed how well this deodorant works!! I live in Florida and summers are hot and muggy, it works very well.  No odor and no wetness.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant out there! This stuff lasts all day without having to reapply! I used to use dove, well that went right in the garbage! I have tried other brands also that don&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t sweat a lot, but for some reason when I wear sleeveless shirts, I start to stink within a few hours. Not with this stuff! No stink or sweat! I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! Both my husband and I use it. It really works! We were concerned about the aluminum content in commercial deodorants and switched to this product. I was concerned about the antiperspirant wetness issue, but even as a heavy sweater, this product seems to keep it in check. I tend to have a heavier body odor and need strong deodorants - some commercial products don&#x27;t work for me. This product has been a real success - even works well 2 days later! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve tried MANY natural ones and this is the only one that keeps me dry and I don&#x27;t have to reapply to keep from stinking. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> We didn&#x27;t want to put the toxic ingredients in deodorant on our armpits, so we tried A LOT of natural deodorants. Nothing from Whole Foods worked, sadly even Trader Joe&#x27;s version didn&#x27;t work. People began avoiding us for some reason. Since Amazon has been having all of the answers lately, we tried Green Tidings. Now, we can participate in society again. It holds up all day and the lavender scent is very very pleasant (not sweet or fruity, more like fresh laundry) and people tell us we smell good, and that hasn&#x27;t happened in a long time. A lot of times when you get on the natural bandwagon you end up with inadequate hygiene because most eco stuff is just too weak. Green Tidings merged non-toxicity and functionality in a market of crappy &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; products and dangerous mainstream products. We can now hug people without fear. Thank you Green Tidings.</li>
    <li> Big time sweater. Since day one of using I am dry and stink free. I have only been using this for one week and have already converted my husband, sister, best friend and her hubby as well. Love Green Tidings.</li>
    <li> It caused raised red marks in my armpits and the smell was really funky. Did not like.</li>
    <li> This has worked excellent for me even in humid climate, and I like that this product does not contain toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> But remember, it&#x27;s only a deodorant and not an antiperspirant</li>
    <li> After years of trying (and wasting money) different natural deodorants, we found the BEST one. Green tidings deodorant really works even when it&#x27;s 90+ F and humid outside.</li>
    <li> The only natural deoderant that has work for me and my husband. We both like the soft lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;It even works after a heavy work out. We are sold!!!</li>
    <li> this product works great!!!I have a very active job and this keeps me dry and smelling great all day. I love how easily it glides on. Definitely found my new deodorant highly recommend!! Loving this product for 3 months now.</li>
    <li> Plagued by multichemical sensitivity, I have tried a dozen &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; deodorants, none of which I would buy again. After reading the reviews of Green Tidings, I decided this would be my final fling before resigned myself to a less-fresh life and scented body powder. My coworkers and I are happy to report that Green Tidings is the real thing - freshness that lasts all day without aluminium and other chemicals. I have tossed everything else in the trash (or recycling bin). THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Got this secondhand as it didn&#x27;t work for my wife (sensitive skin). So I didn&#x27;t really want it, and had zero expectations. And reading the ingredients on this didn&#x27;t raise my hopes either... but since I&#x27;ve learned how to get by with the rock crystal deodorants, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m mightily impressed. Not only does this work for me, it&#x27;s as effective as the big-brand commercial antiperspirant sticks that I used to use. I had to give those up because I ultimately developed an allergy (not sure if it was the heavy chemical content or the fact that it weighed on my skin like a coat of paint). No such issues with this after several months of use, which includes heavy outdoor activity in hot and humid North Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not to say this stuff enables you to work out in the heat right before attending a black-tie event. (Come on, nothing works like that!) What it does, is enables you to get through a whole day of strenuous activity without having to repeatedly disinfect and reapply.</li>
    <li> I really like this deoderant it has a great smell to it and works well to keep my &amp;#34;natural odor &amp;#34; under control with my day to day life. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals although it&#x27;s on the more expensive side, 1 tube lasted me 2 1/2 months so not bad really!! Thanks for making a great product only thing that would make it better is if I could send the tubes back for a refill to cut down on waste!!</li>
    <li> This is the first all natural deodorant that FINALLY works for me. I have tried everything from TOMs to Trader Joe&#x27;s organic crystals, they never seemed to do this trick. This keeps me smelling fresh all day long. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my family too. Do yourself a favor and try this out!</li>
    <li> I commute by biking about 8 miles and no smell from sweating!</li>
    <li> This works GREAT for people who need a little extra &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; in their deodorant.</li>
    <li> Best ever! This is the only deodorant I have found that is safe to use and works great. Love love love this product</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter who absolutely loves it! I will try it myself.</li>
    <li> I am still beyond impressed with this deodorant after using it for more than a year. I am a farm wife and I sweat a lot. This product actually works and works well! I feel good about putting it on my body, and it is wonderful for my sensitive skin. I had given up on finding a safe, non-irritating, effective deodorant before I found this... I would seriously hug the makers if I could!</li>
    <li> I had never been very impressed with natural deodorants before, but this stuff is all it is advertised to be - it works great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and have started developing horrible painful acne under my arms. I thought it was originally from waxing, then shaving, finally gave up on both and still had problems. It got so bad I gave up on deodorant one day and just started swabbing them with Dr Bronners rosewater. Haven&#x27;t worn deodorant in a week and my underarms have completely cleared. It makes me sad that it&#x27;s probably the deoderant because it&#x27;s the first deoderant and years that really wired for me.                        Original review: I am in love with this product!  I even gave one of my three pack to a friend I love it so much!  I feel like it has managed to do something no other deodorant has done for me, which is to keep my poly blend clothes from smelling horrible. After feeling like I smelled worse my whole life when wearing poly blend clothes I&#x27;ve found an article stating  that a very specific bacteria loves polyester and will cause the stink that never seems to go away.  This product works great on that, so well in fact that I am now able to re wear cardigans/jackets/sweaters and things that I would normal have to wash before wearing again. The container says not to use right away after shaving, but I live on the edge and do it anyway with no irritation.  This is huge for me bc I have sensitive eczema prone skin.  The bottom line is this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I am amazed by this deodorant. Before using this brand, I tried several organic, natural deodorants that I was never satisfied with. I have been using the product now for about four months. Green Tidings deodorant performs well keeping me fresh throughout the day. You do not need much of the product for it to be effective.  I apply a little more before exercising because I sweat profusely.  This deodorant handles those sweaty moments.  I find that I am still fresh after my workouts.  The lavender smell is light and refreshing. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the ingredients in this deodorant....organic arrowroot powder, organic virgin coconut oil, baking soda, wild crafted candelilla wax, raw organic shea butter, magnesium oil and pure lavender essential oil. Although the product is expensive, I have found that it lasts quite some time (my first one lasted almost three months) and do believe it is worth the cost.  I am on a healing journey and choosing organic, natural products that do not harm my body but perform well is critical. I have found a winner in this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deoderants and they just don&#x27;t last. No problem with Green Tidings - and the ingredients are awesome. My only drawback is that it&#x27;s just a tad pricey even though I purchased the multi-pack.</li>
    <li> It was not easy to find an all natural deodorant that really works.  Tried Tom&#x27;s and felt self conscious all the time about the inevitable body odor by the end of the day.  I tried Green Tidings and immediately fell in love.  It really works....lasts the entire day (even through strenuous workouts) and applies nicely.  Works better than the traditional deodorant I was using.  Been using for a few months and recently ordered a new supply, definitely a great pyrchase!!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal: And all-natural deodorant that truly works as advertised. It hasn&#x27;t failed me once in an entire summer of temperatures in the 90s and lower 100s. I still sweat, of course, but there&#x27;s not even a hint of BO. I love the scent of lavender and plan to continue using this one, but I am also planning to try out the non-scented version, as well.</li>
    <li> I purchase the smaller version of the lavender green tidings deodorant first to try it out and used it for 3 weeks. I loved how it smelled and was marveled by the fact that I did not have an allergic reaction to it like I did soapwalla&#x27;s natural deodorant. The green tidings deodorant works well with keeping my armpits fresh and free from odor. What I found interesting was that I had an allergic reaction to soapwalla&#x27;s deodorant where it formed a dark rash under my arms which drove me to find something else that works. But after withdrawing from that old stuff for couple weeks and starting the green tiding&#x27;s the discoloration started to lighten and clear up. Now I&#x27;m rash free and odor free for hours on end even after workin up a sweat. So with that being said I took the plunge and invested in the 3 pack 2.7 ounce lavender green tidings deodorant I can&#x27;t be happier with it. Finally a natural deodorant the meshes well with my body chemistry and keeps me smelling fresh throughout my day. If you&#x27;re on the fence do yourself a favor and buy the big one the first time around lol. Also this product is gentle enough for my sensitive skin which is win. I only wish I&#x27;d remebered to use my coupon when I ordered my 3 pack.</li>
    <li> I was ready to give up on &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants due to stinking up my clothes. Then I started using this deodorant. I have been using the lavender for about a month now and it works FANTASTICALLY! I ride my bike to work, work on my feet all day, then ride home, and still smell fresh at the end of the day with only one application in the morning (my old natural stuff took 3 applications and still wasn&#x27;t enough). I absolutely love this stuff. And no sticky-feeling underarms is a bonus! I haven&#x27;t had issues yet with irritation that other people experienced. Here&#x27;s hoping that I never do!</li>
    <li> I had been using a natural deodorant that worked for many years then suddenly stopped working. I couldn&#x27;t wear my work clothes without embarrassing sweat stains and/or odor. It&#x27;s been a week, and no sweat and no odor! I can wear my favorite suits and blouses again and be comfortable. I&#x27;m going to wait a month and see how it continues then buy the 3 pack. This is definitely the best natural deodorant ever and I love how ingredients are wild crafted. Thanks for a superb product!</li>
    <li> Got the value pack. This is honestly a great product and the ONLY natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found to actually work for a significant period of time. The lavender scent is a nice, pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. Feels good, goes on easy and lasts quite a while. Comes with a little booklet to make you feel better about what you&#x27;re putting on/in your body. The only gripe I have is that they go overboard with the NO GLUTEN NO THIS VEGAN THAT, we get it, it&#x27;s natural!! That&#x27;s why we bought it. Other than that, great product, fun booklet and I like the tree logo.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace all &amp;#34;propylene glycol&amp;#34; containing deodorants in my home. My oldest daughter is completely sold! Waiting to hear back from my sister....but I think she will like it. I purchased more and plan to share the good news about such a great product with more women!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant , I used to have an allergic reaction to most common deodorant !&lt;br /&gt;Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant  is a miracle , no more allergy , sweating , redness , irrritations !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much !</li>
    <li> These actually work, last long enough and smell good. However, at +$12 the roll and given how quickly they are consumed, these are way too expensive! So I&#x27;m trying others.</li>
    <li> I have gone through ten or so different natural deodorants over the last few years.  I thought I had found the one and used it for over a year, but after further research there were still some questionable ingredients.  So I gave Green tidings a shot.  Awesome stuff.  It does exactly as claimed and is by far the best natural deodorant I have used to date.  This is my second three pack order.  Green tidings goes a long way and I find myself using less than the average natural deodorant.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a quality natural deodorant. I work out hard everyday and sweat a lot. This product works. It gets a little squishy at the last 1/4 inch. Nice smell. Leaves clothing arm pit area a little stained but mostly washes out. Don&#x27;t apply too much!! Not much is needed.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I react to all forms of corn and corn derivatives, making it hard to find a deodorant that actually works.  This one works!</li>
    <li> Great product! The smell is mild and lovely and it keeps odor away. It has a lower melting point than other simile products making it easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this deodorant! My kids (9, 11, and 13 year olds) and I have been using it for about a month now and I have never been happier with the lack of odor and no need for antiperspirant. Other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants I have tried left me sweaty by the end of the day but this does not. They also left my kids smelly by the end of the day and this does not! I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of this product. Both lavendar and scent free are great.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a safe all natural deodorant that works. This product is it! I have tried numerous products, and I am relieved to not have to look any further. I have been recommending this product to family and friends. You will love it!!!</li>
    <li> One of the most effective natural deodorants I have found.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great. The consistency makes it easy to apply, and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It smells nice and it keeps me dry and comfortable the whole day. Definitely a must-buy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this deodorant and is the best invest I ever made. the price it&#x27;s a little bit too high but well worth it</li>
    <li> I had been trying to take the natural, approach for the past 6 months. I&#x27;ve probably tried 4 different &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; varieties, from local health shops. Some bigger names than others. Every one, lasted a few hours, at best, and I had to start buying two sets (one for home &amp; one for &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34;. Luckily, I finally stumbled on Green Tidings. Even went with the lavender (and I&#x27;m a moderate level bodybuilder). Not only does it smell great (yet not overpoweringly so), it lasts ALL day (12 active hours plus, in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier. If you&#x27;re in the same predicament as I was, I can assure you, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Green Tidings. It&#x27;s now my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant.  For being all natural it works very well.  I sweat a lot!  And this deodorant does the job.  It does not sting.  The only reason why I do not give this 5 stars is because of the price.  I wish it was a little more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I rarely post reviews. I think I&#x27;m kinda stinky. So usually I would shower, apply a lot of &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34;type of deodorant, then reapply again and that would last me a workday.  So I was skeptical that a natural deodorAnt wound be effective, but I dislike the chemical residue and health implications.  Amazon reviews are usually pretty accurate so I gave this a try.  Holy moly!  Put a thin layer on a clean armpit and there is zero odor.  Even if you&#x27;ve been sweating  and stressed out.  No odor, none!  So I ran out and tried regular deodorant again and was stinky after four hours.  Had to switch right back to the natural green tidings.  I no longer have anxiety that I will offend others with my body odor.  This works better than the aluminum clinical strength store brands for me!  Try it and support a small American business!</li>
    <li> Great Product, One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant, and this is as natural as I can find. However, the texture is slightly gritty, like fine sand so if you are sensitive to that, I would not recommend it. My skin is sensitive and I got a rash. I am not sure if the rash was from the grittiness, or from the lack of sweat prevention. The smell is great, and even though I sweat through the product, I never had an odor problem. Great customer service as well, took back my return without a problem.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is amazing. I shower at night and put it on after my showers. I stay fresh all the next day even when I&#x27;m outside in the summer heat and humidity. My husband has even switched to this deodorant and says it&#x27;s the best deodorant he&#x27;s ever used. He can get pretty stinky but this deodorant works better than any chemical deodorant (Old Spice, Arm &amp;amp; Hammer) or natural deodorant (rock salt, etc.) we&#x27;ve ever tried. I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product! It is pricey but we consider it worth the extra $.</li>
    <li> I suffer with the MTHFR mutation (among other SNP mutations). Besides sounding like a dirty word, what that means for me is that there is a major concern about my body&#x27;s inability to properly break down and clear toxins from my system. I set out a few years ago to cut back on my &amp;#34;toxic load&amp;#34; and try very hard to not put things in my body that it is ill equipped to handle. Aluminum is one of the hot button issues and with good reason. It&#x27;s tied to a myriad of neurological conditions, none of them pleasant. One of our biggest, daily exposures to aluminum comes from traditional antiperspirants/ deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of all the aforementioned, I sought out a more natural deodorant for myself and my family. Green Tidings, hands down, is one of my favorites! It has a wonderful scent (though unscented is pictured here, mine is the Lavender scent), it goes on easily and works very well to keep the smelly beast at bay. I live in the south, spend a lot of time outdoors and there is a tremendous difference for me when I use this product as opposed to go au naturale. While it does work best on clean, dry skin, I&#x27;ve used it during my less-than-lily-fresh moments and it does the trick. I am so comfortable with the effectiveness and safety of this product, I also give it to my teenage girls... now THAT is a beast that is tough to tame, but somehow it does!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic.  After experimenting with several natural deodorants, none have even come close to Green Tidings.  So glad I found it!</li>
    <li> What a lovely product! I&#x27;ve been using the deo for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. It&#x27;s been the hottest weather of summer so far and the deo is really standing up to the test - no smelly BO at all!! You will not regret buying this deo! Do yourself a favour and stock up now!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service from this vendor!</li>
    <li> I have tried many all natural deodorants, all claiming to be effective...but unfortunately, very ineffective. Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant is the absolute best deodorant my family and I have ever tried. We are able to enjoy the day, confident that we are odor-protected.</li>
    <li> This product is holding up very well, it&#x27;s more than I expected for an all natural product and I love the lavender smell.</li>
    <li> LOVE Green Tidings, especially the lavender scented stick. I feel so much better about using a healthy, non-toxic deodorant and will continue to purchase in 3-packs!</li>
    <li> The deodorant is great. Stops underarm odor. The dispenser is cheap and broke. I had to scoop out the deodorant and apply it with my fingers. I will not buy it again unless they improve the dispenser.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I tried this. The lavender scent is my favorite, however both are nice. The product goes on nice and smooth, and the lavender has soothed my sensitive skin. Three cheers for deodorant made without all the unnecessary chemicals!</li>
    <li> True 24 hour protection.  My personal experience with other natural deodorants is that they quit working after a few hours (usually around 2 or 3 in the afternoon).  Green Tidings works 24 hours on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is that this is a deodorant.  Not an antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Wow FINALLY a deodorant I can totally accept, embrace and use. The ingredients are absolutely vegan so healthy for our bodies. The scent is fantastic its lasts all day and I have confidence that I&#x27;m using the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU when I do run out ( I purchased the 3 pack) I will for sure be back for 3 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
    <li> Stop looking for a holistic deodorant that works. You have just found one.</li>
    <li> The deodorant works great.  I have had problems finding something for my odor issues and this mostly does the perfect job.  The problem I have with this product is that if it gets a little warm (like when traveling and it&#x27;s left in the car too long), it becomes gunky and even after refrigerating it, it never gets hard again.  So, when I put it on, I have chunks of deodorant that I have to spread with my hand.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it but it&#x27;s superior to others I&#x27;ve tried because it&#x27;s not sticky.  You still sweat, but you&#x27;re supposed to. It just keeps you from smelling like B.O.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY natural deodorants and at some point I always end up switching back to the chemical brand &#x27;cause I just don&#x27;t feel confident I will stay odor free when it&#x27;s important (stress sweat anyone?).  Not with this brand! I haven&#x27;t once put it on and had that &amp;#34;uh oh!&amp;#34; moment where it just isn&#x27;t working anymore. I use the Lavender scented (haven&#x27;t tried the unscented) and there&#x27;s not much more to say but- IT WORKS! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I really love this deodorant. It has a nice fragrance and it controls odor. No white marks on your clothes. Occasionally you get a scent of the lavender. I would definitely purchase this product again. Absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> Love that it works and it&#x27;s safe!</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for something that you need to use a lot of and barely works.</li>
    <li> Works super great!! Sometimes still sweat, but never get stinky, and it&#x27;s so much better than the alternative. Smells nice and light.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant!! It&#x27;s the best out there!! Love the lip balm too!! Thank you!! Will continue to buy!! My daughter who is married loves your products too!! The best!!</li>
    <li> I wish the container was a little different. I have to turn it up further than desired to keep from getting scratched from the container and then excess runs over the side and when I screw the cap back on it gets all yucky... otherwise works great as a deodorant!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product and I enjoy using it so much that I just placed an order for (2) 3 pack,</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found a deodorant that WORKS!</li>
    <li> good product, the lavander smell is acceptable &amp; not bad, quick (direct) shipping 10days( outside US), I would give it the fifth star if the price is a little bit lower... I know that it&#x27;s all organic &amp; natural but I pay high cost on international shipping.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best natural deodorant on the market!  I have tried every single kind and this one works!  It also smells amazing. I am so thankful that this company makes such a quality product,</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant, Lavender fragrance. It goes on smoothly and, indeed , it keeps me dry all day long. Besides, it is a good and reassuring feeling the fact that all its ingredients are natural and I love the fresh, lavender fragrance that starts somewhat strong but, as the day progresses it becomes very discreet. I highly recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I am concerned about ingredients in traditional deodorants, namely aluminum. I have tried at least 2 dozen different brands over the years. None of them work great and many have to be reapplied all of the time. About 75% of them also give me a rash. I have tried PitPowder, Tom&#x27;s, Young Living Essential oils deodorant, Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s deodorant, True Natural deodorant, LaLuli Organics, and many, many more &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; sprays. Green Tidings has worked great for me. I don&#x27;t need to reapply it all day and it does not give me a rash in my armpits like many of the other all-natural products do. Many of the other products I have tried would mask my body odor, but I could still smell it and was always self-consciously sniffing my armpits to make sure it wasn&#x27;t so bad that others could smell me. I cannot smell any body odor when I use this product. It does not stop sweating, but neither do any of the other products....they aren&#x27;t designed to. Sweating is a natural, healthy process which I am okay with as long as I don&#x27;t stink. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that the only scent that they offer is lavender.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant we use at my home. It just works, and the lavender scent is great. My boyfriend and I both use it.</li>
    <li> I was using Malin + Goetz Eucalyptus deodorant, until it just stopped working for me. Since I refuse to use any underarm product that contains aluminum, I started researching on Amazon.com to find the best natural, and preferably organic, deodorant on the market. Whenever I search for something on Amazon.com, I filter the results by Average Customer Review, and Green Tidings deodorant got the highest marks. For me, they are a bit pricey, but they are a local company (I live in Los Angeles) and they are super &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;. No chemicals or aluminum found in their products, and they use high quality ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this deodorant now for for the past 6 months. I buy the large 3 Pack, and one stick lasts me one month of daily use. I use the Lavender scent, and it is a true lavender essential oil scent, not a phoney heavily perfumed smell. I have only has slight B.O. once or twice, and that is my fault for letting my underarms get a bit stubbly, which can cause a stink. I LOVE how effective this deodorant is. The ONLY complaint that I have is that this deodorant, due to its all natural ingredients list (which are primarily essential oils and such) has oil-stained my underarms in my grey and white tops. I would rather have to scrub my clothes underarms with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide periodically than deal with using harmful chemicals found in other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for an honest and all natural deodorant, buy Green Tidings and use it. It works wonderfully and you will be supporting small businesses!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the first time 2 or 3 months ago.  A lot of deodorants have either really awful ingredients that I would not want on my body, or they peter out and leave you in a less desirable, &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; state.  I&#x27;m on my second stick of this product now.  The real test will be how I make it through a hot, Virginia summer.  I am feeling pretty confidant that it will do fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love your healthy ingredients, and my skin is quite sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try.  I&#x27;m coming back for more.</li>
    <li> is the ONLY green deodorant on the market that actually works all day long in a high stress environment. I tried everything else and spent a lot of money on too much dry cleaning bills  and being constantly worried that I may have smelled a bit european by the middle of the day..What did not work was Toms of Main, Jason, Crystal deodorant, EO dedorant and several others. This one WORKS and is saving me bundle in suit dry cleaning expenses. Not to mention that people at the office arent so eager to keep a 3 foot distance. Totally green, no risk of cancer, and socially doable!</li>
    <li> Only natural deodorant I will ever use. Works all day!</li>
    <li> After having tried all natural deodorants in the past which should have been known as people repellant, I tried this only because my daughter recommended it. I was not disappointed. The lavender scent is nice and you stay stink free all day and its all natural. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I sweat a LOT, like cute outfits that are unfortunately usually polyester, and commute to work by bicycle.  You get the idea.  My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, but applying aluminum daily to parts of the body that can be prone to cancer doesn&#x27;t exactly thrill me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used to work in the beauty section of a health food store, and I&#x27;ve tried every single natural deodorant on the market - Tom&#x27;s, Burt&#x27;s, Avalon, Alba, Aubrey, Queen Helene, EO, the crystal rock, crystal spray, 3248746234 essential oil blends, etc - and they all, frankly, sucked.  I also experimented with a few major brand &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants to no avail.  The Body Shop made a decent natural deodorant a few years back but discontinued it.  So, I was back on aluminum deodorant for a while but decided to see what was on Amazon.  The hundreds of reviews for this stuff seemed too good to be true, but I bought a small lavender stick just to try it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY CRAP!  I have been using this stuff for 4 months now, straight through a warm summer including a trip to deserty California, and it is hands-down the best natural deodorant out of the several dozen I&#x27;ve tried.  I still can&#x27;t believe it.  I ordered a 3 pack to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant, so you will still sweat, but magically the sweat doesn&#x27;t smell.  I will start to get a *little* ripe after a really long day (&amp;#62;12 hours) in a polyester top, but that would happen to me with aluminum deodorants, too.  It also lasts a surprisingly long time - I have found that caking it on actually makes it work less well (maybe it rubs off more on your clothes?) than a thin, evenly-applied layer.  In other words, a little goes a long way.  The small stick lasted over 2 months.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues with irritation or staining of clothes, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitant at all, just try a small stick like I did.  The folks at Green Tidings would be wise to patent their formulation (if they haven&#x27;t already)before big shots at P&amp;G, etc. try to rip off their recipe!</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant. I wanted an effective all natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t make me smell like a dirty hippy, and this is it. I buy the lavender kind, and for some reason it smells a little like jelly beans to me when I start to sweat a little. I would recommend. I&#x27;ve bought multiple times. A little pricey, but I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled! Finally a natural deodorant that actually works!! And superb customer service! I didn&#x27;t  care the lavender scent so I asked if I could exchange and they said just keep it and sent me two of the the u scent for free! I will be a customer for life! Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> Is it worth almost $13 per unit? I can&#x27;t say really. Does it work? Absolutely YES! It is everything positive that people say. Today I got pretty sweaty and later after returning home, I took off my undershirt and was amazed that the shirt smelled as fresh as when I put it on this morning! I loathe antiperspirants because I&#x27;ve seen a couple guys who&#x27;s pores got clogged by them and had to have their arm pits lanced open to be cleaned and drained.. yuch! But this does seem to keep you fairly dry. I may have been a bit moist when I was the sweatiest today but I&#x27;m dry now and my undershirt smelled clean. I know right? It doesn&#x27;t seem real but it is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on, I&#x27;m conscious of how much I apply as the price is very high. But if the product lasts as long as say 3 sticks of Old Spice Red Zone, then it is worth it. My O.S. with its guaranteed performance after hours is a bunch of hooey! I always come home stinking after work so in the trash can it goes. Not so with the Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant however. This stuff is the bomb! It is even better than the EO Organic Deodorant Spray, Lavender, 4 oz at $5.99 as I don&#x27;t make it a full day with it but I certainly do with the Green Tidings product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the price was more fair. If it was I&#x27;d be a contiguous repeat buyer. But as it is, I&#x27;ll use the EO Organic spray for non-workdays and outings and this stuff for each work day. That way I&#x27;ll save and not be stinky. Make sense? 2 -Thumbs Up!</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERY other natural deoderant, this is the ONLY one that works for me! I can go all day without reapplying! I will definitely reader this brand!</li>
    <li> Best safe Deoderant out there and I have tried so many!! I&#x27;ve tried kit naturals hippie stick, &amp;#34;the best deoderant in the world&amp;#34; that only comes via autoship, and made my own with baking soda and coconut oil and arrowroot powder - this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t go on thick, flake, itch, etc. this one also lasts longer. No weird smell EVER like the others... Definitely gonna keep using this product - thank you!!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is nothing short of amazing. I was a bit hesitant about the lavender scent, but it is very subtle and not overbearing by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use much less of this and it lasts way longer than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I commute by foot 45 minutes to an hour every day and this deodorant has held back just about any body odor I would have experienced before. I&#x27;ve used other name-brand deodorants and the usually last almost the entire day without wearing off. I can use this on a summer day and it will not wear off during my commute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, this deodorant pretty much disappears once you apply it. I have nothing but shinning things to say about this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product, really works.</li>
    <li> I love Green Tidings all Natural Deodorant! I bought three big ones in the spring for 2015 and it has lasted me until now and I still have not used up the 3rd bottle. I just bought three more to last me another year+. I can&#x27;t say enough how much I LOVE this stuff and how it is so nice to know it is not damaging your body. Don&#x27;t expect this to glide on easily like other deodorants. I apply it by finger or you could use a q tip or something.</li>
    <li> I ordered a single deodorant stick first, because I am searching for a good, reliable, natural deodorant and as you may know, this is a hard process. Most products out there did not meet my standards. This one did. It goes on a little differently, slightly crumbly. But it just works and that is all there is to it. I ordered the 3-pack after I was almost finished. They are generous in size.</li>
    <li> I like it because I strive every day to reduce the chemicals to which I expose myself. However, I guess because it&#x27;s more natural, it melts when I carry it in my gym bag and it&#x27;s also pretty pricey. Haven&#x27;t found anything better so far though so I&#x27;ll keep using it.  UPDATE: About a month ago I started getting a rash and itching. Disappointed that I won&#x27;t be able to use this deodorant any more.</li>
    <li> Finally, a natural deodorant that works is and easy to use too.  It&#x27;s consistency makes it easy to apply.  Usually have to rub it in a bit with my fingers, but beats dipping your hand in a little jar and smearing a bunch on your underarms.  Most of the ones in the little jars tend to be too dry.  Green Tidings has it just right!</li>
    <li> I was on a hunt for an all natural, preferably organic deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce and/or doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemistry lab. Besides the sad fact that there are only a very few deodorants that would fit this description, even a bigger problem is that it&#x27;s hard to find one that actually works. This one, to my surprise, easily lasts the whole day (no joke), and - hooray - does not leave any permanent stains on your clothing. The only reason I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars rather than 5 is that, in my humble opinion, it is expensive. But, given its pros, I am determined to buy it anyway.</li>
    <li> We both love Green Tidings! We both have sensitive skin, tending to react to different ingredients, and neither of us had any problem with it. My husband and I both find it manages body odor very effectively, when used daily. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but not so much when you purchase the three pack, and it is worth it, because it really works well.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant. I find it expensive, but I buy the 3 pack because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> Good product. The only natural deodorant I use and I will continue to buy from here.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this natural product! Thanks to Shane on recommending it.&lt;br /&gt;So far this has been my second order after my initial test sample&lt;br /&gt;It does not stain my clothing and the pits stay fresh with no dragon&lt;br /&gt;odor.</li>
    <li> one of the better natural deodorants there are.  Hope they can find a way to make you stay drier and feel fresh.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last 6 months and traveling through Asia in a hot climate. This is the only natural deoterant that works on me and also keeps me drier. This is the next best thing to making your own baking soda Deoterant, which can be messy. The lavender scent is also relaxing and fresh.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, it has been frustrating to find a truly natural deodorant that works great. I discovered Green Tidings online, here on amazon, in my search for an effective product. I gave it a shot due to the very positive, glowing reviews. Well, so glad i did because yes - it works very well! I was &amp; still am very pleased.You&#x27;re not suppose to apply a lot on, as doing so will be messy (crumbles up and then falls off your pits), plus will stain your shirts. I made the mistake of putting on too much, then working out a good sweat, only to end up staining my clothes! Washing my shirts didn&#x27;t remove the stains, either. Again, that is due to applying too much. I did get a rash from using it after about a week or two, which lasted for maybe a month - don&#x27;t remember. It went away and never came back, thankfully. The company does say that one cause of getting a rash is because my skin was being &amp;#34;detoxed&amp;#34; from the garbage of any previous, toxic deodorant. The other reason they said could be a cause, is an allergic reaction to one of the ingrediants. A consistent problem i have with this deodorant, is that it tends to always, once it is low, fall apart. My last one still could have been used for a few weeks, but fell apart onto the floor as i was applying it under my arms. This has happened over and over again, though usually not as soon as it did last time.  Other than using a good (non toxic) deodorant to control odor, i advise eating/drinking lots of organic veggies, plus a few servings of fruit; and sweating out all those toxins. All in all, a good deodorant that works, considering it is truly natural, and not one that claims to be natural... only to contain toxic ingrediants &amp; natural fragrances (such as herban cowboy - just an example from personal use, is all).</li>
    <li> Excellent all natural deodorant! Works great all day and no need to reapply even after vigorous exercise.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant!  Safe AND effective! And I love the lavender smell.</li>
    <li> I have never experienced anything like this before using this product.  I thought trying to go natural was a good thing but not with this product.  I have started to get the worst red patches under my arm to the point that my skin started to peel. I will not order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Amazing deoderant! There is no natural deoderant comparible to this! I have tried making deoderant  and have bought  many other natural brands but this is by far the best!</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I have tried!  Lasts all day, and works even better for me than conventional deodorants.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things!!</li>
    <li> Amazing deoderant. My 10 year old son uses it and now i have started to also. I always hated the normal deoderants due to the chemicals they have but could never use an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deoderant because they didnt work for me. This one actually does. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product works well for me, although I live in the hot and huimid city of Jeddah - Saudi Arabia, were summer temperature is usually around 112F (This summer it reached 130F) and humidity is always around 85%. Regularly one good application will do it from morning tell bedtime, but when the weather goes to an extreme you might need to apply it twice a day. Also if your house is not properly air conditioned, it will turn slightly runny because all of it&#x27;s ingredients are natural and this is how it&#x27;s supposed to act under these condetions. Otherwise, I&#x27;m fine with it; I already finished 6 pack and I will order 6 more.</li>
    <li> I purchased the three-pack of the lavender scent one and dispersed one to my mom, my husband, and for myself.  Here is the run-down on our results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  My mom said some days it works great, no odor detected, and other days, she can detect odor slightly.  It seems to vary a bit.  She says it is the best organic deodorant she has used to date, but not 100% perfect.  She tends to perspire easily, so that might be a factoring result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)  My husband is active in sports and perspires heavily.  He has not had a problem with this deodorant.  He did not use it for about three days when I initially purchased it because of a skin reaction to the Thai Crystal Stick that caused dry skin and rash underneath his armpits.  He has not had a reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.)  My situation is a bit more different.  I perspire very little, but odor shows up as a problem.  I exercise quite extensively on a daily basis (jogging up to 7 miles or doing personal training sessions).  I was using the Thai Crystal Stick for well-over a year, and I had a nasty reaction to it recently.  I broke out in a rash, sores, and it discolored the skin in my armpit region to beet red.  I had to discontinue usage of it and went for this product.  Initially, I should have waited to let my skin calm down from the reaction, but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first initially used it, the skin in my armpits started peeling, foul odor detected about four hours after application, and it would slightly burn.  I then followed my husband&#x27;s steps of just letting everything calm down for three days.  That made a remarkable difference.  After letting my flaming-pits-of-Hell relax from getting bombarded with products, this deodorant worked MUCH better.  Just like my mom, odor would slightly come back after using it anywhere from 7-12 hours after application, but not enough to be noticed by the noses of others.  The Thai Stick wins hands-down for protecting 20-24 hours straight without ANY hint of odor, which is unfortunately this product&#x27;s Achille&#x27;s heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some experimentation, this is what I noticed on how to maximize the product&#x27;s potential:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  It works better when you have shaved armpits.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  Fresh out-of-the-shower?  Apply it now, not later.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  Don&#x27;t apply the product too lightly. Apply some pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the weird thing effect of this product.  I seldom need to apply it anymore.  Seriously.  Maybe once every 3-4 days?  Something happened between the Thai Stick debacle to this deodorant.  The skin color in my armpits is slowing healing as it went from beet red to discolored (about four shades darker than my normal skin color) to now slowly fading back to my normal coloring.  Odor rarely shows up in-between applications.  Perspiration is practically non-existent now; although I make up for it by sweating elsewhere.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product falls slightly short on a long-standing odor control (which is one star knocked off), it did a bit more than I ever expected.  My whole family and I will continue supporting this company and product line.  Thank you, Green Tidings!t of odor, which is unfortunately this product&#x27;s Achille&#x27;s heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some experimentation, this is what I noticed on how to maximize the product&#x27;s potential:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)

    <li> This is by far the best and most effective *truly* all natural deadorant I have tried.  I have been using all natural deodorant for 20+ years due to a medical issue and this one far exceeds all the others I have tried.  I only need to apply it one time per day, unlike the others that I have to apply at least 2-3 times per day.  It is well worth the price and is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works very well!  Great smell.  I would never go back to the aluminum deodorant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is awesome!!!  Works well under pressure &amp; lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best natural deodorant I have ever tried. It was suggested by a friend and we have been on the lookout together trying everything. Finally this came his way and it worked for him so I tried it and oh my goodness. I tried one and right away ordered a three pack. Simple ingredients that work; you can&#x27;t get much better than that. Thanks again for making the best natural deodorant that works!</li>
    <li> This product burned my under arms! Not sure if it was an allergic reaction, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with lavender or any of the ingredients listed before. For those thinking of purchasing make sure you take the time to read the ingredients used. All natural sounds good but you could come across an experience like mine if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> I find the deoderant to be tacky-feeling under my arms. I desire a dry feeling under my arms. The scent isn&#x27;t unpleasant, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant either. I won&#x27;t be using this anymore.</li>
    <li> Great smell that last a long time and you don&#x27;t need to apply too much. This is an excellent product</li>
    <li> This is great deodorant. I used to use Secret but will never go back to it. I&#x27;m so glad I use this now cause I know there are no harmful ingredients. It keeps me dry and odor free.</li>
    <li> Excellent order protection and all natural product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own natural deodorant for a while and my problem was I would always ultimately have an odor within a few hours.  This stuff eliminates that totally.  Been using it for a short period of time and have yet to smell. Also, any product that I made using baking soda would always cause me to break out under my arms.  Not one bit of irritation with this yet.  Does it keep you the driest?  Not necessarily but it works very well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant!  I got the lavender scent and it smells like fresh lavender - not sickeningly sweet and fake.  As for a deodorant this does its job perfectly.  I always smell fresh and a little of this goes a long way -- you don&#x27;t need to reapply throughout the day or anything.  For a solid stick it also spreads on really creamy and is not irritating to my skin.  I have pretty sensitive underarms and I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product!  This is just a deodorant though - not an antiperspirant.  You will still sweat but you just won&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> I ordered a few different natural deodorants and this one by far worked the best.  It lasts all day with no wavering and was so superior to the others&#x27; performances that I am sticking with this brand permanently.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  My son ordered it the first time as a gift surprise, but the next order was on my own.  Love the natural product and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This is a great, healthy deodorant that works!</li>
    <li> YOU MUST BUY THIS. I&#x27;ve been obsessed with Old Spice forever (yes I&#x27;m female) because it&#x27;s the only thing that worked to keep me from smelling - especially on hikes, working out or laying out in intense heat. I&#x27;ve tried multiple natural deodorants &amp; none worked. Every so often, I&#x27;d try a new one, hoping and praying that something all natural would actually prevent me from stinking. Until this! THIS DEODORANT WORKS BETTER THAN ANY DEODORANT IVE EVER USED BEFORE no matter how sweaty or active I am! I will use this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> this is the only natural, chemical free deodorant that really works!!! i&#x27;m happy i&#x27;ve found it, i have one less problem to worry about )</li>
    <li> We have been trying and using other natural brands with little success. After a hard day of work outside in 100* heat I would have a pretty potent stench about me. Green Tidings has cured my stench!!!! Expensive? Yes. Worth every dime? YES!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a LOT of natural deodorants and this is the only one that consistently and reliably works well. I live in Arizona and this deodorant served me well through our intense summer. I play tennis and have on many occasions gone straight from the court out to lunch with friends and I have never worried about being stinky to the people sitting near me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Green Tidings All Natural Deoderant!  I wish it cost less, but after trying plenty of the other lesser expensive options, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s worth the price.  It works 100%!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well. Wish it lasted a bit longer though</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Works just as well as any aluminum deoderant.  Better than all others in the same class.  Very impressed!  Will definately order again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a year and am amazed at how well it works.  It works close to 24 hours. The lavender scent is not overpowering and is very nice.  Green Tidings customer service was outstanding.  I have told many people about this product.</li>
    <li> So far so good I recommend it to my friend and he&#x27;s  going to try it gave my aunt one and she love it my friend is a hard marker and if he likes it then it&#x27;s is a winner five stars for me;)</li>
    <li> I work construction and this stuff out lasts me! I come home still smelling fresh. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I may have come to the end for the search of a natural deodorant that actually works. I sweat a lot and this particular deodorant keeps me smelling fresh all day and I find that I don&#x27;t sweat as much like before. It also keeps my daughter who is a very active gymnast smelling fresh at the end of the day too. The lavender scent is quite subtle and not overpowering at all and I actually like it. This is hoping that this particular deodorant is not a fluke and will become a keeper!</li>
    <li> This is the first natural deodorant that has not left me smelling weird!!!!!! I have tried several different brands from whole foods and sprouts and have never liked the way I have smelled. I cannot smell a thing when I wear this one and a little bit goes a long way. The only thing you have to be careful of is that it turns some white clothes grayish around the pits but it&#x27;s a small price to pay. This deodorant is a little pricy but I believe it goes quite a long ways and am super happy. I wish they sold it in more stores so I didn&#x27;t have to order it but like the three pack option so I don&#x27;t have to order it as much. I am more of a smell person and don&#x27;t sweat as much so thats what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Good experience from start to finish. Purchased this item as a gift for my daughter. She claims it is the only deodorant she found that does not irritate her underarms.</li>
