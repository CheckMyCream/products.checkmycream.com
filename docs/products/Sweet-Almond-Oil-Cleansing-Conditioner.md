      <li>I love this Hair One Cleanser Conditioner!  </li>
      <li>I was pretty happy to find a review online about how great this was.</li>
      <li>That is great!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>my hair looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>And let me tell you, this one is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is just as good as Wen, but at a much better price.</li>
      <li>I DO HOWEVER, love a GOOD DUPE.</li>
      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t go more than two days without a good cleansing</li>
      <li>Nice product.  </li>
      <li>you want healthy shiny hair, take plenty of vitamin b &amp; b12, eat  good diet foods.</li>
      <li>It kind of smells like toothpaste (</li>
      <li>the popular brand that you see everywhere on tv.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair nicely conditioned but there are a couple of downsides.  </li>
      <li>Good for the money has comparable ingredients as Wen which makes this the next best conditioner cleanser.</li>
      <li>It is very strong.</li>
      <li>but it does clean well, smells nice!  </li>
      <li>Hair one did not smell so great nor did it leave my hair and scalp feeling &amp; smelling fresh like Wen ...</li>
      <li>It took me a couple times washing my hair before I actually liked the product, but my hair has more shine than it has had in years.  </li>
      <li>On its own merits for me it was just okay.</li>
      <li>It did have a nice smell to it, and made my scalp and hair feel very clean.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the original WEN.</li>
      <li>As an avid Wen user this is a great alternative.  </li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t mind sweet scented stuff then this should be a good buy.</li>
      <li>However I like the Renpure better.</li>
      <li>But after using it for a couple of weeks, my hair was A LOT more tangled and matted when I got out of the shower and it just felt like straw.</li>
      <li>I am in a pool many days per week</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Pleased with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Wen and Lisa Rachel and was very happy with both (especially Lisa Rachel), but this supposedly comparable product is a joke.</li>
      <li>It was ok didn&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;cookie&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>I have to make sure it all gets washed out or it will feel coated.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use this until I find something better although I dont see that happening.</li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I love the smell(and</li>
      <li>I even like it better then</li>
      <li>user, absolutely love the stuff, but the price was killing me</li>
      <li>And THE price isn&#x27;t really much better, given the size of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>love this &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Well..gotta say I really love using it..</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather..</li>
      <li>I find that the cucumber and aloe version works much better for me.</li>
      <li>and if I had to choose between the two, Wen is slightly better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While I like this product, it was not the same as Wen, which I was using.  I thought I&#x27;d try this based on the price.  You get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s a smaller amount than you get with a bottle of Wen.</li>
    <li> I had hoped this would be at least an adequate replacement for the expensive WEN that I love. Not so fast! It seems to be decent on my hair, but it seems I use more of it than the WEN if that is possible, and after I wash my hair, it is nasty to comb through. That does as much damage as a harsh shampoo I would think. Going back to WEN, though I will keep this and use it since I paid for it.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is every bit as good as wen. If not better. I bought this at my local Sally&#x27;s. it&#x27;s cheaper on amazon. But after using the wen and this both, I found this to be every bit as good as wen. They both have a lot of the same ingredients, both have the sweet almond oil of course. the hair one actually has a few additional great natural ingredients, such as avocado oil, and peppermint oil, where as wen&#x27;s contains vegetable oil .  The cost is so so much more reasonable as well. I will definitely continue using the hair one product.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this product. It left my hair feeling rather dry and straw like. After having tried many of these I have decided that it really depends on your hair type. I&#x27;ve found people either love it or they hate it. I have straight super fine hair that I color process and I use heat styling a few times a week. My mom tried this one too and didn&#x27;t like it either. After trying many of these sulfate free 2-in-one products I have found that my hands down favorite is the Macadamia Oil Flawless 6-in-one. The Macadamia Oil Flawless one requires less product to work, it is pretty comparable to this one in price (and thus MUCH less expensive than the Wen) and it moisturizes MUCH better. My hair is soft and super shiny after I use it, whereas with this one I had to use a leave-in conditioner just to get a brush through my hair.</li>
    <li> Hair type: thin and curly&lt;br /&gt;Length: Short/pixie&lt;br /&gt;Abuse: high. (lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;.  I typically use it 5x a week--with the other two days being real shampoo days.  It leaves my hair feeling soft, clean, and fragrant!  It even holds up to 10-mile-run hair and gets me squeaky clean.  Can&#x27;t be happier.  This particular smell (Almond blossom), is very authentic.  It is slightly fruity, milky, and warm.  It is not, however, overly sweet.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bottle&#x27;s pump sometimes gives out towards the end of the life of the product.  Sucks.  That&#x27;s the reason for the 4-star.</li>
    <li> I tried several wen alternatives, and this one smelled awesome but left my hair feeling weighted down.</li>
    <li> It was very close to wen products. Not exactly but close. Thanks for the recent teview to aid in my decision to purchase hair one.</li>
    <li> Pleased with my purchase.  As an avid Wen user this is a great alternative.  I use this in between using wen cleansing conditioner and feel this is a good substitute and works as well.  As a fan of cleansing conditioners this product measures up.  Will order again</li>
    <li> My experience with hairone has been horrible. It is very difficult and time consuming to apply the product as it is hard to work through the entire scalp and hair length. A lot of product has to be applied for each use. It left my scalp very itchy, irritated, unclean and my hair limp and lifeless. Do not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> I am a [[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]] user, absolutely love the stuff, but the price was killing me so I sought out a cheaper product and [[ASIN:B008V0U33U Hair One Sweet Almond Oil Hair Cleanser Conditioner For All Hair Types]] came highly recommended. I only rated it a 4 rather than 5 because it isn&#x27;t Wen and if I had to choose between the two, Wen is slightly better. However, even if I could afford it again I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d go back to it because this product works just as well. I love the smell and feel of it and it makes my hair feel and look just as good as the Wen products.</li>
    <li> It took me a couple times washing my hair before I actually liked the product, but my hair has more shine than it has had in years.  I love the way it keeps my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I started using this as a replacement for my regular shampoo. I think my hair is cleaner with this, and my hair has a better texture and feel.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! Great price! Shipped super fast! If you like a mint fragrance this is for you.</li>
    <li> For one. The supposedly ez to open pump is a joke, had to literally take it off turn the bottle upside-down and shake it out like hienz ketchup.&lt;br /&gt;2nd, as thick as this mix is it took some work to mix in. My hair is baby fine and wee past shoulder length.  Left it in by the recommended time. When I went to rinse my hair felt rough like a horse tail. I thought this is conditioner also?.&lt;br /&gt;3rd. Went to brush my hair and found the detangling is a big zero, held my hair in a clump brushing from the end upwards sometimes going over the same area gently to avoid tearing out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;my conclusion is this  you want healthy shiny hair, take plenty of vitamin b &amp; b12, eat  good diet foods. We may of course need clean hair and scalp true, but wont get it from using this.  I was considering using Wen , but I will stick to my average shampoo and conditioner,  1 of each. At least I know which one is working right.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you want a clean bathtub! Like everyone else, I am always searching for an economical version of Wen. This one was my first attempt. Since then I have purchased Herbal Essence Naked Cleansing Conditioner, and Pantene Pro-V Damage Repair Cleansing Conditioner. I have to honestly say that Wen is the best. but I&#x27;m unwilling to shell out those big bucks. This one worked well, but I had a an unexpected incident. I caught my husband peeing freely into our bathtub. His excuse was that the whole bathtub smelled like a urinal mint, and I must admit he&#x27;s right. Yep that settles it this product now goes in the garbage can, and I go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I have very thin, fine, long hair and have been looking for a combination shampoo and conditioner.  I thought I had found it when I read the positive product reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using Hair One for about a month now and always it produces the same result, no matter how carefully I rinse it my hair doesn&#x27;t really look or feel clean once it&#x27;s dry.  I feel like the product is leaving a residue on my hair and I don&#x27;t like it one bit.  I very carefully read the instructions and was careful to follow them so I&#x27;m sure that isn&#x27;t the problem.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Smells great and a nice boost for dry scalp or hair.</li>
    <li> The delivery was as promised but the product did not work as it should on my hair.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  It really is a good conditioner and you will notice the difference if you don&#x27;t use it.  Thanks, j</li>
    <li> I like this product and use it exclusively as my shampoo and conditioner all in one. No soap and stripping of the natural oils in my hair. My hair is soft and my naturally waves returned after the first couple of uses. It is a good as a more expensive widely advertised cleaner / conditioner.</li>
    <li> I had used wen for almost four years and decided to try this.  Wen was just too expensive. I love this product and won&#x27;t go back to Wen. I have mostly straight hair that has just enough frizz to have to dry and flat-iron. This product doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. My hair is past my bra strap and all one length and 15 pumps is adequate.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen so I wanted to try this lesser priced cleansing conditioner, but I will not buy again. My hair does not feel as clean or as thick and healthy as it does with Wen.</li>
    <li> There is a bad smell to this product. It is very strong. I do smell the menthol (it is strong also) but there is another more medicinal smell that is a real turn-off. I switched from Wen to this briefly and had to stop using it. My head started to itch a lot and ended up with my seborrheic dermatitis returning. And it did, fully. So I had to go back to using my prescription harsh, drying shampoo then using Wen as a conditioner. I should never have experimented with Hair One. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. Plus it did not moisturize my hair at all, in fact it made it more dry than before. I can&#x27;t recommend this product at all. It might be an okay in-between product for when you can&#x27;t afford Wen or are between paychecks.</li>
    <li> As good as Wen but considerably less expensive.  It leaves my hair nicely conditioned but there are a couple of downsides.  Like Wen, you really need to use a lot of product, so it doesn&#x27;t last long.  Also, make sure to rinse like crazy or your hair will be dull, flat and sticky.</li>
    <li> Good price, nice feel, and my hair looks amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t have the heft of other non-shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, nor as strong of a scent.  But it does a very good job.  I do have to remember to rinse my hair very well or else there&#x27;s some stickiness left over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It works great for my hair.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and this is the best hair cleanser I have ever used.  I even like it better then the popular brand that you see everywhere on tv.  It does not leave my hair greasy or dry.  I have very long pin straight hair and this stuff leaves my hair shinny conditioned and not oily.  I can also run a brush right through my hair after showering and I never could before.  It was always a hassle to get a brush through my hair without pulling half of it out and I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cleansing conditioner.  I have recently bought it for my mother and she likes it to.  You just have to be used to no frothy bubbles.  Just pump it out sooth it through all of your hair by lifting the strands and getting it on all of them, rinse and done.  I will never use anything else.  Truly a great product.  Ten stars  IF you have doubts about trying one, do it it&#x27;s worth it for your hair.  I never have humid puffy hair always healthy and shinny.</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions - and read every review because they tell you better how to use the product - it does clean your hair. I don&#x27;t feel it does a markedly better job than standard shampoo and conditioner and hair tends towards the limp and scraggly with repeated use, but it&#x27;s a great one-shot if you&#x27;re a gym rat who doesn&#x27;t want to carry a on of products into the locker room.</li>
    <li> Lasted about a week. It works well enough, but as you need to use so much product, the bottle needs to be 4x the size for it to begin to be worth it. Switched right back to Aussie. That leaves my hair far silkier than this and costs a lot less.</li>
    <li> Bought it to try instead of the more expensive Wen. It was terrible and left too much residue in my hair. I have now gone back to Wen. Oh well, the price was worth a try!</li>
    <li> This hair one is not good at all. I had tried this product thinking it would be like Wen. I was very wrong! After I had got done washing my hair with this product, my hair was very dry &amp; rough feeling unlike when I wash my hair with Wen which leaves my hair silky smooth &amp; vibrant. Hair one is a horrible product! I will be sticking to Wen!</li>
    <li> First Time User: you can definitely feel a difference in your hair. Its not greasy, but it feels soft, clean, and makes my hair feel so smooth. The smell is really strong in the bottle but its not as overpowering once it&#x27;s rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative: you have to use SO MUCH product  if you have long hair. Like, 15+ pumps per wash.</li>
    <li> Not bag..  Hair seemed greedy after a couple washes.  Will use as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I would order this product again. Works great. My hair feels so much more healthy. Also no more frizzy fly aways</li>
    <li> **UPDATE 3/18/14**&lt;br /&gt;The 2-star review below was for the Jojoba version of this. I didn&#x27;t realize the travel size they gave me was that version instead of the sweet almond mint. This version works fine, a little more oily scalp than with Wen, but I&#x27;ve also discovered that there are 2 different versions of Wen products (one made for QVC/Sephora/online \\&quot;Wen By Chaz Dean\\&quot; and the one available directly from chaz Dean&#x27;s website) and I like both of those better than this one, but it is a close 3rd. If you don&#x27;t have oily scalp and dry ends like me then this will probably work great for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/2014 I tried this because I recently got introduced to Wen Sweet Almond Mint and it took me a bit to convert but I fell in love. It is so expensive that I came looking for a less expensive alternative and tried this because of all the good reviews, specifically of people who had similarly liked Wen and were looking for a less expensive alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product cleanses well but... presumably because of the silicone pretty high up on the ingredient list (as compared to Wen, where the amodimithicone is farther down the list), my hair is disgustingly greasy by mid afternoon. I find myself using dry shampoo at the end of the work day, just so I my hair can be presentable for after work activities. I have the same problem with most conditioners that have a lot of silicones and in order to avoid this in the past, I would just apply that to my ends, and avoid my scalp to minimize the oily hair problem. but since this is used as a cleanser for the scalp, in addition to a conditioner, that is not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as some background I have fine, thick wavy/curly hair, not color-treated, a little dryness at the ends, but have always had an oily scalp (have to use dry shampoo to get away with washing every other day), so I may be more prone to this than the average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for cleansing ability and price, 1 star for end of day greasiness.</li>
    <li> I love this product my hair is so soft and silky and I don&#x27;t use any other products in my hair except this now.  Disclaimer: my hair is super straight, not dyed, and fine.  I have no idea how this product would work on thicker, curly, or chemically processed hair.</li>
    <li> I normally purchase Wen, a great product. Didn&#x27;t think this cleanser would work  as well. I was wrong. Only thing missing is the higher price. Just as effect as the higher  priced product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying less expensive alternatives to WEN.  This one did the job just as well, if not better for 1/3 the price.  It leaves my hair smooth just as Wen does, but not as silky as some others I&#x27;ve tried.  My only complaint is that it does not pump as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later -- I have to now say that the strong perfume of this product is overwhelming.  The pump also stopped working.  I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works exactly like I had hoped and my hair is thriving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do condition afterward so I&#x27;m not sure I would consider it an all in one product. (my hair doesn&#x27;t feel that conditioned with just this alone.)</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for years but it is do expensive so I was looking for a cheaper alternative! I have now found it! Love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take the frizz out of my hair like I thought it would. At least it wasn&#x27;t too expensive of a test.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine, thin hair (thanks Mom). I was worried this product would weigh my hair down and leave it greasy, but wanted to get out of the damaging routine of using Shampoo/Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have to wash my hair daily as it gets so oily. I use this daily as well.&lt;br /&gt;WOW! This stuff is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has MORE BODY than it ever has. Super soft. Never greasy or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;I have mid-back length hair, so it&#x27;s fairly long.&lt;br /&gt;I soak my hair for about 1-2min.&lt;br /&gt;Then I rub (2) pumps into my front hairline, sides by ears, and top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I rub (2) more pumps into the center of the back of my head, and then run my hair for a second or two under water to disperse the product a little more. I then take (2) more pumps and add it to the nape of my neck hairline.&lt;br /&gt;I rub with my fingers all over my head for 30sec to (1)min, then another 30sec to (1)min down to the tips of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I twist it up in a bun and clip it up (I keep a clip in the shower for this reason now-very handy).&lt;br /&gt;I then leave it up as I go about my other shower business; shaving, face scrub/wash, etc. for about 10-15min so it can sit on my hair and do its thing. The bottle says the longer it&#x27;s left on the better-and it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;Than I rinse it all out, rubbing the scalp for 1-2mins.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use leave in conditioner now, too. That is great!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an amazing product. I am still using the same bottle for 1 month now and have about 1/4 left.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper option than WEN and still saves when compared to the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and high end brands of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I believe any negative reviews this product has received is due to operator error, or different hair types that weren&#x27;t compatible with this product (which is why the company makes different ones).&lt;br /&gt;Just TRY IT FOR YOURSELF, it&#x27;s worth a shot. I will NEVER use shampoo again!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for it, didn&#x27;t do anything stated,</li>
    <li> This was awesome.  I was just thinking this morning about buying one for my sister.  I loved the smell and how it worked on my hair.  I was using Wen when I ordered this to start when the Wen ran out.  I was so excited that instead of waiting, I tried it right away and preferred it.  I was eagerly awaiting the end of the Wen so that I could start this on a regular basis.  I just ran out this AM.  Yea!</li>
    <li> Love this gentle hair shampoo &amp; conditioner! I have ordered it now at least five times. I usually wash my hair every other day &amp; haven&#x27;t had any problems with my hair getting oily between shampoos.</li>
    <li> First of all! The pump was broken when it arrived!!! I had to use a pump from another bottle that does not reach the bottom of the bottle so I am now squeezing into my hand. It takes alot of this product to clean long hair. I bought it for my daughter who was having the greasy hair teenager problem. To keep her hair on her scalp clean, her long hair was getting very dried out. I had my doubts about this product when we first tried it. I was afraid that it would make her hair greasier but actually we have been pleasantly surprised. Her hair is healthier and shinie all the way down. It has given her beautiful highlights and  her hair actually seems less greasy. I am actually ordering her a second bottle today. I&#x27;m getting the one for curly hair. Now that her hair is less damaged her curls are more evident. I bought this product because I was too cheap to buy the Wen, I&#x27;m not sorry I cheaped out.&lt;br /&gt;Also, using one product instead of 2 is great.</li>
    <li> very thick, comparable to wen</li>
    <li> I have a very odd ethnic background.... my hair is EXTREMELY thick, wavy but not curly unless it is super humid, it is does not have as smooth of a texture as most Caucasian hair but not as rough of a texture as african hair. It is usually frizzy, unmanageable and looks greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it at least every other day. I was very skeptical about not using shampoo.... that I would end up walking around looking like a dirty grease ball or something. NOT THE CASE. When I &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my hair with this it starts out looking oily and ends up looking clean, smooth, soft, and healthy. I no longer have a problem getting a brush through my hair! Huge fan. My hair has NEVER looked better and I am NEVER going back to shampoo!!! Just keep in mind you really do have to follow the directions exactly.... thorough rinsing is NOT optional.... that includes the pre-rinse!!!!! oh... and I&#x27;m pretty sure that with all of the scalp stimulation it will close to double the speed of anybody&#x27;s hair growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the Wenn that this is supposed to compare to, so I am not comparing it to any other product. On its own merits for me it was just okay. I did not think it was a miracle worker for my curly frizzy hair, but it did suffice as a shampoo/conditioner. I used it more than once, and at times felt that straw feeling others had complained about. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but with hair products, it&#x27;s trial and error. What works well for one person isn&#x27;t going to for another. For the money, you are not risking a whle lot to try it once. It did have a nice smell to it, and made my scalp and hair feel very clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for 4 months. Given the expense, I gave this a go. It works. Leaves my hair not quite as clean as Wen. My ends get a bit dry too. But works well if you want to save some money and you like the idea of a less harsh way to wash your hair. I&#x27;m going back to Wen, but don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try. It smells nice but not as natural as Wen. It kind of smells like toothpaste (but sweeter).</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and just below my shoulders and it takes a lot of this stuff each shampoo time.  I&#x27;ve got some grey, I&#x27;m over 50 and the texture of my grey hair seems to be tougher than my normal hair, but this shampoo is good for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before even putting in any conditioner, my comb goes through my wet hair like buttah.  I have noticed that in order to have this wonderful phenomenon occur, I have to rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse if I use the shower.  I keep an empty quart yogurt container that I fill up and dump repeatedly on my hair while I&#x27;m still in the shower because no matter how long I stand under that showerhead to rinse, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of rinsing.  If I wash my hair bending over the sink, I let the sink fill with water and swish my hair and head and it truly leaves my hair silky even without conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want to style my hair, I will use Garnier leave-in stuff after I get out of the shower.  Just a little bit works since my hair is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this because myself and 11 year old daughter had been using Wen, but both of us with long hair and hers, thick, Wen was getting pricey. I was pretty happy to find a review online about how great this was. I&#x27;ll admit, I love the smell(and the price) and my hair was almost as soft and shiny as when I used Wen, HOWEVER, while letting this product sit in my hair, I read the ingredients to see how different it was from Wen. I was SHOCKED and erked to find that BHT is is this stuff. My bad for assuming this product was organic only based off an internet review comparing it to Wen. My bad for not doing more research, but I have to give 1 star to this product for the BHT added. It&#x27;s just not necessary to add this toxic stuff.</li>
    <li> love this product.  has a great smell to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great item if you follow the directions, but I decided to take my time and follow the same directions using my regular shampoo and conditioner and I got the same great results</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. 1st time that I used it got it from sallys. Great for my nature hair. Told my friends about it.</li>
    <li> It seemed to just make my hair so limp.  I do have extremely fine hair.  I heard this is much better for thick hair.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good. Not as good as the original WEN.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything else after this. My hair stays clean and fresh for up to 3 days and I used to have the OILIEST hair imaginable. Now it&#x27;s clean and keeps my highlights very bright and new.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do wonders for my hair. there are other product I like way better that help the health of my hair</li>
    <li> Too heavy for regular use.  I used it as directed and after the third time, my hair looked so greasy I had to wash it with my regular shampoo.  I did like the feel of my hair after washing it, so will use this weekly for deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> leaves hair lovely, because it has silicons in it.</li>
    <li> I did not feel like my hair was really cleansed but it does feel soft. It smells okay too but not anything special.</li>
    <li> I have been using HAIR ONE for about 2 years now. I like it very much. It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft. Sometimes I do need a leave in conditioner or oil.</li>
    <li> It was ok didn&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;cookie&amp;#34; smell. I bought this to replace my Wen product but honestly I had to go back to Wen!</li>
    <li> I love Wen but it&#x27;s more than my wallet can take. I tried this and it&#x27;s a good substitute but I still prefer the original. It is a great change though and I prefer it over shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used wen and ren pure before, but this is not nearly as good as either. It left my hair more greasy, and I naturally have oily hair. I used the same number of pumps that I did for wen, left it through the recommended time frame and rinsed for about three minutes straight. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the name brand but cheaper.  Very satisfied with Hair One</li>
    <li> Feels like it leaves a film on my hair. Waste of money I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this way cheaper then Wen!</li>
    <li> For all hair types is a bit relative.  I have oily hair and this is making it much worst.  I have used it five times and have decided to give up on it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff !  defiantl&lt;br /&gt; will keep ordering...</li>
    <li> I have tried ALL the hair one products and this one by far smells the best, hands down.  If you follow the directions properly, you will go through a bottle a month if not more.  I noticed more hair falling out but my hair does not seem to thin any more then before.  I think i only notice because its on my hands (with all the massaging) and not down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yes I have used Wen, and this COMPARES to Wen but is not the same/better then Wen.  Wen leaves you feeling cleaner and is easier to wash out of your hair.  Hair one gives you a similar clean feeling but takes longer to wash out.  That being said, Wen is $40 and Hair one is $10.  There is no question in my mind then Hair one is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and then tried this product. I am 50 and have long hair and recently added a few extensions to add more volume. I am allergic to many shampoos and conditioners and am always switching trying to find something I&#x27;m compatible with. This worked great, my extensions don&#x27;t look dry, my hair is full soft and shiny.I usually add morroccan oil ect. but tried this straight and I like it a lot so far. Give it a try. No reaction to chemicals or perfumes.</li>
    <li> Smells so good . Works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this one--I tried it and my hair felt like straw!  I didn&#x27;t like that hair was falling out either!  The next day I rinsed by hair with water in the shower and it seemed much more manageable.  Truthfully, I&#x27;m afraid to try it again, unless someone out there has advice!</li>
    <li> While this did clean, it was much more drying than the others.  My hair was very tangled after this one.  I do not have dry hair, but normal hair.  I will go back to the other types for dry or colored hair.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with thick, long, coily hair.  I tried Hair One since it cost about a third of Wen; however, after one application, it left my hair looking dry and my scalp feeling very itchy.  (And I never have dry or itchy scalp.)  On the positive side, it did leave my hair feeling light and clean.  I had high hopes for Hair One because of the low price and the decent reviews it had but because it left my scalp dry and itchy, I&#x27;ve gone back to Wen and other conditioning products.  (I had my issues with Wen as well but I&#x27;m seeing that if I use less than the directed number of pumps and don&#x27;t leave it on as long, Wen works well for me.  I know this last part is about Wen but maybe it&#x27;ll help Hair One become a better product.)</li>
    <li> I continue to buy this stuff because I like it just as much as Wen.  Does the same thing as their cleanser at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had long, dry, frizzy hair and thought it might work better than my normal shampoo/conditioner regime.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The only thing is I expected to be able to eliminate the conditioning process, but unfortunately I had to continue to do it.  I recently cut my hair short, so I&#x27;m anxious to see how it works on shorter, healthier hair.</li>
    <li> I had to leave a review simply because there aren&#x27;t enough good ones on this product. I bought this at Sally and I will be buying it again and again! It may take extra time, and you have to use a lot of product. For me, I end up using around 25 pumps for my whole head, but I have incredibly thick hair that goes almost mid chest. If used properly and with norml hair that isn&#x27;t TOO oily or dry, this will make your hair soft and impossibly smooth! I don&#x27;t need to straighten my hair anymore, and even with my hair, I have used a 12 oz bottle for a month and it is only half gone. I am a no-poo convert Thanks to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, Hair One makes all types of cleansing conditioner, for dry hair, colored hair, damaged hair, and even one for all hair types! Try the one that best fits your type, and follow the directions to a tee. You won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> Not even close to WEN IN QUALITY.  And THE price isn&#x27;t really much better, given the size of the bottle.  I&#x27;ll be staying with WEN.</li>
    <li> I love this! I had tried Wen (almond) and loved that, but it was so expensive. I then tried the &#x27;knockoff&#x27; that Walgreens sells but it left my hair flat &amp; oily. This product is just as good as Wen, but at a much better price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It took me a few times to get used to not having tons of lather, but it leaves my hair clean without drying it out or leaving it feeling over conditioned. I am in a pool many days per week so I need something gentle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a less expensive and natural alternative to the Wen line and I think I found it in Hair One. I&#x27;ve been suffering from dandruff for years and finally found relief in both Wen and Hair One. For the price, what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> I did not have great luck with this version. I find that the cucumber and aloe version works much better for me. This version was too heavy and left my hair greasy in a day and feeling very heavy even right after a wash. It also isnt as almondy smelling as Id hoped for. I think it will work for certain kinds of hair types but not mine which tends to be fine, dry and oily.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be a more affordable alternative to Wen. It is ok but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work as well as Wen. I mostly use it as a leave in conditioner now</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that this is nearly as good as WEN. Someone recommended it to me and said it was great and so I started with 2 bottles instead of one. I thought that I had found a cheaper alternative to WEN. But after using it for a couple of weeks, my hair was A LOT more tangled and matted when I got out of the shower and it just felt like straw. My hair became very brittle while I was using this. I never finished the first bottle and I threw away the second. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews that it was comparable to WEN.  It is not.  If you are looking for just a conditioner for normal hair, this will work.  My hair is dry and this product, after following the directions, put my hair in such bad condition that I could not run a comb through it.</li>
    <li> If I could give this a zero star I would. First it smells like toilet cleaner my hubby recoiled when he smelled  it for the first time. Second the instructions are so convoluted it&#x27;s hard to understand what to do. 1 pump here another pump there and you have used the whole bottle in one shower! Amazon stood behind the product and gave me a refund but I felt I had to warn the people who want to give it a go. TRY SOMETHING ELSE.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really greasy faster than usual.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Use this product in between using Wen. Good for the money has comparable ingredients as Wen which makes this the next best conditioner cleanser.</li>
    <li> This stuff is okay.. reminds me of any other shampoo/conditioner in one. I bought it as a substiture for Wen, which I love, but it is not nearly as good. It&#x27;s much cheaper, but I have to use so much more I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really worth it. Guess I will go back to (overpriced) Wen.</li>
    <li> Hate this product. I&#x27;ve used Wen and Lisa Rachel and was very happy with both (especially Lisa Rachel), but this supposedly comparable product is a joke. I could tell immediately that it was very different based on texture. When I stepped out of the shower after using this and brushed my hair, I found it to be snarled  (I always brush my hair before showering) and dry. If you are considering Hair One, my recommendation would be to buy Lisa Rachel instead. The price and size are the same, but the quality is vastly better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beauty product aficionado you name it I&#x27;ve used it. high end products galore, mainly because I just adore a good beauty product regardless of price. I DO HOWEVER, love a GOOD DUPE. And let me tell you, this one is amazing. Users definitely need to follow instructions just like they do when Using Wen, I LOVE the fact that this line offers many hair type/need options. A great investment for the serious beauty junkies. This one is a true dupe, not a nearly dupe...</li>
    <li> I only gave this 4 stars because i cannot use it as a shampoo. It wont get thru my hair products, and they&#x27;re light. BUT, as a conditioner its great. I have fine limp hair and as a conditioner it made my hair thicker and stronger. And no oily or waxey residue. Just strong healthy hair. Wish i could use it as a shampoo but it just doesnt work for me that way. But for the price it is a great conditioner, especially after a coloring !</li>
    <li> Too little product for the price.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> At 1st if I had wrote a review which  I thought I did but I gather I didn&#x27;t.  My first bottle I had bought on Amazon of Hair One,  I thought Wow this is great in the 1st  bottle and half that I had bought hear lasting one per month only. Although  something was missing but coudnt think what it was. (Well do to divorce &amp;less income being on disability unfortunately,)  I had to cancel my Wen hair care auto delivery  package deal. Just wasn&#x27;t in budjet but after less than 2 bottles I purchased hear, my hair started to tangle a lot and looked fried and frizzy and my color blonde turned yellow!! . Well I had found from moving a little leftover of a bottle of my Wen. Well, that evening I used it and to my surprise it was the cool tingling feeling and that silky run fingers thru without a comb in shower feeling again! Happy as a pig in ****! It&#x27;s the mint missing from this brand of Wen alternative conditioning  cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Well moral to story I immediately  bought a bottle from Amazon of my true Wen Sweet Almond &amp;#34;MINT&amp;#34; . I might not be able to buy direct from Wen but I use half the amount of Wen than this brand and the bottle is 16oz a lot more than this crap.  Maybe its a bit expensive but for only myself its worth the 30 something dollars &amp; I know I don&#x27;t have to buy a bottle every month . AIso I have very long but extremely silk like underneath that kind of hair that tangles very easy. I&#x27;m glad I got my Wen real good cleanser for my hair, it will take I&#x27;m sure a month I hope less to get my hair nice and silky again.  IF U USE WEN STAY WITH WEN MORAL TO THE STORY.  And it came next day on Amazon if purchased thru Wen I woudnt of gotten for over a week!! Very upset and dissapointed at this product and what damage it caused to my hair. Dont fall victim! I&#x27;d give O stars but u have to give at least one unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I have chin length hair and it takes 25-30 pumps to get adequate coverage with this product. It left my hair heavy, and not very clean at all....</li>
    <li> I bought a sample pack of this from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  I loved it!  I got on Amazon and ordered a bottle the next day.&lt;br /&gt;My hair gets oily in exactly 24 hours.  I have to wash every day and a lot of regular conditioners make my hair more oily, needless to say, I was really scared of ordering WEN, thinking it would make it even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this similar product, I was so excited!  My hair feels cleaner than ANY shampoo I&#x27;ve used in the past, has more body, and is so so soft, without the oily residue.  I think the smell is great.  Very suttle, yet refreshing.  A hit of mint as well as almond.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, Try it!  You will not be dissappointed.  The price is great, although I wish they would come out with more varitey of smells for all hiar types.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather..Will it really get your hair clean? Also I NEED to always use conditioner or else I end up with dry,frizzy hair...But after seeing the barrage of Wen commercials...I was curious...but Wen can be really expensive..So I saw this..It sounded pretty similar to Wen...so I throught I would try it..plus it was for a great price....Well..gotta say I really love using it..I can wash my hair and have it be conditioned all in less than 3 minutes..with one product...So quick..so easy..Smells good..I ordered the sweet almond...It leaves my hair very soft and silky..I was nicely surprised!!...I definitely would buy again..The one tiny drawback is..if you have shoulder length hair it doesn&#x27;t last long cuz you gotta use a lot of pumps each time you wash your hair..but its a great product..You can also get it at Sally beauty supply..You can buy sample size envelopes there to try it out and see which one of the products works best for your hair if you&#x27;re not sure which one to order...</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair with gunk and I don&#x27;t feel clean at all.  My hair does not shine either.  I used it on my 4 year old son and his silky smooth hair changed to sticky no-shine hair in just two uses.</li>
    <li> I feel lead to write this review because there are people reviewing this product inaccurately because they don’t know Wen or Hair One very well and how they work.  I’ve been using Wen for 3 years and it completely transformed my hair from breaking constantly to elastic and healthy.  However, I found myself trying Hair One when I ran out of Wen while waiting for the annual, 1 gallon, QVC special in June and the results were HORRIBLE.  I was astonished at the cheap price but soon discovered the reasoning behind its price point.  First, the consistency of Hair One is like whipped cream, it’s frothy and easily collapses!!  You have to use TONS of product to get enough on the hair to make it work with water.  Due to this light, poor consistency, you have to use double the amount of product which inevitably costs the same as Wen and you’re paying for a far INFERIOR product to boot.  Wen’s consistency is thick, dense and creamy so it doesn’t collapse and goes a long, long way.  Second, after washing my hair with Hair One, it was dry and wirey.  NOTHING like Wen!!  After washing with Wen, your hair is smooth and silky.  After using Hair One, I was actually afraid to brush my hair because it was so dry and stripped.  Trust me there are much harsher cleansers in this product ladies, NO QUESTION!!  It is not the equivalent to Wen by a LONG SHOT!!  I’m just a regular woman from Frederick, Maryland and have nothing to gain from writing this review other than helping another woman from wasting her money on this cheap knock off product.  Sally Beauty, if you want to make a product comparable to Wen, you need to go back to the drawing board and use just as good ingredients as found Wen because Hair One is as harsh as Suave.  I know the Hair One label “claims” to have the same ingredients but trust me, they are MUCH cheaper, low grade, replica ingredients.  So ladies, suck it up and stick with Wen.  You aren’t saving a dime with this product whatsoever because you are using double the amount of product to cover your hair and you’re drying it out in the process.  To date, I haven’t found anything comparable to Wen and if I do, I’m sure the price point will be comparable to Wen.  Quality products cost money ladies and if you seriously care about repairing and keeping your hair strong, you are going to have to invest wisely and buy Wen.  I’m just your average housewife and not wealthy by any means so I have to budget to buy Wen.  However, it’s worth the sacrifice to keep my hair healthy and strong.  You would be wise to do the same!!</li>
    <li> Like many, I was converted to cleansing conditioner by Wen but the price of Wen is too hefty to keep up. When I bought Hair One, I thought of it like comparing a PT Cruiser to a Cadillac Escalade. The PT Cruiser will get you from point A to point B, but it&#x27;s not going to have the luxury of an Escalade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair One doesn&#x27;t feel quite as luxurious as Wen, but it works surprisingly well. I&#x27;ve found that the key for healthy, shiny hair with ALL shampoos is to wash with cool water. Hot water opens the cuticle, making your hair brittle and fragile. Cool water keeps the cuticle closed so the cleanser simply washes away the dirt and oil on the outside instead of stripping the oil on the inside. You should rub the product between your hands and then apply directly to your scalp, massaging it in and working out to the ends. Also, massage your scalp as you rinse so the water gets all the way down and you rinse it out completely. The cool water also attracts the cleanser so it doesn&#x27;t leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels very nice after using Hair One, clean, no residue, bouncy, shiny and silky soft. I use just a tiny bit of coconut oil shine on the tips and that&#x27;s it for product after washing with Hair One. If you want a comparison to Wen, this doesn&#x27;t feel as creamy out of the bottle and the scent is very minty with a hint of almond whereas Wen smells like almond with a hint of mint. While the experience while washing doesn&#x27;t feel as luxurious, the result is very much the same.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now.  I have very fine very thin blonde hair and I would have to wash every other day or it would look horrible and greasy.  I have found that my hair doesnt look good on the first day I wash it but looks great the second and third day.  I am able to go at least 5 days without washing and it still looking good, I just feel gross if I go longer than that because I have been a slave to washing for too many years.  I do find it works best if I use a regular shampoo and conditioner every 2-3 weeks.  I find my hair gets to be a different kind of dirty, not oily anymore but it will feel coated.  This has a mild smell, nothing fancy but nothing strong.  My hair is mid back but because it is so thin, I probably only use 8-10 pumps total.  That seems to be more than enough and I can not use as a leave in.  I have to make sure it all gets washed out or it will feel coated.  I can brush with no tangles or knots as soon as I get out of the shower.  I will continue to use this until I find something better although I dont see that happening.</li>
    <li> I really liked this very much. However I like the Renpure better. But that&#x27;s only because my hair has serious frizz and needs more cones. This Hair One is a little less on the cones end. I believe that if you have normal to dry hair, you will like this very much. Perhaps not to use every single day, as too much will make your hair shed, just use it to moisturize a few times per week.</li>
    <li> I love this Hair One Cleanser Conditioner!  I&#x27;ve been searching for a great moisturizing cleanser as I have long, dark, thick, layered, and wavy hair (which is also colored to hide the grey, as I refuse to have grey in my 30&#x27;s.) The traditional shampoos left my hair dry and often frizzy. It seemed like I couldn&#x27;t condition my hair enough, I have been using leave-ins for the last few years. I avoid styling and drying, as I like the natural look of my waves which &amp;#34;do their thing&amp;#34; with the layers. (Aside from coloring, my hair has been strong and healthy.) I&#x27;ve seen the Wen infomercials and really wanted to try it. However, I couldn&#x27;t get over the price, nor the idea of automatic monthly charges. So I found Hair One at a Sally store a few weeks ago, and my hair is soft and much happier.&lt;br /&gt; I am surprised at some of the negative reviews this cleansing conditioner has gotten. I think the reasons for them are: 1) It is quite a bit different to use than shampoo, and this may be unexpected by those that don&#x27;t read up. It does require use of a generous amt, along with more effort to spread throughout thick hair and cover the scalp. It will eventually lather somewhat, but nothing like shampoos which always lather up immediately. 2) It may not be ideal for every hair type. I imagine it may provide too heavy of a conditioning element for thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff! It can even be added to the ends of hair as a leave-in conditioner. Wow! And, you can&#x27;t beat the price either! Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of Hair One almond mint for all hair types.  I like the olive oil one for dry hair much better.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo conditioner hoping that it would leave my hair in a similar state as the WEN products. It doesn&#x27;t. Even though I used the product the same way I use WEN it left my hair dry and looking dirty. This is not a good combination. When you look at the ingredients, the order is not the same as for WEN and it makes a huge difference. I would rather use my normal shampoo and conditioner as well as the other products I have to put in my hair for it to be well hydrated then to use this. I will continue to use WEN until I can find something that does well for my hair. For those who want to save some money, it seems that WEN at Sefora might end up being slightly cheaper as you don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping...</li>
    <li> Great product with excellent cleaning and conditioning properties. Nothing else I have tried is like it on the market at this price.</li>
    <li> I am 48 and hair is getting so dry!  I tried sulfate free shampoos, like them, but wasn&#x27;t enough.  This works great for my hair!  no lather really, but it does clean well, smells nice!  I use it every three days (yes hair is dry)  It helped calm frizzies, and smooths.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use anthing else!</li>
    <li> its too sweet for my liking. it works really well and i enjoy what it does a lot, but the smell is not my favorite. not overpowering to the point of bothering me, so i will still use it all... if you don&#x27;t mind sweet scented stuff then this should be a good buy. its a preference thing.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen products but they&#x27;re so expensive. I was sceptical when I saw this product at my local Sally beauty supply. I had ran out of my Wen and had been using regular shampoo and conditioner which made my hair so dry compared to Wen. Since Hair One is so cheap I went ahead and bought it. Immediately after using it I noticed a difference. With Wen it took a few weeks before I saw results. It&#x27;s also convienent that I can get this product at Sally&#x27;s rather than have to order online. So basically I will never spend so much money on Wen again. I love hair one and don&#x27;t ever want to use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, every bit as good as Wen</li>
    <li> Not Wen but good option.  Did not want to do the mandatory Wen thing. It is not quiet the quality but for the price and convenience it works well. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I recieved Hair One on time and packaged well Its not Wen but is Good it did leave my hair feeling greasy when it was wet but after I conditioned &amp; blowed dried my hair it was gone it did leave my hair soft and detangled I liked it but Im going back to Wen ..Hair one did not smell so great nor did it leave my hair and scalp feeling &amp; smelling fresh like Wen ...But this isn&#x27;t Wen I would recommend Hair One especially for those on a budget Wen Is expensive......</li>
    <li> I am still not sure about this.  Only been using two weeks.</li>
    <li> Have not used regular shampoo in 7 months, great price without the commitment of other similar products that will hurt my wallet.</li>
    <li> way to much alcohol, dried out my hair.</li>
    <li> did  not work on my hair</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and was told this is a good shampoo to use. It was okay and cleansed my hair, but did not help in the thinning areas.</li>
    <li> For years I kept a short hair style because it&#x27;s easier to manage and with the constant hair cuts, it didn&#x27;t matter how much I ironed and tinted. I have wavy hair that&#x27;s not very thick and has a mind of its own. Some mornings I have curls, other mornings I have half curly half straight and frizzy all around. I decided to let my hair grow out but to maintain a smooth &amp; styled look, I have to blow dry it with leave-in conditioner. Blow drying isn&#x27;t the healthiest thing and it has been causing lots of split ends. My hair in the front starts to break before it can get past my shoulders. I knew that if I wanted to sport the long luxurious locks, I needed to go easy on the blow dryer and flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Wen several years ago after seeing an infomercial. Yes my hair was super soft after the first wash but my hair was also very oily like I never shampooed. I felt that it was more conditioner, less cleanser. I can&#x27;t go more than two days without a good cleansing otherwise I look greasy! So I stopped using it. I also almost fainted after I saw that my account was debited over $100.00 the following month for another kit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my new goal was to grow my hair long with less blow drying and flat ironing, I started looking into Wen again. Perhaps they would have a more normal to oily hair friendly product. I came across Hair One which looked very familiar to me since I used to be a Sally&#x27;s regular a year back before I moved away. I read about how Hair One is also a cleanser conditioner and there&#x27;s one for curly hair, one for color treated hair and one for all hair types. So I purchased a 12 oz bottle of Hair One for all hair types. To my surprise, it costs less than half of what Wen costs and it&#x27;s sulfate free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed my hair for a good minute with water before I used the product. I then used 5 pumps on the top of my head and massaged. Then I used about 8 pumps for underneath and massaged. I added a little extra water and began massaging all over. I rinsed it all out with cold water and carefully towel dried my hair. I let it dry without the blow dryer and waited. The following morning, my hair looked like it does after I blow dry it! It was also very shiny and soft. All I have to do is run the flat iron down my bangs on a very low setting and I&#x27;m done! My hair looks great and I feel much more confident in growing my hair past my shoulders &amp; maintaining HEALTHY long hair.</li>
    <li> Today was the first time using Hair one. I absolutely love it! Made my hair so soft and bouncy. Wasn&#x27;t heavy and it smells so good! You have a faithful customer Hair One! Sorry Wen- you have competition.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo a lot. I usually wash my hair every other day but with shampoo I find that dries my hair out too much. I would rather wash it every 3 or 4 days anyway. My only complaint is that each time I shampoo my hair it recommends using like 20 pumps of soap. I don&#x27;t think this bottle will last long if that&#x27;s what I have to use.</li>
    <li> Pump doesn&#x27;t work, and it&#x27;s very hard to get the product out of the bottle without it.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very soft and clean</li>
    <li> Have tried tons of products and I&#x27;m sorry to say this one does not work!!!!!</li>
