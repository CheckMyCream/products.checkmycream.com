      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>So pretty.  </li>
      <li>Provided expedited shipping for my large order.</li>
      <li>Its a very light pink and works well for every day</li>
      <li>It lasts very well,too.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>this pink is more of an adult color than what the young girls are wearing.</li>
      <li>but this gives the equivalent smoothness and beautiful, subtle pink finish.</li>
      <li>you can see many small bubbles on your nails.</li>
      <li>Its not to light and not to dark.  </li>
      <li>The polish seemed old!</li>
      <li>Very pretty pink color!</li>
      <li>OPI is the best in almost all colors.&lt;br /&gt;Usually put on the base, then nail polish</li>
      <li>The texture is so smooth and so completely different from all of my other nail polishes.</li>
      <li>It takes a few coats because it is a very light pink.</li>
      <li>This is such a soft color!</li>
      <li>Especially with some clear glitter tapped on the tips.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s neutral enough to work in a professional setting.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a vibrant  pink, I&#x27;d pick this one.</li>

    <li> This is a great color if you want to stay in the nude family of colors - great on short nails.  Not too pink that it won&#x27;t work in a professional setting.  I will buy this color again.</li>
    <li> Great light polish and very shiny which make it even better. Shipping didn&#x27;t take long either. Good seller! Highly recommended</li>

    <li> I HATE fake nails but this gives the equivalent smoothness and beautiful, subtle pink finish. The texture is so smooth and so completely different from all of my other nail polishes. It can be layered for more pigmentation. I&#x27;d say the photo in the product pic is pretty accurate in color and smoothness and I&#x27;d guess the nails in the pic had about two or three coats. It also dries much quicker.</li>
