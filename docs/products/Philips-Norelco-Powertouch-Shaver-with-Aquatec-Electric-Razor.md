<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought as a birthday present for my husband. He loved it, no tugging on the hairs, very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Have purchased 3 of these.  Two for my sons and one for my father in law.  All of them are happy.  Older son does use this in the shower.  No issues with performance of this shaver.  Arrived on time.  Packaged well.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase.The electric shaver makes shaving a lot more convenient compared to using the disposable razor blades. It also removes the &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; making a clean, smooth shave WITHOUT causing razor burn.</li>
    <li> This is without doubt the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Great shaver and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, works well</li>
    <li> I had to return this shaver twice. Both times the shaver was used and then repackaged. It came in a generic cardboard box with a gigantic red sticker on the box which included a barcode. Once you look at the shaver you will see fingerprints all over it. Returned it and went to Cosco where it was brand-new in the box it the same price</li>
    <li> good piece of machinery</li>
    <li> Ok I know its just a razor but I thought I would share my thoughts on it. I’ve been using it for a few months and its works the same as the same Norelco that I had for the past 10 years.  That would have still been going except I dropped it and the head shattered. My previous Norelco had a soft case that I lost and was hoping this had but it doesn’t. Sort of a pain since I travel and I have to keep it in a quart freezer bag because I have had it open a few times and the contents spill all over, not fun. So far it works and the shave is as expected. I don’t have a very heavy thick beard so this works great. I have not used shave gel with this razor but I would expect it works. Another thing I wish that it had was a stand when at the house so that the water could drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro’s&lt;br /&gt;-Fairly cheap&lt;br /&gt;-works in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn’t have a case or stand&lt;br /&gt;-If you forget to clean it out before you travel and the head opens you will have hair everywhere</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this razor and it does a great shave,</li>
    <li> This model can not be beat for the price. Expect a reasonably good shave without skin irritation. Mine lasted me about a year before I replaced it with the same updated model. The side-burn trimmer, however, is a joke (hence the 4 stars).</li>
    <li> I have a fairly tough beard. This shaver does a good job giving me close shaves. I&#x27;m happy with it. The only reason I don&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is compared to a blade it just not as close. Have never seen an electric shaver that does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Quiet.  Light.  Takes a long time to shave.  Not as good as the last Norelco I had.</li>
    <li> my brother loved it !</li>
    <li> I got it for my boyfriend, the only problem we have with it is that its hard to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver on a daily basis for about a month now. It&#x27;s my second electric shaver; the first one was a Remington, back in the 80&#x27;s, which I tried twice and I immediately went back to shaving with Gillette Good News disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this is a very good shaver. I like the fact that it saves me time when I use it to shave dry, because I don&#x27;t have to put on shaving cream and I don&#x27;t have to keep rinsing off the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either wet or dry, I don&#x27;t think it shaves as close as a regular razor, but it&#x27;s almost there. Once you put on some after shave balm, your skin will feel smooth, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part for me to shave with this item is right under my bottom lip. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much I go over this area, I still feel a little stubble. Since I still maintain a military regulation mustache, I still have to use my disposable razor to shave above it and at the ends; this electric razor is unable to manage that aspect of my grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little trimmer thing is OK, nothing special. The charge lasts a long time; I haven&#x27;t charged my razor in a couple of weeks, and I have used it each day. I recommend this shaver. It is a good product (so far) and it delivers a good shave; almost as good as a regular razor.</li>
    <li> I still cannot get over the fact that I cannot use this while it&#x27;s charging!  I mean, what if I&#x27;m completely out of battery and I need to shave?  Why can&#x27;t I just plug it into an outlet and shave!  Seems common sense to me.  Also, cartridge failed very fast.</li>
    <li> Was very tempted to try the cheaper Remington look-alike, but after reading those reviews, decided to buy this, and was not disappointed. I already owned this shaver, but on a recent trip it was &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; so I wanted a replacement. Although made in China (as is everything else, it seems), the&lt;br /&gt;shaver operates smoothly and quietly, goes many shaves between charges and cleans easily. It can be used either wet or dry which is another big advantage over earlier dry-only rigid head shavers of the past. The shaving head itself,  as well as the individual heads, tilt&lt;br /&gt;to the contours of your face, giving a smooth, close shave. After using it for about a year, I don&#x27;t think I could go back to a blade.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver,don&#x27;t buy the cheaper one,it&#x27;s junk.</li>
    <li> Very similar to my old one. Shaves smooth</li>
    <li> Meets all expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers since I was 17 years old, and sadly have seen the overall quality go downhill with each new model purchase.  This particular shaver works decently because it utilizes the newer blade technology, but the drive motor is very weak compared to my previous models.  It operates quietly but that&#x27;s also because it is a less powerful motor.  I can&#x27;t imagine using this shaver if I had a thick layer of facial hair.  The sideburn trimmer, like most built-in versions is marginal at best.&lt;br /&gt;The most frustrating thing about this shaver is that you cannot use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.  All previous rechargeable Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve owned allowed you to still use the shaver while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall.  When this one dies, it&#x27;s dead, and you&#x27;re screwed if you need to shave quickly because you have to wait for it to charge.  That&#x27;s a horrible design feature.  Also, the charging cord is a cheap thin cord unlike the previous models that had a nice thick spiral flex cord.  This cord will clearly have much less life expectancy and be much more prone to easily being damaged.  The low battery indicator is virtually useless as it can barely be seen and doesn&#x27;t indicate the overall power level like previous models that showed the charge level in 20% increments.&lt;br /&gt;As a whole it&#x27;s a usable shaver, but I would&#x27;ve much preferred being able to buy a new version of my older Norelco.  Don&#x27;t set your expectations very high on this one.  It&#x27;s a marginal performer.</li>
    <li> I am 48, and have used several electric shavers over the past years. Always ended up back to a conventional razor. My whiskers are like wire bristles. Could never get a clean shave and grinding away at my face for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews here I purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this shaver for the first time today. Holly Molly Man!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used a shaver in sometime, but this thing is outstanding!!!!</li>
    <li> Returned and upgraded</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to my boyfriend. He likes using it for a quick shave, but he says it still irritates his skin after a couple of months. I guess it wasn&#x27;t that great of a gift :(</li>
    <li> So far so good! This is my first electric shaver and a far cry from the ones made back in the day that made my skin feel like I shaved with a lawn mower. I use shaving cream with it and it cleans up nicely. All in all, a great alternative to having to use a razor every other day.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Exactly what I hoped it would be. Shave is close and smmoth</li>
    <li> Husband is very pleased</li>
    <li> My husband is extremely pleased with this shaver. It holds a charge a long time and doesn&#x27;t make his face breakout. Also, I don&#x27;t have to worry about him cutting himself like he did with his old-style razor. His beard is rather stiff, but he gets a good close shave with this shaver.</li>
    <li> BOOO!  A HORRIBLE shaver.  As one tries to CLEAN the shaver there is a HIGH possibility ALL of the small internals will spill onto your floor or into your trashcan.  There are about 9 small parts that fit into the head and the floating heads fit only ONE WAY!  What a pain.  Same with the blades and frames.  I try to be extremely careful as I clean, but those pesky parts almost &#x27;explode&#x27; out of the head if I try to clean thoroughly.  If yours falls apart expect substantial time lost as you try to reassemble everything.  This razor was a gift, but if it wasn&#x27;t  I would have brought it all back to the store in a bag and let them sort it all out!  MORE!    After months of using this shaver I find that I now need to shave MUCH LOWER on my throat than I ever have.  I&#x27;m sure this is is because of the (wide) &#x27;swipe&#x27; of the blades.  Before this shaver I used a safety razor and I shaved just below my jaw because my beard never grew any lower.  I now need to shave to just ABOVE my collar bone(s), so please be aware of that too.  Be ready for more beard area.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have owned.  I&#x27;ve use electric razors for over 35 years.  I served overseas and replaced razors about every 4 years &amp; usually got the latest model.  My daughter gave me a SensoTouch 8900 (I think that is the number?) about 4 years ago ... I had suggested a cheaper model and thought I had a good deal.  Wrong!!!  Never seemed to shave too close.  Then started having trouble about a year ago.  Ordered a replacement head, but still only 2 of the 3 heads would rotate.  Wished I had spent that money on a new razor.  Read reviews here.  Ordered the 4500 instead of the more expensive fancy razors.  Very happy with the way it shaves.  Yes, I would like to have a battery level indicator, but I can live without it for a razor that does it&#x27;s job.  I like the deep reservoir for clippings.  With the old ones I would have to empty during a shave to keep it cutting ...this one no problem.</li>
    <li> good for daily shavers who are sun-exposed</li>
    <li> best electric razor on the market...not the cheapest but you only get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every way possible to shave. I suffer from ingrown hair, like most men of color.  I tried this shaver for about 2 months now, so far so good. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  I now have three of them.</li>
    <li> Feels a little weak. Been using it for 4 months and it takes a lot of passes 21 year old male, I can&#x27;t even grow a beard and this can&#x27;t even tackle my short stubble well. Disappointed. Not good for 80 dollars. I am not attracted to amazons &amp;#34;#1 best seller&amp;#34; titles anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco razors for many years and each one gets technically better. This one gives a very close comfortable shave, (I have a  tough beard and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried other electrics, (when I didn&#x27;t have access to mine), for me, nothing else comes close.</li>
    <li> Its good but not great, doesnt shave with pressision</li>
    <li> Talking about preferences between blade razors and electric razors is like arguing whether the North or South was right at the time of the Civil War. There&#x27;s something to be said in defence of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a razor blade shaver for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, I&#x27;ve tried an electric, but for the most part they&#x27;ve left me disappointed--so much bother to clean them, and they never seemed to shave close enough, or they burn and irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have high hopes when I tried this Philips/Norelco, but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there&#x27;s no cord, and you can take it into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it wet, dry, with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;It works best for me, after washing the face and then applying a pre-shave lubricant like Lectric Shave, but shaving cream also works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing for me, besides an &amp;#34;almost-as-close-as-a-razor&amp;#34; shave, was the ease of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The housing for the shaving heads opens, staying attached so you don&#x27;t lose anything, and you simply rinse it with hot water, and lightly shake dry. The sideburns trimmer cleans easily the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use the razor blade razor when I need a really close shave, but when I don&#x27;t want to risk nicks or burns, I&#x27;m very pleased with this convenient electric shaver--it&#x27;s so easy to use and clean!</li>
    <li> The shaver really shaves nice.I&#x27;ve had electric razors most of my shaving life and I prefer floating head design best.</li>
    <li> Solid shaver with good battery life. Tends to burn my neck a bit though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace an older model whose time had come.  More comfortable than the old model.  Technology marches on....</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the performance of the shaver.  Battery life is good.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, I have a very thick hair and I was looking for a wet shaver to avoid skin irritation when I used the dry electric shaver. This shaver is making my mornings irritation free and also it gives very close shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 40 years. The batteries get longer lasting every year.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly on my patients. Smooth shave and easy to clean. My alzheimer&#x27;s patient can use it all by himself. If only it would guide him to the neck spots he misses, lol...</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and he says &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay and I hardly have to charge it ever!</li>
    <li> Very simple to use, husband uses it every day. He says it is easy to use and cuts very well</li>
    <li> My husband likes it very much</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t pull on the longer hairs like my old razor did!  Easy to empty out shavings.</li>
    <li> I have used quite a few Norelco shavers over the years, and this unit replaces a very similar one (8240XL) that started to come apart after several years. I have been using the shaver for a couple or weeks without recharging, so it will be interesting to see how much longer the charge will last.The shaves have been close and comfortable, and the built-in trimmer works well. I travel a lot on business so I needed a shaver without a charging base, and this one fits the bill. The only issue - and the reason for not giving 5 stars, is that the shaver didn&#x27;t come with a travel case. This wasn&#x27;t actually a problem for me since I was able to use the nicely made case from my last shaver, but I would much rather pay a few extra bucks and get a new case.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!  He wonders why he continued to use the old one so long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews on the Philips Norelco 830. Although a few have left negative comments most seem to like the razor, but I wondered why all comments aren&#x27;t positive given that similar conditions should yield similar results. So in thinking about it I&#x27;ve concluded the following. First, not everyone has the same facial hair, and to a degree this explains the different results; no doubt the AT830 is designed for medium to light beards, and for anything heavier the blades just don&#x27;t cut as well as they should. Next, in my experience the razor works exceptionally well when used with gel and hot water; dry shaves not so well. Finally, I have another electric razor by Philips Norelco, the Arcitec 1050x, which uses similar cutting blades to the AT830, but the blades on the 1050x are dull and need to be replaced. Result? Even with hot water and shaving gel, the 1050x doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close or as comfortably as with the AT830. So I think this explains the negative comments, probably made by those with heavy beards, or by those who haven&#x27;t replaced their cutting blades or finally, by those that shave without gel and hot water. So before knocking the razor, replace the blades and then try shaving again with gel and hot water. If that doesn&#x27;t work, your beard isn&#x27;t compatible with the AT830, so try a Braun or Panasonic. If that still doesn&#x27;t work, go back to blades.  Update - 4/20/2015 Just tried a Panasonic ES-LA63s. The Panasonic does well when dry shaving but is not as good as the AT830 when wet shaving. After reading the reviews I never would have guessed that (which is why I bought the ES-LA63s), but the AT830 gives me a closer shave! The truth is there&#x27;s no such thing as the perfect electric razor - everyone&#x27;s different, and it&#x27;s a matter of finding the right razor for your facial hair. Update - 5/1/2015 Used the Panasonic now for 2 weeks until it was &amp;#34;broken in.&amp;#34; Just wet shaved the right side of my face with the AT830 and the left side with the Panasonic. The Panasonic did just a little better, giving a shave equal to a blade (use of a blade leaves absolutely no stubble on the face). For the test, I created optimal conditions, including shaving late in the day, having no more than 1 day of stubble on my face, pulling my skin taunt while shaving, the use of hot water and premium gel, then working both razors against the grain of my beard while shaving. Yes the Panasonic was a LITTLE better. But for the cost, I&#x27;d still buy the AT830 over the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This is an overpriced piece of trash!  The razor has no more power than the cheapest model.  It does not cut well at all.  There is also a major design flaw with the release button to open the top.  Any time the smallest bit of pressure I applied to the razor, the head pops open.  You will end up cut hair spilt on your head, down your shirt, on the floor, and pretty much everyplace else.  This is the absolute last Norelco product I will ever buy!  It should be a crime to sell a piece of garbage like this!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always used a Norelo and I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been  Norelco user for years and have always found them to be great. This one is no exception.</li>
    <li> I bought this wonderful little shaver for my husband last Christmas, he still has words of praise for it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent product, long battery.</li>
    <li> Good close shaves and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Gives a smooth, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Husband uses it every day!</li>
    <li> Not much to say.  It works great.  I get a close shave.  It replaced a previous very similar Nonelco that I had for close to 20 years and was worn out.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my husband to replace an older Norelco model. He likes it--gets a good close shave. He needs an electric shaver because he&#x27;s on a medicine that causes bleeding..this shaver is safe for him.</li>
    <li> Did Not Gave The Close Shave I Expected !!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - like it very much.</li>
    <li> This gentle giant mows through the clumps and stubble even the big boys miss...like the Braun 9000cc,and at less than half the price.  Great shave.  Great buy. I may never use a blade again!</li>
    <li> great shaver at a great price.</li>
    <li> Works well in the shower which is my primary shaving location. I had dropped my old Norelco one too many times and now wish I had replaced it sooner.  Hopefully holds out as long as my last one did</li>
    <li> Classic shaver gets a hitech battery!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. I would have liked to have a battery gauge on it though.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable shave, battery charges very quickly.</li>
    <li> This was the second of two new razors I purchased.  This was considerably more expensive, but does an excellent job.  No electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had matches a blade razor and this one is no exception.  But I knew that going in.  I tried a rotary shaver many years ago and didn&#x27;t feel it gave a good shave.  This one is much better.  I use this with a light touch.  I think that avoids razor burn.  Stretching the skin first helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially thought I had not gotten a good charge because the razor seems VERY slow.  But after recharging there was no speed increase.  Still, it seems to cut as well as previous shavers, including the foil types.  It also seems to do well with the longer, softer hairs on the neck.  With foil razors, I&#x27;ve taken a first cut with the beard trimmer.  But this one seems to do the job with just the rotary heads.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve every had.</li>
    <li> Was a birthday present for our son and he really likes the feel and close shave he gets with it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  Quality razor.</li>
    <li> my husband likes it very much</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my father-in-law, who suffers from a very sensitive and irritable skin. He tried it for two weeks. He was not satisfied with the shaver. It did not shave evenly nor sufficiently all his face skin. If he pressured the shaver on his skin too hard, he got a bad red rash. Therefore he decided to return it. Maybe for a man with a less stubborn stubble it might do.</li>
    <li> The AT830/46 Shaver 4500 is similar to my last but you are able to use this model in the shower.  It is a good medium priced razor with nice features such as a built-in trimmer, quick charge and long battery life. I rated it 4 stars because over the past several years the quality or sharpness of the cutting blades has, in my opinion, declined and the product does not provide as &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; a shave as once was provided by Phillips Norelco blades.</li>
    <li> Nosier than predecessor, so it sounds like it&#x27;s doing much more work.  However, it is about as effective as the old one it replaces.  I&#x27;d hoped that the technology would have advanced over the years, but performance seems the same as previously, which was good but not great.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just fine. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old one, same make and model . Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco rotary shavers for many years, and this recent purchase lives up to what I expected and then some, in a positive way. I&#x27;ve always focused on the mid-level product, as I don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles of the higher priced Norelco shavers. One nice touch is that a light will go on while you are shaving to indicate that you only have some minutes left before the battery is depleted, so you should recharge after finishing up. Also, the shave head moves slightly up and down on two hinges, which seems to further help the blades follow the contours of your face and neck, though I&#x27;m not sure if this helps much. I can recommend this shaver without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim to replace my 4-year-old Remington because I&#x27;d been hearing how great Norelco shavers were. The Norelco is much quieter, but it took over twice as long to shave as my old Remington because of the multiple passes needed to get all the whiskers. Moreover, my Remington&#x27;s cutters do a better job even though they&#x27;re a year old. If you decide to take Norelco up on their 21-day trial, be advised that it took them 10 days to send me an RMA form via email, and I had to fill out everything on it by hand even though I had had to dictate everything over the phone to the agent.</li>
    <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for shaving. The shaving system is too weak for shaving a normal beard and that&lt;br /&gt;is the reason we are sending the razor back. This is the Norelco that we tried and the same problems are still present.</li>
    <li> Good razor simple and works great.</li>
    <li> excellent performance, quiet, gives close shave.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Norelco.....</li>
    <li> Great shave, quickly recharges.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco shaver and by far the best. The swivel head works great and overall the shaver works just as well as its more expensive bigger brothers.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver and it does get closer than my previous shavers</li>
    <li> This a great replacement for an older Norelco.  Love the fact it came in simple packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I have had over 2 weeks.. use it everyday and is still on original charge.  Gives me a close and great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This item performs just as good as my previous two Norelco razors.  Good quality blade system.  Very well pleased.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> No problems works as promised, shipped even faster, Amazon delivers</li>
    <li> does a very good job, but is also very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; in your hand...i would of rather it be a little heavier.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine and met my expectations. Noting spectacular but okay.</li>
    <li> great shipping..no  stand to put shaver while charging...come on norelco company..where do you expect it to go on the sink .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for many years and this is one of the best.  They keep improving the technology.  Nice, clean shave as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Norelco.  In fact, better than my previous Norelco shavers.  Well recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside:&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty ticked that I couldn&#x27;t replace the battery when it&#x27;s time is up. I replaced batteries on my previous Norelco shavers on more than one occasion and maximized the life of the shaver.  I&#x27;m guessing Phillips hates that so the non-replaceable battery model is their &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;. Shave 5-stars.  Customer satisfaction 3-stars (due to battery stupidity).  Tempted to look at other brands of shavers next time...</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor over a year ago so I have had plenty of time to put it through its paces.  I was tired of paying outrageous prices for replacement blades so I decided to go the electric shaver route.  This shaver had some of the best reviews so I took the plunge..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an overall shave it does a decent job..  It has some issues getting a close shave on the neck but I take care of that with a few swipes with a regular razor.  I like that you can run it wet or dry and it is very easy to clean and to change shaver heads.  Battery charge is pretty good, usually one over night charge lasts me a week..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with the shaver - it&#x27;s a good alternative to buying expensive replacement blades.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. My husband has put his stamp of approval on it. It works quietly, charges fast, shaves well...just like the others before it.</li>
    <li> Love it.  My husband will never use a bladed razors again.  He lives it!</li>
    <li> Nice quiet improvement over my 30 year old Norelco. Doesn&#x27;t require a charging stand which is great in my tiny condo. The heads with two types of holes seem to give me shaves equal to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> This is a classic awesome Philishave.  Smooth, and quiet.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great value&lt;br /&gt;Frustration free packaging was incredible&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Quiet and effective.  Five star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a couple years now. I&#x27;m pleased with how it shaves. I find shaving dry or with water works best for me. I&#x27;ve not felt need to change the blades, though I have some extra on hand. I find that applying mineral oil to the shaver blades and internal mechanism, when the shaver is dry, helps keep the plastic looking new inside.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out, not the closest shave yet but it takes a few days for your skin to adjust. But it works good.</li>
    <li> Works great. My boyfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> My husband is really loving this shaver!</li>
    <li> does a great job, battery lasts for a long time between charges.</li>
    <li> It works quite nicely, Just a bit long for my liking. Definitely Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> If I could go back in time, I&#x27;d pass on this shaver and choose something else. I paid more money thinking the shave wet idea would be cool to try. From the start it was working great, and then I started having problems with the shaver not wanting to cut certain beard hairs! After running over the same hairs every which way I just gave up and used a manual razor. In short, I replaced the heads/blades in my older Philips Norelco Electric Razor 7300 and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I might look into buying a different brand of razor next year because the cut and quality are just not what I remember them to be from Norelco.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly as described here. I gifted this to my husband and he seems to be enjoying it. He was soo lazy in getting his beard shaved but now with this he thankfully shaves before turning into an ape... lolzzz. This is our first electric shaver and we totally love this. It has great battery backup as well.</li>
    <li> Have been using Norelco for several decades. This is the best yet.</li>
    <li> Much prefer this over Braun. Be sure to get floating heads models, etc.</li>
    <li> All the items have worked as good as advertised</li>
    <li> Product has fully met my expectations.  I especially like the battery life.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works as described.&lt;br /&gt;I use a simple soap as lubricant and keeps the shave action comfortable and smooth&lt;br /&gt; easy to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt; When it loads up with soap just pop it open and rinse under the shower, then carry on. (so far after a month).&lt;br /&gt;charges quickly and lasts a long time on one charge.  have gone a week without charging.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have a 1970&#x27;s Norelco electric that still works well as a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old one. But it is OK&lt;br /&gt; I do have to go over the same areas of my face several times to get a close shave. (didn&#x27;t with the older one)&lt;br /&gt;Nicks my upper lip occasionally. (older one doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;grip angle is not as comfortable as my old one but it is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is a good value and I am happy with its features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally runs at a slower RPM but the new one is battery the old one is 110V only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 1970 model still runs like a rocket.  The new one definitely wont last as long, but that&#x27;s todays products anyway!</li>
    <li> It works well but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the rotary speed as the older Norelco I owned in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do well on my neck.  Even fresh out of the box and fully charged it left angry red marks afterwards.  Overall ok.</li>
    <li> Good razor. Worked well - for 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;Good:  Close shave. Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Bad:  Low RPMs. Unit only lasted 1 year before water got into the &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; electronics and corroded the components.  I started noticing the battery light would flicker while charging, then it stop illuminating completely after a few weeks.  Then, the unit refused to stay on.  It would turn on for a short burst when the power button was pressed, then immediately stop. I opened the unit to find substantial water damage to the circuit board.  I never used this wet. I just rinsed it off after use.</li>
    <li> Hubby was very pleased with the way it cleaned his beard.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift and have heard no complaints.</li>
    <li> what is there to say i am happy with it</li>
    <li> Love this new model with fast charging action and very efficient shaving.  Quite and effective.  Will test further in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> Wet or dry, best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten</li>
    <li> This is an upgrade of the Aquatec shaver, which I have used  daily for several years.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job on my medium whiskers, easy to grip. Every charge lasts for a couple&lt;br /&gt;of weeks. I take the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one on trips now. You can pay a lot more for a Norelco, but this&lt;br /&gt;model is the gold standard, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> over the years I hve had sevreal of this model razor.  They work well for an electic and are very convenient</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a gift for my son, who reports that it lacks the power of his old plug-into-the-wall Norelco and requires continual recharging, which is a nuisance.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Really helps to have new shaver head and the battery last about 2 weeks before needing recharging.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my new Norelco shaver. It arrived on time, in perfect condition. I charged it up and registered it. It shaves nice and close. I am sure the new shaver will provide many years of service with proper care.</li>
    <li> Clean smooth shave, long lasting battery, decent price. Definitely worth buying</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a morello user for a long time. This taxer gives a very close shave without discomfort. It&#x27;s easy to clean. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Nothing new other than lighter weight lacking minutes indicator, rotary cutting blades that are no different than those in my old 6885XL model (15 years ago) &amp; doesn&#x27;t cut better than the old one either. I bought that one because the blades for my old one were $40.0. Bottom line is, if you were satisfied with your old Norelco, keep it. I paid $25.0 more than the 810 model for a swivel head that swivels in one direction only, old technology in new package.</li>
    <li> have used this style shaver for 30 years this is the 3rd one,  10 years is fair for an electronic device</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Bought it for his Christmas gift! :)</li>
    <li> Present for son.  He will love it...Thank you...</li>
    <li> Razor is fine. Cuts close and clean. Great battery life. Needs to come with a travel case though.</li>
    <li> my husband is laid up in bed after surgery so this nearby has made him so happy, he says it gives him a great shave.</li>
    <li> Product and projected date of receipt were just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shaver I have ever owned.  I have used Norelco exclusively since I was a teenager and have never experienced a shave this close.  I could even get away with skipping a day but it&#x27;s so effortless I wouldn&#x27;t bother to.  Previous Norelcos have been slightly irritating to my neck and left bumps while not shaving all that closely but this one is a dream!  I have not used the wet feature for shaving but very much enjoy the rinsing clean up versus the dry brushing on previous models.  Be sure to follow the instructions and wait a FULL 15 minutes or longer after washing your face.  It really does make a big difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had electric shavers in the past including Norelcos and the Norelcos give me the closest shave.  The unit still won&#x27;t give you the same shave as a razor but it is a lot more convenient.</li>
    <li> I use it to shave my head and although not quite as good as a razor it still does a commendable job without having to worry about nicks and cuts like I get with a razor blade.</li>
    <li> It provides a close shave but if a person has sensitive skin it may be too close when used dry.</li>
    <li> Was a gift, but he likes it.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift to my brother and he said he loves it.</li>
    <li> This one is more powerful than the previous version.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this razor a 6 star rating. I have been using Norelco razors for over 30 years and this razor is the best of all time. It really glides over my face lightly. The only problem is if you run out of power during shave, you can&#x27;t just plug in and finish. I wonder when Norelco stopped this plug in shaving feature.</li>
    <li> I have had other Philips Norelco shavers which were well worth the prices. So far this one is equally good.</li>
    <li> June, got the Philips Norelco shaver for me (Wayne, her husband) nice close shave.</li>
    <li> This is my forth and most expensive Norelco shaver. First three were great.  Have been happy with the shaves from this one, but the third time I used and opened it to clean it, it fell apart and parts dropped into the sink.  Took me almost an hour to get it back together, with some damage to the heads and head holders, then it wouldn&#x27;t close.  Probably needs new parts which are expensive. Afraid to use it again, so went back to using my old $49 one.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He can use it wet or dry. Great service and delivery.</li>
    <li> A very good razor, very easy to use and clean. Fairly close shave, against a very coarse beard.</li>
    <li> Quiet. Smooth, close shave. Charges quickly.</li>
    <li> Horrible model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older model worked a million times better and faster.  Wished that I didn&#x27;t toss it</li>
    <li> This is simply the best grooming product. Get the jobs done quick and fast.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it.  It is a replacement for the one that was wearing out.</li>
    <li> Just a couple of months using this, everything was fine and dandy until it stopped working. Power cord doesn&#x27;t work as expected and machine doesn&#x27;t charge anymore, so I found myself with a Shaver that cannot be used because of poor quality accessories. The most frustrating part is this is not a cheap shaver and I bought it off trusting to get a good product, not this disappointing junk.</li>
    <li> Fine shaver, great price.!!</li>
    <li> Quiet, fast, gets a close shave. Would be nice if it had a stand, but it certainly does its job well.</li>
    <li> its a good shaver but I would have liked a closer shave</li>
    <li> Its is a fair shaver it takes it down to a stubble but it dose not shave very close.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, timely delivery</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband, he has used it everyday and loves it.  The battery says up good as well.</li>
    <li> husband had shoulder surgery and couldn&#x27;t shave with regular razor, needed this electric to use with left hand....works very well</li>
    <li> This thing is a monster.</li>
    <li> I am well satisfied this shaver, it shaves much better than my older Norelco 7310XL shaver even though they use the same shaving head and the battery charge lasts much longer. I would like it better if I could use it while it was charging, but it is designed to be used wet, so that is the way it has to be.</li>
    <li> not as powerfull as I expected</li>
    <li> well worth the money. very quiet, gives a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this shaver.  I avoided buying for years because I could not decide between the rotary and a foil.  I have always liked the shave I got with my old rotary and this one is so much better.  Could be because my old one was going on 7 years with only one blade change!</li>
    <li> 1st electric I have had since 1957. I love it. Greatly improved.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s my whiskers off, and that&#x27;s a good thing!  ☺</li>
    <li> This was my first rotary shaver purchase.  I have been using a Braun foil shaver for years. I&#x27;m glad I made the switch. This shaves much faster than my foil shaver and gives a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> very close shave. like it! shipping was also quick.</li>
    <li> My first head shaver.  Exceeded my expectations.  Even use it on my face as well and I&#x27;ve always been a blade guy.  Love it so far!</li>
    <li> It shaves very well but it should have been sold with a charging stand which I had to buy at the website linked to from Norelco for what I considered a rather high price.</li>
    <li> This shaver seems to cut well, dry, with some repeat passes.  I have just had it for a week.  It also charges rapidly, which is very convenient.  However, I was not happy to learn that I will have to replace the shaver head every year to maintain its cutting ability.  This adds to the cost and complication of using this shaver.  However, after considerable study of user reviews of shavers on the market, it looks to me like none of  those in the low to mid price range appear to be absolutely reliable and effective.  Read the comments with one, two and three star ratings of each product.</li>
    <li> Great shaver and great service also.</li>
    <li> Quiet, comfortable, clean shave.  Excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband.  He loves it.  He&#x27;s had several others that did not work properly and this one does.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I received a different model for Christmas and this one is far superior to that one. Clean shave everytime.</li>
    <li> Replaced my Sensotouch 3D with this shaver since Philips ruined what was a great shaver, the 3D, with &amp;#34;new Improved replacement head&amp;#34; that is horrible.  I guess this is considered a step back from the 3D but the quality of the shave is equal to the 3D even when it had the original head, and absolutely kills the 3D now that the original replacement head for it is not available any longer.  I noticed that this shaver is now out of stock and Amazon does not know if or when it will be available once again, so I guess Philips is doing everything they can to force people to buy their $200 - $350 models, but the day I would do that is the day I will just stop by the barber shop daily and get a top quality shave.  I can do that many times before that would total $350.  If they eliminate all their shavers that cost less, maybe some folks will stick with them regardless of price, but I&#x27;m not one of them. I&#x27;ve used a rotary shaver for the past 20 years and have always counted on Norelco, but if this razor konks out, I&#x27;ll be trying some other brands and options.  It&#x27;s sad to see Philips falling into the greedy mold like so many other companies have, but I guess stockholder dividends are driving the train now with them, too.  Please excuse the editorial comments, I&#x27;ll get back to the 4500..if you can find it somewhere I would advise you to buy it before they all disappear, because this shaver delivers a nice, close, comfortable shave every single day.  I don&#x27;t use gel or shaving cream since going to all that trouble was why I gave up on a razor, but for years I have used a pre-shave lotion to help get my beard ready for a close clipping.  Not Williams Lectric Shave or some watery substance, but an actual lotion that truly helps, like Afta pre-electric or even a house brand of CVS that is comparable to Afta, but has a much more noticeable aroma.  Applying that and allowing it to dry helps make shaving with the 4500 a real pleasure for me just as it did with the Sensotouch3D in its earlier days.  I prefer plugging the cord directly into the razor rather than into a stand and the case for my 3D fits this razor well for travel so those two issues are not a problem for me. The price is really reasonable and all things considered, it&#x27;s an excellent shaver.  I highly recommend it if you can find it.  It&#x27;s a winner and I&#x27;d be amazed if you can find a comparable shaver in this price range.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointing shaver on all fronts. Not only did it chew me up, it didn&#x27;t even do a good job shaving. After more than double the amount of time it normally takes me to shave, I was still left with random bits of hair.  Definitely not a keeper.</li>
    <li> Great while it lasted!  I purchased this razor for my husband on December 1, 2014.  The battery failed this month (February of 2016) and the last date to return was January 2nd, 2016.  This is the THIRD Norelco three head razor he has used that has failed after only 13 months or less of use.  Pretty spendy for the time it lasts!  Maybe you and I should look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Gives a neat clean close shave.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the lack of battery charge state</li>
    <li> Works great.  Stays charged for at least a week.</li>
    <li> Had to shave my beard off after not shaving for about 25 years. This razor works well, I need a smooth surface to get vital stem therapy on my neck. This fills that need and doesn&#x27;t rub my face raw.  The face is not used to shaving since it&#x27;s been covered for 25 years.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I&#x27;ve been pleased with Norelco razors for decades and expect the same of this one.</li>
    <li> Good clean shave. Charge lasts real well. Nice waterproofing.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I really do quite like this shaver.  It works quite well, does a pretty good job, and seems to have good battery life so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then why the 3 stars?&lt;br /&gt;1.  The trimmer is poor.  It&#x27;s at such an angle that when I try to use it I find it wanting to close on me.  The only way around that is to keep the body of the shaver right against my body, which is awkward and was never an issue on my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I feel that it could do a better job shaving.  My 10-15 yr old Norelco had similar &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; blades but I feel like I have to go over the same area many more times with this shaver than my old one.  If I don&#x27;t, it seems to leave lots of stray hairs untouched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ability to rinse it out after each shave, but I&#x27;m still trying to decide if that is the best way to go in an area where our water is very hard (and I don&#x27;t have a water softener).  It seems like the hard water buildup over a short time would create more issues than NOT rinsing it out after each use like they suggest.  Jury is still out on that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, like I said, I quite like the razor, but I was expecting a whole lot more, coming from a 10+ year old corded bottom-of-the-line Norelco.</li>
    <li> I still use my blade razor to clean up my upper lip and chin, however, I don&#x27;t cut myself like I used to.  I&#x27;m beyond early years.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my husband as he is a coach for the middle school.  He needed something to keep with him since he puts in a lot of hours and need a quick shave.  He loves it.  Says it cuts close and is excellent for his needs.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised upon using the shaver (dry) for the first time.  A very good razor that gave a closer shave than my more expensive $249.00  Braun 7 series.  The spinning of the blades don&#x27;t seem that it would cut well, but I have a Braun 7 series that I compared it to today, and the Norelco was smoother, and I did not have to go over the same area of my face as much as the Braun.  Go figure.  Could not believe this nor understood as to why.  I will never purchase one of those expensive ones again.  My beard is not on the heavy side which could account why I get a closer shave over some of you that have a heavy beard, but still, that does not account for the closer shave over the Braun.  Learned a lesson, that just because a shaver costs more does not translate into a better shave.  Enough said.  Happy camper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  Not to mention, the blade replacements are less costly as well</li>
    <li> This shaver meets all expectations. Good value.</li>
    <li> Initially I was very happy with this razor - it felt more powerful and give a cleaner shave than my previous Philips razor.  However, after about a year and a half, the battery suddenly died, so that it no longer takes a charge.  Because this model cannot be used while plugged in, it is now useless.  It&#x27;s still under warranty so I&#x27;m getting a replacement handle, but this makes me hesitant about buying this model again, having to wait 7-10 days for the replacement part is a bit frustrating.</li>
    <li> Does a good job and is fast. Good trimer.</li>
    <li> My first electric Shaver. Used for a week now and I read the information. Very happy so far and I would say read and do the 21 Day run to see if you are happy. I feel I will be very happy.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth of this brand and model and this is even better than the previous three, which were great!</li>
    <li> good but not excellent</li>
    <li> A slightly less-well-made replacement for my similar Philips Norelco 8251XL that stopped accepting a recharge after many years. This one is much more plastic. Less-firm grip. This one came in the Amazon &amp;#34;frustration-free&amp;#34; packaging. Inside, the protective plastic cover for the heads wasn&#x27;t on the shaver. There wasn&#x27;t a simple travel pouch included. (The pouch wasn&#x27;t listed on the &amp;#34;what&#x27;s included&amp;#34; text on the purchase page, so the lack of the pouch was anticipated). Seems to shave about the same as the old unit.</li>
    <li> Very neat that you can take the head off and rinse it under water.  Of course you need to unplug it first.  The only down side is you can not use it while it&#x27;s charging.  Holds a charge quite a long time.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and they liked it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift.  The person I got it for loved it and uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shaver . it is so much better than the 1 I tried years ago!  It hardly ever pulls hairs and I love using it cordless</li>
    <li> It is what I expected and great service.</li>
    <li> It is as good as electric shaver get.  I doubt those costing a lot more are any more effective.</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave. Light for off and on does not work (used maybe) and being hard of hearing doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
