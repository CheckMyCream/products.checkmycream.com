      <li>LOVE  </li>
      <li>I would like it better.</li>
      <li>Now have three different styles/sizes for the perfect blow-out!</li>
      <li>Great brush...use it for blowing out my wavy hair to make it straight.</li>
      <li>Was so excited to have found it after years of searching!</li>
      <li>The brush is of good quality and it is gentle on your hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to maneuver while blow drying.</li>
      <li>Cheap wood that you can get a splinter from.</li>
      <li>It is my absolute favorite - the combination of the plastic pins and the bristles</li>
      <li>I had my sister try out this brush once, and she was actually amazed at how good her hair felt after using it.</li>
      <li>so I still use, but a lot more gently.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>I have super straight hair and it never leaves it with static.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful, doesn&#x27;t pull of hair is wet or dry, and fabulous for styling with a dryer.</li>
      <li>I have been using the same kind for 15 years now</li>
      <li>Love this paddle brush; had a hard time finding a replacement for my own so ordered through amazon.</li>
      <li>It was fine and nice for the first few times that I used the hairbrush.</li>
      <li>Four months, to be exact.</li>
      <li>, it makes my hair smooth and soft</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t send it back</li>
      <li>Good brush but kinda heavy for me.</li>
      <li>It brushes through my wet, tangled hair very easily.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this brush for my long hair, gets tangles out without hurting my head.</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>After five years, my brush is starting to look a bit beat up - a couple bent pins, and all of the plastic tips that make it not scratch your head have been knocked off by my attempts to clean it with my comb.</li>
      <li>Decently priced too.</li>
      <li>I started to send this brush back, I thought it would be too strong for my scalp, then I actually used it and while it&#x27;s taken some getting used to, I really like it now</li>
      <li>separates all of my hair, leaving it feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>Saw a recommendation on the Today Show, and wow, I am hooked!</li>
      <li>I hate buying new brushes but this one was great!</li>
      <li>It IS big and is actually made for long hair, but I still like it for my shorter, baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Im a big fan of natural brushes as I feel they are somewhat healthier for the scalp and hair.</li>
      <li>This was a good brush while it lasted, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s harder and less comfortable to hold on to.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also heavy and the handle is uncomfortable, but I was willing to overlook that because I liked the combo plastic and boar bristles.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair as the other brushes I have with plastic bristles.</li>
      <li>I actually did not expect much from a hair brush other than what you expect it to do.</li>
      <li>Takes far less time, and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>

<li> This is the absolute worst brush from goody.</li>
<li> Really stiff and painful to brush.</li>
<li> Bristles do fall out a bit but for what I paid it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
<li> I hate to get rid of it</li>

    <li> Not bad for the price. Bristles do fall out a bit but for what I paid it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> Good brush but kinda heavy for me.</li>
    <li> I love love love this brush!</li>

    <li> I bought one of these brushes years ago and had been enable to find another to replace. This is the only brush my girls will let me use on their hair as it doesn&#x27;t pull. Was so excited to have found it after years of searching!</li>
    <li> This was a good brush while it lasted, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t long. Four months, to be exact. One day I noticed that it was really scratching my head, and I saw that all the gray &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; had broken off the plastic bristles. The few that are still intact, I can break off with my finger nail. I&#x27;m not sure if this happened gradually or all at once, but either way it&#x27;s unusable now. It&#x27;s also heavy and the handle is uncomfortable, but I was willing to overlook that because I liked the combo plastic and boar bristles. On to the next brush.</li>
    <li> I actually did not expect much from a hair brush other than what you expect it to do. So I was pleased and amazed the it defluffed my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush for my long hair, gets tangles out without hurting my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for over 6 years and am just now replacing it with the same. It&#x27;s wonderful, doesn&#x27;t pull of hair is wet or dry, and fabulous for styling with a dryer. Used it through short and long hair over the years, and every time I use another brush I wonder why anyone would use something without the boars hair layer. Everyone who borrows my brush falls in love with it.</li>
    <li> Not great for thick hair like mine but it is a nice brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is hard to beat. It really gets to the roots and smooths my thick, wavy hair. The combination of nylon and boar bristles makes for a perfect brush.</li>
    <li> I hate buying new brushes but this one was great! I have super straight hair and it never leaves it with static.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush at Walmart for seven dollars probably five years ago or so. It is my absolute favorite - the combination of the plastic pins and the bristles (I think they&#x27;re boar?) separates all of my hair, leaving it feeling very soft. (For reference, I have thin, fine, Scandinavian hair, but I don&#x27;t think this brush would perform at all badly with thicker hair.) I had my sister try out this brush once, and she was actually amazed at how good her hair felt after using it. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it does make your hair feel noticeably nicer. After five years, my brush is starting to look a bit beat up - a couple bent pins, and all of the plastic tips that make it not scratch your head have been knocked off by my attempts to clean it with my comb. But, I don&#x27;t mind, considering how well it&#x27;s served me. It would be awesome if Amazon brought this item back - depending on the price, I might love to replace mine!</li>
    <li> The brush is of good quality and it is gentle on your hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair as the other brushes I have with plastic bristles.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It brushes through my wet, tangled hair very easily.</li>
    <li> Best hairbrush ever! I&#x27;ve been using this brush since 2008. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the last year. So glad it&#x27;s on Amazon! I can finally replace the three worn out ones I have.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Ibrought this by accident because I couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture there are 2 different kinds of bristles in the paddle. One boar the other is plastic. This makes it  very hard to clean and will damage hair.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!  I love this brush!!!!!  IT&#x27;s so big!!!!  LOVE  LOVE  LOVEE!!!&lt;br /&gt;You must buiy it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great brush...use it for blowing out my wavy hair to make it straight. Takes far less time, and leaves my hair soft and shiny. How did I never know about the difference that boar bristles make for brushes and hair? Saw a recommendation on the Today Show, and wow, I am hooked! Now have three different styles/sizes for the perfect blow-out!</li>
    <li> I like this brush, but it is a bit big. I have short hair, and not much touches my head when using. I think if I had longer hair I would like it better.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  It IS big and is actually made for long hair, but I still like it for my shorter, baby fine hair.  I like that I can brush through my hair after I wash it without pulling from snarls.  I even stopped adding a leave in conditioner because I no longer needed it.  Very happy with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now January 6, 2016 and I&#x27;ve had this brush for just over a year. It has lost all the little caps on the top of the bristles so it can be a bit painful if I brush too hard. I hate to get rid of it so I still use, but a lot more gently.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush! I have been using the same kind for 15 years now and whenever I try out a different model it doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush but personally I&#x27;m not a fan of the flat wooden handle... It&#x27;s harder and less comfortable to hold on to.</li>
    <li> Im a big fan of natural brushes as I feel they are somewhat healthier for the scalp and hair. This brush is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The bristles do break off from time to time but not in excess and every time I use it it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m getting a scalp massage which I love. I feel like it&#x27;s even stimulated hair growth!</li>
    <li> Makes my daughter and my hair shine brilliantly.  It is lightweight too, so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver while blow drying.</li>
    <li> It was fine and nice for the first few times that I used the hairbrush. But, after those uses, it just fell apart, basically. Amazon may not be my go to buyer anymore.</li>
    <li> Great brush for a great price!</li>
    <li> Good quality and feels good on my scalp.  I like the combination of both plastic and bristles.  Decently priced too.</li>
    <li> Love this paddle brush; had a hard time finding a replacement for my own so ordered through amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worst brush from goody. Cheap wood that you can get a splinter from. Bristles were all falling out. Really stiff and painful to brush. I contacted Goody, they said that they didn&#x27;t make this brush.</li>
    <li> I found that I was brushing  my hair too hard after getting this brush. It works really well.</li>
    <li> The only place that I could find this brush! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Great partner of Blowdryer for hair straightening.</li>
