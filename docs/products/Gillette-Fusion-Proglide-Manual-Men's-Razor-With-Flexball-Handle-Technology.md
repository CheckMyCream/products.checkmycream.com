<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors before. I used a Mach 3 for years after they sent me my first razor for free when I turned 18. So using a Gillette razor again was a welcomed test! I was very pleased! Before buying this product you should know it is way better than your old Mach 3, and destroys the cheapy disposables. I currently use Harry&#x27;s Razors and shave cream. I shave every day for work. I&#x27;m definitely no stranger to a razor! I&#x27;ve used everything in the past. Every major brand of manual razor and a few electrics thrown in there too. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Harry&#x27;s so I figured why not change it up and see what these new Gillette Proglide razors have to offer?  I tried the Proglide Razor, which came with four cartridges, and the Proglide Shave Gel. Gillette even sent me the bundle FREE to try as a promotion! Total Score!  The new Gillette Proglide Razor and Shave gel  feel great on my skin. I loved the cool feeling the shave Gel left on my face after the shave. I usually like shave creams and dont enjoy the gels. This one was different. I liked it a lot. Comparing it to the different products I&#x27;ve used in the past, it is right up there with the best. Nivea for Men, Schick Hydro, and Harry&#x27;s Shave cream are all currently sitting on my counter. As far as the gels go, this one gives a cooler, more refreshing shave than Nivea or Schick. It definitely works and it is easy to clean up too.  Regarding the razors and the shave itself, it is as close to perfect as I&#x27;ve ever had from a manual, multi-razor cartridge system. Though I thought it was a gimmick at first, the rotating head really does make a difference! It is more forgiving and it makes for a really smooth shave! The razors themselves are great quality and I dont think I could ask for more! I&#x27;ve used Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s, Shick Hydro&#x27;s, Harry&#x27;s and cheap disposables recently. The Proglide might be the best shaving cartridges of the bunch. The razors are sharp, dont snag or cut, and are spaced well enough to clean them off without a lot of clog ups. I really like these things and am considering making a switch. My wife likes the smooth skin too!  Regarding the Shave Gel, I will say that it is my favorite gel I have found, and I will probably go out and buy more when I am finished with this bottle. I definitely would recommend it to anyone wanting a clean, fresh shave gel. It does everything you want it to do and isn&#x27;t even messy! 5 stars for the Gel itself.  I would definitely recommend the Gillette Proglide razors to anyone looking for a good manual cartridge razor. I&#x27;ll also probably reevaluate what razors to buy once my current surplus dwindles down. I think I even saw a coupon around here somewhere for Proglide cartridges...</li>
    <li> I am used to shave with a 2 blades razor and foam.... so trying the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor and gel was a revolution! Its 5 blades and its FlexBall Technology made shaving something natural! You fell almost nothing! The foam I was using left a smell on me pretty strong and left my skin pretty rough, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive 2-in-1 Shave Gel smell good and my skin is smooth after shaving! Glad I was chosen to try this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Kits for free by BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> Amazing gel! Very cool to the skin and has great lingering aftershave-like aroma. Flexball is great and quick; makes it easier to maneuver around the skin without worrying about cutting too sharp and causing a cut. I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Gillette but it really is a great product, if anything itll cut down your stress and time when shaving! I tried the &amp;#34;Alpine Clean&amp;#34; gel and loved it.</li>
    <li> great deal ever that you can make for such item</li>
    <li> One of the best razors and gels on the market. Razors provide a close shave and the gel leaves your skin feeling smooth. Gel container does not leave a mess due to the twist nozzle. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> So I have been using the Gillette Active Sport Shave Gel for few weeks now and it&#x27;s not bad.  While using the Active Sport Shave Gel, the first thing I noticed was the smell. Even though it says that it will prevent past-use goo, I noticed some. It was definitely less than other brands I have used. The one feature i am impressed with was that the Gillette Active Sport Shave Gel came with a gel gauge. This is such a helpful feature. It tells me how much I have left and when I need to go buy another one. Having a plastic canister is an excellent idea. I hated it when I saw rust on my shave gel container. It made me not want to use the shave gel at all.</li>
    <li> I received the proglide gel and razor through a promotion from bzz agent and boy was i impressed! At first glance, people may shy away from the sheer price, however the razor lasts quite a long time. In my case it lasted several weeks without a hitch! Still shaved smoothly after many uses and i do not have a baby face. The gel complimented so well, and in its own right goes on smoothly. You dont have to apply too much either, the gel spreads out easily. A cool feeling indeed. The after feel when completing the shave is amazing - I feel fresh and ready for action whether its at work or a night on the town!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with 2-in-1 ShaveGel for free to review, as a BzzAgent Attowan516.  I use an electric razor most of the time but tried the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor, and wow what a difference! I now love the difference of the shave. The closeness of the shave without the razor burns from an electric shaved, the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor has actually changed the way I shave now and use it now instead of my electric razor for a nice close shave from a razor. Thank you Gillette, you have made me a believer once again with a razor from pure protection!</li>
    <li> Looks like, as with a lot of other people here, I received this through BzzAgent.  It&#x27;s not a bad razor.  I like it, it&#x27;s got a nice weight to it, it comes in a decent packaging, and does what it needs to do --- shave my face closely.  The problem is the price.  I wasn&#x27;t aware it&#x27;s $28 for four blades, a razor and some shaving cream.  For a subscription pack that seems pretty pricey, especially when other companies like Harry&#x27;s and Dollar Shave club are around.  I personally use Harry&#x27;s, and while the ProGlide feels pretty good in the hand, I don&#x27;t think the cost is justified over something simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, there is a close shave, and I don&#x27;t get any razor burn with this razor.  The gel is something I would never touch again, as I felt it was relatively useless when shaving in the shower.  It didn&#x27;t lather very well, made my face more difficult to shave, and overall just felt pretty useless.  Though I must say that I never use shaving gels and any that I have gotten as gifts I have tried and instantly said &amp;#34;Meh. Someone else want this?&amp;#34; So it&#x27;s not necessarily an indictment on THIS particular gel, just in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, the blade is good, it lasts about the same as any other razor I&#x27;ve used.  The handle is comfortable, the head flexes back and forth though I don&#x27;t see there to be much use to that, and it&#x27;s in an easy to open package. I can&#x27;t complain about anything except the gel and the cost.  If you can get it cheaper than competitor&#x27;s, by all means grab it!  Otherwise it&#x27;s just another razor in the crowd.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be given this product as part of a promotion and each time it has happened, I haven&#x27;t been let down. The first thing that drew me to this product was the packaging. I was tired of the metal canisters that would inevitably rust after one use. Secondly, I really liked how it had a locking mechanism on the front to prevent the gel from pooling up on the outside.  To being my shave, I followed protocol and sprayed some on my hand. Immediately after it touched my skin, I could instantly feel the cooling formula. I spread some on my face and started shaving. I felt the cooling sensation throughout the entire shave and it made a difference. Once I rinsed, the soothing aspect kicked in and it felt like I put moisturizer on. I do not think my face has ever felt that way and maybe that is why I was so impressed. My wife was skeptical that I simply shaved and even accused me of putting something on afterwards. In the end, my face exactly how I would want it to after a shave.</li>
    <li> I would first like to disclose that I obtained this product for free from the company.    As a black male who normally suffers from razor bumps when I shave with anything other than an electric shaver, I was hoping this product would be different.  Although the electric shaver works well for my purposes, it still does not give as close a shave as a razor.  Therefore, I was excited to try a new shaving product, which I received free as part of promotion from  gillette. To give a fair assessment of the product, I used it  several times before I wrote this review of the product.  I wanted to give an unbiased review that is just not based on the initial use.  Advantages 1. It gives a really close shave 2. Skin feels really smooth right after shaving 3. While shaving, the product is so smooth, it really doesn&#x27;t feel as if I was shaving.  Disadvantages 1. As a black male, after a few days I started to develop razor bumps again.  Although it was mild, the irritation on my skin was annoying. 2. I have a chin strap, and with the proglide, it is difficult to line up my chin strap beard evenly.  All in all, it is a good product for people who normally do not suffer from razor bumps and who do not have a chin strap.  As for me, I would not give up on my electric shaver completely, I may use this product once in a while, when I want a really close shave.</li>
    <li> this has to be one of the best razors and gel for shaving. you don&#x27;t feel the hair pulling from your skin. it is amazing and you wouldn&#x27;t be sorry if you try it.. I promise you.</li>
    <li> First I must disclose I received a free sample of this product. I&#x27;ve been shaving over 35 years and this is the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s thick and spreads smoothly and evenly. Only a small amount is required. Combine that with the nice ocean breeze scent, no drip no rust can, and monitoring gauge on the can to tell how much is left and you have a real winner. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Got this bundle from Gillette to try out!. This pair is a great combo to control your out of control beard, if thats the case. The razor is a great choice to get all the small spots and the gel helps this. The flexible nature of the razor gives a really close shave. The gel gives a great scent and the can does not drip, which is a nice addition. Great product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent reviewer, I was given the Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care, Alpine Clean product free to try. Such a long name, let&#x27;s break it down:    \\&quot;Fusion ProGlide\\&quot;    Gillette&#x27;s flagship cartridge razors bears this name. Its the best they put out so any product they put out with these two words will command top dollar. This shave gel is no exception. Comparing prices at the major retailers this particular 2-in-1 gel goes for ~$.80/oz to $1.00/oz -. Pretty much any other shaving gel I&#x27;ve found retails for half that at most. Can this product be twice as good as any competing major brand product?    \\&quot;2-in-1\\&quot;    There&#x27;s no visual proof that there is two of anything in this can. I&#x27;d be more apt to believe the 2-in-1 aspect if the gel came out of the can like a two-part epoxy or something.    \\&quot;Gel\\&quot;    I decided to forgo shaving gels a couple years ago opting instead for a shaving brush &amp; cream combo. So it was interesting going back to the more mainstream approach of shaving. I forget how effective and time saving it was. This gel went on smooth and lathered well. Aside from the overly wordy marketing, I do like this product. I personally wouldn&#x27;t pay the premium price for it but it is quite effective.    \\&quot;+ Skin Care\\&quot;    This is where I am a little perplexed. I don&#x27;t quite know what Gillette is claiming here. Is this an alternative to using an aftershave lotion? Then call it a lotion. If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;ve yet to see it printed on any material. If, instead this is just another moisturizing gel, let&#x27;s just call it what it is. The Skin Care aspect is quite confusing to me.    \\&quot;Alpine Clean\\&quot;    I opted for the Alpine scent and I enjoy using the product. The scent is nothing new - much the same as any HBA product with any snow-related term in the fragrance name- Alpine, Glacier, Arctic Freeze, Permafrost- whatever. I tend to opt for a more subtle fragrance but choose to mix it up a little when selecting this. Regardless, while the fragrance is rather strong during application I found that the smell did not linger at all.    So, take it for what it is - A great, effective product from a reliable brand at an inflated cost but buy it on closeout or on double coupon days.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BZZ for letting me try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the razor and the gel. They would work really good but one problem I had was during shaving the corners of the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro-glide is really good the movement and of the blade is really good, it shaves really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is good I used the active version of it and it is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only concern is regarding the price.</li>
    <li> As a Bzz Agent, I got a chance to test drive the &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel+Skin Care&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really impressive stuff (despite the really long, yet informative name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it provides the smoothest shave ever, as you might expect from Gillette. But it goes further.&lt;br /&gt;It takes care of many of the &amp;#34;little things&amp;#34; that are often overlooked in such a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Extra tidy: the dispenser prevents the typical accumulation of &amp;#34;shave goo&amp;#34; at the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;2) Extra secure: the nozzle can be locked for travel, so there aren&#x27;t any messy surprises in your luggage if it gets bumped in transit.&lt;br /&gt;3) No guesswork: it comes with a built-in &amp;#34;gel-level&amp;#34; gauge, showing how much you have left in the rust-free dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to shave very quickly, after a four-day non-shaving binge, with a new blade and still NO NICKS!&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff! Seriously.</li>
    <li> Very good, and the price it great, you getting the shave creamer for free!</li>
    <li> Best Razor for modern face</li>
    <li> Like the razor but replacement blades are expensive! Found this seemed like good deal very happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to using a manual razor, but I generally reach for my electric razor most days. Having received this kit as a promotion to try for free, I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with the razor&#x27;s performance and quality feeling. The handle is very well balanced, and feels very comfortable in hand. The blades provide an excellent shave with no tug right up to the end of life on the blades. I used this every morning for a work week, and it wasn&#x27;t until Friday that I even started to experience a slight tug. That&#x27;s with incredibly thick, wiry, bristles (I could probably use my face in place of sandpaper while woodworking). The shave gel provides an excellent shave medium, great cooling sensation, and foams up to a nice, rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I docked a star was because I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the scent of the shave gel. This is strictly down to personal preference, and some people might like it, while others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product, and have recommended to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Sensitive 2+1 Shave Gel/Skin Care from Gillette and tried it.  Just when you think Gillette can&#x27;t improve upon a shave product, they manage to find a way.  This product solves all of the problems associated with shave gel cans.  It eliminates excess gel from leaking from the nozzle because it has a twistable cap which closes the nozzle opening.  The can is made of plastic so there is no unsanitary rust. There is a gauge which indicates how much gel is left.  And that&#x27;s just the can.  The gel is thicker than any gel I&#x27;ve tried which makes for the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The skin conditioners leave my skin smoother than it has ever been before.  I don&#x27;t know any man who would describe shaving as &amp;#34;enjoyable&amp;#34; but Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Sensitive 2+1 Shave Gel/Skin Care makes the experience as enjoyable as it can be.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit especially knowing how much a single razor and shaving cream are separately great value and awesome product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time Gillette razor/cartridge user.  I received this set free from Gillette.  Getting a close shave is something I am willing to pay a little extra for.  I typically view their biggest value improvements being when they issue a new cartridge/blade but was pleasantly surprised with the flexball technology.  I don think the shave is more efficient as the blades contour the face more effectively. Overall the shave is probably the same in terms of closeness since it is the same blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the shave gel, I am not a regular user of gilette or other &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; shaving gels/creams. I find that they don&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as I get with the shave lotion I switched to several years ago. This pro-glide gel is no exception.  While my skin did feel softer after the shave, the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow was much more pronounced when using this new gel and therefore I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome products, the shave gel smells amazing and is really good for sensitive skin. The razor is super easy to shave with and gives a clean shave. Thank you Bzzagent and Gillette for letting me try this product for free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also a BzzAgent reviewer.  They sent me the razor and the shave gel (I have Alpine Clean) and I promised to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the gel - I think Gillette has done some actually innovative things with their latest ProGlide shave gel.  The gel itself works great - I have sensitive skin and the gel protects against razor burn and bumps.  The &amp;#34;Alpine Clean&amp;#34; is also quite refreshing.  However, the can is where they have solved some problems that have bugged me for years -&lt;br /&gt;1. No mess - the cap twists to either an &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; setting.  It can be cleaned completely with a little water.  So there&#x27;s no mess of shave gel all over the can the next time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Plastic can - that&#x27;s right, no rusty mess if you leave it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;3. Gel gauge - a see-through way to know how much is left.  So cool!  We really do live in the future!&lt;br /&gt;The gel is really a nice product.  It works well, and Gillette really has done a good job to try and make shaving better with this gel and its packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the razor.  I was actually a FlexBall customer before getting the free razor from BzzAgent.  My daily driver is not the simple model that comes in this kit (though I have one of these too), but instead is the Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Power.  Basically, it&#x27;s like this one, but has a battery and a tiny motor that buzzes the razor while you shave.  I first saw the &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34; at the store, with the little display that moves the razor back and forth on the little moving piece of plastic.  My initial thought was &amp;#34;That&#x27;s silly. Nobody has a face like that&amp;#34;.  But when I needed a new razor I figured I would try it.  I&#x27;ve used Fusion razors for some time so I decided to put the marketing to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does work.  That razor stays on your face no matter what.  I get a closer shave with a blade than I&#x27;ve ever gotten before.  I do find myself slowing down a bit while shaving to make sure ittracks completely, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  It&#x27;s a nice improvement to a good product.</li>
    <li> change razor or gel get Gillette® Fusion ProGlide Razor&amp;2-in-1 Shave Gel it is safety and soft skin and Never had problems i get free sample from buzzagent.com</li>
    <li> Good product and gives me enjoyable shaves.  I still like cream vs gel, but would recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;It isn’t hard to get the feeling that Gillette is constantly trying to invent false reasons to sell you upgraded, transformed, and suspiciously better but certainly pricier shaving products. But as far as I’m concerned, they can go on doing that so long as they keep selling disposables. Gillette’s older top of the line products from the late ’90s is still available, affordable, and better overall at balancing performance and price than any of its competitors&lt;br /&gt;I do like the latest but not enough to justify the cost.  The older technology still works almost as well.  I received the products as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Pro Glide no mess shaving cream is awesome. There&#x27;s no mess and my face feels amazing after. I recommend this to any man thats looking for a mess free shave with a fresh feeling after. I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor and shaving cream from the manufacturer as part of a promotion. The razor is truly as superb as everyone else claims it to be and does offer an extremely close shave while being easy to control on different facial contours. With the shaving cream, an even closer shave can be found. The shaving cream has a cooling effect which raises hairs to allow for a better shave. However, it does have a lot of &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; to it that is hard to wash off and does have a certain taste to it... Be aware of that.  A big pro that i did notice is that the can doesn&#x27;t leave a rust ring in the shower. That is a big plus in my book for container improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product and really allows you to get in the hard areas with ease.</li>
    <li> I recently had a chance to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide kit through a promotion from Gillette. The first thing I notice was the presentation( see pic), I really appreciate a company for going all in on a very nice product presentation and Gillette doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised how close of a shave I am getting, the blades are top notch they are very sturdy with just the right amount of give to hug your face. The handles ball joint is very innovative it makes shaving a breeze. The shaving gel took a little time for me to get use to simply because I&#x27;ve been using various low-tier creams and gels. This gel put them all to shame and being a 2 in 1 you get added moisturizers which for my dry skin is much needed. The kit is perfect for someone who is looking for a better shave experience, the kit includes a handle with 4 replacement blades and the 2 in 1 shaving gel. This is also a subscription service so you can chose from three different plans for blade replacements, there are at least eight different vendors to select from such as amazon and target to name a couple, and with a delivery frequency anywhere from 1 to 6 months. I know you&#x27;re wondering about cost....well I found the cost to range from $15 to $30 depending on the vendor and the amount of blades you select( between 4 to 16). For me personaly Amazon.com had the best price for a 4 blade replacement at $15.17 after a 5% subsription discount, I would highly recemmend this kit, I&#x27;m paying anywhere from $2 to $3 less for blades than buying them in the store and having them shipped to me on my schedule is great.</li>
    <li> I got to try the fusion proglinde for free thinks to gillette.  I will now never use a nother razor again. This razor does a great close shave. Makes my skin so soft and smooth. My wife tells me how much she loves how smooth my face feels. If you&#x27;re looking for a new razor you have got to try the fusion proglinde</li>
    <li> At first when I saw it, I thought it was just going to be like all the other shaving gels out there. But I was wrong. I just loved this shaving gel. It makes my skin feel smooth. And It smells amazingly good.And the razor works surprisingly well! I will definitely be buying this shaving gel and razor from now on! Absolutely wonderful stuff! I would recommend this to every one! I received this product for free to try from BzzAgent.com.</li>
    <li> As I BzzAgent I recieved a sample of this in the Ocean Breeze scent.  Wow!  Gillette has done it again.  I got a close shave and smoothe skin.  My girl liked it so much she stole bothe the razor and the gel for her legs.  It handled both my beard and her legs with no problems.  Gillette Fusion Pro- Glide 2-in-1 Gel and the razor are worth the purchase!!</li>
    <li> This combo razor and 2-in-1 shave gel is fantastic!  I am especially thrilled with the shave gel and its dispenser.  The dispenser allows you to monitor how much gel you have remaining and FINALLY provides a means for mess-free gel storage - no more caps coated in film and gel!  The gel has a great scent and leaves my skin feeling smooth and not irritated.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Sensitive 2+1 Shave Gel/Skin Care from Gillette in Alpine scent along with a Fusion Pro-Glide Razor.  The Alpine scent feels fresh and clean, and their new packaging includes a see-through Gel gauge that lets you see how much gel is left. This is much better that the old cans where you&#x27;d discover you&#x27;re out just as you&#x27;re about to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-Glide manual razor with the articulating head navigates easily around the contours of my face.  It&#x27;s similar to the razor I&#x27;ve used for the last eight months.  Last July I switched from being a long time 3-blade user to a 5-blade Pro-Glide Power razor and received the smoothest shaves in my life. (comparable to a straight razor at the barber).  The only downside is the blades lose their edge eventually and the cost of refills can add up.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. I hate trying so many different products to not make my neck so itchy and red afterwards. This has been the best cream I have found. It smells good and leaves my skin feeling smooth and barely irritated. Very happy with it. I am happy I got to try it for free thanks to Gilette</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Sensitive 2+1 Shave Gel/Skin Care from Gillette and tried it. Gillette can&#x27;t manage to find a way to improve their product. This product solves all of the problems associated with shave gel cans. It eliminates excess gel from leaking from the nozzle because it has a twistable cap which closes the nozzle opening. There is a gauge which indicates how much gel is left. And that&#x27;s just the can. Quality wise amazing gel . Very cool to the skin and has great lingering aftershave-like aroma. Flexball is great and quick; makes it easier to maneuver around the skin without worrying about cutting too sharp and causing a cut. I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Gillette but it really is a great product.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Sensitive 2+1 Shave Gel/Skin Care and razor with FlexBall Technology to review from BzzAgent and got a chance to try it out and here is what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I have a couple of electric razors so I don&#x27;t often use the traditional razor with shaving cream unless I need a close shave or I have let my facial hair grow out for to long and when I do use a razor I go with the cheap plain shaving cream and off brand triple blade razors, NEVER AGAIN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what a difference!  The FlexBall razor is amazing!  I saw the commercials and thought it was just a gimmick, I was wrong.  I love how this thing tracks every contour of my face.  It doesn&#x27;t pull like the cheap razors even when I have let my facial hair grow out for a few days.  It doesn&#x27;t leave razor burns on my neck and it is sooooo close and smooth that I can go 2 days without shaving.  I am so sold on this razor I threw all the rest of my cheap disposables away because I just can&#x27;t bring myself to use them again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care, the design of the container is great, Gillette has put a lot of thought into putting a great product into a great package!  As others have said, no rust, no mess and you know when you need to buy another can instead of suddenly realizing I am out and have to make a little dob stretch across my entire face.  The Gel is amazing, I can say this because I tried the razor with my old cheap shaving cream the 2nd time using the razor and there is no comparison, non what so ever!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the razor is still great even with cheap shaving cream but how my skin feels after is night and day.  I usually have to use lotion on my face after I shave but not with Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold, sold and sold.  I using my coupon and going to buy some refills and saving my electric for those days when I wake up late and don&#x27;t have the time to give myself a proper baby smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift; I prefer an electric razor, however, I was intrigued by the new technology. The razor is great, delivering a smooth shave all over my face. I especially liked the single blade trimming blade on the back. This led to some experimentation on my part. I shaved one day with the multi-blade side and got a great shave; I shaved the next day with the single blade and also got a great shave. My conclusion is that the cartridges are over-engineered and over-priced.  The fusion 2-in-1 shave gel was great, but only for a few days. the fancy dispenser quit working and I had to throw away the bulk of the product. As a result, my conclusion is good product but poor engineering.</li>
    <li> I also received a free sample of this item. They sent me the razor and the shave gel, and I promised to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel - I think they have instituted some nice adjustment with their latest Gillette ProGlide shave gel. The gel works wonders - I have sensitive skin and the gel protects against razor burn and bumps.  The gel is thicker than any gel I&#x27;ve tried which makes for a much smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;1. No mess - the cap twists to either an &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; setting. It can be cleaned completely with a little water. Eliminating the mess of shave gel all over. 2. Plastic can - Amazing that there is no rusty mess if you leave it in the shower. 3. Consumption meter- a see-through way to know how much is left, better than shaking the can or guesstimating how much you have left in the tank. The gel is great!. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and Gillette has done a good job to try and make shaving simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a current FlexBall customer even before getting the free razor from BzzAgent. the FlexBall i use is not the entry level model that comes in this kit, it&#x27;s the Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Power. The functionality is similar to this one, however it has a battery and a tiny motor that buzzes the razor while you shave, which Gillette says helps raise your facial hairs for an easier shave. I have had no complaints with this model, and really do recommend this to everyone. The functionality is excellent and i am a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> So I got this free sample of Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care from Gillette via BzzAgent. I did shave with it, and yes it did fell really good while shaving. Then I looked at what they put in the can and WOW! I would never buy this product! Never! Here are just a few on the listed ingredients in the shave gel:&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine; that chemical is considered a moderate hazard ingredient by the Cosmetics Database, which notes as concerns. According to Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics, and the U.S. National Library of Medicine, there is strong evidence that Triethanolamine is a human skin, immune system and respiratory toxicant. One or more animal studies show sense organ effects at very low doses, especially when used around the mouth, eyes and lips, and one or more in vitro tests on mammalian cells show positive mutation results. It has been shown to cause bladder and liver cancer, as well as changes in testicles. Careful men, I did say testicles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isopentane is a hydrocarbon, it is extremely volatile and extremely flammable liquid. I guess it is really needed in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isobutane is also known as R-600a; a refrigerant for an AC system, it has been known to explode in refrigerators. It’s cool to use I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEG 90M and 23M. Pollutants found in various PEG compounds include ethylene oxide (used to manufacture mustard gas), 1,4-dioxane, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and heavy metals (lead, iron, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, arsenic). Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol! Ahh… Glycol. This is the chemical used every winter as an aircraft deicer. I can only think of one thing good about this substance! It keeps water from freezing in winter so your plane does not ice up going down the runway at 180mph. Other than that it is a pretty nasty substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butyrospermum can be bad if you suffer from tree nut allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer; I don’t know what this is, I’d have to do a little research on it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green 3 and Blue 1 are basically food coloring. Do we really care what color our shave gel is? I sure don’t. It is most likely made with Propylene Glycol (see above) but I am not 100% sure. Coloring in my shave cream is about as useless as the “fragrance” they add to it..  Green 3 and Blue 1 are basically food coloring. Do we really care what color our shave gel is? I sure don’t. It is most likely made with Propylene Glycol (see above) but I am not 100% sure. Coloring in my shave cream is about as useless as the “fragrance” they add to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and shave gel combination.  I received this item for free for the purpose of my review.  The razor glides smoothly over my face and neck with no nicks or cuts.  I have to shave almost every day and this razor makes it so much easier.  The shave gel smells great too, which is good since you use it so close to your nose.  Great product, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide razor, I got the razor and shaving gel to try from Bzzagent as a part of promotion a few weeks back and was thoroughly impressed. The razor was my favorite of the bundle its sleek and glides smoothly on my skin. I find myself using the cheap razors or electric ones but this razor has certainly converted me. A close shave and no cut....winning! The shaving gel worked wonders too It left my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these ProGlides. They give me a much closer shave compared to my older fusion power cartridges. They look narrower compared to the older Gillete fusion power cartridges at first glance, but the width is exactly the same and it&#x27;s a little shorter than the older model.  The cartridges are interchangeable between the older Gillete fusion power handle and the newer proglide handle. I can do just one pass ALONG the grain and get good results - this means a lot because I have extremely thick and fast-growing hair, and I usually have to do two to three passes to get a close shave. The blades seem to bend a bit more and there&#x27;s sort of a serrated/furrowed thing (not sharp) at the bottom which I think is used to guide and align the hairs better. They&#x27;re a tad bit on the pricey side, but other than that I really, really like these. Would have given them five stars if they were a little cheaper.  I have received this item to test from bzzagent</li>
    <li> I recently relieved a sample pack that included a flex ball razor and a can of shaving gel from gillete.  At first I thought I would try the gel once and then just keep the razor.  I was so wrong.  What a terrific Shave.  I used the razor with flex ball technology and it contoured perfectly to my face for a really smooth shave.Combined with my new addition of the 2 in 1 gel what a difference.  I used to never like shave gel as they didn&#x27;t perform as expected.  I would still end up with razor burn and my face feeling worse that before I shaved.  What a difference the 2 in 1 gel made to my shave.  My face was smooth and the tingling sensation after the shave is great.  On top of how great it makes my face feel, the can is plastic so I can leave it in the shower or on the counter and not have to worry if it gets wet so it doesn&#x27;t leave a ring of rust.</li>
    <li> I received a can of the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide 2 in 1 shave gel in a trial offer and have to say WOW! I have never had a shave that has been this close and left my face feeling so good! The scent was perfect, not to strong but not to weak. The can is made of plastic and there is no oozing of gel after you use it. I am able to toss the can back into my gym bag right after I use it and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting gel on all my stuff! I highly recommend this gel. It is worth the cost if you find joy in a good shave.</li>
    <li> I have seen no difference in any of the multi-blade razors. So I am only commenting on the sensitive 2-in-1 shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the menthol ingredient gives a little tingling sensation when you first put it on. Not in a bad way. But like how Head &amp; Shoulders momentarily makes you wonder if your head is on fire. And then you&#x27;re okay with it because you assume it is just burning away bad, dirty things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the number one feature of this product is that the canister has a PLASTIC BOTTOM. It took decades for manufacturer&#x27;s to acknowledge that metal canisters quickly rust and leave unsightly (and often unremovable) brown/orange rings all over your bathroom. Gotta hand it to the boys in the lab for recognizing that the future is in plastics.</li>
