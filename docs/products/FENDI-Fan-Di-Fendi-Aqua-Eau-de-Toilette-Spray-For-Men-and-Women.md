      <li>Top of the line high fashion buy.</li>
      <li>Ladies like it very much!</li>
      <li>The very first morning I applied Fan Di Fendi, I was walking in midtown Manhattan.</li>
      <li>The sprying valve looks damaged and the smell is not similar to the original which I still own.</li>
      <li>The latest Zegna UOMO is the only better &amp;#34;designer alternative&amp;#34; in my opinion to this cologne, but for a bit more mature guys.  </li>
      <li>And he absolutely loves it!!</li>

      <li>And use responsibly!</li>
      <li>Not ten minutes after that, another young lady approached me with love in her eyes!</li>
      <li>God, this is the most amazing cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn!&amp;#34; I was somewhat chagrined though, when I noticed first, that these two ladies were also approaching other men, and they then scattered when an NYPD patrol car pulled up to the curb!</li>
      <li>he absolutely loves it as well</li>
      <li>he is military and very anal about what he wears but he fell in love with the cologne as well this cologne cost about $80 at</li>
      <li>I thought this was true to it&#x27;s product, the smell don&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>Overall - not bad.</li>
      <li>I definitely think its worth the $50 though.</li>
      <li>this is just as good if not better than the regular fendi fandi.  </li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to smell this cologne before hand at my local Dillard&#x27;s but $80 was a bit much</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t advice this perfume who are expecting anything loud smelling perfume coz</li>
      <li>So, If you don&#x27;t mind/like aquatic scents with a few sweet vibes, you will like this scent on you.</li>

    <li> best new cologne lasts all day gets alof of attention.  this is just as good if not better than the regular fendi fandi.  i wish it came in 6.7 oz because i would buy it in a heart beat</li>
    <li> Have been using it and I like it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it arrived at my door quickly! Hands down the best scent for men! It&#x27;s both his and my favorite cologne for him! And of course he loved it too</li>
    <li> The sprying valve looks damaged and the smell is not similar to the original which I still own. Carefull when buyin from DiscountPerfumes.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I so love the way this smells! My girlfriend loves her Valentine&#x27;s gift!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to smell this cologne before hand at my local Dillard&#x27;s but $80 was a bit much I definitely think its worth the $50 though.</li>
    <li> Perfect! This is my second time purchasing this cologne. The first time I purchased it for my boyfriend for Christmas 2014. And he absolutely loves it!! he is about 6 foot 4/ 230 pounds and when he walks in the room everyone notices. I also bought this cologne for my brother this year for his birthday he absolutely loves it as well he is military and very anal about what he wears but he fell in love with the cologne as well this cologne cost about $80 at Macy&#x27;s this is the best quality Cologne you can get at this price hands down. Top of the line high fashion buy. Take it from a marketing fashion expert &amp; nope I don&#x27;t work for amazon. This is real life! Lol</li>
    <li> This in my opinion is the best fragrance FENDI has on the market today. And it&#x27;s a summer aquatic type, a bit on a sweeter side. Comapare it to let&#x27;s say L&#x27;eau par Kenzo (water&amp;lemon) this one is more potent and with better longevity and projection. The latest Zegna UOMO is the only better &amp;#34;designer alternative&amp;#34; in my opinion to this cologne, but for a bit more mature guys.  Overall - not bad. Not bad at all. So, If you don&#x27;t mind/like aquatic scents with a few sweet vibes, you will like this scent on you.</li>
    <li> I hv gifted this perfume to my hubby. The perfume smells good but isn&#x27;t last longing. I wouldn&#x27;t advice this perfume who are expecting anything loud smelling perfume coz this one is very subtle.</li>
    <li> Light and aquatic.  You will get many compliments when you wear this.  This fragrance lasts only about 4 hours and then becomes a skin scent.</li>
    <li> the smell does not last like a cheap one!!</li>
    <li> Great shipping speed. Love the product!</li>
    <li> Fendi did well with this product. It sticks well when used and helps announce that &#x60;I have arrived&#x60; (LOL!!!)...sounds vain but what can i say? I have definitely found my soul mate.</li>
    <li> The very first morning I applied Fan Di Fendi, I was walking in midtown Manhattan. Within just a few minutes I was approached by an attractive young woman who seemed very interested in being with me! Not ten minutes after that, another young lady approached me with love in her eyes! I thought to myself &amp;#34;My God, this is the most amazing cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn!&amp;#34; I was somewhat chagrined though, when I noticed first, that these two ladies were also approaching other men, and they then scattered when an NYPD patrol car pulled up to the curb! Hey you know? I prefer to think that yes - it was me that targeted their interest, and of course, my irresistable Fan Di Fendi Pour Homme Acqua! Enjoy my friends! And use responsibly!</li>
    <li> Second time I buy this cologne.  Ladies like it very much!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son I had smelled a sample from Ulta and loved it had to buy it my son loves it and it smells great on him :)</li>
    <li> I thought this was true to it&#x27;s product, the smell don&#x27;t last. It like water with coloring it. I was very disappointed with this product. This is a waist of your money.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great price, shipped very fast</li>
    <li> nice gift for any enthusiast.</li>
