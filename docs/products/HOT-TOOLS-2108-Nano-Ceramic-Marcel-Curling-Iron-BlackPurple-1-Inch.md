      <li>No too good</li>
      <li>I had this one before and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I find for my thinner hair, that it&#x27;s best to quickly use the iron rather than hold onto it for seconds after seconds.</li>

      <li>The iron works great, however the purple coating is easily scratched off if put into a metal holder, wish the coating was thicker or stronger.</li>
      <li>I love a good marcel iron and this one has a great weight, it&#x27;s easy to use-</li>
      <li>I think the 1\\&quot; barrel is probably the best all-around size</li>
      <li>Just what I wanted very satisfied customer, I love it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s also light weight which is good.</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this iron!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s okay, to be honest I like my babybliss  better</li>
      <li>Hot tools works great..</li>
      <li>This was my very first marcel and I absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>I love how it leaves my hair feeling.  </li>
      <li>Love the color too.</li>
      <li>This took some getting used to, but I really love it.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>So after I returned it, I bought the T3 marcel 1inch and I like it better.</li>
      <li>I always keep to unlock for easier use and more flowing curls</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t able to handle the iron.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a keeper for sure.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>With the Nano I&#x27;m not so sure, but it&#x27;s extremely cute.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute, but I should have ordered the gold one because it gets hotter.</li>
      <li>I love this iron.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>and I love how it handles.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product, but you need to note that it is not &#x27;spring loaded&#x27;</li>
      <li>Love mine.</li>
      <li>I got MUCH better results.  </li>
      <li>I do much better with the InStyler rotating curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>more than anything.  </li>
      <li>it is not spring-loaded like most curling irons - but I bought it because my hairdresser uses one just like it</li>
      <li>But I an absolutely in love with it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
      <li>Loved this iron for the first couple of months, and then I noticed that the coating was coming off on the underside of the clip.</li>
      <li>- this is an excellent curling iron, gets nice and hot - in fact, I only used the halfway point heat setting and that did the job</li>
      <li>I have used this type (professional) for years and this ceramic is a great iron...does not &#x27;stick&#x27; to your hair.  </li>
      <li>But its not as easy as the youtube videos make it.</li>
      <li>This marcel makes beautiful curls that last all day!</li>
      <li>I liked the Hot Tools</li>
      <li>I got my first curling iron over 20 years ago and it was a marcel, so the clippy kind of irons feel like they are pulling out my hair.</li>
      <li>This iron is smooth and heats up very quickly.</li>
      <li>Again, it works fine</li>
      <li>and it truly gives me the best curls that last for days - the first day curls, the next day great waves...</li>
      <li>I love all Hot Tools products!</li>
      <li>Gets nice and hot and curls easily and quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought very high-end and very low-end hairdryers and styling tools, and this has proven to be the absolute best of both worlds.</li>
      <li>I followed all the advise and watched several YouTube videos but could&#x27;t get a great curl with it.</li>
      <li>It takes some getting used to, but overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I make beautiful long ringlets without damage.  </li>
      <li>I love Hot Tools.</li>
      <li>: Heats up quick, smooth operation, long cord, great for salon work..</li>
      <li>The product was delivered as expected and works great.</li>
      <li>and then some - I can imagine needing more intense heat than that was.</li>
      <li>I have better control and don&#x27;t leave it on hair too long because of the better control.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited at first then</li>
      <li>I have used that thing everyday and it has been dropped on the floor over and over and it still works great.</li>
      <li>Ok I am a professional Hairdresser, so that is why I go with a Marcel Iron (for home use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a cosmetologist, but I learned how to use it and my curls look so much more professional.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I am a professional hairstylist and love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>and it arrived right away, so five stars for Amazon too.</li>
      <li>I was right</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t clean your tools with the Hot Tool Cleanser or a gentle soap/water mix, stuff can build up and thus scorch.  </li>
      <li>and it is very fast but does not burn my hair.</li>
      <li>Granted everyone&#x27;s hair is different but my girlfriend and I both love it.</li>
      <li>I get a better easier curl with the Remington Pearl Wand and the curls last for two days on my hair.</li>
      <li>My first time using this style and brand of curling irons.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked the Hot Tools Nano Marcel curing iron. 1 Inch was just perfect for me. This was my very first marcel and I absolutely loved it. I bought it because this is the same curling iron my hair dresser used However, two weeks into using it (probably used it 4 times), the metal piece holding the black handle sheath popped off/broke and the black covering on the handle wouldn&#x27;t stay on so I had to return it. The quality of the plastic parts were not so great. So after I returned it, I bought the T3 marcel 1inch and I like it better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hot Tools Marcel irons for about 25 years and first, I must say, they last FOREVER! The first 10 years I used them I was doing hair professionally and this is only the 4th iron I have purchased in 25 years.  I should mention that the third one I purchased, a Gold Iron, is still working. I only bought this one because I read the reviews on this and decided to treat myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceramic barrel means NO BAKED ON HAIR PRODUCT RESIDUE to clean off!!!! I ordered this iron over 6 months ago for personal use and I use a lot of gel and hairspray on my hair and it is CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up hot and fast. (I use wet towel to cool down before applying to dry hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has safety stand and the swivel cord means it does not get twisted up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like is the &amp;#34;ON light&amp;#34; it is not bright or distinctive enough to notice in a room that is well-lit or with natural lighting. I have become a little OCD with checking that the iron is off because just turning off the bathroom light during the day (we have a skylight) will not get the room dark enough to determine if the iron is off just with the &amp;#34;ON light&amp;#34;. It is easy to see in a dark room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe as a side-note con I could mention that I would much prefer the on/off switch on the cord, less likely to accidentally turn it off or on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is perfect and neither the &amp;#34;ON light&amp;#34; nor the switch placement would not be enough to keep me from recommending it or to keep me from buying one again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this iron! Ok I am a professional Hairdresser, so that is why I go with a Marcel Iron (for home use I would purchase a clamp iron in the same line) In the salon I prefer a Marcel. Heats up lightning quick, smooth turning, easy operation, 1 inch is perfect size for most of the work I do. I also use it for spiral curls (just lock it in place so the barrel will not spin, and don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;clamp&amp;#34; feature).. There are more expensive irons on the market, but they do not justify the price.. The Hot Tools Irons last a long time as well, don&#x27;t waist time or money on more expensive curling irons, this baby will work just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Heats up quick, smooth operation, long cord, great for salon work..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: For home use get a clamp iron in the same line...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several spring loaded curling irons which always ended in lack luster results. After using this Marcel curling iron I was amazed at the beautiful amazing sexy beach curls. I highly recommend this product if you are considering purchasing a curling iron.</li>
    <li> i love this curling iron, however i had to return it due to the size of the barrel on it i was looking for a larger one due to the length of my hair. i have 3 other hot tools and love them all. they have lasted many years through daily use.</li>
    <li> No too good it&#x27;s hard to use. The handle doesn&#x27;t close automatic,&lt;br /&gt;everything is manual you need to open and close it manually</li>
    <li> I love a good marcel iron and this one has a great weight, it&#x27;s easy to use- no complaint.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find a marcel curling iron in stores anymore. I prefer these over I was researching for a while before I decided to try Amazon.  I saw this purple ceramic curling iron and after doing some research on ceramic verse metal, I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  This iron is amazing!!  I love how it leaves my hair feeling.  And it does not need to be wiped constantly like the metal ones.  I would definitely recommend this Marcel curling iron.  BTW - shipping was really fast.  It came within days of me ordering and was actually 1 day earlier than the estimated shipping date..</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought it was.  It is too difficult to use.  Did not realize it didn&#x27;t have a spring.</li>
    <li> tricky to figure.  no instructions</li>
    <li> I love this iron.  Marcels are the best. I have better control and don&#x27;t leave it on hair too long because of the better control.  It curls fast.  I make beautiful long ringlets without damage.  I had this one before and loved it.  Love the color too.</li>
    <li> This took some getting used to, but I really love it.  I like that you can squeeze hard to really hold your hair.  My hair is super straight and slippery, so it&#x27;s hard to get my curls &#x27;started&#x27; on a traditional curling iron.  Now I need to buy other sizes.</li>
    <li> The curling iron arrived broken, it was flimsy and looked like it was a previous return. I returned it immediately and exchanged it for the hot tools&lt;br /&gt;1 1/4 ceramic (black and white) curling iron and I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it best curling iron and I am a hairstylist this is my go to tool no need for anything else</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, to be honest I like my babybliss  better</li>
    <li> The iron works great, however the purple coating is easily scratched off if put into a metal holder, wish the coating was thicker or stronger.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron. I was a little hesitant to purchase it because I haven&#x27;t used a marcel in so long, but its easy to use and worth the purchase</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, but you need to note that it is not &#x27;spring loaded&#x27; so it is better if you have some experience with a similar curling iron or you will be disappointed and frustrated.  I have used this type (professional) for years and this ceramic is a great iron...does not &#x27;stick&#x27; to your hair.  It gets quite hot, so turn it down while you are learning to use it.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have never used a curling iron like this on before and it took a little getting used to with the technique but once you have that down it&#x27;s easy to curl and holds very well. Doesn&#x27;t burn hair or leave it dry, especially if you use a heat protectant first. Would recommend to anyone who wants a salon curl or wave.</li>
    <li> Bought to curl my hair without leaving that dent a normal curling iron does. Takes some practice to use, if you aren&#x27;t used to this type of curling iron. Love mine.</li>
    <li> My first time using this style and brand of curling irons. But I an absolutely in love with it. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used Hot Tools brand curling irons and they have always worked well and lasted a fairly long time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling iron. It lets me control exactly how I want my curls to look. It takes some getting used to, but overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to \\&quot;work\\&quot; it - it is not spring-loaded like most curling irons - but I bought it because my hairdresser uses one just like it and it truly gives me the best curls that last for days - the first day curls, the next day great waves...even the third day can still look cute with a minor touch-up if I am too busy to wash my hair. Truly, I have fine hair and the selections of heat settings allows me to find the best temp to give my hair awesome body. Buy this curling iron!</li>
    <li> Loved this iron for the first couple of months, and then I noticed that the coating was coming off on the underside of the clip. Then it started coming off the barrel. Then the handle came off, the parts keeping it on nowhere to be found. My stylist uses the gold ones and has for years, so I&#x27;ll be switching ASAP.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling tool.  I really only know one technique for the Marcel curling iron, and it works well for me, but it is neat that if you want a styler with added versatility for various curls, this wand will allow you to do that. I have fairly long hair and it is very fast but does not burn my hair.</li>
    <li> Heating control mechanism is located in wrong area and makes it hard to properly work the marcel handle.  Otherwise, product does work well.</li>
    <li> Seriously reconsider buying this item.  It&#x27;s built backwards compared to what us girls are used to using.  Very disappointed. Returned same day it arrived.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever. It takes a minute to figure out but keeps a curl for hours/days. Granted everyone&#x27;s hair is different but my girlfriend and I both love it. She has very fine hair, I have very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have the 1 1/2 in marcel hot tools nano ceramic and have had it for years. I have used that thing everyday and it has been dropped on the floor over and over and it still works great. Everyone asks me how I curl my hair and I tell them the marcel makes a big difference in the longevity of your curls. If your looking for big loose curls go with the bigger 1 1/2, but I got this one for more of a beachy wave and for my daughters hair which is shorter and needs a tighter curl. Hot tools works great..no need to spend double the money for some fancy name brand. Fyi..if you have never used a marcel it takes a couples time to get the hang of it..I burned myself a few times, but they do work so much better than a regular curling iron. Like I said I have had mine for years and its no big deal to use now.</li>
    <li> I was so excited at first then a major let down.  I have had my curling iron less than a month and the handle already broke!</li>
    <li> I have very unruly hair. My hair is thick, long, &amp; naturally curly but unfortunately my curls aren&#x27;t pretty! This marcel makes beautiful curls that last all day! Hot tools is the only brand I can find that gets hot enough &amp; can curl my hair!</li>
    <li> Was great while it lasted. The purple coating peeled off after a few months and then part of the handle broke. I didn&#x27;t even use it daily... Maybe twice a week.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron. It heats up fast, is very comfortable to use and stays hot under heavy use. It&#x27;s a keeper for sure.</li>
    <li> It might have been me but I wasn&#x27;t able to handle the iron. It just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable and I was afraid of burning myself. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot hot hot.  I set it to the highest heat setting for my thin hair, and curl quickly to avoid any damage to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lock/Unlock setting. I always keep to unlock for easier use and more flowing curls&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful curls!! I find for my thinner hair, that it&#x27;s best to quickly use the iron rather than hold onto it for seconds after seconds. This gives that fuller/bouncier look vs. the fake curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No auto turn-off setting. My mistake, but I kept this on for too long and it&#x27;s now broken.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found a marcel iron!</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the box or else I would have returned it. I followed all the advise and watched several YouTube videos but could&#x27;t get a great curl with it. PLUS, the curls wouldn&#x27;t even stay until the end of the day. I have long, healthy, straight hair so maybe that was part of the problem. I get a better easier curl with the Remington Pearl Wand and the curls last for two days on my hair.</li>
    <li> My mediocre rating of this item relates to my admitted &amp;#34;hair disability&amp;#34; more than anything.  I simply lack the manual dexterity to manage the clamping rod and the rotating handle at the same time.  Since the entire curling rod is hot, you can&#x27;t stabilize the end with your free hand while manipulating your hair around it.  I do much better with the InStyler rotating curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;This item did heat up quickly, the heat is adjustable for your type of hair, and it did cool down quickly when you are finished.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st Marcel iron... Never even heard of them before.  I knew I could not do the professional &amp;#34;flat iron as curling iron&amp;#34; trick but saw a YouTube on using Marcel and decided to give it a try.  Traditional irons fry my ends before they deliver any heat to set a style in the rest of my length.  Because Marcel works in reverse (start at roots instead of ends) I got MUCH better results.  I&#x27;ve also tested various tools and determined &amp;#34;tourmaline&amp;#34; truly makes a difference in reducing frizz.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, but I should have ordered the gold one because it gets hotter. Even though it says both of them should reach 430 degrees. With the Nano I&#x27;m not so sure, but it&#x27;s extremely cute. Again, it works fine and it&#x27;s also light weight which is good. I would recommend this product, but I favor the Gold and Hot-Gold Metal Marcel.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. Gets nice and hot and curls easily and quickly. I am a professional hairstylist and love this curling iron.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy one of these as an alternative to the flat iron while on the road and in between washings as a way to touch up my edges while wearing straight hair styles. It does the trick because you can straighten and curl your hair with one tool. Be careful because it does get hot and just like the flat iron you can eventually break your hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best irons out there perfect size for many styles.</li>
    <li> Perfect item &amp; quick shipping! The product was delivered as expected and works great. I prefer it over the gold curling iron they have simply because the ceramic holds the curl longer</li>
    <li> So i got this because i wanted to force myself to learn to use a professional curling iron like the pros. But its not as easy as the youtube videos make it. Practice makes perfert</li>
    <li> ordered Wrong item.  Had a wand thing on it and she didn&#x27;t like it.  . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> The products are great. I love Hot Tools. However, if you&#x27;re a smaller person, with smaller hands - its hard to operate the tool because the handle and the base are too far apart.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted very satisfied customer, I love it. And its my favorite color Thank you looking forward to making future purchases.</li>
    <li> Turns out I was just using crappy curling irons. WOW. What a difference. The ceramic really does make a difference. The iron stays hot and my curls stay curly!&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewer who complained about missing the spring... this is a MARCEL iron. It does not have a spring. I&#x27;m not a cosmetologist, but I learned how to use it and my curls look so much more professional. All I did was search the internet for videos on how to use the iron. It helps a lot and it&#x27;s totally worth it. I highly recommend this iron.</li>
    <li> For anyone out there that is used to marcel curling irons you&#x27;ll know they are somewhat hard to find. If you are not used to marcels there is a learning curve and it may be frustrating to get used to. I got my first curling iron over 20 years ago and it was a marcel, so the clippy kind of irons feel like they are pulling out my hair. This iron is smooth and heats up very quickly. The handle rotates, but has a lock if you prefer it to stay in place. I think I only gave it 4 stars because I have liked other marcel irons I have had in the past better, but this one is definately a good one too.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been slinging hair since 1989 and this is the best electric marcel iron I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve used quite a few over the decades.  My last purchase was another manufacturer whom I would never waste my money or time with as their product failed.  Rubber grips aren&#x27;t supposed to become &#x27;gummy&#x27; like unless the rubber is faulty which in fact those tools were.  My Other HOT TOOLS I&#x27;ve purchased were amazing but didn&#x27;t have the Nano Ceramic technology - those were the gold ones.  The difference is performance and cleaning.  Products do not stick nor scorch on the tool when wiped down properly after usage.  If you don&#x27;t clean your tools with the Hot Tool Cleanser or a gentle soap/water mix, stuff can build up and thus scorch.  The Nano Ceramic tools however don&#x27;t allow product to bake on or build up.  The hair comes out of the marcel iron curled and the cuticle is smoothed and not fried in the appearance.  I recommend this tool in any size.  The 1&amp;#34; is a great over all iron for volume and curls!</li>
    <li> This iron came with no instructions.&lt;br /&gt;The handle does not have a spring, does not lock and I still can&#x27;t manipulate it.&lt;br /&gt;The box suggests getting on line if you have questions.  Not what I expected from a&lt;br /&gt;product described as professional.&lt;br /&gt;No warrentee material.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Little tricky to learn to use with the rotating barrel, but once learned that it was a breeze and produces high heat and quality style.</li>
    <li> Left the Golden Hot marcel I had in England - man did I miss it. Could not find any Marcel curling irons at the local beauty supplies, YES - not even Sally&#x27;s! And coming home I thought Amazon will have what I need. Yep - and this was one of many various types, and the ceramic seemed to be the way to go - I was right - this is an excellent curling iron, gets nice and hot - in fact, I only used the halfway point heat setting and that did the job and then some - I can imagine needing more intense heat than that was. Straightened my hair beatifully with just the curl I needed on my ends! Will be buying the larger 1-1/2 now and the flat iron to complete the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this Hot tool!</li>
    <li> heats up fast and last through the salon beating they take.. hot tools always the best ..this one stays hot through a whole head.</li>
    <li> I love all Hot Tools products! But this one is wonderful. I love that they started making ceramic marcels!! I can furl my thick, long hair in 15 mins. Live saver in the AM.</li>
    <li> First of all, Amazon has the best price for this and it arrived right away, so five stars for Amazon too. :) This is my first marcel iron. I was a little bit nervous about it, but figured if the pros use it, it must be better and it&#x27;s a still a dang curling iron, so how hard could it be? Not that hard. The awkwardness went away during the first use and my curls are AWESOME. This thing gets HOT FAST. I think I have the dial somewhere around halfway (350 maybe???), and that&#x27;s plenty hot. I spritz on a little heat protector before i start and use a light dusting of hairspray as I curl. The curls are SO shiny and last all day. For day two, I&#x27;ll just freshen up the top layer a bit, so they don&#x27;t look slept on, but the curls really do last. I&#x27;ve bought very high-end and very low-end hairdryers and styling tools, and this has proven to be the absolute best of both worlds. At the Amazon price, this isn&#x27;t much more expensive than the drugstore brands, but the performance is leagues beyond those. Ceramic is worth the couple of extra bucks, because it really keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking. I think the 1\\&quot; barrel is probably the best all-around size - you can get a lot of pretty tight curls with it if you use small sections, but it&#x27;s also big enough for the big, loose waves that I usually wear. I actually switched down from a very large barrel iron to this one for the large waves - there&#x27;s enough even heat with this to curl well through a relatively thick chunk of hair. Bottom line: I recommend this without reservation.</li>
    <li> I have a flat iron but I like have the marcel curling iron in my arsenal and this nano ceramic one was an excellent choice for me. Heating is fast and even and I love how it handles.</li>
