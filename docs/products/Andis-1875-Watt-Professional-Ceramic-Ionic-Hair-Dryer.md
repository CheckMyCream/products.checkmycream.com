      <li>It&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
      <li>I was so impressed with the power and design of the hair dryer that when my Conair died, I searched for Andis online and found it here.</li>

      <li>This one is, by far, the best I have used.</li>
      <li>The reason I chose this one was because of the 3 attached parts, they looked great and useful.  </li>
      <li>Bought this on Amazon 2 years ago and it is still going strong!</li>
      <li>The atttachments fall off kind of easy.</li>
      <li>The andis tourmaline hair dryer is better than I thought.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Decisions...decisions...  :)</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>I love the attachments diffuser for days</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t use it on clients any more.</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s better than pulling your hair from your head though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy anything more with the Andis name, as it was made in China.</li>
      <li>There are MUCH better dryers out there......</li>
      <li>Yea I can agree with everyone&#x27;s review about how it is heavier than most dryers.</li>
      <li>It dries hair quicker than most, leaving no frizz in the hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels softer and has more body with this one.</li>
      <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
      <li>You can do better.</li>
      <li>The Andis Tourmaline/Ionic dryer looked interesting and well-priced, so I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I moved out of parents house and couldn&#x27;t use my moms any more.</li>
      <li>I love the way this dries my hair and love all the heat settings.</li>
      <li>It dries my hair FAST and it looks great and healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying two more for my sisters as Christmas presents.</li>
      <li>This one ranks in the top percent.</li>
      <li>While gripping the handle I manage to turn it off or change the heat setting while drying my hair.  </li>
      <li>I am writing this review more as a eulogy than anything else.  </li>
      <li>It was at the top of her Christmas wish list, so</li>
      <li>I LOVE this blow dryer.</li>
      <li>So I found this one and it had a great price and had pretty good reviews on other websites but a great price here.  </li>
      <li>I am sure I will enjoy this one if not I am sure u will hear about it</li>
      <li>Many attachments, price is good, attractive, dries quickly, no damage.    </li>
      <li>The comb attachment is great and my hair dries smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>I works wonderfully, but sometime I tend to change the settings unintentionally due to the location of the switches.  </li>
      <li>but package was received very quickly.</li>
      <li>These attachments sometimes fall off easily; they don&#x27;t snap or screw in.</li>
      <li>also suggest buying a nice ionic hairbrush like the CONAIR and if you use flat irons, you can find a really good IONIC brand without spending Chi money.  </li>
      <li>I noticed that the sound on the Conair (when on \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting) was a lot quieter than the Andis.  </li>
      <li>Having purchased a similar product some years ago, that I was happy with, I re-ordered this product.</li>
      <li>Fortunately with the dryer aimed at me, it blew out sideways, so just startled, no harm.</li>
      <li>They should have 3 speeds on that thing because it doesn&#x27;t just sound like a leaf blower, it feels like one too.</li>
      <li>The attachments fly off and hit you in the head midstream (especially the diffuser).  </li>
      <li>There is a heft to the item and does not feel cheap or plastic-ky</li>
      <li>Honestly, I dont use it that much.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>As you are holding and using the dryer, your fingers wrap around the handle and end up right on top of the buttons.  </li>
      <li>I got a great deal with the flat iron as well.  </li>
      <li>This is a powerful dryer!  </li>
      <li>The control sort of drifts back and forth from warm to hot to warm, etc.  </li>
      <li>Some of the reviews that I read on here before purchasing, said that a lot of people didn&#x27;t like the controls because their hand would hit it and just turn it off, I don&#x27;t understand this, if you hold it in your hand the right way, it works fine without hitting the controls.</li>
      <li>I loved this product for 2 years and last week</li>
      <li>Such a shame a good name has lost it&#x27;s quality, and quality control.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it so much. Even the button is kind of easy to accidently push, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal.</li>
    <li> So noisy I could not use I am using the travel one instead.</li>
    <li> I am an age 40-something WASP with thick but now-fine hair that likes to frizz. I was impressed with the Andis hairdryer in the room at the Chicago Renaissance hotel, and looked for the brand on Amazon. The Andis Tourmaline/Ionic dryer looked interesting and well-priced, so I ordered it. It&#x27;s a little heavier than the usual hairdryer, and the included diffuser has not yet stayed on when I try to attach it to the barrel of the dryer. But I don&#x27;t care - just using the hairdryer alone does indeed deliver smooth, sleek, soft hair in less drying time for me. I&#x27;m glad I bought this. So far, so good - my instincts tell me this dryer may be less harsh on my hair than the non-ionic type dryers I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
    <li> This dryer works pretty well.  It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side and the diffuser doesn&#x27;t seem to fit properly-it&#x27;s always falling off.  I use this before that flat iron and my hair has never felt better. UPDATE_3/09 hair dryer died after very light usage-used maybe 5 times a month about half an hour each time-if you want you money worth try some other brand</li>
    <li> I purchased this Hair Dryer for my wife and she likes it very much. She said it worke&#x27;s as good as a more expensive one she had used. The on/off buttons on the handle are a small problem, they can be hit by accident.</li>
    <li> Have no complaints other then it&#x27;s a bit heavy and the attachments seem to slip off easily.  It works well and dries my hair without all the damage of a regular dryer.  This is a salon quality dryer for a great price..I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.  My only complaint is that the diffuser falls off occasionally.  I would buy it again however.</li>
    <li> When my years-old trusted hair dryer died I was not looking forward to trying to find a replacement. Why is a good hair dryer so hard to find? I thought this one was expensive but decided to give it a try and see if it was worth it. In my opinion it is - yes it is heavy but it gets very hot (though you can set it lower) and dries my hair much more quickly than other hair dryers. Other reviewers noted the problem of attachments being a little loose. I had this problem and happened to mention it to my hair dresser - she said to just use a paper towel between the attachment and the dryer to keep it on. Genius!! Haven&#x27;t had a problem since! I would have given this dryer 5 stars if not for the fact that a paper towel is required to keep the attachments on. Would purchase again and have recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. It&#x27;s powerful and dries my hair quickly.  The only draw draw back is that it&#x27;s pretty heavy. I can handle it, but if you have trouble holding your arms up long enough to blow your hair dry, you may want to look at a different product.</li>
    <li> Yea I can agree with everyone&#x27;s review about how it is heavier than most dryers. It is also much louder too. Compared to my old dryer, it sounds like somebody&#x27;s going through my house with damn leaf blower. They should have 3 speeds on that thing because it doesn&#x27;t just sound like a leaf blower, it feels like one too. The \\&quot;low\\&quot; on this dryer is my old dryers \\&quot;high\\&quot;. It does do the job when it comes to getting your hair dry fast though! : )</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom to try it out because her $150 dryer went out after 9years and she said it dryes almost as quickly as her old one but is super loud! And does not leave hair feeling or looking as smooth and shiny as her old one. You get what you  pay for.</li>
    <li> The  ionic nano-ceramic technology dries hair like no other. Instead of dry, straw-like dried hair the Andis provides supple and soft drying that makes hair feel very healthy and natural. Will not go back to regular &#x27;hot air blasting&#x27; on my hair.</li>
    <li> el producto es muy bueno&lt;br /&gt;the product is very good</li>
    <li> Bought this on Amazon 2 years ago and it is still going strong! I never heard of this brand before I saw it in a luxury hotel. I was so impressed with the power and design of the hair dryer that when my Conair died, I searched for Andis online and found it here. The overall item is well made and solid. The gorgeous deep red color is very rich and boy is it powerful! I use it to dry my hair daily and it has held up well. There is a heft to the item and does not feel cheap or plastic-ky like my old Conair. The Andis also comes with a nice long cord but I did wish it retracts to make storage neater. I am giving this a 4 star because of that.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST dryer for the money!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a hair dryer on line.  It seems that I&#x27;ve had to replace my store purchased dryers annually if not sooner in the past.  I&#x27;m hoping this one is better built than the others I&#x27;ve owned previously.  It does seem to be a higher quality product.       I have to confess that the color of this hair dryer was what initially caught my eye.  It&#x27;s a powerful dryer....certainly has shorten my hair drying time.      I like this product a lot with one exception - - the position of the buttons.  They are situated at the middle of the handle.  I end up accidentally shutting off the dryer constantly in the midst of drying my hair!  Not a big deal - - just sort of irritating.  Had they moved the buttons higher up on the handle, this problem could have been eliminated. Perhaps they&#x27;ll make that adjustment on the next model.    Nonetheless, I think this product earns a 4 star!</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer. It blows hard which is what I wanted. I have short bleached hair. I don&#x27;t use the attachments. I haven&#x27;t noticed that the ion feature has done anything different for my hair. It has a nice long cord which I also like. Some reviewers have mentioned it being heavy. Not true, maybe for a three year old, but not an adult. It just feels like a nice solid, well made dryer. It&#x27;s louder than my last dryer, but not too loud. I don&#x27;t think that whole ion thing does anything no matter which dryer you use. My hair is the same, with or without ions. What smooths it out is the fact that it blows nice and hard. That will probably change though as the filter gets clogged inside. That remains to be seen. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> OK, I love the looks of this dryer, and the different settings.  It does seem to dry hair quickly even at the warm and low settings.  However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is heavy.  Really.  Also, the other reviewers that said that the buttons were easy to accidentally push while using weren&#x27;t kidding.  As you are holding and using the dryer, your fingers wrap around the handle and end up right on top of the buttons.  It is almost impossible to not accidentally push one of the buttons while drying your hair.  Also, the other reviewers weren&#x27;t exaggerating about the difficulty with the attachments.  There is NOTHING to help hold them on.  So, using the diffuser is kind of a ridiculous arm-twisting ballet, trying to hold the attachment to the dryer with one hand and holding the handle of the dryer with the other, trying to not push any of the buttons directly under your fingers,  while trying to shake your hair into place because you can&#x27;t use one of your occupied hands to arrange your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I suppose that this is a good option.  but, when mine breaks, I will buying a different model or brand.</li>
    <li> Pros: Many attachments, price is good, attractive, dries quickly, no damage.    Cons: So heavy to use and that factor alone is enough to cancel out any of the pros.  The weight is also unbalanced, so when you grip the handle in the place that best balances it out, you wind up hitting buttons.  The attachments fly off and hit you in the head midstream (especially the diffuser).  Not recommended.  You can do better.</li>
    <li> I was just using what I thought was my trusty dryer when it literally BLEW UP in my hand.  Sparks went flying and there were pieces as far as 10 ft away. The entire back of the dryer exploded.  I have never been so scared of an appliance.  I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them.  Please do not buy this- it&#x27;s very dangerous!</li>
    <li> This dryer does dry may hair fast and it seems less frizzy than with other dryers. I have had many dryers ranging from cheap to very expensive. This one ranks in the top percent. A few downsides...it&#x27;s a bit heavy and I don&#x27;t like where the buttons are located (On/Off-Warm/Hot) I&#x27;m constantly turning the dryer on warm when I want it hot. Not the end of the world, just something I would change about it if I could.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer lasted me one month!  It started overheating and some plastic piece that must have been inside the dryer started burning.  I  had already thrown all packing and attachments out so I just tossed the hairdryer in the trash.  Bought a new red hardryer at Walmart for $15.00.</li>
    <li> There are only two heat settings on this hair dryer - Warm and Hot.  But you really don&#x27;t have to choose one or the other - the dryer does it for you.  The control sort of drifts back and forth from warm to hot to warm, etc.  And there are only two blower speeds - High and Low.  The low setting is barely a puff of a breeze and the high setting is enough to blow over a brick building.  The dryer is also very heavy.    There are MUCH better dryers out there......</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer. I use the comb attachment and it keeps m,y hair relatively straight. The problem is that it is a little heavy, but i guess thats like most. I would recommend it to others because it gets the job done, and i havent had any problems so far.</li>
    <li> I love the way this dries my hair and love all the heat settings. I really wanted a concentrator to help control frizz. This came with 3 great attachements but they do not stay on and after 4 uses my concentrator fell off and cracked. If you do not want the attachements then this is the perfect dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does the job; it dries your hair FAST. It comes with 3 attachments, and I really only use one. This means I have to find more space to store the other clunky yet light weight attachments. These attachments sometimes fall off easily; they don&#x27;t snap or screw in. I find that the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting are overkill, so I use the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; and \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting for drying. I wish there was a lower setting for styling, because there is so much power even in the low setting that it blows around the hair I&#x27;ve already styled. Also, it&#x27;s fairly heavy and large. As I blow dry, my grip is such that my fingers accidently shut off the dryer because the tiny \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch (which is basically the low or high setting) is right where my fingers go. That can get annoying. If I adjust my grip to prevent the accidental shut off, I find that my fingers are touching the \\&quot;extra cold\\&quot; button. No crime there, but I&#x27;m not ready for the cold button! Regardless of these things, it really is a decent, affordable hair dryer, especially for people with a lot of hair (probably too much \\&quot;wind\\&quot; for short hair). Oh, and it&#x27;s fairly quiet too, as far as hair dryers go. Good times.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find good for my hair any. Only this one I use about 2-3 years already, and still have it as a gift for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended item!</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer! It takes half the time to blow dry my hair like my old one did and takes a lot of the frizz off too. I LOVE this blow dryer. Highly recommend it. Shipped Fast!!</li>
    <li> I have never had an Andis product before and I am very pleased.  The comb attachment is great and my hair dries smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. There are enough settings and attachments. Very nice product for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I first bought this because the gym I went to had this hair dryer and I always liked how it dried my hair.  I also figured people use the hair dryers all day long at the gym so they must last.  So when I was in the market for a new hair dryer and decided to buy the same one.  Ive used this everyday for the past 2.5 years and still works great.  The lint catcher is easy to clean out and has good excellent heat and drying power.  When this one someday wears out I will be buying the exact same one again.</li>
    <li> I would previously have been skeptical reading those reviews of the hair dryer exploding, but it just happened to me. This was a great, attractive and reliable hair dryer for, for more than four years. This morning about two or three seconds after I turned it on, wham! the fan inside fractured and blew out the side of the case. Fortunately with the dryer aimed at me, it blew out sideways, so just startled, no harm. It&#x27;s obvious from this experience, and now reading previous reviews, that there is a pattern of this occurring. I would not give it a low rating for what seemed a fluke physical failure, but since it&#x27;s not isolated, and this replaced a 20+ year old Sunbeam dryer that never failed, and I just got tired of, I see no other choice than to score this one low.</li>
    <li> I chose this hair dryer after reading some of the reviews.  Sounded like a great hairdryer.  Maybe the one i received is a lemon, or maybe it is the same.  But this unit is awful.  First I took the wrappers off the attachments.  I loved how after you put them on, they just sorta launch themselves upward and slide off the end of the dryer.  Each one of the three did this!  The unit looked used when it arrived.  But I decided I would test it out to see if it was a good dryer.  It is waaayyyy too easy to turn this unit off just in the normal course of drying hair &amp; you do not want to do such, as you are still in the process of drying.  I must have cut the dryer off eight to ten times in the time I used it.  I also felt that the dryer was a bit heavy.  Now I am sensitive to over-sensitive about weight.  I have had two failed carpal tunnel releases &amp; have had rheumatoid arthritis for four years, and I grew tired &amp; achy holding this unit.  My hair is long &amp; thick also so that could have contributed to the problem.  I did not see any reduction in the amount of frizz or drying time for my hair.  So with a heavy heart, I must rate this dryer a generous one star &amp; get it ready to return to Amzaon for a refund.  I would not recommend this dryer to my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months ago and was initially happy with the product. That is until the hairdryer exploded while I was drying my hair. Scariest thing ever. Red plastic pieces flying everywhere with smoke coming from the dryer. The dryer was not damaged or dropped prior to the explosion. I contacted the company and have not heard from them.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer for the money!  Drying time is cut by half, great tools included.  My only wish is that it didn&#x27;t weigh so much.  It is a bit heavy but on the upside, by biceps are more sculpted now. :)  So...you can save about $200 dollars for this model and have a heavier dryer or purchase a T3 which performs the same but is wayyy lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decisions...decisions...  :)</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  It has improved the texture and whole condition of my hair.  My (African-American) hair is less frizzy, smoother and calmer.  I&#x27;m buying two more for my sisters as Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> I really liked the ionic technology.  It dries hair a lot faster.  However, after a year of owning this, it broke. I had to buy another dryer from Amazon, and I chose a different one--the Conair 213x Infiniti Professional Tourmaline dryer.  I noticed that the sound on the Conair (when on \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting) was a lot quieter than the Andis.  I get the impression that the motor on the Conair is of a higher quality than that of the Andis.</li>
    <li> I had used an ANDIS dryer at a hotel and LOVED it.  So, I thought I would try this one.  Yes, it is a little heavier than most, but I think that is because it has a larger (and better) motor in it.  It dries my hair FAST and it looks great and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It is the best one I have ever owned in terms of making my fine hair look amazing.  I recommend this hair dryer to any one and be sure to use the large attachment to it for great results!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new hair dryer b/c mine did not have the concetrator attachment and the universal wouldn&#x27;t fit.  So I found this one and it had a great price and had pretty good reviews on other websites but a great price here.  I got a great deal with the flat iron as well.  It&#x27;s perfect.  It drys my hair much quicker and my hair feels softer and looks better than it did with just the regular hair dryer.  I would absolutely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I used one of these blow dryers at a Hyatt in San Antonio and really liked it. My hair feels softer and has more body with this one. It&#x27;s heavier than I remembered, but I wouldn&#x27;t exchange it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer and it was defective.  The casing simply pulled apart at the handle and the screws that should have held it together could not be tightened.  I ordered a replacement (which came right away, thank you, Amazon) and it had the same defect.  The handle simply pulls apart.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s my bad luck - I think there is a problem with the assembly.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair dryer that didn&#x27;t fry my hair and this is it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> She asked for a colorful hairdryer to take back to Texas A and M. This one has a beautiful glittery finish, while also being a very good one. She rally did like it!</li>
    <li> THE DRYER WORKED GREAT FOR MY HAIR. I SELDOMLY USED IT AND I NEVER DROPPED IT. WHILE USING IT ONE DAY, THE MOTOR EXPLODED FROM THE BACK OF THE DRYER AND HIT ME IN THE FACE. I TURNED IT ON AND HEARD A STRANGE NOISE. SO NATURALLY, I DECIDED TO TURN IT OFF TO SEE WHAT COULD BE WRONG. BEFORE I COULD TURN IT OFF, IT HAD ALREADY EXPLODED AND SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE DRYER! PIECES OF THE DRYER HIT ME IN THE FACE. QUITE HARD! I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS DEFECTIVE OR IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL DRYER. CAUTION TO ALL!</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer to use at work.Andis has been a professional company around a long time; I happily unpacked it and took it along with me to work, only to discover that of the three attachments that accompany the blow dryer, only the diffuser fit. Niether of the two concentrator attachments would stay on the nozzle of the dryer due to their inner construction. The dryer itself is also quite loud and makes it hard to hear the customer. Silly me threw away packaging w/out reading the Amazon return policy which wants things returned in original packaging....my bad. So now I&#x27;m stuck with a loud blow dryer at home, and purchased a different blow dryer elsewhere for work. I probably won&#x27;t buy anything more with the Andis name, as it was made in China.Such a shame a good name has lost it&#x27;s quality, and quality control. My dealing with Amazon through this purchase was prompt, and only my fault that I didn&#x27;t read everything before I tossed the packaging.  Oops!</li>
    <li> The dryer stopped working the first month of purchased, simply connect as normal in a 110v socket normally used, and did not turn over. try connecting the other parts of the house and likewise does not work anymore.</li>
    <li> gave this as a gift &amp; she loved it... it made her drying time half of what it was &amp; she has long thick hair! thanks!</li>
    <li> The Andis 82075 Dryer is just what I wanted.  It dries my thick hair fast and does not leave it frizzy.  I would recommend this product for fast dry time and soft silky hair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Drying time is cut in half compared to other blow dryers!</li>
    <li> I am writing this review more as a eulogy than anything else.  I purchase this hair dryer in early 2009 so my thick curly hair.  I have an unconditional hair care regimen, which involves blow drying my ridiculous curls, upside down, with two hair dryers.  When I purchased this one, it cost a LOT more than what it costs now, and such, was my first &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; hair dryer.  Well, last week, after blasting perfectly hot air through my twisted follicles for 4 long years, my beloved died on me.  Now, I have been through many a hair dryer as it&#x27;s co-hair dryer, and finally settled on a baby bliss (and actual expensive hair dryer), but I still preferred my andis.  It has a nice open mouth, strong air flow, and not so much voltage that I have to reset my circuit box (a problem with the baby bliss).  I had logged on to order another one to replace my dear fallen friend, when I noticed how awful the reviews are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends, I logged some serious mileage with this haior dryer.  It&#x27;s Probably about 45 minutes a week over the course of 4 years.  and I NEVER had a problem until last week when this one started sputtering out.  Maybe they don&#x27;t make them like they used to?</li>
    <li> This is a powerful dryer!  My only issue is that when I use the attachments on my natural hair, they slide off of the base of the dryer.  That&#x27;s frustrating and requires me to hold the dryer where the two connect.  That is extremely uncomfortable.  I will make it work until I find a better solution...perhaps a new dryer.</li>
    <li> I love love this dryer! My daughter hair came out softer and I was able to dry her hair faster than usual. A great dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because my hairdresser has one like it.  I have naturally curly hair that I straighten. This dryer is awesome.  It dries hair quicker than most, leaving no frizz in the hair.  My hair feels smoother and healthier after using it.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Some of the reviews that I read on here before purchasing, said that a lot of people didn&#x27;t like the controls because their hand would hit it and just turn it off, I don&#x27;t understand this, if you hold it in your hand the right way, it works fine without hitting the controls.</li>
    <li> The reason I chose this one was because of the 3 attached parts, they looked great and useful.  But turned out those cannot be attached.   All three always falled down after ~15 seconds, so no use at all.  This dryer is a little heavy but acceptable because the air is powerful enough to make the hair dry fast.   Overall, I am very disappointed for the \\&quot;special features\\&quot;. Its design has a major problem, should make it just as the bottle top.    Updates 2/21/11  After 7 months, it is not \\&quot;hot\\&quot; enough, just a little more than warm.  My old travel dryer is even better than this.</li>
    <li> I loved this product for 2 years and last week the dryer exploded/imploded. It was terrifying. I&#x27;m lucky no one was hurt and that my 5 yr old was not in the bathroom with me at the time. I&#x27;ll stick to Andis but going to try another product line. We&#x27;ll see...</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of hair dryers in the last 40 years. This one is, by far, the best I have used. It is pricier than the ones you see in the discount stores, but it is worth every penny you pay for it. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This dryer is deafeningly loud, heavy and unwieldy, and none of the attachments fit. It&#x27;s a terrible piece of machinery. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Loved my Andis but it just exploded while drying my hair. Plastic everywhere, lucky no one was hurt. I don&#x27;t hate it but it could be unsafe! trying to decide if I want another one or switch brands.</li>
    <li> I have thick African American hair.  This straightens my hair quickly and I don&#x27;t need to work SO hard when flat ironing my air with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest buying a nice ionic hairbrush like the CONAIR and if you use flat irons, you can find a really good IONIC brand without spending Chi money.  I have the Titanium Tools Jilbere de Paris flat iron.... whatever it is... works for me and cost me around $50. Half the Chi price.  Get the Biosilk or the Chi silk Infusion (use a small amount) to protect your hair... they last a long time and protect your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will rarely need a salon with these ingredients.</li>
    <li> I try for the first time ionic hair dryer and I have to say, it works. The andis tourmaline hair dryer is better than I thought. Makes my hair feel much much softer, the blowing is strong and faster than normal hair dryers do. So , trust it!!!! worth it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the attachments to stay on at all.  I put the diffuser on my counter, put the hairdryer in it, and pounded the dryer with my fist.  It flew off in a matter of minutes.  I find the control switches are awkward as well.  While gripping the handle I manage to turn it off or change the heat setting while drying my hair.  It is powerful and does dry hair.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; dries however.  1/23/12- I guess on a plus side, this darn thing hasn&#x27;t died yet.  I still manage to have problems with the on/off switch.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer and was initially happy with it until it EXPLODED IN MY HAND while I was drying my hair.  I first felt a weird sensation going up my arm and then a huge hot stab in my back right before the dryer EXPLODED IN MY HAND, with pieces flying everywhere the motor was still running and I could not release it from my grip.  It hurt so bad and feels like my insides in my back are on fire!  Not only am I in pain, it scared me pretty bad!  I will be getting a completely different dryer now. I will never purchase another Andis dryer!</li>
    <li> BE WARNED ---- Don&#x27;t buy unless you want a fire on your hands. IF YOU HAVE ONE THROW IT AWAY!!! This product exploded in my hands just as I plugged it in and I have only had it for a few weeks.  If you read other reviews on this you will see that this is not the first or second time that this has happened and the supplier is refusing to refund.  Totally shabby treatment all around!!!! AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE IT FROM THEIR SITE!!! [[ASIN:B000M7YQOM Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer]]</li>
    <li> Best hair drier I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> The dryer is the worst one I ever had it started falling apart on the first day of using it, don&#x27;t loose your money on junk.</li>
    <li> I really like this dry.  I works wonderfully, but sometime I tend to change the settings unintentionally due to the location of the switches.  It&#x27;s a great dryer other than that.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this hair dryer for about a year now with no problems until today, when the dryer motor exploded in her hands and she was nearly electrocuted when she tried to unplug it. Reading some of the other reviews, I see that she was very lucky - the casing remained intact and the tiny sharp pieces of the motor remained inside the unit rather than turning into dangerous shrapnel. The Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer is a poorly-designed, dangerous product that should be taken off the market.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer.love that its red, not happy with the concentrater it did not fit on the end. Had to use an old one I had. But the andis dryer I had before is on its fourth year. I am a hair dresser so I use it a lot! The only reason I brought it home was because the vent on the front broke. So I can&#x27;t use it on clients any more. I am sure I will enjoy this one if not I am sure u will hear about it</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite hair dryer ever! I moved out of parents house and couldn&#x27;t use my moms any more. So excited to have the same one she had. This one has kept up with 4 girls for a couple years.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, my comments on the result of purchasing this product a year ago:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a good for drying, I don&#x27;t know why the professional word is on the description, next time tell this is for home use, home result, totally different to result my wife get from beauty med level professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Disappointed with this purchasing, but the time to send this back and get money back.</li>
    <li> My daughter had used this dryer in a hotel while traveling for work &amp; she loved it.  It was at the top of her Christmas wish list, so it was one of the most appreciated gifts she received.  She assures me it is the best dryer she has ever used.</li>
    <li> I was so happy I found a dryer that worked so well and made my hair feel so nice, that is until it exploded. I was about 3 minutes into drying my hair when the side blew out sending plastic pieces flying everywhere. It was so loud, the person upstairs came running down to make sure I was ok. I even found pieces outside the bathroom. Now looking, I see this is not an isolated instance. I am going to contact the company, but it looks like it hasn&#x27;t been very responsive. If you have this product, I recommend getting rid of it.</li>
    <li> I really needed a hairdryer upgrade... I think I had been using the same one since I was in high school. This blow dryer blew me away with how awesome it is! I love the attachments diffuser for days I want curly hair comb for days I want wavy and a smaller opening for when I&#x27;m straightening my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> The item was packaged well but we were missing the diffuser for some reason not sure what happened but package was received very quickly.</li>
    <li> The atttachments fall off kind of easy. If it snags on some tangled hair it&#x27;s going to come off. I guess that&#x27;s better than pulling your hair from your head though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Honestly, I dont use it that much. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and i&#x27;ve probably used it 4 times.</li>
    <li> Having purchased a similar product some years ago, that I was happy with, I re-ordered this product. It is an updated version of my earlier order. What a difference. This dryer is very noisy and I would not recommend it. I was disappointed and returned the product.</li>
    <li> La nano-cer&amp;aacute;mica i&amp;oacute;nica seca el cabello tecnolog&amp;iacute;a como ninguna otra. En vez de seco, paja-como el pelo seco el Andis proporciona un secado flexible y suave que hace que el pelo se siente muy sano y natural.</li>
