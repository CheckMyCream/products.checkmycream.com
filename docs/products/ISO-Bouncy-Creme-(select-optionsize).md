      <li>I have very curly hair and this cream makes my curls look lovely!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking crunchy.  Nice soft curls and keeps the frizz down as well</li>
    <li> A little cheaper then going to the beauty supply when you take into account gas and finding a store that carries this larger size which is rare.  Always arrives on time and wrapped nicely with no leakage.  Product seems exactly the same as when I by it in the store.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite hair products!</li>
    <li> Always a great product.</li>
    <li> Really does make your hair curl and that&#x27;s great. Only thing is it is slimy.</li>
    <li> I have to give this product only 2 stars, as an average between product quality and service.  This product was listed a \\&quot;Prime,\\&quot; meaning that it should have arrived within two days.  Instead it took 5 days.  While that is not a long time, it is still a FAIL.  Regarding the product quality, I would give it 4 stars.  I put it on while my hair is still damp from the shower, then let my hair air-dry, and then run my brush through it after it has dried completely.  I have rather dry and thick hair, and  it leaves my hair shiny and soft, exactly what I was looking for.  Very tangle-free, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian but I got stuck with some very thick kinky curly hair.  It&#x27;s taken YEARS to master my mane and Bouncy Creme is my hair&#x27;s BFF.  It really defines my curls while nixing the frizz.  It leaves my hair actually bouncy and so soft to touch.  I&#x27;ve tried SO many products from cheap Walmart stuff to very expensive salon products and nothing compares to Bouncy Creme.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s weightless and is awesome for enhancing your curls.</li>
    <li> Want natural looking curls? Get this</li>
    <li> I ordered this Because the image shows a pump, which helps when U order a large bottle...NO PUMP is disappointing!  The scent is very light which I like and I know its a good product because my hair cutter uses it on my naturally curly, old, died long hair &#x3D; its light weight and gives even my old hair bouncy curls + fights a little frizz</li>
    <li> I have been using Iso Bouncy Cr&amp;egrave;me for about 5 or 6 years now. I was looking for a product that I could use for my naturally very wavy hair that would not weigh down my hair or make it crunchy. My then hair lady recommended Iso Bouncy Cr&amp;egrave;me and I have been a loyal customer ever since. The product is GREAT! It does not weigh down my naturally oily hair or leave me with crunchy curls. The scent is slightly perfumy (is that a word?) but disappears when the product dries. It keeps the shape of my waves all day and if I need a hair refresher in the evening all you have to do is comb through hair with pick or fingers, spritz with some water, and then air dry. The product reactivates and livens up your curls or waves. I have hair past my shoulders and lots of it. The 33 oz bottle may come as a sticker shock to some, but this one bottle will last me 6 months at least! Great value and fantastic product. For any guy or gal out there with frizzy waves or curls and does not like the oh-so-80s crunchy mouse/gel curls, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and bought it on recommendation by her hair dresser. She is happy, I am happy.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and Bouncy Crème encourages non-frizzy curls.</li>
    <li> This product does not come with a pump on it. I know it seems silly, but I specifically switched to this curl cream because the pump would make it easier to get an appropriate amount of product without stopping to unscrew a lid. Nope, there is no pump. Just a flimsy lid which was scotch taped on. When I opened the box, the product was wrapped in paper, and there was cream ALL over the bottom of the box. Not to mention, the smell is pretty awful. I&#x27;d love to review the product for what it is, but I&#x27;m not using it until I get a refund for the mess that was shipped to me.</li>
    <li> Really really works well for my fine curly hair.  Isn&#x27;t too heavy and helps define my curl.  LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is light and can be applied to hair that is damp from shampoo, or lightly misted in between shampoos.  It articulates curls and tames friz and is neither sticky nor heavy.  It is a great product.  Pump bottle is easier to use.  I was surprised when my bottle arrived without a pump.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and was exactly as I expected. I would recommend this for anyone trying to maximize curl in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. My hair cannot live with out it.  I have fine, color treated curly hair.  Put a nickel size amount in your hand.  Rub your hands together and apply to your hair. Your hair feels like silk.    Enjoy</li>
    <li> the only product that smooths, controls and defines my curls. good product and good price, however the product picture example shows a &#x27;pump&#x27;, there was NO pump included with my shipment, disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am African American and this stuff is great for my naturally curly hair. Don&#x27;t leave home without it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is only carried at a speciality store or a beauty salon.  I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so was pleased to find such a large size for a great price.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and the buyer that I purchased from.  Great transaction!!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product that coaxes the most subtle curl from your hair and adds body and (of course) bounce to even thin and lifeless tresses.  The vendors response was quick and efficient.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and the service from this supplier was superb. I plan to order again very soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bouncy Cream for a few years now and absolutely love it. My hair is naturally curly and when I put this stuff in, it keeps the frizz away.  I love it and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Bouncy creme is light enough to use every day but strong enough to keep my curls from frizzing. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that will control the frizz without weighing down the curl. I have loved ISO Bouncy Creme for years, but it has gotten harder to find in recent years. So glad I can go to Amazon and find exactly what I want at a great price.</li>
    <li> I use this on towel blotted hair - about 6 pumps for my long hair and with a diffuser i get the best curls ever.  Big sigh of relief :-)</li>
    <li> The reviews are all so great but this stuff was awful.  I don&#x27;t get it...it just left my hair dry and spongy.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to try this product at least 10 years ago at Pure Beauty in SF.  I rarely do a review on products but I really put this in my top 3 beauty products that I love.  I have thick, yet fine textured and wavy hair.  I can blow it out straight very easily, or wear it natural &amp; wavy.  This is the BEST product I have used when I want wavy hair (once used BedHead Curl Activator (sp?) and it was so crunchy and made my hair do ringlets).  ISO Bouncy Creme gives my hair beachy, loose waves and people always ask me if I style or curl my hair and all I say is I use this cream on my wet hair and I&#x27;m done.  I think a good, layered haircut is key also. Also, there is no crunchiness with this product, it feels like a body lotion and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down either.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I have natural wavy hair and this product defines the curl/wave. You don&#x27;t havve to use very much and It is not sticky and smells good.</li>
    <li> It has a nice fragrance but I was hoping it would help to make my hair less frizzy than if I didn&#x27;t use it.  My hair was soft but still frizzy.</li>
    <li> While I really love this product, I was really hoping to get bottles of the original scent. The new fragrance is too strong.</li>
    <li> I rub a small amount into my hair any time when it looks dry. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy-looking.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Used to get it through my beautician.  Glad to see it is available online.  The best way to use this is to put it on your barely towel dried hair.  Rub it in, comb it through, push up your hair a little in your style, then leave for a few minutes before blow drying.  Gives great body to a short hair cut for sure.</li>
    <li> I Love this product and will consider it a staple for my hair!</li>
    <li> Recommend by my hair stylist. Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS-- It is the BEST product I&#x27;ve ever used for my curly hair.  This product leaves my curls soft, spiraled, and saturated with moisture and has improved the overall condition of my hair returning it to a healthy state.  BEST PRODUCT out there for CURLY HAIR!  Bouncy Creme has gotten it right!</li>
    <li> I ended up returning my purchase because what I received was not the product I buy in stores. I have been using this product for over 15 years and I know how it feels, smells and works on my hair. I don&#x27;t know how the product was compromised but I know it was not the &amp;#34;offcial&amp;#34; product. Sorry guys! Bouncy creme is a fantastic product for people with curly hair normally. Next time, I will just buy it in the store.</li>
    <li> I love the ISO bouncy cream I have been using it for a while so I decided to buy the big bottle since i go through it so quickly. When I received the bottle it was shrink wrapped very tight which I was happy about but when I opened it up not only did the bottle feel half empty but the cap doesn&#x27;t even screw on all the way! It&#x27;s not a pump like the picture shows it&#x27;s a snap top that just keeps turning and turning doesn&#x27;t actually lock in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love this product like I do, get it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice. Always got complimented because of the smell. I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because now I&#x27;m really into organic stuff. But for those that don&#x27;t care, this is a GREAT product. Makes your curls soft and bouncy and looking great.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy hair and this tames the frizz and makes my curls look pretty.  I don&#x27;t have time for a lot of hair maintenance with 6 kids, so this really helps me get ready.</li>
    <li> I have short, fine hair and this stuff really revives what little curl I have!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair really soft and gives it well defined curls. Love it!</li>
    <li> my hair is curly and frizzy.  this product helps control the frizzies and makes my curls soft and managable.  i love it</li>
    <li> This does NOT work to hold curls in my wavy hair, it just looks BLAH and inconsistent.</li>
    <li> This leave-in moisturizer for my permed hair keeps it shiny and enhances &amp;#34;the bounce&amp;#34; -- helps my curls revive, refresh and enliven my curls.</li>
    <li> I spent lots of time in Florida and always had the frizziest hair and I hated it.  Now, when I use Bouncy Creme on wet hair, and again a small bit when it&#x27;s almost dry, my hair is curly not frizzy.  A solution in the sun!</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with long curly hair. Until approximately 8 years ago I couldn&#x27;t find anything to put in my hair to keep it moist and manageable.  A friend from the West Coast introduced me to this product as we have very similar hair , and I&#x27;ve been in love ever since. It is alcohol-free which is one of it&#x27;s best attributes.  I order it from Amazon because it&#x27;s not sold in this market, and I live in the New York tri-state area.  Thank goodness for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Bouncy Cream rocks!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy in the City.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when I lived in Hawaii for three years. I grew up in Southern California so my naturally wavy/curly hair went crazy in the humidity. This was the only thing that helped and it smells soooo good. I was thrilled to find it again on Amazon. Now I&#x27;m back in CA, but with my crazy life have little time to spend on my hair. I wash, let it get about halfway dry (either air or diffuser) and put this in for perfect happy hair. I find it works a bit better for me when not totally diluted by sopping wet hair. My husband even will use it when his hair is a bit frizzy and I&#x27;ve used it on my 2 yr old son, poor thing has my hair, when his is crazy in the morning. This tames it and leaves it beautifully shiny. LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a person who wore my hair up in my bun for years, because I couldn&#x27;t stand the frizz and dullness of my hair. After coloring my hair, I was recommended this product through my hair stylist to style my curls and eliminate frizz, and let me tell you, this product is great. It leaves my hair soft with no frizz. It also leaves it touchable...unlike some gels and mousses. I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this makes me actually like my hair...which is a miracle. It&#x27;s great for curls :)</li>
    <li> my curls spiral, and my hair is never frizzy. This is my favorite hair product. I use a little everyday, and I love that my curls are not frizzy, and fall really well.</li>
    <li> love this product.  takes out the frizz.........enhances my original bouncey curl........</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my curls and doesn&#x27;t weigh them down. I have 2C/3A hair and it really defines the curls nicely.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Does not come with a pump but great size to refill into a smaller container.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction. Excellent product. Fast shipping. Very Happy. Thank You</li>
    <li> Excellent for curly hair!</li>
    <li> The product was what my wife was looking for, just didn&#x27;t come with the pump as shown in the picture. Either needs to come with it or change the picture.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great item for the person just starting out as a natural hair wearer. It takes just a small amount to get the hair feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products but this is the only one I have ever fallen in love with. My hair doesn&#x27;t require fizz control, but it does require detangling without weighing down my curls and this does both. Never has a product so effortlessly detangled my hair.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, unmanagable hair.  I have tried every product on the market.  Then this young woman turned me on to this and it makes my hair look so good, no frizz, silky and manageable.</li>
    <li> My husband has VERY curly hair and has tried LOTS of curly haired products.  He has specific requirements: he wants something to control frizz, keep his hair in place and his curls fairly tight to his head, not give the \\&quot;wet look\\&quot;, and (very important to him) make his hair feel like hair without feeling crisp or gelled down.  In the past, it&#x27;s required several products to accomplish this.  Since discovering Bouncy Creme, this is the only product he uses and it accomplishes all of his hair goals with one product!</li>
    <li> made my hair feel gross.</li>
    <li> ISO Bouncy Creme is the best!  I have naturally curly hair and have used it for years.  I have tried other products but always come back to Bouncy Creme.  Is keeps my curls defined and still feels natural, not crunchy!  This is not actually Jayson, this is his wife.</li>
    <li> Iso Bouncy Creme helps me control my curly hair.  Now it goes where I want it to, not where it wants to go!</li>
    <li> My mom loves, thinks she can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream and I keep ordering.</li>
    <li> Great product that conditions your hair and leaves no sticky residue at all. Great for enhancing your curls, and your hair smells good, not chemically like some products. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using it for my curly hair for several years. Would highly recommend for anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Bouncy creme enhances the wave and curl in my hair and adds body, yet leaves my hair soft and never oily.  I am very satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s fast and efficient shipping.</li>
    <li> When I ran out of my stock pile of ISO that I purchase at my local store when it was being discontinued, I purchased the 32oz bottle and I was SO sad it not only smelled like baby powder it left my hair limp and gross. I seriously wonder if I was using baby lotion on my hair. I asked for a refund. I may try buying a smaller one from a different seller and hope it&#x27;s the real deal! I love ISO! My hair is not the same without it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  So much more economical on amazon. Tames the frizzies</li>
    <li> I just got a large bottle with &amp;#34;New Fragrance&amp;#34; stamped across the top! The smell is completely different and the ingredients are changed too. I called the company and according to the code on my bottle it is new and was manufactured April 2014. She also said &amp;#34;oh, I didnt know they changed the fragrance&amp;#34;... :/&lt;br /&gt;I have not used any of the new bottle yet, so I cant say weather the slightly different formula works the same as the old product does. Just wanted to let others know!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own perception of smells but to me the old one was more mild and clean smelling, the new one is more perfumey, when I opened the box I could smell it. I&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;new fragrances&amp;#34; in hair products that give me headaches from the strong fragrance and having it in my hair all day, so I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s not the case here!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for my curly hair. Keeps the curls and the bounce without becoming crunchy, stiff, or frizzy. I bought it from my hairdresser, but she kept running out, and I kept running out. So glad to see it here so I can buy enough to last a loooong time. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Seems like a fantastic value for the price, and I love how soft my hair is. It de-frizzes it pretty well, and I like best when I shower in the evening, then put the cream in. The morning hair is good. I have thick, semi-wavy Caucasian hair.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this product, but it is impossible to get around here, unless you are a beautician. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and have spent too much money on other products that failed on many counts but this one is worth every cent!  My stylist introduced me to this product then ordered it for me.  Thankfully I found it here!  It feels great on my hair, enhances curl, smells nice, and is certainly NOT greasy or heavy. Finally a product that brought the bounce, softness, and curl back to my naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> Greay purchase at an affordable price. Silky hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found that is light and not greasy.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found a large bottle of this as it seems to be vanishing from stores.</li>
    <li> Great for my fine, naturally curly hair when left to remain curly for the day. It is lightweight. Just finger some through damp hair, use a pick to work the curls, let dry naturally or use a diffuser for a little more fullness. I know 3 other ladies who love Bouncy, too. Each one has naturally curly hair but different thickness.</li>
    <li> Use it for curly hair the best</li>
    <li> ISO Bouncy Creme leaves my hair nice and healthy with lots of body, bounce, shine and definition. I&#x27;ve tried similar products recently and nothing I&#x27;ve tried compares-other stuff tends to leave my hair crispy, weighed down, limp or mopy. Since I started using this stuff again my hair looks sooo much nicer and fuller! After I condition my hair and dry it with a t-shirt, I spray Elasta QP leave-in h2 and run 6 squirts of the ISO bouncy creme through to the ends. I have 3B hair that is similar to Mya.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and years. I defines my curls so nicely making them smooth and shiney and never crunchy.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my curls intact &amp; feeling soft all day. I recommend this product if you have curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this cream makes my curls look lovely! I can use it alone, or add a bit of mouse after to defrizz a bit more. I love how it feels in my hair, soft not crunchy.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I have purchased it here before and will do so again.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product years ago to add body to my hair.  And it does just that.  Just remember, A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I mix Bouncy Creme with Bouncy Curl Definer pomade and I think it&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for thick, curly hair.  Effectively tames frizz, defines curls, and does indeed add the \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; its name implies.  Surprisingly moisturizing and shine-producing.</li>
    <li> ISO BOUNCY is a great product very light non-greasy and have a great smell. I have been using ISO BOUNCY for a couple years..</li>
    <li> My hairdresser started using this on my hair to give my hair body.  It works!  I bought my own because her price was much more than Amazon for an 8 oz.  I put it on my damp hair, blow dry, and it holds the style with a lot of body.  My hair is thick anyway so this prevents a lot of &amp;#34;teasing&amp;#34; to the hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Iso Bouncy Creme for many years. I have thick, curly hair and this tames it. I always use it after shampooing my hair. I apply it to dry hair if I haven&#x27;t shampooed that day and it always does the trick! It has a nice subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t compete with anything else. It&#x27;s a great, leave in conditioner. I love it! Susan K.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  Hard to find locally so amazon is perfect.  Keeps frizz at bay while keeping your curls soft and not crunchy or wet looking.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my hair I have natural curl, however I have a perm now to even the curls out....  this even helps when the perm is old and and it needs help.</li>
    <li> Perfect for curly hair</li>
    <li> This was great!  It came very quickly and a huge amount for the price.  I would definitely recommend. They want more words, really!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday so being able to have the larger volume is financially a benefit for me. Big retailers such as Sally&#x27;s Beauty Products &amp; Ulta don&#x27;t carry it. Amazon to the rescue. Works for me. Thank-you.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about. I have bouncy, well defined curls, medium thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it smells like cheap soap. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with smell of hair products, I&#x27;m not fussy about that at all. This is the first time the smell was a deal breaker. It&#x27;s actually embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s one of the lowest quality hair creams I&#x27;ve tried. It feels a little sticky as you apply, and after your hair dries there is no definition at all. It&#x27;s neither softer nor more defined. Except if you get frustrated and apply too much, some parts of your hair gets hardened and/or straightened. It&#x27;s a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for a (much) higher price, Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-curl Definition Crème: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZT9E4/&lt;br /&gt;For a lower price, pretty much any curl defining hair cream from your local drugstore. They all do a decent job nowadays.</li>
    <li> So sorry I bought this HUGE bottle.  It&#x27;s never going to be gone, and I&#x27;m not as crazy about the product as I thought I was.  It seems to weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> Bouncy Creme is one of the only products I have ever used that maintains and structures my curls, while keeping my hair soft-- which is why I continue to use it.  The only downside, again, is the smell.</li>
    <li> Hate the new smell, too bad, but I returned it and it easy. Smells too strong, like heavy spice.</li>
    <li> I have wavy to curly hair that used to be unmanageable. But when I discovered Bouncy Creme, I was able to wear my hair longer and enjoy the way it looks rather than looking at a pile of frizz on top of my head. It organizes my curls and makes them soft and cascading. And I have had tons of compliments about how great my hair smells when people are standing next to me. If this product ever comes off the market, I will be extremely disappointed and depressed!!</li>
    <li> Great! Leaves my hair super soft! You should definatly get this the big one as opposed to the smaller one. I didn&#x27;t know it was available in this size so I bought the smaller one first. I still have the smaller one and I just refill it out of this one. If you have bought the smaller one before you should do the same. If not buy this one.</li>
    <li> Very good product for my curly hair.I love it</li>
    <li> My hair is stick straight, blonde, and fine. I read that this cream added body and softness and after trying many creams, I was pretty sure this one wasn&#x27;t going to work. Boy was I wrong!  ISO Bouncy Cream is awesome--the best hair volumizing cream I have ever used. It leaves my hair soft, smells great, and with volume all over. I know it&#x27;s for curly hair, but it seems to do wonders for any type of hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product-- makes my thin hair look thicker.  Quick delivery.</li>
