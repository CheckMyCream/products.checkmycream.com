<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does a great job and it&#x27;s much less expensive that small indivisdual bottle of AC shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  The scent is strong, which is fine, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get my hair clean.</li>
    <li> Great value, smells good, but doesn&#x27;t shampoo wash hair as well as even cheap shampoo. Find myself washing my hair twice if I use Murray&#x27;s to style my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, love the smell</li>
    <li> As you can see by the picture it is described as American crew &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; and it just came to me as regular American crew.  L&#x27;Oreal changed the recipe and the new version smells like roses which is a feminine smell.  The old &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; version has an awesome smell and I&#x27;m having a hard time finding it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I just wanted shampoo - not a mixture with conditioner. I should of paid more attention.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good, subtle scent&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves hair very manageable&lt;br /&gt;- Conditions well&lt;br /&gt;- Nice looking bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Pricey&lt;br /&gt;- Not as effective as dedicated conditioner or body wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tilt:&lt;br /&gt;- The price is justified by performance IMHO</li>
    <li> Just what a guy in a hurry needs, conditioner and shampoo, rinse and you&#x27;re outta there. Good stuff, my wife likes the smell too.</li>
    <li> The best smelling pro shampoo for men! Works great!</li>
    <li> MAKES YOUR HAIR SOFT!</li>
    <li> The bottle came opened and there&#x27;s shampoo that has emerged all over the inner packaging</li>
    <li> Fantastic 3 in 1 body wash. can find it for decent price on amazon</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while and am very happy about it.  Additional bottles will be given to members of family who will be receiving as a X-mas gift.</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair, and keeps it soft.  Smell is not obnoxious like some other shampoos/conditioners.  I also bought the Crew pump that fits this size bottle which makes it super convenient in the shower.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even smell like Crew.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm without separate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or hair and smells great.</li>
    <li> Love this 3-in-1 Crew Shampoo and Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Best price found.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Crew hair gel, but in a much smaller size.</li>
    <li> I really like only to have one product to take care of the entire shower detail and it smells good too :)</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel very thin!  I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo that has done it this bad before.  I have long fine hair, not real thin, but not real thick.  Just normal.  I don&#x27;t over-wash my hair and usually wash it only 3 times a week.  First couple washes, I thought I liked this shampoo, but by the end of couple weeks, I thought I was losing my hair!  It was soo thin feeling and I was scared something was wrong.  I thought about it and realized it could be the new shampoo.  Luckily when I stopped using this shampoo everything became thicker immediately again!  So it wasn&#x27;t thinning my hair, just making it look and feel like it!!!  So unless you have super thick hair you want to look thinner, don&#x27;t use this shampoo!</li>
    <li> This 3 in 1 wash is so good that I always keep an extra bottle on hand so I don&#x27;t run out and have to wait on delivery.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> I was sent daily shampoo, daily conditioner, moisturizer one, and hair paste. All these products smell very manly, and very low key. I use the conditioner for myself since my husband doesnâ€™t and I love it, makes my hair soft and nourished. All these products are great, and you can find them pretty much any where, but they do cost a lot, but luckily you really donâ€™t need much for men per use, unless they have long hair, so it will last for a long time. This is just a small portion of all the products they have to offer and all smell the same. They have pretty all natural list on their ingredients list in these bottles. All the formula is perfect, and lathers up great and you really donâ€™t need that much per use. The paste as well, just a little will go a long way for sure.</li>
    <li> Has a masculine, clean smell which is spot-on. Works great as a body wash. As a shampoo, it seems to leave my hair really dry. Not so good.</li>
    <li> Great bproduct that my husband loves</li>
    <li> The perfect shampoo and conditioner to keep my hair clean and manageable !  Thanks for making it available on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I have straight thick, short to medium length hair.  I started using pomade/ fiber for styling my hair and occasionally gel.  It took two washes with the shampoo and conditioner I was using to get the pomade and/or gel out.  After reading reviews and doing some online research, I decided to give this a try.  After my first week of washes, I am pretty satisfied with this.  The scent is mildly &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;spicy.&amp;#34;  I only have to use about a teaspoon and it lathers really well.  This washed out the pomade and/or gel with one wash, and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  My previous shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling dry and difficult to comb through.  This left my hair very manageable and my scalp feeling moisturized.  As far as using it as a body wash goes, it moisturized my skin pretty well.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star is because of the price.  It is a little expensive, but it is a great product. If you are unsure about this product, I think there is a smaller size available at a lower price.</li>
    <li> this shampoo has a great fragrance and likes the way it deep cleans the hair, specially for med you haw they are.&lt;br /&gt;glad I bought the big bottle !!,&lt;br /&gt;jo</li>
    <li> Not great for the hair because can dry it out but I leave it at my bae&#x27;s for when I need a quick shower. Serves all my needs in one bottle.</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a while now. Seems like the formulation changed at some point, but still highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was never a fan for 3 in 1 but it actually works well without drying or splitting hairs.</li>
    <li> Smells great and was shipped super fast!</li>
    <li> This CREW does not lather, not what I wanted, used it 2 times bad, Glenn</li>
    <li> smells good, feels good, looks good. is good. 8)</li>
    <li> This is fantastic shampoo and conditioner and it smells amazing. It&#x27;s much creamier than others too. Buy this if you have any style at all.</li>
    <li> First off, this is the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen for this stuff!  This is my college-age son&#x27;s favorite.  He&#x27;s usually very picky about smells, but this doesn&#x27;t linger and isn&#x27;t a problem for him.  What he likes most is it really is great as both a body wash and shampoo/conditioner.  His hair has never looked this good!</li>
    <li> Product is great but all three bottles I bought was packaged so poorly, a tenth leaked out!</li>
    <li> This stuff is definitely worth the price. It saves so much time in the morning, which with our high water rates, makes a huge difference each month as well. It smells amazing, leaves the both the skin and hair feeling great and smooth. Tons of compliments on the smell which makes it worth it just for that reason. The only complaint is that it can dry your hair some. To deal with this, I have begun to use a little less, just to the point where it feels like not enough. The bottle size, although bulky, goes a long way and is a huge convenience.</li>
    <li> I started using Crew one bottle ago and just love the smell and quality.  It&#x27;s thick and not watery while the 3-in-1 is useful as I only need this bottle to wash, condition and clean my body.  It saves space in the shower and saves water.  The price on Amazon is by far much cheaper than the retail stores.  Adding a pump top adds to the convenience and works very well.</li>
    <li> good smell and works well in all functions: shampoo, conditioner and soap.  Theere sure is enough of it too, which makes up for a hefty price.  It does not dry out the skin as many other 3 in 1s can do.  My suggestion would be a smaller amount for lesser dollars.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl with nice long hair and always used to use fancy shampoo and conditioner... until one day I tried this at a guy friend&#x27;s house because I&#x27;d forgotten my shampoo and conditioner and I expected my hair to come out a tangled mess... but it actually felt softer and smoother than when I use my own fancy products! I made the switch because it&#x27;s easier, saves time, and makes my hair feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was every disappointed to find that the formula had changed.  The old body wash had a nice subtle manly scent but now it just smells like a generic shampoo.  The old body/hair wash was semi-transparent with a great scent.  I&#x27;ll never order this again as it is way to expensive to just be getting generic shampoo.</li>
    <li> Never heard of this brand until a few weeks back .... Ordered a bottle and I love it .. The scent isn&#x27;t bad as I have seen reviews about the scent .. My g/f likes the smell... We&#x27;ll be buying more when this bottle is done</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. The girl that even cuts his hair mentioned that only after 2 weeks of use she noticed a marked improvement in his formerly dry hair and scalp. I would recommend this to any of my male friends or even to my girlfriends for the men in their lives.</li>
    <li> I love the product, it cleans and conditions at the same time</li>
    <li> I seriously doubt that the product that arrived is the same as what is advertised.  My product was opened and didn&#x27;t smell or feel like the original product.  Can I prove anything?  No.  But buyer beware... I know I&#x27;ll be buying this product elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Not sure yet if I like a combo of shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite all in ones</li>
    <li> Same as I can buy in the stores.  Works Great!  The only one that I will ever use.</li>
    <li> My husband only uses Crew products, so he is well pleased with this product. When he is happy, the whole house is happy!</li>
    <li> Throw your soap bars away, this does it all.  Leaves your hair fresh and shinny, and soft.  Body feals fresh.</li>
    <li> This is all I use now, never used to look soap/shampoo combos, but this works perfectly, very high quality and smells great (does not smell like perfume like other reviewer says, i think it is a manly fresh scent -- heck the brand is \\&quot;official supplier to men\\&quot;)</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying American Crew because of its really good reviews. The big positives in regards to its scent are spot on, probably the best i&#x27;ve tried. But it dries out your scalp, the conditioner isn&#x27;t sufficient to re-moisturize either. Scalp and hair feels dry and damaged following use, kind of feels like i used soap on my head. As a body wash it isn&#x27;t that bad, though you do have a feeling like you have conditioner on your skin. I think this is what happens when you go with an all in one, i suspect buying the body wash and shampoo separate would&#x27;ve been a better idea.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would be a on par with other Crew products. But the fragrance is overpowering. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great  product&lt;br /&gt;No allergic smelling&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got beautiful smell&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great price, great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t demand much out of my shampoo so 3 in 1 is a nice bonus. My brother gave me a bottle before and I liked the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I would always sit shampoo, conditioner &amp; soap out. Only shampoo &amp; soap used.... I was having massive over run of conditioner but a husband with dry &amp;#34;golf ball&amp;#34; head as we call it here. This helps me get all I need for him in 1 &amp; not feel like a Mon to my husband asking if he used his conditioner (when you could clearly see he hadn&#x27;t)!</li>
    <li> works really good for my hair and has a great manly smell&lt;br /&gt; I also use the Crew forming cream. I have medium thick hair.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in any stores. Definitely worth the price given especially the speed of the delivery. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> works well with oil/sensitive skin. best 3 in 1 yet. nice clean fragrance, did i mention it has hops in it?</li>
    <li> Would order the product again.  With the size, the cost is really inexpensive and usage may last longer than the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> It smells good. I got a sample with a magazine, and I love the smell, so I ordered this... I don&#x27;t feel any conditioning function.........My hair is super dry after using this...&lt;br /&gt;It came without any seals on the bottle... I was expecting some sort of plastic sealer underneath the cap, but there was none... Bought from &amp;#34;Hayward Beauty&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Not only does this stuff allow you to smell great without having to worry about using any kind of sprays, but the hair looks great with the right amount of body, moisture and control.  Perfect for the gym.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; formula as pictured. The aroma is still very appealing. I am going to keep it. But, if you are expecting the classic fragrance do not buy from this listing.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and don&#x27;t wash it every day with product but when I do, I use this stuff.  Works great on the body as well, I sometimes have a problem with dry skin/scalp but this seems to be pretty gentle on both.  Makes my hair nice and soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a great distinctive/manly smell too, my fiance loves it.</li>
    <li> High quality product. Feels good after using.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for men or women. Does it all. Will buy it again as long as the price stays below $20.00</li>
    <li> Product leaked. tape over cap. inside plastic bag, but bag not sealed. Very little cushioning in box. Strong initial odor, but O.K. when shampooing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle. It conditions.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Nuff&#x27; said.</li>
    <li> Has a more manly smell than most of the stuff you get at a drug store, and keeps hair clean.</li>
