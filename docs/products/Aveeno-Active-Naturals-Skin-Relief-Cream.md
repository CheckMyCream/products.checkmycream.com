<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband likes this better than any of the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brands I have spent a fortune on. He has dry (almost burned looking) skin due to a medication- but this keeps it away. His skin is not red, peeling or itchy like it was before using this produce. Also, it rubs in really nicely- not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the store price and smaller tube!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my MD for my dry skin.  Great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is certainly thick, but I find the smell annoying. It is a slightly medicinal smell that seems to linger softly (smell is a big deal for me!). I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because it isn&#x27;t a good enough cream to get past the smell, in my opinion. There are other creams out there that do a better job for the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something for my dry/peeling skin from some dermatologist&#x27;s medication I received. I purchased this (determining between Cerave and other &#x27;medical&#x27; boring brands) in hopes that this will solve such issues as dry,peeling, itchy, and rash prone break-out skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;-It made my skin soft in the long run (applying it nightly after a shower)&lt;br /&gt;-No perfume scent, just a basic plain lotion sort of smell&lt;br /&gt;-I still peel in my top spots I wanted not to, but it&#x27;s not as bad&lt;br /&gt;-No long dry feeling skin&lt;br /&gt;-Itchy now and then, but not often&lt;br /&gt;-I now mix this with St. Ives lotion and a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-Applies weird, like watery cream, bit strange to explain since the product looks like regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you need to know!!&lt;br /&gt;  This is what gave this product 3/5 stars. Ever been out on a hot day too long, or did a little jog, to the point where your skin became very moist (not dripping sweat)? That clammy feeling? Sweaty palm amount? That is what this is. For hours after I applied it. My boyfriend told me &amp;#34;EW! Sweaty skin!&amp;#34; when he touched my leg :(&lt;br /&gt;  I will probably now look into those boring medical lotions that are just, if not more, highly rating.</li>
    <li> Best stuff.... MY DERMATOLOGIST friend says so.  That&#x27;s MD. to MD</li>
    <li> This works very well for my very dry skin. I use it right outof the shower and my skin stays soft all day.</li>
    <li> My husband and I live in Interior Alaska, where the winters are very cold and VERY dry. I also spend a good amount of side outside most days, so my skin is exposed to pretty harsh conditions. My skin, particularly on my hands,can get extremely dry and even broken in the winter, to the point that lotion burns like fire when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my husband, a couple of years ago, my husband developed absolutely terrible, large patches of red, itchy skin on various parts of his body. We tried to get rid of it for a couple of months and tried assorted lotions and creams, but nothing worked. A dermatologist said it was just eczema and said we should buy this lotion specifically because it&#x27;s the best around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally we&#x27;d try to avoid a lotion in a tub because neither of us actually like lotion and dipping our hands into it is especially unappealing, but the doctor said to get this kind of lotion versus another Aveeno product that&#x27;s sold in a tube. She explained that alcohol is added to bottled lotions so they flow easier, and that can be harsh on the skin. This lotion doesn&#x27;t burn my skin when it&#x27;s really chapped and it moisturizes very well. It cleared up my husband&#x27;s eczema within a couple of weeks. It also isn&#x27;t too greasy, which is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, neither of us is especially thrilled with dipping our hands into a tub of lotion, so I purchased a couple of small, empty squeeze bottles at the store.  I think they&#x27;re designed to bring small bottles of soap and lotion in airplane carry on luggage.  I scooped this lotion into the bottles, and they work great!  No problems getting the lotion out.  Wish they&#x27;d just offer this lotion in a bottle to start with- maybe one of the squeeze tubes vs one with a pump- but this solution works fine.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  My husband has rough patches on his elbows and this is pretty much the only thing that seems to work on them.  It also just feels good to put it on and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, so it works for the whole family.  The tub container is kind of weird at first, but you learn to appreciate it because you don&#x27;t waste a drop.  (We also tried Vanicream at one point, but that had a sticky feel that didn&#x27;t go over well with my husband and daughter.)</li>
    <li> A thin coating does very well.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I work around stocking shelves at a retail store.  Because I handle paper boxes all day, my hands get very dry and crack.  This Aveeno skin relief cream has worked the best to help heal my hands.  The results were impressive after only one week of use.  I put the cream on my hands before and after work.  My hands are now soft, healed, and feel great.  One important note:  This cream is not greasy and it works into the skin fairly quick.  Also, the cream has little to no scent.  I&#x27;m a guy, so I don&#x27;t want to smell like a flower.  The price seems a little high compared to other daily use lotions, but the tub lasts a long time and the results are much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Has helped with my daughters eczema so much better then any other cream I tried!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cream for eczema. It soothes the itching and moisturizes for most of the day. Apply it immediately after showering to lock in the moisture. It really is fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that liked Aveeno Intense Relief Repair Cream [[ASIN:B001M0S9QO Aveeno Active Naturals Intense Relief Repair Cream - 16 Oz]] this cream has an identical ingredient list with the exception of ceramide NP for ceramide 3.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> excellent, as are all Aveeno products</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion around.  I have tried many different brands, and this works best for me.  I like that it has no added fragrance.  I have very dry skin, due to sjogrens syndrome.  Aveeno keeps my skin moist and prevents the itching and flaking.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is a web page issue for amazon, but the blue topped intensive skin cream is super !</li>
    <li> Great stuff if you have really dry skin, but doesn&#x27;t make you feel too oily. Nice product.</li>
    <li> nice cream if you have dry skin it is better than most creams on the market and it does not have a lot of bad things in it my husband use it and it does not have a smell to it so he uses it he has dry skin it works</li>
    <li> Nothing works for me as far as body lotion, this stuff is amazing it work s perfectly.  Most lotions leave a coat that scape off or drys up completely in an hour.  This is the only one that works for days.</li>
    <li> Truly an incredible product.  It applies easily and works to sink into your skin well.  I hope they find a way to keep cost down, kinda pricy.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful.  Really absorbs into the skin while not leaving a film as many others do.  No fragrance makes it easy to use with other products.  Love this cream and have switched to it permanently.</li>
    <li> Buy it for frd, but cannot allow to order more than 5.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of cream but this is so good.  One tub lasts a little over a month and I use it after a shower.  My skin is so soft and no greasiness.  I also use it at night along with my other moisturizer to deep moisturize my face at night.  A great, great value!</li>
    <li> I went to Curacao on vacation and during my trip, my legs below my knees started itching like crazy. I use a different Aveeno product daily, so it wasn&#x27;t dry skin. Bugged me after I returned home. Felt like poison ivy or chiggers, but there were not any signs of anything of the sort. So I gave this specific product a try and it immediately stopped the itching. Still don&#x27;t know what it was that caused it, but this lotion took care of it.</li>
    <li> What more can I say, even on the hands that are in water a lot.  It stays for some time and reapplying brings them back again to soft moist skin, instead of dry and uncomfortable. For the body, it is very, very effective and gets deep into the layers of skin to moisturize.</li>
    <li> This cream has substance and absorbs right into the skin. Leaves it smooth and last long. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really works for me.</li>
    <li> I am very please with the overall experience. The Aveeno cream was just what I wanted and the price was great. I will certainly will use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the cream yet but it is NOT a nice scent.</li>
    <li> One of my friends is a bio-engineer working for cosmetic company.  He highly recommend this product to us.  It is a very good product.  It protects you from dryness but doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy.  very good!  Highly recommend it even you have oily skin!</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my husband and he loves it.  Works well no complaints.  Will order it again.  It feels great when applying it to your body.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this primarily but I&#x27;ve been known to use it occasionally or just for my hands. He really likes the jar feature so he can clean it out completely and not have to pump or shake and squeeze furiously. It also works into the skin quite readily and without a greasy or heavy film. I think that is due to its almost whipped consistency. Like any cream product though, the least amount you can use and work into the skin the quicker and better it does so. This product is a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream but was not the one I thought I was buying.  In the description it said it contained menthol, which it did not.&lt;br /&gt;The product I wanted contains menthol and is the very best cream EVER for extreme dry skin and itching.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find it...</li>
    <li> I love this for my sensitive skin.  It truly is fragrance free, which is a must for me.  Thank you, Aveeno!</li>
    <li> this product was good it made my skin smooth. i look radiant these days. everyone says im pretty. pretty ugly. damn. aveeno!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands from doing a lot of dish and bottle washing. My hands were cracked and bleeding. This lotion made a huge difference in just the first day!!</li>
    <li> Very good and mild enough that it can be applied daily.  Really helps to keep my skin moist through the day.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive and dry skin and relieves itching.  Worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a redhead with freckles but a fair skinned brunette and I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been moisturizing since I&#x27;ve been 16 and I feel it&#x27;s the key to keeping your skin young along with avoiding the sun.&lt;br /&gt;It could be genetics but I&#x27;m 49 and people mistake me for 35.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the Aveeno products are the best out there. Forget about expensive department store brands. Lately, my hands were getting a little dry and rashy due to cleaning and using chemical disinfectants without gloves and this formulation worked well in restoring the moisture so that my skin looked and felt great again.&lt;br /&gt;I use all the different Aveeno formulas for moisturizing my body and they&#x27;re fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Always moisturize after a shower because your body absorbs more when you&#x27;re still wet.(An old tip from my mother).&lt;br /&gt;And for people suffering from body rashes that don&#x27;t respond to prescriptions or if you want to try something natural and inexpensive first, buy some Aveeno Colloidal Oatmeal. It&#x27;s basically an oatmeal powder that you can bathe in and it&#x27;s great for contact dermatitis and other bothersome rashy issues that may not respond to conventional treatment.</li>
    <li> The dry weather in here made my skin dry so much even my skin is not that type. After using it for several days, the skin condition is better. However the Cream&#x27;s ingredient: petrolatum is not good for skin, so it&#x27;s better to use it twice a week instead of daily.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with extreme dry skin, please buy this product. A friend has chemo and the hands were really feeling awful and flaking and painful. Applying this balm solved the problem! It works:)</li>
    <li> non-greasy, smooths skin</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this in a ritual of, shower- don&#x27;t dry completely, olive oil and then Aveeno. It really worked for me. I was so dry that my skin looked like a snake. I had white peeling skin, from medication or just from being in the hospital for 3 months. Even without the ritual, when I just just the Aveeno skin relief, it makes my skin look and feel so much better. I also like that I don&#x27;t have to use much. This big container has lasted 2 months already and I&#x27;m sure it will last at least 2 more.</li>
    <li> I have very dry scaly skin, a severe form of Ichthyosis that covers my whole body. The only solution for my 60+ years on this planet have been quality moisturizers that are non-greasy and relatively odor free. I&#x27;ve found that Aveeno products out perform much more expensive lotions and cream by keeping itchiness down and the skin relatively soft, but even they wear off within an hour or two. This new cream is comparable to the Aveeno skin relief overnight cream in nearly eliminating the itchiness and keeping all areas covered moisturized for about 8 hours, but is easier to spread than that tube-based product. I highly recommend it to those with similar issues.</li>
    <li> Great!! Use it daily in the morning and before going to bed..........Great on elbows that are rough. I Love It</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recently recommended this.  I was using the Aveeno lotion but like the cream even more for my occasional dermatitis (which means, in my case, very dry and very itchy hands if I get fragrance or cleaning chemicals on them or pet dogs).  Definitely recommend.  (Also: very creamy but not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy afterwards!)</li>
    <li> It seems I&#x27;m never really happy with body creams, lotions, etc.  Lately I&#x27;ve gravitated toward unscented creams, and I think I&#x27;ve finally I&#x27;ve found one I&#x27;ll stick with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisture Repair Cream (Unscented) has what I consider the perfect consistency for a body cream.  It&#x27;s liquidy-creamy, neither runny nor too thick.  It feels wonderful going on, soaks in quickly and leaves no oily residue on hands or anywhere else.  The skin is left feeling fresh and soft - and clothes can be put on pretty much right away.  An unexpected benefit: the backs of my upper arms, which haven&#x27;t responded to loofah scrubbing or other creams, are becoming smooth and bump-free after just a few days of applying this Aveeno cream after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is a product I&#x27;m genuinely happy to have found.  I will stock up for the winter.  I confess I discovered it at my favorite local drug store, and paid a significantly lower price than shown here.  But honestly, I think I would pay a bit more rather than do without.</li>
    <li> Does everything you need for severely dry skin.  Not greasy, easily absorbed and makes your skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using it for many years. The best body cream for the dry and cold winter. Will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product but I like the tall dispenser bottle better.  It is a wonderful moisturizer and I never have a dry itch ever!</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveeno products for years.  My skin is extremely sensitive and tends to break out easily. Aveeno products are calming and gentle and really make your skin soft.  I use Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream on my face (at night) and body and I absolutely love the way it absorbs quickly and takes away the nasty winter itchiness.  I absolutely recommenced this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Just the right consistency.  Not too greasy and not to watery.  And being unscented adds to its value!  I really love the convenience of being able to order this product on line and no having to stand in line in the grocer and pay more for it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry skin.  I even use it on my face.  It helps to keep ezcema at bay.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I think the description of &amp;#34;intense moisture&amp;#34; is spot on!  The moment I used it on my face, I could seemingly hear my skin saying, &#x27;thank you for giving me what I wanted and needed---FINALLY!&#x27;  The cream is not greasy and there is no noticeable odor--which is a double plus!  A little bit goes a long way and it lasts all day.  I tend to get really dry on my forehead and neck area during the cold winter months, but, this intense moisturizing cream just shut all that madness down! Aveeno knows skin relief!!!!  I have used the less expensive skin moisturizers in the past, but, now that I decided to try Aveeno, I am sticking to it.  My skin is smooth, soft and most of all---not dry.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  My dad was a diabetic, and I bought it for him several years ago.  I found the jar when I was going through some of his things, and ordered more for both Mom and I.  This cream moisturizes without leaving you greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of Aveeno products in the past but this one truly is a moisturizing cream that lasts as it states on the jar. Recommend this to anyone who needs and wants soft moisturized skin.</li>
    <li> I was SO distressed when they stopped selling the old version of this, and totally happy to see they came out with a new one. Its worth the price - I&#x27;ve got very very dry skin (cracking feet, peeling fingers, and eczema) and this is one of the only lotions that actually works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that with continuous use, my skin doesn&#x27;t get so dry to begin with. I very highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> As always Aveno is a great lotion. I like the tub because you get to use every little bit. Seems the pump bottle alwaysw wastes the last few ounces.</li>
    <li> Best Cream I ever used  to smooth out my dry cracked hands. I  put it on nightly for nice smooth hands in the morning. Haven&#x27;t had to use vaseline &amp; cotton gloves for relief. This is the best  moisturizing cream on the market!</li>
    <li> Love this. Not greasy but is a  great moisturizer! Fragrance free so it doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies! Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> This is the best thing we have ever tried for dry skin especially good on the soles of your feet. Apply right after a shower . Not greasy at all and very soothing.</li>
    <li> This cream is worth to recommend.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite moisturizer.  It leaves my skin very smooth, not greasy and is one of the longest lasting moisturizers I have found.  It is an added plus that there is not strong scent.  I can&#x27;t be without this one.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and eczema.  If I go just one day without using deep moisturizing body wash and this amazing moisturizing cream, my body feels noticeably dry.  As someone with chronic dry skin and constant battling eczema, this Aveeno moisturizing cream is a life saver.  I went through countless brands of lotions, creams, and oils.  I tried many before I found this and even while using this, I went ahead and tried other lotions, creams and oils as I came across others&#x27; experiences.  I thought that maybe something would work even better and be cheaper.  In the end, I always came back to this product.  It is hands down the only product that works to keep my skin soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this were sold in gallon jars, I&#x27;d probably buy it.  Especially, if i could save money by buying in bulk.  Until then, I&#x27;ll be ordering this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The cream rubs in quickly and makes your skin feel smooth and soft. Can&#x27;t wait to try thebody wash.</li>
    <li> MY wife just loves it, calls it her \\&quot;go to\\&quot; cream. I buy this for her every 6 months or so and it makes her very happy.</li>
    <li> This is not easy to find in drug stores.  Fragrance free.  No nonsense.  All their fragrance free stuff is excellent.  I think the quality is better than Curel.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of cream but this is so good. One tub lasts a little over a month and I use it after a shower. My skin is so soft and no greasiness. I also use it at night along with my other moisturizer to deep moisturize my face at night. A great, great value!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that both guarantees deep moisture and all ingredients have absolutely no long term side effects. This one does it and is not expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the first winter of my life that I have had my skin dry up so fast like it has been. I concocted a mixture of Shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter oil, vitamin e oil and have been putting it on my skin just for my skin to suck it in and be dry and itchy in about 2 hours. Yesterday, I bought this product, along with the matching body wash. No dryness, no itching.  I slept without scratching all freaking night for the first night in a month or so. What a relief! This is my new wintertime lotion.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this, I did not have high hopes.  I have very dry skin, with a strong tendency toward eczema, and this winter it has been particularly itchy and irritated.  The Aveeno cream was less emollient and creamy (more moist) than what I was using, so I didn&#x27;t expect much.  However, after about 5 days of daily use (after my morning shower) I definitely noticed that my skin was less itchy and irritated in the evening.  It works.</li>
    <li> Very good for my dry whole body.</li>
    <li> I really suffer from dry itchy skin in the winter. The dryness can be painful at times and Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream is thick, rich and soothing balm. It gives all day relief and my skin feels so soft! My Mom tried some of my moisturizing cream and has become a big fan of it as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery time and product really moisturizes dry skin.</li>
    <li> A personal favorite, it works extremely well for extremely dry and damaged skin. My sister-in-law tried it while at my house and loved it, so I got her one of her very own and she&#x27;s delighted. Rather difficult to find in retail stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using many other types of moisturizers that just weren&#x27;t doing it for my skin. My skin is combination, so some of the areas on my face would be oily while others would be so dry, they would flake constantly. It was embarrassing to deal with, and make up won&#x27;t cover flakes. I bought this and used it on my face and my body. Three days later and my skin is in much better condition. My face isn&#x27;t flaking much at all and the dryness is gone from my arms and legs. It&#x27;s been a lifesaver. I&#x27;m getting married in less than two weeks and I am going to be able to walk down the aisle with confidence.</li>
    <li> It works over night on the driest of skin. I love this stuff and swear by it. I use it between my thighs where my skin often gets so dry it starts to peel and flake. One night of this stuff and my skin is so much better.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;prescribed&amp;#34; by my dermatologist.  he said lotion was not enough for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream for very dry skin. It smells very good, and it really works overnight. I live in a very hot country, and this cream is a little heavy for the summer, so I use it in winter and after shower before sleeping.</li>
    <li> Works well. You can use lots or little and it just adds to the normal lotion that one buys. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy and costs less than the stores.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed since they replaced the old formula with this one.  I have eczema and extra dry itchy skin, the original formula worked great, this doesn&#x27;t relieve the itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Aveeno specially formulated eczema in a tube and it works much better than this.</li>
    <li> Better than nothing.  I really had high expectations after reading other reviews, but this falls short.  It is almost watery and doesn&#x27;t relieve eczema itching.  Maybe for just regular dry skin, but not when you have severe dry and itchy skin.  Will keep looking for a better product.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> A good moisturizing cream. Good for extra dry skin. I have tried many cream for extra dry skin, and this works fairly well.</li>
    <li> Great price and a great product. Nothing else makes my skin feel as moisturized as Aveeno.</li>
    <li> This is one of Best moisture cream for my son who has very dry skin and eczema.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my wife, and she loves it. It does really protect the skin as described on the container. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to protect his/her skin.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST moisturizing cream I have ever used for my dry arms and legs.  I will be buying this again and again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too big. I can use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Like putting water on your skin - works well.</li>
    <li> I was getting &amp;#34;old lady skin&amp;#34;...and hating it!  Now my skin looks soft and moist...I wouldnt use anything else. My girlfriend who works witha plastic surgeon told me its what they recommend for their patients....</li>
    <li> Can solve the problem about itchy and dry issue. And did not have any specific smell which will influence your using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from extremely dry skin and eczema since I was a child. This is the lotion I swear by. It makes my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products. Some burn, some are sticky, and some just don&#x27;t work. This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> My mother and I both have very dry skin....enough to have to go to a dermatologist for eczema which is another word for very dry skin. This Aveeno product does the job very well and does not have fragrances or a lot of chemicals added, which is another plus. It is a little pricey but it does work very well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little thin. I would like to see it as thick as the Aveeno that comes in tubes.</li>
    <li> I use the body lotion, the body wash,  the facial cleanser and the moisturizer, can&#x27;t go wrong with a good product.  Alaska plays havoc with every ones skin.</li>
    <li> Another healer and something I keep on hand! I actually like it better than the Eucerin. Eucerin worked well in the beginning--and I need the Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream (Aveeno) for the present situation. Will keep using this as a regular skin care product.</li>
    <li> Aveeno skin relief gets 5 stars for keeping the skin on my wrists, hands and feet from cracking and splitting. A lot of lotions dry out my skin and leave an oily coating. Aveeno is one of the few lotions I am able to use with my super dry skin. I love that it does not have a overwhelming smell. I have MCS and many smells make me sick. The lotion absorbs wonderfully into super dry skin and will not leave an oily left over feeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nothing short of miraculous! I have very itchy, dry skin; any and every cream I&#x27;ve used previously has been only marginally effective. A friend with a similar problem recommended it. I tried it and have been itch free for over 2 years! (Ok, it did meet its match in Las Vegas last March and there was some itching. However, I try to avoid that place as much as possible anyway, except for the occasional family visit. But it did help somewhat when nothing else previously has.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m signed up for Amazon&#x27;s auto reorder - one jar every 2 months.</li>
    <li> The only cream that healed my sensitive skin this winter!</li>
    <li> I have a severe form of Atopic Dermatitis, which I have had since the age of 8 months. I have seen countless dermatologists and tried countless products. Nothing really made a difference (except cortisone of course, but that is not viable for a constant treatment). Until I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;The reason is most likely that this cream creates a very strong film that lasts for an entire day (unless you sweat or wash it off, of course). The main issue with Atopic Dermatitis is that the skin barrier is defective, letting foreign particles through the skin. In fact I have strong allergic reactions towards anything that is fine powder (dust, chalk, gloves powder, cat dander, etc.). So I believe this cream works so well for A.T. because basically it creates a second skin and allows the allergens not to penetrate, like a normal skin would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months ago I rescued a cat, and my dermatitis exploded to the point that it was painful to even take a shower with just water. I had rash from head to toes, but did not want to give up my cat because I love him so much.&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried this cream, and it worked instantly, from the very first application I noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am now, finally, clear of rash and can live without the constant itch and burning.&lt;br /&gt;I have to apply it twice a day at least, and any time after I sweat or take a shower. A jar lasts about a week, so it does get a bit expensive, but it is SO worth it, it has hugely improved the quality of my life. I just hope Aveeno will continue making this!&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I would give a hundred stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT February 2017: I have been free of Atopic Dermatitis symptoms for years now! My life is soooo much better. This Aveeno cream allowed me to break the inflammation cycle. Now I don&#x27;t use it as much, only occasionally if needed. I went back to using coconut oil and squalane oil. But the oils did not work when I had rash from head to toes. I strongly believe this cream allowed the skin barrier to slowly restore itself so now I no longer need it as much. But when I get a patch of rash (rarely) I still use it and it is always helpful.n barrier to slowly restore itself so now I no longer need it as much. But when I get a patch of rash (rarely) I still use it and it is always helpful.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin. I love Aveeno products! Sometimes I even use it on my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> I mix it with oil of Olay Complete Moisturizer w/Sunscreen (Sensitive) to stretch it and so that the 2nd main ingredient glycerine doesn&#x27;t break me out. I am 56 with some deep lines in my face caused by extreme weight gain followed by extreme weight loss (out of control Thyroid). Those deep smile lines were red in the crevaces, as stretch marks will do. Within 2 months of use that redness went away. The best part? This combo works so well in plumping up and filling in those deep lines that I don&#x27;t require face primer prior to foundation! I put it on my face &amp; neck in the morning and let it soak in for 10-15 mins and again at night at least 30 mins before going to bed. Smoother, softer skin and deep lines reduced by 50%. Another combo that works like this with the Oil of Olay is Argan Oil Moisturizer for hair (I believe i did a review on that too), but this Aveeno does the same thing for less money and doesn&#x27;t break me out like the Argan Oil tends to.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by my dermatologist but difficult to find in this size.  It was a great price.</li>
    <li> Recently I have had skin problems that have required me to see a Dermatologist.  He recommended Aveeno lotions so I started off buying some to try at my local store.  After I found that it was working for me and I wasn&#x27;t have any reactions to it, I found this lotion on Amazon and have been buying it here instead.  This cream has done wonders for helping my dry skin and itching caused by eczema and I highly recommend it to anyone suffering from itchy dry skin.  I use it from the neck down and it feels so good.  I have tried other lotions, other more expensive ones as well and personally I have found Aveeno to be the best in terms of quality and price.</li>
    <li> ordered by mistake was looking for the same product with menthol that seems to be discontinued</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin after chemo and have tried so many OTC and even expensive prescriptions but this has worked the best for me.  It soaks in and I don&#x27;t scratch.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve got lotion layering on my skin.  I&#x27;m a picture so if I feel a bump or scratch or rub and it moves I unintentionally dig and this stuff has soaked in, a rarely scratch and then its usually about time for the evening application.  When I apply at night, even with the mild hot flashes it keeps me from scratching, a nice lubricating product that doesn&#x27;t layer on top, it really soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;noknots</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel softer and better, use it on my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I loved the old version of Aveeno moisturizing cream in a tub.  It was rich and thick and a little bit went a long way and totally prevented dry skin.  The new version has been reformulated and is much lighter, more &amp;#34;watery,&amp;#34; and not as dense or rich.  This makes it messier to use and you have to use more to get the same moisturizing effect.  Advice to Aveeno:  Go back to your old formula.  The new one does not make me want to be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> My wife has psoriasis and uses this line for some time already, your skin is soft and not oily, she loves it!</li>
