      <li>What an amazing product to transition off the anti-persp.</li>
      <li>This however is honest to God amazing no rash</li>
      <li>This deodorant is amazing, but i have to emphasize it&#x27;s a deodorant - not an anti perspirant.</li>
      <li>If you still want to buy Lavanila deodorant proceed with caution and do some  research in order to make up your own mind.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s silky, it has a nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t too stinky(I</li>
      <li>Instead, it has kind of a musky, powdery scent - not at all</li>

      <li>/&gt;Overall I really liked this product.</li>
      <li>I think I kind of sweat a lot (might just be too ashamed to admit it outright. . .), but this does the job for me all day.</li>

      <li>The best all natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>-- This is the best natural deodorant i&#x27;ve tried but still does leave a lot to be desired.</li>
      <li>The product is also very moisturizing and smells incredible.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m happy to have an all natural effective deodorant!</li>
      <li>but once you get over that hump, you&#x27;re fine and can really test these healthier deodorants to find which one works best for you.</li>
      <li>Although it smells good and worked to keep my armpits clean</li>
      <li>Smells great and worked well at first, but gave me a rash after a fews weeks.</li>
      <li>The first three months i used this it was great.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing but not too strong.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Many of my friends rave about this product.</li>
      <li>I reluctantly stuck with a mainstream deodorant/antiperspirant even though more and more studies are showing the toxicity of some of the ingredients - until I found Lavanila.</li>
      <li>it does work slightly better than the one I had been using which was Herban cowboy.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for yearssss.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it and will probably never use another.</li>
      <li>The great plus is that it is really skin conditioning/moisturizing.</li>
      <li>hope you have better luck than me...</li>
      <li>but -- as I said, it&#x27;s better than others i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I love this line but no ma&#x27;am on the vanilla.</li>
      <li>One too many friends have found lumps.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE lavanila.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I do not wear this on days I know I will sweat more.</li>
      <li>I use to like Lavanila but after using this deodorant for many years I have started to develop a rash.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and moisturizing component.</li>
      <li>I like Pit Putty more.</li>
      <li>It is OK.  </li>
      <li>However, I love the product just wish it was part of Amazon Prime.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really want to love this deodorant. I just don&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t work. I put it on at 7am by 10am I need to reapply. By 12pm I have body odor and the vanilla smell really doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla at all. It smells kinda gross actually. I will use it occasionally until its gone. but I prefer wearing nothing to wearing this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for yearssss. It smells GREAT and is a healthy deodorant. Since it is so expensive, I only use it for times when I have to look nice like when I&#x27;m in the office or going out.</li>
    <li> I purchased the sample size of this from Sephora. I love the scent, it&#x27;s really nice... but I would be smelling again within two hours. It was nice while I had it, but I wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase it.</li>
    <li> This deodorant was ok. It smells pleasant and feels nice when it is applied. It didn&#x27;t make it through my work day though. I am a dental hygienist and I have to be in people&#x27;s personal space while I clean their teeth. This deodorant worked better than all of the others that I had tried up to that point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants because in my experience, they don&#x27;t work very well. In some I found that bacteria would sit on the stick and grow (I guess because of the non chemical properties) and eventually you&#x27;d be applying BO smell to your body which obviously defeats the purpose. In many others  I found that they worked pretty well for about a half day which is fine provided you bring it with you and remember to re-apply. Finally most were weirdly drying on my skin or left a lot of goop behind which stained my mostly black wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve found that this vanilla stick works well and doesn&#x27;t make a mess. As far as I can tell I smell ok and my clothes aren&#x27;t ruined, and I can wear sleeveless tops without any visible product stuck to my skin.</li>
    <li> The product gave me an underarm rash.  I purchased this product to use while undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer. I saw a YouTube recommendation. I hoped to keep using it long term but due to the immediate irritation it caused I had to stop using it.  I liked the lovely vanilla scent and that it has no aluminum. It&#x27;s too bad that it contains other irritants.  I have NEVER before had a reaction to an underarm product, and only rarely any skin reaction to a product. I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this deodorant! It like this product, but I do have one complaint - it does not cover my odor all day long. I can usually start to tell it wears off by late afternoon.</li>
    <li> As a guy looking for a all natural deodorant, let me just say it isn&#x27;t easy.  Most products are marketed towards ladies and leave my armpits smelling like a flower or lemon.  This one happens to be vanilla.  Once you get the thought of your moms deodorant out of your head it is pretty acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides all the complaining the deodorant actual worked well for me.  Only had to use it once on most days.  Scent lasts and easy to apply compared to some all natural deodorants.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smaller travel size version of this--it became dry and crumbly very quickly. However, the full size version is amazing. I LOVE the clean vanilla scent, and it is lasting. I do not wear this on days I know I will sweat more. I usually wear this at night and when I am at home. For that purpose, it works well and I have no issues. I will continue to purchase this product for its cruelty free natural ingredients and amazing scent!</li>
    <li> smells great, but kinda smells like a men&#x27;s deodorant. ALSO, it does not help with stopping the sweat. It actually makes it feel like i&#x27;m sweating more and I can definitely feel it more. ..... not so great of a product. BUT it&#x27;s all natural ingredients so that I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and that is easy to wash off</li>
    <li> NO. No. No. No.&lt;br /&gt;Huge waste of money. I will give myself cancer with regular deodorant rather than stink.</li>
    <li> Meh. Doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla. Works for a couple hours but I don&#x27;t want to spend all day reapplying</li>
    <li> Smells great and has a nice texture.</li>
    <li> Many people have complained of rash and it not working...I have neither problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered Vanilla, Vanilla Grapefruit, and most recently Blackberry and Vanilla (I believe).  I will never use &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it goes on, it is a warm feeling, but not uncomfortable, and does not stain my clothing.  I find that I do get through my 8.5 hour work day (where I am up and active, not sitting all day), and a 3-8 mile hike afterward...no odor.  Now, if I take a shower, go to work, hike, come home and not shower due to being too tired or something, I will wake up with odor.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to &amp;#34;blame&amp;#34; that on the deodorant, though.  I should be showering after doing all of that, anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to last a very long time...well worth the money you spend on it!  I never thought I would buy such pricey deodorant, but it is the &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; product and works well.  I will be a forever user!</li>
    <li> I have waited two years and seven months to write this review. I have used this deodorant for six days now. It is fantastic. I have no complaints. It smells great! It works great! I cannot express my excitement and am overjoyed. I have literally tried over 40...yes over forty different natural deodorants these last two years and seven months. It has been a long nightmare of rashes, itching, burning, raw skin, stained clothes and stink. Plus the money. Oh my the expensive over the years ugh. From store bought to Etsy to homemade deodorants that others swore by but nothing has worked until Lavanila. Thank you for this product. I&#x27;m extremely determined and knew I would find the right deodorant for me one day. Today was the ultimate test-It&#x27;s August in Texas I worked the morning indoors with no air conditioning lifting and stocking then this evening had a tough workout for an hour and a half. Lavanila you rock! Highly recommend in case you hadn&#x27;t gathered that. You have a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few years and have to say I really like it.  I&#x27;m sensitive to the aluminum in antiperspirants so this is a great fit for me.  There are several fragrances but I like the plain vanilla best as it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as vanilla as I was expecting but it is a nice and fresh clean scent that lasts through the whole day, although I&#x27;d reapply before a long run. The plus side for it not being so feminine smelling is my hubby will wear it too. Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews, I really thought that this would be a great natural alternative to my current deodorant. The first day I wore it to an outdoor event, and the deodorant seemed to hold up just fine. The second day, I applied it after my morning workout and shower.  By the end of a my workday, I caught a whiff of someone who apparently didn&#x27;t believe in wearing deodorant. After close inspection, I realized that someone was me.  So I will stick with the chemical-laden Degree antiperspirant/deodorant because I don&#x27;t wanna stink!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes and it smelled nice, clean, but it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant so after a few months using it every morning, now summer&#x27;s coming around and I&#x27;ve started getting rashes! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so this is rare. I&#x27;ll have to switch back to a normal aluminum containing deododant and chuck this one away...hopefully I&#x27;m not too sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tree-hugger about deodorant. One too many friends have found lumps. This is way better than the Toms or the Crystal or Vitamin C or the billion other weird ones that I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not strong at all, and I can only smell the vanilla when I put it on. I think I kind of sweat a lot (might just be too ashamed to admit it outright. . .), but this does the job for me all day. Have had to reapply after plane rides, but otherwise does a solid job.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla. It&#x27;s more of a powdery smell, which is pleasant. It goes on feeling a little wet. It actually does work though. When I do serious sweaty workouts it doesn&#x27;t hold up completely (maybe because the sweat kind of washes it away), but for everyday stuff it&#x27;s fantastic. It lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have tried a whole lot in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant arena for the past few years. This brand is thee one so far I am subtracting a star for the cost though. It is outrageously priced for 2 oz. I will continue to search though for a cheaper substitute.</li>
    <li> Great product with very pleasant scent.  I&#x27;ve tried other all natural deodorants but they weren&#x27;t that strong.  I would use a sensitive skin version of a regular deodorant when exercising but this product manages just fine so I&#x27;m happy to have an all natural effective deodorant!</li>
    <li> No A Huge Fan Of The Scent</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all. Not worth the money in my opinion. On YouTube I saw some reviews that stated you need to give it a month to work because it has to adjust to the chemistry in your body. Puh! Yeah, no thanks. I switched to Crystal Essence (Lavender &amp; White Tea) roll on and it works great</li>
    <li> Not to sure if product dies the job, same result as regular deoderant.</li>
    <li> The only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, among many, that actually works!</li>
    <li> I love this product. And it smells great. I just wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but way too expensive for as long as it lasts.</li>
    <li> Worked well, but I didn&#x27;t like the scent.  I will only use if it&#x27;s an event I want to be perfumed for.</li>
    <li> The best all natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!  It smells great - no perfume necessary!  It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the Lavanila Pure Vanilla perfume, but the scent is still really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the deodorant isn&#x27;t strong enough to last though my gym sessions, but it&#x27;s definitely good for daily wear.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells so good! Kind of pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while before switching to the Grapefruit one.  I have no complaints with the Lavanilla, but just personally preferred the Grapefruit better.</li>
    <li> It works!!!  It really, really works!!!  Man, I have been on a two month mission to find some organic deodorant that actually works, and let&#x27;s just say I did not smell well in that two months at all!!!  I sweat a lot, even when I am not exerting any energy, I don&#x27;t know why but I know it runs in the family.  And I have used prescription strength antiperspirants, over the counter, and I apply a lot.  I got to thinking, I sure am putting a lot of chemicals in my body and this will probably not end well for me.  I&#x27;ve been eating organic for the last couple of years, so I figured I need to start switching out everything else I use on my body... shampoos, conditioners, toothpaste, and deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a little pricey, but as the saying goes... You are either going to pay for it now, or pay for it later.</li>
    <li> Having had breast cancer, I was looking totally de-toxify my bathroom cabinet when I came across this little gem...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say???  I&#x27;m on my 3rd lot and now even have my daughters fighting over it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT.  There will ALWAYS be negative reviews, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t take any notice of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product I ever bought, only wish I&#x27;d discovered it years ago ! x</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant--it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I love that it&#x27;s also a simple vanilla scent which I think is great for guys. Vanilla is also a natural aphrodisiac!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I am not a wet sweater to be frank but I do hate/have body oder. This lasts the entire work day. I do tend to reapply once I get home or if going somewhere after work. Smell is not too strong.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of Lavanila and I LOVE it.  It smells great and I feel like it works well for me.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands; however, this remains my go-to deodorant!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have very sensitive skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t break out my arms. Fast shipper as well</li>
    <li> This product actually works. I&#x27;m not sure how, but it does. It keeps my underarms dry and comfortable through a moderately paced eight hour work day. I am not involved with any sort of manual/physical labor, however. The product is also very moisturizing and smells incredible. I also recommend the lavender vanilla if you enjoy this scent.</li>
    <li> Wow. This is perhaps the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I would be better to go without anything!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have a reaction o the formulation. Many of my friends rave about this product.</li>
    <li> Horrible!! Gave me a very awful rash! Do not use if you have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and creamy ,smell nice !</li>
    <li> I have problems with store bought, big name deodorants. They make me break out on my underarms and cause other problems as well. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and there has been such a remarkable improvement to my skin, it&#x27;s really unbelievable. The scent is light and smells wonderful (I have the regular vanilla scent) and I can&#x27;t wait to try the others. I won&#x27;t be buying any other deodorant again and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive pits for so long. No other skin on my body is sensitive but my armpits would turn red, itch like crazy, and peel when trying other natural deodorants. I went back to aluminum deodorants for a while but I said no more! Aluminum is a poison and is absorbed into the skin and is linked to cancers and enough badness that I had to declare myself done. So I had to find SOMETHING that would work. I&#x27;ve been reading negative reviews and I wanna say that everyone&#x27;s gotta have their natural deo journey and find what works for them but please keep in mind, this will NOT stop you from sweating. You&#x27;ll sweat. It&#x27;s your biology and this contains no poisons that obstruct or impair your sweat glands. This is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. It will make you smell nice! When you first switch from aluminum to natural, your body detoxes and your armpit sweat smells especially bad but once you get over that hump, you&#x27;re fine and can really test these healthier deodorants to find which one works best for you. This one smells AMAZING and has never even remotely threatened to blister my armpits. It costs, but that&#x27;s a personal matter. I pay more for cosmetics and toiletries as it is. I love that it&#x27;s gentle on me and smells soooo good. Definitely find what works for you, but I would recommend anyone try this if the price point wasn&#x27;t an issue for them!</li>
    <li> It has a very refreshing scent. It also feels cool when applied.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of $15.  This deodorant has no staying power whatsoever.  I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, nor do I struggle with excessive armpit odor, so I thought I would give this a try based on the other reviews.  I applied the deodorant fresh out of the shower, and within 3 hours; it had worn off almost completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To describe the smell...it smells like Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s bedtime bath wash/lotion for babies.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the lavendar vanilla, so I was a bit surprised by the scent.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have bought and the roller broke after a couple of uses so now the deodorant will not come up.  Very disappointed since it is $15 and is a deodorant that actually works.</li>
    <li> see my other review on the same product, different &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and am reviewing it in hopes more people will buy it so they will keep making it forever, which is approximately how long I intend to keep buying it. Plain vanilla scent is the way to go. Simple, pleasant scent, vanilla with a touch of baking soda, not too sweet or foodie or cloying. This is the first non-commercial / non-aluminum (non-anti-perspirant) deodorant I&#x27;ve ever been able to stick with. I love it and love that it&#x27;s a safer and more natural option. I bought some for my mom and she swears it&#x27;s all she&#x27;ll ever use now, too.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. I have waited a few weeks to really put this deodorant to the test. Yesterday I ran a half marathon in 90 degree weather and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product. I am allergic to antiperspirant and the doctor advises to avoid all aluminium products. I&#x27;ve cycled through several products available at local  pharmacies and each product disappointed - and I ended up pretty stinky at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I work in an industrial environment and I am also a runner. Lavanilla - Pure Vanilla doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a perfume counter at the department store and also doesn&#x27;t require a second application. It goes on smooth and does not feel sticky. I look forward to trying the other scents.</li>
    <li> I use to like Lavanila but after using this deodorant for many years I have started to develop a rash.  I just happened to read another review on Amazon  warning buyers of Lavanila that this deodorant contains the ingredient carrageenan which may actually promote breast tumor growth.  I am really concerned because the reason I switched to this product is that  the doctor told me that I have a condition that could lead to breast cancer in the future.  I did research on carrageenan which  has scared me enough that personally  I will not  be buying  products with this ingredient any longer.  This ingredient is also in many food products,  especially in some dairy products.  I just ordered another all natural deodorant which is even organic from Amazon which I hope works.  If you still want to buy Lavanila deodorant proceed with caution and do some  research in order to make up your own mind.  Hopefully, Lavanila laboratories will take this ingredient out of Lavanila deodorant  to be on the safe side and not put consumers at risk.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I also thought the smell of it was a little overbearing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and moisturizing component. At times, I still am left wet under the arms but it&#x27;s no more than I would be if I was using Secret or another antiperspirant; without the aluminum and toxins. I have been using this deodorant for about a year now; it works well for me.</li>
    <li> The concept of a healthy deodorant is great and I read a lot of positive reviews so I decided to give it a try.  Does it perform as well as Secret, or one of the other mainstream deodorants, no.  But, that being said, it does work.  I find that on a regular day it&#x27;s probably best to reapply at least one time, but I usually just do it again before bed.  I haven&#x27;t worked out enough since using this to give a good review, but I added more before my workout and didn&#x27;t feel like I smelled any worse than using regular deodorant.... It doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating, but you work out to sweat!  Overall, I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I will get a little stinky after a while if I don&#x27;t reapply, but I&#x27;d rather that than use deodorants that could be harmful to my health.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells awesome and best of all it&#x27;s aluminum-free!</li>
    <li> Love this! Will be the only deodorant I will buy now. Nice smell keeps me fresh.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  I smelled like sweaty vanilla after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Spanish &amp; I swear &amp; I get stinky!!!!! I have tried all and any deodorant out there!!! I used to swear by the Dove clinical strength. But it started giving me a rash after over a decade of using it. This however is honest to God amazing no rash no itching and I put it on once a day and I&#x27;m good. However if your going to do hard work or something you may want to apply it again.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me.  I live in South Fla. and I sweat if I&#x27;m out in the humidity.  This Lavanila keeps me dry and I love it!  I didn&#x27;t think I could go without an antiperspirant containing aluminum.</li>
    <li> it does work slightly better than the one I had been using which was Herban cowboy.  for those new to using natural deodorants, it will not stop you from sweating.  any deodorant will not stop you from sweating.  Only antiperspirant with cancer causing aluminum will.  the only problem I have with lavanila pure vanilla is that it does not smell like vanilla to me</li>
    <li> I have been trying different deodorants for a long time, and this one really surprised me. Great smell and lasts longer than most of the  other organic varieties. I will most likely be buying this product again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Smells nice but does not last all day</li>
    <li> Leo&#x27;s wife writing. Hated the smell and the texture. Leaves a white film. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> One star because is smells wonderfully amazing when you put it on. No more stars than that because I smell like a dirty hippie that&#x27;s been camping in the woods for a week, AN HOUR OR TWO LATER! I&#x27;ve tried figuring out what to layer this with since it does smell wonderful. Normally I don&#x27;t have such a noticeable body odor but I guess not having anti perspirant really makes a large difference with some people. Such a shame because like I said this product smells heavenly when you first put it on!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have seen that this PURE vanilla wasn&#x27;t PURE vanilla. It&#x27;s a bit floral which I don&#x27;t like. As a deodorant it works wonderfully. I think I like the lavender/vanilla scent better.</li>
    <li> honestly, this stuff smells amazing - love love love the smell but as a deodorant it doesn&#x27;t last at all - if it actually worked I would use it even though it is pretty expensive. Bummer</li>
    <li> I love this line but no ma&#x27;am on the vanilla. The scent did not go with my body chemistry. I like the vanilla-lemon, and the vanilla-grapefruit. I&#x27;m trying to decide btw the coconut or the lavender scent next.</li>
    <li> Great product! Nice pleasant fragrance works great.</li>
    <li> I find that on particularly sweaty days I need to reapply a couple of times.  Seems like the lasting power is not there, so I would recommend getting on for your purse.  Other than that the vanilla scent is nice, however I think a little more musky than I would like.</li>
    <li> Works really well! It&#x27;s summer in the south and you know pretty quick if your deodorant doesn&#x27;t work. Smells amazing but not too strong.</li>
    <li> I am a sweaty girl, but my doc doesn&#x27;t want me slathering aluminum all over my underarms.  Understand that this will not prevent you from sweating, but you will smell nice!  Very soothing to the skin.  My underarms are like a baby&#x27;s butt after using this for a month!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite deodorant ! It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant , so don&#x27;t expect it to work like commercial  American  deodorants . It will keep you smelling good all day . Pure vanilla  is my favorite scent. Finally a deodorant I can feel good about using! FYI...Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant doesn&#x27;t work at all !</li>
    <li> Best smelling one yet!!</li>
    <li> Not strong enough! Great for everyday use but not for a total body work out!</li>
    <li> Best price for this product. It works well.</li>
    <li> Moderate control of body odor but caused a problem with my sulfite intolerance.</li>
    <li> The first three months i used this it was great. Next thing i knew i was getting irritation and redness in my arm pits. I did my research and found out that caraganeen which is a sea weed derived product although completely natural but causes an inflamation of the immune system. This is the last thing i need since im off my RA meds and finaly having control over my immune system. I hope they can take it out. Although it smells good and worked to keep my armpits clean yet i wont be using it anymore unless they remove caraganeen.</li>
    <li> This a healthier choice by far, maybe not for someone avoiding corn - but I&#x27;m very happy with the performance of this deodorant. I&#x27;ve been off anti-perspirant types for some time now, so my transition to this was seamless, but for someone who has to go thru allowing the body to evolve from over use of the aluminium based products it may seems that it&#x27;s not working - keep trying. This feels great, it&#x27;s silky, it has a nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t too stinky(I am not a fan of over perfuming), and it really seems to last. I have recommended this to many people, and we&#x27;re really happy with the results , and to have finally found a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and used it for the first time today.  I have a lot of allergies and since Tom&#x27;s of Maine now puts zinc in their deodorant I can no longer use it.  I was concerned about finding a non allergenic product.  Today there was no itching and no rash.  I am hopeful, because I usually break out on the first day of use if there is a problem. I&#x27;ll write again in a few weeks. A  week later and still no rash or itching. Yeah! I love this deodorant, I find it works perfectly, no odor at the end of the day! I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was getting ingrown hairs under my arms all the time. I did some research and found it might be the chemicals in my antiperspirant. I switched to this all natural one. Haven&#x27;t had problems. And it has a great smell! The downside is that it is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. So, I do notice a little perspiration.</li>
    <li> this deodorant works well keeps you dry and smelling good for some hours.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product, smells good, feels good and I don&#x27;t seem to need to use it everyday. I&#x27;m 47yr old and have never really needed anything under my arms, but lately my body is changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order again. I will recommend to friends&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! I really wanted to like this product, but I&#x27;m allergic to it. Bad rash underarms after 3 days of use. You CANNOT return it, just a warning.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product to transition off the anti-persp.</li>
    <li> It is OK.  I like Pit Putty more.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant that I have ever used...</li>
    <li> Absolute fav deodorant !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product! I&#x27;m doing radiation and had to switch deodorants. I was horribly allergic to Tom&#x27;s of Maine, had welts under my arms for a week. I ordered this and was really hoping it would be okay... have used other Lavanila products. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks now and this stuff is awesome! The great plus is that it is really skin conditioning/moisturizing. I LOVE it and will probably never use another. Love the scent too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Lavanila Pure Vanilla deoderant, which is what was pictured and what I ordered.  Instead, I got Lavanilla Vanilla Grapefruit scent deoderant, which is not at all what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this new scent does smell really good and I&#x27;m going to keep it and wear it.  I just wish that someone had contacted me to let me know I was not actually getting the Pure Vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was Prime and incredibly fast, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great purchase but would have appreciated knowing that I wasn&#x27;t getting the specific scent I ordered.</li>
    <li> Sticking to clinical strength because I smell like a wet dog</li>
    <li> Not as effective as a conventional deodorant which is to be expected. I reapply before the gym in the am and then again after shower and at night before going out. Seems to work fine when I stick to a clean diet as the body releases less toxins/odors. When my diet is not so great it fails on me quite a lot. Love the scents though and will continue to repurchase as it&#x27;s a much healthier alternative to drugstore deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant!  Have been using for a few months now.  I work out and sweat like crazy, and not one bit of BO when I&#x27;m using this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant on the market!!!  Great smell, not overpowering or artificial.</li>
    <li> Shipping was not as I understood, and product arrived later then promised.  However, I love the product just wish it was part of Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> i like this pro not the first time with it ,smell amazing and no stain on cloths</li>
    <li> Ordered the vanilla to try, doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla at all :(</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY SILKY SMOOTH, really nice...unfortunately, i didn&#x27;t even smell a hint of vanilla...its a &amp;#34; clean - soapy scent&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont require a lot in the &amp;#34; odor department&amp;#34; and i got zero protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i even applied it twice...even a third time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERYBODY has different chemistry/ pH levels...and i&#x27;d read really positive reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can ALWAYZ try for yourself....perhaps its my pH...hope you have better luck than me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the LAVANILLA perfumes are amazing!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see a natural vanilla deodorant that got good reviews, but I was so disappointed when I opened it. This deodorant smells repulsive. I didn&#x27;t even put in on because it smelled so bad. There is NOTHING vanilla-smelling about this product. I can&#x27;t even describe the smell, but I am not exaggerating when I say it made me nauseous when I opened the lid to smell the product.</li>
    <li> I tried several natural deodorants before with little success. While I like Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, their deodorants do not mix well with my chemistry... the crystals &amp; salts didn&#x27;t do it for me either. I reluctantly stuck with a mainstream deodorant/antiperspirant even though more and more studies are showing the toxicity of some of the ingredients - until I found Lavanila. The first time I tried it, it got me through an outdoor summer BBQ while toting a 25lb 1yo for most of the evening and, voila! it works. Though expensive, I love that I&#x27;ve found an effective alternative.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get used to the scent but now I love it. It doesn&#x27;t keep me completely dry, but I still love it for most days (100 degree+ days require a little more protection!). Normal deodorant dries my skin out and makes me itchy. Since starting to use this deodorant my dry skin has cleared up completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this deodorant :-) I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; brands (Toms, Crystal Body, Natural Grooming, etc) and not one of them has kept me from getting stinky, now I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t sweat with this (remember this is a deodorant NOT an antiperspirant) but I don&#x27;t stink at all!! Even after an hour of hot yoga! This stuff works really well and if you&#x27;re thinking about ordering it I&#x27;d encourage you to take the chance.</li>
    <li> Heard it is a healthier choice....so far so good</li>
    <li> 3.5  -- This is the best natural deodorant i&#x27;ve tried but still does leave a lot to be desired. It doesn&#x27;t last that long or cover all that well but -- as I said, it&#x27;s better than others i&#x27;ve tried. The really disappointing element is that it smells like BABY POWDER and not even remotely like vanilla.</li>
    <li> Great for those who aren&#x27;t extreme sweaters. It does feel a little wet at first, but it&#x27;s more of a refreshing wet than a gross-sticky wet. I feel like Pure Vanilla can be used by both males and females, as it isn&#x27;t a sweet vanilla scent. The scent seems to last for half a day, and it&#x27;s not overpowering either.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the vanila aroma but I didn&#x27;t think it protected me from odor as long as I needed it. It didn&#x27;t stain and it went on easily. I will use what I have but I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is amazing, but i have to emphasize it&#x27;s a deodorant - not an anti perspirant. As someone who suffers from hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating in the under-arm area) I have tried countless products and have perfected my routine to achieve great smelling and dry armpits. I use the certain dry roll-on every other night (I know this is not an all natural product). And I use the lavanila deodorant in the mornings and I touch up after going to the gym during my lunch break. I love the scent and will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> TL/DR: Give it time, I love this deodorant! Keeps me dry and I do not have to reapply often throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story:&lt;br /&gt;About two years ago I stopped using antiperspirants and started using deodorant. It was quite the fragrant journey. To spare a long winded story I will just give the highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first product  I used that claimed to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; was an Arm &amp; Hammer brand. I do not remember the specific product. The first couple weeks were alright, and then I started to get a slight musk after about 3-4 hours of wear. I knew my body would take time to adjust so I continued to use it for another few weeks. It did not keep me dry at all, I knew there would be some moisture with simply deodorant, but this was outrageous.I am very physically active and this deodorant was just not holding up, let alone in the hot, humid summer. So I switched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Lavanila and at first I really enjoyed it. It kept me a lot dryer than the previous brand I used. It was about 2 months into using it that my body would start to get that funk going on and I would have to reapply every few hours. It was really depressing. It worked so well for the first 2 months. Then why the 5 stars if I am saying negative things about the deodorant? It is because I gave it another try after using a Toms brand. By the time I switched to a Toms brand it was about 8 months after I stopped using antiperspirant. My body was still taking its good ole time getting used to unclogged underarm pores. Needless to say I had the same problem with the Toms as I did with the Arm &amp; Hammer (consistent wetness, constant odor). So I switched back to Lavanila because it actually kept me dry, where as the other two did not. I figured if I had a smell with any deodorant I used, I might as well use the one that keeps me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to my surprise I started smelling less and less and required less applications throughout the day. My body was finally adjusting after almost a year and a half off antiperspirant. I would highly recommend this deodorant to anyone, I will purchase it again and I am glad I gave it a second chance. Moral of the story: give it time. I absolutely love this deodorant. Note: I still use the Toms if I forget my regular deodorant or if the Toms is all I have in my gym bag, and it still does not work as well as Lavanila.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve find so far! I have used it in humid southwest Florida and I can&#x27;t get over the fact that I may still sweat, but I never smell!</li>
    <li> Luv it so far. don&#x27;t know if it holds up in hot weather yet.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great smell, lasts all day long.  Fabulous.  I want every scent.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive alone in general and even more sensitive under arm skin. I have been buying online deodorant for about five years. I recently became disenachabted with the heavy tea tree Scent of my last deodorant, so I decided to work my way through a list of natural deodorants from various online reviews. This is incredible!! The caveat is that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, inserts profusely and stink, and this works hard and lasts all day. The online reviews have been &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, but I realize it truly depends on you. I but the bulky and decided to buy a new deodorant to try every months and this was the third on on the list. The lavilin deodorant, theeveryone raves about, didn&#x27;t work as well for me, neither did just using lavender spray deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I tried the grapefruit and vanilla scent and it just didn&#x27;t work as well. I&#x27;ll stick with the traditional.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, but only works for about half a day.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this out - I love most vanilla scents, but I cannot detect even a trace of a vanilla scent in this deodorant.  Instead, it has kind of a musky, powdery scent - not at all what I was hoping for.  I am going to try it for a few days to see if I can acclimate to the unexpected scent.</li>
    <li> Lavanilla is healthy, smells great, &amp; works well! It&#x27;s least expensive on Amazon Prime - Sephora is more $$ and out of stock all the time!! Im thrilled to have found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have tried at least 20 natural deodorants over the past 2 years and all of them have weird scents! I don&#x27;t want to smell like pachouli or cedar or any other earthy type scent. This deodorant smells great!! I loved the smell of all those baby powder scented anti-perspirants and this is the closest thing i&#x27;ve found to the smell and feel of those unhealthy deodorants that are so hard to stop using! This deodorants works well...it&#x27;s not perfect. You will need to reapply and at the crazy price that means it will run out a little faster but I still think it&#x27;s worth it! If you&#x27;ve tried everything and want something that doesn&#x27;t have the usual weird natural deodorant scents try this! They make a smaller size for less money to try out before buying the bigger expensive size.</li>
    <li> As many have said, this actually works. I do a lot of running and yoga and was getting sick pf paying for paraben-free deodorant that smelled good going on, but then didn&#x27;t do their job because I still stunk by the end of the day or after a workout. This smells great! I might still experiment with other products to test them out, but I feel like I&#x27;ve found my match. Be aware that it&#x27;s a natural deoderant, so if you&#x27;re used to secret clinical strength or something,it&#x27;s going to smell and feel a little different. it smells a little baby-powder-ish but the vanilla scent is really nice. Also, it&#x27;s not an anti-persperant so you&#x27;re still going to sweat, but this deodorant​ stood the test and kept me smelling good through runs and yoga sessions.</li>
    <li> In my hunt for natural deodorant, this was the first product I started with. The smell was pleasant and I found that it stayed throughout the day. This product applies with a slight white cast but I found that throughout the day it wasn&#x27;t visible. My armpits also looked the best they ever had with this deodorant. It seems to be nourishing and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The only real con that I had was that I could feel myself sweating through this deodorant on busy days. This of course is something I&#x27;d never experienced with conventional deodorants. This meant I had to reapply on certain days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really liked this product. I left it behind in my search for a more natural alternative because this product isn&#x27;t as natural as it boasts to be.</li>
    <li> LOVE lavanila. It doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my clothes or require scrubbing to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do note: it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant. So you will get sweaty. If it&#x27;s a really sweaty non-gym day (like upper 90&#x27;s for me) you&#x27;ll want to reapply once or twice as you will sweat it away. It was odd the first week or so cause I wasn&#x27;t used to my armpits being... lubricated... when I ran, or moved my arms, or anything. Usually one good application works for my whole workout of 30-40mins good cardio, 10mins stretch, and 10-30mins muscle work.</li>
    <li> My old deodorant had become ineffective so I tried this and like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Natural, pleasant scent. It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re not doing anything strenuous. I would avoid using during summer months.</li>
    <li> Smells great and worked well at first, but gave me a rash after a fews weeks. Had to toss it out.</li>
    <li> rolls on feels nice not sure how good it works was not what i expected</li>
    <li> One of the only healthy women&#x27;s deodorant that works works for myself and my daughters.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this but realized it had carrageen in it which some studies showed as harmful. I was trying to do aluminum free but decided to go back to my old stuff when I realized this may be harmful in a different way. I find the higher grade long lasting results of aluminum to be worth the risk but that is a personal choice</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.  In fact, it makes the smell worse on me..  I wonlt be buying again.</li>
