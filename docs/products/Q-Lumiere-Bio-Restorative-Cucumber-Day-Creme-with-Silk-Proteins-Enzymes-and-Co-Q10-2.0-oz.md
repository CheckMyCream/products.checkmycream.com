<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the day cream leaves my face moisturize all day. Not sticky feeling and absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> My favorite day cream. Smells amazing, and leaves my skin well moisturized without leaving it greasy, as I have experienced with other day creams I have tried. The only reason i don&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because it does not have spf protection, which for me is a plus as I have sensitive very light skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer of all time! Light, refreshing and heals up dry spots.</li>
    <li> I finally finished my Clarins day creme and move to this one, it mixes nicely with toner, serum from Sweetsation Therapy.  I am still using Clarins spf40 sunscreen because Sweetsation Therapy does not have such product :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am 40 and have tried different, more expensive facial products in past years, now I am stick to Sweetsation Therapy products: face cleanser, toner, serum, day creme, Repair Treatment (use it as night creme), masque, lip balm, eye creme, The only thing I am not very satisfied is the night creme.  It smells too strong.</li>
    <li> I love putting this product on my face - the smell of cucumbers and the instant moisturizing just feels so good!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Day crème together with many other Sweetsation products.  I&#x27;m hooked and have been for three years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme goes on sooo smoothly, feels sooo luscious and most importantly, it does the job! The cucumber scent is so wonderfully refreshing that you feel like you are being pampered in a luxurious spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  The 2oz bottle lasts me for months. I&#x27;m 46 and my skin looks better than it did 10 years ago - no peals, no botox, no laser, just Sweetsation products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, every order comes with small samples which are perfect travel size.  I always take them with me on my trips to Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if, like me, you are concerned about our environment, you should know that Sweetsation recycles your empty containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Natalja for creating this amazing cosmetic with NO BAD CHEMICALS - good for my skin and good for the planet.</li>
    <li> Okay, I love this stuff. I found Sweetsation Therapy initially for their safer sunscreens, when I was pregnant and wanted safer products. This was sent first as a free sample with an order, and I was HOOKED immediately upon trying it. It is luxurious, but light at the same time. And the smell is so fresh and heavenly...I adore this! It is also light enough to use under their sunscreens, but rich enough to use on its own if I will not be going outside. I use this every morning and Aqua Tica every night, and I swear, my skin looks younger. I noticed that after only a couple of months using them. I have been using them now for about 2 years, and people are always shocked to learn that I am almost 43 years old! I attribute part of this to Sweetsation Therapy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up! I&#x27;d give more thumbs up if I had more thumbs.</li>
    <li> This Sweetsation Therapy moisturizer is very light, quick-absorbing and has a crisp cucumber scent.  I would rate it five stars, except that I personally do not like cucumbers!  As with every other product I&#x27;ve used from Sweetsation Therapy, the quality of this cream is excellent.  The company is responsive to any questions or concerns about the product and will promptly answer any query a user might have.  Highly recommended, especially if you LOVE cucumbers!  (I prefer the Lumi*Essence because I have \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin which has become dry.)</li>
    <li> Great product.  Left my skin feeling in the best state it has been since highschool at age 42 now.  I am so glad I could find your company and its all natural.  Keep up the good work!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re wondering if this product will be worth your investment, it is! Fantastic product. I love that it has natural ingredients and doesn&#x27;t have any parabens. It works well to hydrate the skin and my skin always looks nice after application. I use this and the night creme from Sweetsation and love them both. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use any other moisturizers again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this day crème along with the cleansing foam, toner and scrub by Sweetsation as my daily skincare regimen and have had wonderful results. My complexion is brighter, softer and smoother since using these products. I like this lotion but don&#x27;t love it, it feels a little slippery once on and doesn&#x27;t feel like it ever fully absorbs. Also, the smell for me is not as pleasing as their other products, but that is a personal preference, it has a very strong smell of cucumbers. And, yes, I know the title and picture both&lt;br /&gt;show cucumber as a primary ingredient, I just didn&#x27;t know it would be so strong! If you love the smell of cucumbers then it would be great. I will probably continue to order the lotion because I like the overall results I&#x27;ve gotten when combined with the other products.</li>
    <li> I am 33 years old, not pregnant, but an avide bike rider living in the hot state of florida. I began using sweetsation products a few weeks ago and simply could not believe the benefits and quality of each product. The PSF 30 and SPF50 is remarkable and does not wash off in the heat or sweat.    The day cream I purchased to use after I wash off my sunscreen from my long bike rides. At first, I was not sure but before giving up I emailed the company directly on the sweetsation therapy website. The owner promptly emailed me right back with suggestions and after listening to her suggestions I could not believe how nice the product works. No chemicals is a super plus as eventually everything enters your bloodstream. Most products available and even high end products are full of chemicals, even if they say they are not. In the long run chemicals will do more damage than good.    The day cream is so light and soft. As I was surpised with the sunscreen moistureizers I immedietly felt and saw a difference. I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything more to happn than hydrate my skin after a 2 or 3 hour bike ride. The fragrance is that of natural aroma, which is really nice because I can not tolerate any fragrances whats so ever, never could.  You only need a pea size, if that, and the product will cover your entire face. This is he reason why the products actually cost less then neutrogena or high end products. They last a really long time.     The best part of these products is the customer service. I can&#x27;t compliment this aspect of the company enough and how impressed I am. I am not a girly girl so moisturizing etc is kind of new to me. When I emailed the company for my question on how to apply, the owner kindly emailed me right back and did not what so ever make me feel stupid. She even gave me further suggestions on how to care for my skin, which didnt even involve her products or any products. Customer needs come first which is why her products are a success. NOt many companies are like this, I personally only know one other person who is like her and thats my Bike Doctor.    You wont regret buying swetsation products, especially the day cream. Remember, if you have any questions or feel something is not right about the product, go to the sweetsation therapy website directly and email customer service. The owner will kindly email you right back, within hours it seems and give you tips or suggestions or whatever your needs. Just don&#x27;t give up with out asking.</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this product &amp; am very impressed so far! Light, refreshing scent of cucumber glides on effortlessly. This non-greasy creme is perfect for your skin &amp; as a prep for foundation!</li>
    <li> I have used some of the most expensive skincare products, everything from Lancome, Este Lauder to La Mer. I have been extremely pleased so far with Q*Lumiere Organic Day Creme with Cucumber. This cream makes my skin feel smooth, soft and more radiant. I usually go for the brand names, but this definitely takes them out!  I highly recommend this product. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on anything but I&#x27;m truly happy with this product and plan to keep using!</li>
    <li> I started using Q Luminiere about 1 year ago. It has been the best decision I ever made. It keeps my hydrated all day long without a greasy feel. I have never had breakouts since using this product. It has kept my skin healthy and well moisturized. It has a lovely cucumber smell that is very light and refreshing. If you have sensitive, combination/dry skin then try this product. I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for natural and preservative( paraben and phalates ) free skin care  products for a while and found Sweetsation and decided to try it.  I have combination skin and loved the \\&quot;Q*Lumière Organic Day crème with Cucumber\\&quot;. I kept my skin even hydrated without making it oily.  I also useAqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream\\&quot; and I can definitely see a well rested me in the morning with brighter even skin tone and less visible forehead wrinkles. I like the packaging too as a little bit comes out with one pump which is enough for the entire face and neck. I highly recommend both product and will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Love the natural cucumber smell. I love all of sweetsation&#x27;s skincare product and this product is no exception. It leaves my skin bright and smooth, I also wear it under makeup and it gives me a natural glow. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> This product has a clean and refreshing scent coupled with great moisturizing effect.It smooths the skin and leaves it bright and glowing. It has become a huge part of my every day beauty routine along with other sweeetsation products. I love the company&#x27;s philosophy regarding product ingredients and customer service. Great company and great buy!</li>
    <li> Another great produce by Sweetsation - use it every day and it&#x27;s light and lovely.  I really like these products.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this line of products a couple of years ago and consider myself lucky. This moisturizer is non-greasy and has kept my skin supple and clear. I will always choose a product that is as close to organic as I can get, like Q&#x27;Lumiere, but that also does the job. I*Light, Sweetsation&#x27;s eye treatment, is also a winner. The greatest testimony I can write is that with all the facial creams out there, I keep coming back to cucumber-fresh Q&#x27;Lumiere. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this Sweetsation product.  I have sensitive oily skin and have been using this creme for 1 year.  It has the right balance for all seasons.  I also use the night creme.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended Sweetsation Therapy&#x27;s Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening approximately a year ago.  I was so pleased with Lumi*Essence that I discarded everything I had been using and switched over to all Sweetsation products.  Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic Day Crème with Cucumber and CoQ10 keeps my sensitive/combination skin hydrated all day long.  I love the fresh cucumber scent and one pump covers my face and neck.  Most importantly, every product in the Sweetsation line is completely safe - free of any toxic ingredients.  It&#x27;s so good to have finally found a product line that works and doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> This creme has a beautiful texture as it goes on smooth and absorbs perfectly into your skin. I would highly recommend it for dry or combination skin. Lasts all day and makes your skin glow a little more!&lt;br /&gt;Also I recommend 100% purchasing from this buyer. I had a problem with the delivery and they sent another one without charging me for the product or the shipping. Very reliable and also gave free samples! WOW!</li>
    <li> I love this day cream for the fact that it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, but not all greasy.  It smells great, too.  I am always looking for organic and gentle products.  It&#x27;s so refreshing to find one that is both organic and made of very skin-friendly ingredients that is also quite affordable (especially compared to many up-scale beauty products).  I look forward to using it every day.  If it&#x27;s anything like the Night Cream, then it should last me a few months, too.  A little goes a long way with this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how effective the cream is because the fragrance was WAY too strong, so I had to wash the cream off within 1o minutes. Description says, \\&quot;Soft natural cucumber scent\\&quot;... I find it hard to believe it&#x27;s natural because the fragrance is so intense. Natural fragrances are rarely that strong. I have allergies and cannot deal with ANY artificial fragrances, and my nose can usually tell the difference right away.</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled with Sweetsation products and so happy to have found them on line. I only wish one of our local stores here in Los Angeles will start carrying this amazing line.. It has been a few days since I got the Organic Cucumber cream and there goes another favorite... this cream is so light and yet moisturizing, I can&#x27;t say enough!! I like to mix it with Sun Si Belle SPF 30 cream since I live in Los Angeles and SPF is a must. These two creams form an amazingly strong duo of moisture and sun block... a simple perfection!! I would also like to add that since I have discovered sweetsation products, about 3 month ago or so, the diference in my skin tone and the appearance of darker spots is unbelievable. A friend of mine said to me that my skin is glowing!! Thank you for all sample goodies.. you are the best!</li>
    <li> Slight cucumber smell feels so natural.  I need little bit more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I like this hygienically pumping bottle. Quantity is fine.  I can use like 3 month enough.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It hydrates, without producing an oily feel. I have very sensitive skin and tend to have allergic reactions from most moisturizers - this moisturizer worked great for me. I have received multiple compliments on my skin since I began using the l*Light Eye Treatment, Q&#x27;Lumiere and Acqua*Tica Night Cream. I am very impressed with Sweetsation and plan on trying out more of their products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over 3 months and it&#x27;s really helped even out my skin tone plus it&#x27;s an incredible all- natural daily moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin too oily. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that was organic and actually WORKED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is GREAT! i am addicted.&lt;br /&gt;I am 40 and have minor wrinkles and fine lines.  I wanted a product to use each day before I put on my makeup. I tried this and love it. My super-sensitive skin never reacted and it sinks in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I feel my crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines are smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using this product for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:&lt;br /&gt;NO CHEMICALS - check your products - so many skin care items have cancer-causing ingridients!</li>
    <li> love this day cream! has enough substance to soak in to keep skin soft while also feeling weightless. the cucumber scent is uplifting. i often feel obliged to use another, high-end moisturizer because it was more expensive and contains SPF. but. guess what? i always reach for the q&#x27;lumiere with a giddy smile. it feels light and luxurious at the same time. I just hope that sweetsation integrates sun protection into their already wonderful products!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect daytime mosturizer! It softens and fills in the lines&lt;br /&gt;around my eyes, but does not leave me greasy. My only complaint is I wish they offered it in a larger&lt;br /&gt;size as well.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift...and WOW what a perfect gift!  Smells so great and feels awesome on my slightly summer damaged skin.  I love this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of the Day creme. This is one of the 4 products I use by Sweetsation and it&#x27;s the most used. It&#x27;s been a long time since I bothered with a day creme, because I couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t make me break out. Now, I can&#x27;t seem to go without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle lasted a really long time. I kept thinking it was about to be empty but it still had a month, maybe more, in it after that. It was hard to tell when it was about to be empty because the weight hardly changed and the bottle has no way to see inside, that I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to travel with- I kept the lid and the little plug it comes with. I never had any trouble with the lid popping off or leaking, even in plane travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is wonderful. I&#x27;m 30, with fair, sensitive skin that is showing the first signs of aging. This was my lotion night and day before I decided to get the night cream (I needed heavier moisture for the nighttime). I never noticed any break-outs or other reactions. It absorbs quickly and works great pre-makeup. It smells exactly like cucumber, very fresh. Only a small amount is needed- about two pea-size drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the benefits, since I wasn&#x27;t watching too closely for effects. I&#x27;ve recently started you use all natural and anti-aging products, but after a few weeks of this, I did seem to have a glow and I regularly get complements on the tone and clarity of my skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell of cucumber in this cream, and my skin feels like velvet after I use it. This is the second product I have tried from this company, and I plan to try more of them.  Better then the most expensive creams I have bought.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it is the third time I buy it and I will always keep buying it from now on. It is the only cream that diminishes my wrinkles and keeps my skin hydrated. I have tried different brands, even Lancome, but this is so much better and you know that your not putting so much junk in your face.</li>
    <li> I love these products. I have very sensitive skin and a lot of chemical allergies and the Sweetsation line of face care creams and cleansers not only work well they don&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use this one under my make up every morning and its a nice lightweight moisturizer that&#x27;s not greasy. My only complaint is the bottles. They are completely opaque so I have no idea when I&#x27;m running low. One day it pumps out and the next day its gone. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if I could pick up a new one at a local store but since I can only get it online, I go a week without a product when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I have a very dry skin; this cream seems very light applying and does not feel oily. I do not have to reapply during the day, my face stays nicely moisturized. It does have distinct cucumber smell, but to be hones I barely notice it now.</li>
    <li> Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic Day creme smells wonderful, feels wonderful, worth the money, leaves NO tacky residue, good to wear under makeup.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this skin care line to anyone who wants glowing skin. The day cream smells amazing and your skin is so soft afterwards!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cream! definitely a fresh cucumber scent. I use it under the SunSiBelle spf 50 sunblock and it helps the sunblock blend in easier. Its a cream so it does leave your face with an oily sheen, but the fact that its organic and smells great beats the oily look! Just top it off with some mineral powder foundation and you get a fresh, youthful glow.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before ordering this product and I am glad I did! I didn&#x27;t find the cucumber smell to be too strong and it dissipates very quickly. It keeps my skin hydrated all day long without being greasy. I will be ordering my next bottle soon!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, smells amazing , natural , and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (which is wonderful because I typically only buy items marked as being hypoallergenic). It&#x27;s the only day cream I buy. I&#x27;m very, very happy with this cream and will be buying more soon (although a tube lasts for a very long time)! Another thing to note: The order also came very promptly.</li>
    <li> I am a real fan of Sweetsation Therapy products but this one is my absolute favourite. I happened to order the Sun*Brella 30+ and a sample of Q Lumiere came with it. Upon the first application I was hooked. Overnight my skin plumped up.It smells really good-exactly like cucumber and is super hydrating without being oily. I had been using this for about 2 months when I ran out and decided to try and finish my Juice Beauty Green Apple Anti-oxidant moisturizer. It just pales in comparison to Q Lumiere.     Q Lumiere really makes my skin glow and it feels healthier than ever. Its addictive!</li>
    <li> I am totally addicted to Sweetsations products and this day cream is my favorite!  It makes my skin feel smooth and gives it a glowing appearance.  I just love the cucumber scent it is so fresh and yummy!  I bought some to try and had to buy more sooner than I expected because my husband loved it too.  We have been married 18 years and this is the first time I have seen him use any product.  My order is always shipped promptly and there are always a few surprise samples added to the box.  I won&#x27;t go anywhere else for my skin care needs!  Check them out on Facebook!  Thanks Sweetsations!</li>
    <li> The best part is it really works I see a difference as soon as I apply….I have tried soooo many products and this one is perfect especially if your eyes are sensitive to artificial fragrances.  The feel of the crème is so soothing and the smell is subtle but wonderful! I will actually put more on throughout the day just to smell it….:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a skin care junkie for years.  Always on the quest for that perfect moisturizer, I&#x27;ve tried low end &amp; very high end, and this by FAR has been the best moisturizer.  My fancy &amp; expensive favorite moisturizer is now history.</li>
    <li> Not heavy, smells great - love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 products from them about 2 months ago. AquaTica Organic Botanical Night Cream, I Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment, and Q Lumiere Organic Day Cream. My issues are not so much with the quality of the products. I love the creams. They smell divine, and keep my skin moisturized without making my sensitive skin break out or feel oily, plus, a little goes a long way. I couldn&#x27;t stop talking about the products and recommended it to several friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an issue with the packaging breaking after using it for about a month, but they were quick to reply and replace the item and always nice in the emails we exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love their attention to keeping a customer happy and the free samples that come with the order are an extra nice touch.</li>
    <li> I just finished my second bottle of cream, and I&#x27;m about to order another one. I have skin very prone to acne even though I&#x27;m not a spring chicken... Redness around my nose and on my chin are also a problem, along with the dryness. Since I started using this day crème and the NutriSerum with hyaluronic acid it has gotten soooo much better. I was looking for a couple of years for an organic product that actually works and so far Sweetsation is the winner. I also love the way this cream smells, that the price is very good and that the bottle lasts a long time because you only have to use a little dollop to cover the entire face.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Its light and smooth refreshing. I can smell the cucumber! Not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I intitally received the Q*Lumiere Day Creme as a sample in my first Sweetsation Therapy order and within a couple of uses, I knew that I was going to purchase the full size bottle of it.  It immediately makes my face look soft and I love how my skin glows.  I love all of the Sweetsation products that I have tried and feel so thankful that I found this wonderful company!  Not only are the skincare items incredible, but their customer service is super nice and helpful!!  I would highly recommend this line to anyone! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the Sweetsation products and I love them all.  I am someone with very sensitive, reactive skin (and possibly rosacea) but also acne.  So, when I use acne-type products, my skin tends to be red and irritated looking--and I have those little red, rash like acne stuff...but when I used rich moisturizers, my skin will look fabulous for a few days... and then I break out with a whole other type of acne... it&#x27;s really frustrating.  I also have years and years of acne marks/scars.    Products:  I have tried many of their products and I love them all.   They are pretty much the only rich, healing moisturizers that don&#x27;t make me break out.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the products with regard to anti-aging, because I haven&#x27;t been using them consistently/for long enough.  I used them for a little while, then my dermatologist put me on a prescription regimen for rosacea that actually seemed to irritate my skin more, so I recently went back to the Sweetsation products... and my skin is starting to look luminous again.    I*Light eye cream, is creamy, rubs in well, and not oily.    The toners are non-drying, non-irritating, and, well, toning.      The Q&#x27;Luminere cucumber day cream smells delicious and is hydrating, soothing, and completely non oily.    Lumi*Essence advanced brightening repair treatment is a bit lighter of a lotion.    the Berry Mask/Scrub is the perfect scrub.  It is the perfect scrub.  The perfect amount of grainy-ness for exfoliation but without being scratchy or damaging.  The base is the perfect consistency, too:  neither too runny ( &#x3D; too much grainy, scratches) or too thick and pasty (too thick for the scrub part to do anything)    the sunscreens:    So, these are 100% mineral, non-nano sunscreens, completely natural, with no preservatives.  I have tried many such products, and this one is by far the best.   In general these type of sunscreens (because of the specific aforementioned properties) are a little difficult to rub in, often leave a white cast, and are pretty oily.  The sweetsation sunscreens are the best in this regard--they are concentrated and you don&#x27;t need much, rub in well especially if you use a moisturizer underneath, and any white-ness goes away after a few minutes or with light dabbing with a towel.  I recently got a sample of the tinted sunscreen and it&#x27;s wonderful!!!  I didn&#x27;t get it originally because I am very fair and typically have such bad luck with tinted products, but this one is perfect!!! no white-ness, no unnatural look.    Beauty Intropack:  if you go to their website:   you can order a little sample kit of many of their popular products.   It&#x27;s a wonderful deal and you can try a bunch of things out.  The products are so concentrated that even the samples last a long time and it&#x27;s great to have them for travelling!!    Customer Service:  Has been, without exception, exceptional.  Probably the best of any company I&#x27;ve ever interacted with.  Emails and phone calls have been returned by the owner within a day, even on the weekend.    My first order I ordered a few products before I discovered the Intropack, and she allowed me to cancel my order and change it.   Customer satisfaction is their highest priority.   I am hesitant to tell some of the things she&#x27;s done because I don&#x27;t want people to take advantage of it, but she is the epitome of honest, accommodating customer service.  And one other thing that I really like is that the shipping charges are reasonable--what it would actually cost, not some ridiculous, flat rate that that they make a profit off of.  Not sure why that is so important to me but it is.    Bottom line:  if you are looking for natural, organic, chemical free products, definitely give it a try.  The Beauty intropack is a perfect way to do it.</li>
    <li> Crappy product in my opinion, some of you may like it and I don&#x27;t care. Have a good day and happy new year.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, some chemical in this has irritated my skin and makes it itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and feels nice, but I find it actually quite oily and heavy.  And then, the itch.  It&#x27;s too bad, too, but just remember that everyone has their own, unique skin.  :(</li>
    <li> I started using this cream when I was pregnant and looking for a natural product to replace my old standbys.  I was instantly impressed with the way this lotion felt on my face and the natural &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; it seemed to give it.  It is light enough to wear during the summer and was still a great moisturizer during the winter.  I am no longer pregnant or nursing, but I will forever use this cream.  I highly recommend it to anyone and have been nothing but impressed with all the sweetsation products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy P.</li>
    <li> I could not brag enough about how great their products are. Being a licensed esthetician, I can say I&#x27;ve learned a thing or two about how the facial products work. This one is by far my favorite facial moisturizer. Feels so good on your skin, smells great and results are actually showing! That was the biggest shocker - to see a glowing face after using it a few times. Not sure if it&#x27;s that, the night moisturizer, or both of them in a combination, but my skin is looking so nice - everyone&#x27;s noticing it. So people think I do something fancy to make my skin look so good, but really.. all I do is apply their toner, (have a face wash ordered), moisturize and eye cream. Oh I also use their exfoliating mask 2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Save the trip to the skin spa and try this, you will be impressed!</li>
    <li> Q lumiere day creme is the only day creme that i use. The mild cucumber scent is so pleasant. It feels great on my skin. it keeps it well moisturized all day. i also use their night creme i love it. wonderful customer service too.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this product is amazing...light on the oily areas, hydrating on the normal ones. Love it! Will definitely continue purchasing.</li>
    <li> Love these Sweetsation products! They leave my skin feeling moist and dewy but not greasy. I have sensitive skin and&lt;br /&gt;Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic Day creme with Cucumber does not cause blemishes. I also use&lt;br /&gt;Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening. I started with the brightening product and they sent me a sample of the day creme which I then ordered and have been using ever since. The products last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product line. I have used many different brands of skincare and Sweetsation therapy is the one product line that I actually noticed results. The Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic day creme is amazing. I have some dark spots from being in the sun that got darker with pregnancy and they are lightening up dramatically. I am confident that the longer I use this product they will no longer be noticeable. The product is also pregnancy safe and I cannot wait to order more during my second pregnancy. The crème is light, does not leave one&#x27;s skin greasy, but soft and silky. And the fresh cucumber scent is just a bonus. I would recommend this product to a person of any age, pregnant or not.</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells lightly and freshly of cucumbers and it really soothes my dry skin. My skin tends to get really dry but when I put this on, it feels like my skin gets balanced and normal I love it! I like it even more that it is organic and that I don&#x27;t have any problems with it. Man, I wish it was bigger though. Lasting me about 2-3 months though for one bottle. I use it on both my neck and face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past 2 months. The product just feels natural and that is so important to me. I also love the texture and smell. It makes my skin feel amazing without feeling greasy. I definitely recommend their products!</li>
    <li> I use this fresh-scented organic moisturizer on top of my LaNouvel Serum. It goes on smoothly and spreads well. Additionally, it works well underneath my makeup, so I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;cakey.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the smell.  It&#x27;s not terrible but it smells like cucumber.  Solid moisturizer.</li>
    <li> love the cucumber smell &amp; freshness also it&#x27;s organic, just makes mom to be feeling much safer. This is my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> Light and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase and I absolutely love this product. The scent is a bit strong (cucumber) but it goes away as soon as you put on the cream. I love the lightness of the day cream (I have normal to oily skin) it goes on smoothly and my skin just seems to absorb it! I love that its safe for pregnant women-- which was the number one reason I chose the organic option. I also have the night cream and love it as well, perfect when I feel I need a bit more moisture. My skin feels balanced and NEVER oily!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m IN LOVE with Sweetsation Therapy! Let me begin by sharing that I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician, so I am rather picky about my skin care regimen. I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer of Eminence Organics for seven years now, and was looking for something new to share with my skin. I&#x27;m also about to become a mom so I figured what better time to find something new to start this chapter with? I stumbled upon Sweetsation while setting up my baby registry on Amazon.com. I read the glowing reviews for both the Cucumber day cream as well as the Elastibelly and figured I&#x27;d give them both a shot. I&#x27;m soooo glad I did. First, I received my package, within a few short days of placing my order, LOADED with extra goodies!  Thank you so very much, Sweetsation, for your unbelievable generosity.  I decided to wait until I had used the products for a few weeks so I could give an honest report. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced so far. At first, I thought the face cream may be a bit too dewy for me. Then, I realized that I was simply applying more than necessary. This is wonderful news! The 2oz will last longer, and I love the fresh cucumber scent. It&#x27;s very natural, not at all superficial. Now for the Elastibelly. I went ahead and ordered the larger size since it was such a steal of a deal. MONEY WELL SPENT! I only wish I&#x27;d found this miracle cream sooner. I&#x27;m in my final month of pregnancy and I&#x27;ve been going to bed EVERY night smothered in grease...not at all a comfortable nights sleep, but ANYTHING to avoid the dreaded stretch marks. I&#x27;m happy to say, I&#x27;ve tossed my other oils/creams and now joyously spread this luscious lemon-cookie lotion all over my body morning and night. Where has this been all my life? I&#x27;ll be using this cream long after my baby joins me here in the physical. The scent really satisfies my sweet cravings as well. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;d LOVE an ACTUAL lemon cookie, but this lotion brings a sweet smile to my face on it&#x27;s own AND...NO MORE GREASE-SHEETS! YAY! I can&#x27;t wait to try out the baby care line on my son. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll love it just as much as his mommy does. You&#x27;ve made a believer out of me. Thank you for your wonderful products and superb customer service.</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old and this is first time using Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic Day creme with Cucumber &amp; CoQ10.  I like it very much.  It is very mild and not oily.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s light (but very moisturizing), smells amazing, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my dry/sensitive skin (which is wonderful because I typically only buy items marked as being hypoallergenic). It&#x27;s the only day cream I buy.  I&#x27;m very, very happy with this cream and will be buying more soon (although a tube lasts for a very long time)! Another thing to note: The order also came very promptly.</li>
    <li> This cream works really well so I highly recommand.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day and after then my skin feel really soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I am also happy that the cream doesn&#x27;t have a chemical ingredients much.&lt;br /&gt;I think it truly is an excellent product for any women at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I aleady used Sweetstation products such as Sun&#x27;n Fun sunscreen for my girl and Lumi*Essence for me.&lt;br /&gt;These are rate 2 on the EWG website so I could use them without any doubt.&lt;br /&gt;The Sweetstation products were really good and safe.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> This day cream makes my face glow! It&#x27;s light and absorbes quickly into my skin, and feels so good on the skin with all the natural ingredients. I noticed the lines on my face  immediately softened and unnoticable after 3 weeks of use. I thought I might need a heavier cream during the winter but it turns out it works well in the cold weather also, my skin never feels dry with it on. It has become my all-year round go-to day cream and has replaced all the other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> Very expensive - and it really does smell like cucumbers (so if you don&#x27;t like that, you won&#x27;t like this) - but I really like it.  I use after the strawberry scrub (which I also love).  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream. I had used the night cream and the smell was too powerful for me, but this one, is just a nice light cucumber smell and it feels good on the skin, and you don&#x27;t need to use very much, it goes a long way.  I have only used it a few times, but it is making my skin look better.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this day cream and have been using daily for about a week and a half now, and I gotta tell you I love this stuff. My face seems to absorb it quickly so I don&#x27;t feel that greasy face feel some face creams will give you. I have to mention also that the smell is sooo refreshing!! I also like the pump bottle it came in because one pump is actually enough for your entire face and neck so you really get a lot of product from this 2oz bottle, well worth your $$!</li>
    <li> love this night cream. Ordered the eye cream, got a sample of Q&#x27;Lumiere day cream, so went back to get that. Sample let me experience wonderful dewy skin.  cucumber smell is not that strong. no samples this time though  :(</li>
    <li> This is my third moisturizer. Will come back for a fourth and so on as long as the ingredients stay the same.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of very expensive face products before but nothing really worked out perfectly. The original reason I tried this cream was that I have decided to switch to organic skin care after the cancer diagnosis of a close friend of mine. From my experience of a few other organic brands a few years back I was prepared that switching to organic will probably be a compromise. I was wrong! This cream is amazing, and in fact much better than most of the high end brands I have used before. And MUCH cheaper! But even if it was the same price it would worth it. I was honestly surprised. It&#x27;s very hydrating but not thick, it has a great consistency, and my skin feels great all day. I also love the packaging and how one push pumps out just the perfect amount! I am not a huge fan of the scent but I got used to it, plus it&#x27;s not too strong and goes away pretty quickly. It&#x27;s just a matter of taste I guess and has nothing to do with the quality of the product. I also started using the night cream and the eye cream and both are perfect (and the night cream smells great!).</li>
    <li> I started using the Q*Lumiere Day cream when I was pregnant with my second daughter and wanted to avoid adding any additional chemicals to my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and I still can&#x27;t get enough. The cucumber scent is so refreshing that my skin feels like it wakes up when I put it on in the morning (no easy feat with two niblets who like to tag team us all night). My youngest is still nursing and has really sensitive skin that breaks out almost instantly with almost any scented product (including anything I wear) and she has absolutely no issues with this whatsoever. You would think that having two young children and sleep deprivation would show on my skin, but this definitely keeps me looking refreshed and not a day over 25 (a birthday to which I have been celebrating for quite a few years now lol).</li>
    <li> As I posted previously, I am a fairly new customer to the Sweetsation products.  The ones I have tried I have been very happy with.  I really like this Day crème with Cucumber.  It goes on very light and is never greasy.  I wear it under my powder foundation and can go almost the entire day without a touch-up for shine.  I have oily skin and many of the moisturizers I have tried require me to touch-up several times a day.  It&#x27;s also nice to know that I am not putting chemicals on my skin.  I highly recommend this product and the price is very affordable.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for almost a year.  Very happy with the product.  You can smell the cucumber.  Feel moisturized and fresh after each use.  I use it along with other Sweetsation products from the toner to the night cream.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this. It smells really refreshing, just like cucumbers and a little goes a long way. I put it on in the mornings after washing my face. It lasts all day and my face remains nice and moist. I have super sensitive skin and have not had any issues after using it for more than month.</li>
    <li> Light touch yet gives me moisture. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so I&#x27;m very picky about facial cremes. This one makes my skin soft and hydrated but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and shiny. I&#x27;m also acne prone but this never makes my skin break out. Most Sweesation products smell nice, and this one smells like real cucumber. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent since I&#x27;m not particularly fond of real cucumber scent, but to me this is a minor issue as it fades out right away after application (I love the scent of their night creme though!). Not even worth deducting a star. I think the quality of this product over-weighs my preference to the product scent. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love that smell and I use it with LaNouvel Cellular Hyaluronic acid Nutri Serum from the same brand. They gave me the complexion of what I need: smoother, lift, brighter and moistured skin.</li>
    <li> sweetsation therapy. it smells good ! but however if you are sensitive to smells you , like I , can not use it, it will irritate your skin, not sure what other benefits it will have, for this price I will stick with the garnier skin products ! they are amazing</li>
    <li> This day cream I love to apply every morning after I clean my face and I loveeeeee the effect of this creme i love more younger , my face looks glowing and I would definitely buy this to maintain my younger look hehehheeheh</li>
    <li> I have tried and reviewed several of these products and I&#x27;ve not been head over heels for many. I&#x27;ve used these products on and off for about a year. My skin is 32 years old, suffers mild hormonal breakouts, milia and broken capillaries. I think this is why this skin care line is not revolutionary for me. Most of it smells great, uses quality ingredients and makes your skin feel pretty good. It just doesn&#x27;t solve or aid in my issues. That said, this lotion smells exactly like a cucumber and it&#x27;s so refreshing going on. I don&#x27;t wear a moisturizer too often because so many of them clog my poors and exacerbate my milia. I like the LaNouvel Cellular Hyaluronic acid Nutri Serum by Sweetsations as a daily moisturizer, but when I need just a little more moisture this is the one I grab. It&#x27;s a little heavier than is like but I do love the smell and soothing feeling. Overall, pretty great.</li>
    <li> I love this product. A little goes a long way. It makes my skin feel great and moisturized, and it smells great too. I had trouble with dry spots on my forehead and chin, and now I have no dry spots or peeling skin. Very nourishing! I also love that it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
    <li> My second bottle has run out.  I use this creme everyday. I like the organic ingredients of the Sweetsation lines. This day creme is so gentle that it never irritated my skin, even my eyes. Before using this creme, my cheeks were dry due to the strong wind. Many shelf products didn&#x27;t work on my cheeks. After using this organic day creme for a couple of weeks, I feel my face moisturized, smooth and glowing. I am happy to touch my smooth cheeks. It&#x27;s my favorite organic products. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I&#x27;ve gotten comments on how great my skin has been looking. This winter has been brutal and horrible for my skin.....since using this... its made my skin so healthy!</li>
    <li> so far so good, a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Good to use during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. It smells divine, healthy and natural and clean. It feels so good on the skin! When used in combination with the night cream, I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks...so it&#x27;s hard to say there&#x27;s any crazy transformations happening. but it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer. a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product!! The more I use it the more I like it!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is beautiful and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more for sure</li>
    <li> I first purchased this Q&#x27;Lumiere Day Creme when I was pregnant since it was an all-natural daily facial cream option. I was hooked from the start with its&#x27; delicate fragrance and the way it keeps my face moisturized through the day. I have sensitive skin and have thrown away many a bottle of moisturizers. I&#x27;ve never had a problem using this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Really nice Day creme! I love that it has all natural ingredients!!!</li>
    <li> Love it,recommend to everybody.Light,pleasant organic smell.I have use it for years mornings and nights.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs into skin rapidly,able to apply make up right after.It only what i need for my skin after when  makeup comes off.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to switch from the store-bought, chemical-filled skin care products, this company is a great place to turn. According to their brochure, they are free from artificial colors, fragrance, formaldehyde,, oxybenzone, petrolatum, mineral oil, phthalates, parabens, sulfates, and retinols. Not only do they exclude all of the bad stuff, they pack their products full of skin-loving ingredients. Once you make the switch to all natural skin products such as these, your skin will start to become healthy, glowing, and radiant. It can take some time however, as it could take some time for your skin to adjust. I have tried multiple items from this brand and have not yet been disappointed by any of them. They also make sure that all of their products are safe to be absorbed into the skin while pregnant which was a huge plus for me. They also always send out free samples with my order which gives me a chance to test out some of their other products before I commit to buying them. In addition, they have a program that supports recycling by allowing you to send back 5 empty product containers and they will give you a $10 credit toward your next purchase or a set of 5 product samples. Just cannot say enough good things about this company and their products.</li>
