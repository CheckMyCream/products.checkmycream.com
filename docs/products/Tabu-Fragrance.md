    <li> If you have never tried Tabu before you should..it is a woodsy, oriental, floral smell that you will just absolutely love.  It is a perfume that has been around for years.  I used to wear it in my teenage years, and now in my later years have decided to start wearing it again.  I love it!</li>

    <li> Tabu cologne brings back many memories!!!!  Tabu was &amp;#34;thee&amp;#34; cologne back in the 40&#x27;s.  I purchased three for notatgia &amp; sent two of them to long time friends &amp; kept one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t seen it for quite some time &amp; wasn&#x27;t even aware it could be purchased so when I saw it come up in Amazon I was delighted.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, have since I was thirteen years old (and I have lived over six decades).  I love the way Tabu smells on me, my clothes and my bedding.</li>
    <li> My Mother, a lady in her 80s, loves this cologne.  It has a very clean scent, but not overly sexy.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered it.</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent since high school so that is 50 years. It has been difficult to find off and on through the years but the scent has never changed. It is priced well and easy to order and I got it quickly. Personally I would recommend this cologne to any age.</li>
    <li> Just great. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Bought for a gift, but I confess it is my favorite! I am sure I will be giving it again.</li>
    <li> Tabu has been one of my favorites since I was a little girl.  My mom wore it then I wore it followed by my daughter and although my granddaughters are too young for such a strong scent they too like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above stated by Philip Clark, my husband this is Bobbi.</li>
    <li> I had another bottle of Tabu bought from a different source a few years ago. ..It seemed to have a stronger bouquet...but maybe the manufacturer has changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the subtle spicy odor...just wish it was somewhat stronger.</li>
    <li> My favorite since high school. Can&#x27;t let it go.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne very nice musk smell..... Receive compliments every time I wear ...... Have worn Tabu for years ....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how long I&#x27;ve been wearing this and still I get complemented, almost daily, affordable and I love it!</li>
    <li> Wife has been using this brand for long time and is pleased</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive many choices to pick from in sizes and strength of cologne. I ordered, received the announcement of its being sent and Voila! It arrived as promised in good shape and as described. Another Amazon victory- thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered what the item illustration showed...SPRAY COLOGNE.&lt;br /&gt;What I received was EAU DE COLOGNE, which is different!  Make sure pic matches product!</li>
    <li> Tabu is my old reliable &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; scent. There is almost a patchouli character along with the depth that has been associated with this scent for years.</li>
    <li> Can not go wrong with Tabu.  Men love it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over 40 years as it just suits me.  Why change when you are happy with something.</li>
    <li> Was a really great price &amp; I received it on time. It was a gift for my aunt that has worn this all her life, so it was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I read some the reviews before I purchase it. Most the review gave hight score.  I guess it just not my style, to me it smells too much like an old person.</li>
    <li> Just has a wonderful fragrance - have worn for over 20 years and still love it.  Don&#x27;t be fooled and buy TABU for Women as it is NOT the same.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend.  She loves this perfume!</li>
    <li> Still the best smell ever and I&#x27;ve been a fan since I was a teen.....all those years ago.</li>
    <li> my wife&#x27;s favorite, as expected</li>
    <li> ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT!  Earthy fragrance brings many, many daily compliments.  I spritz Tabu on everyday, the fragrance last long and is not overpowering, you just smell GOOD.  When I was a little girl my mother used to wear Tabu, her closet always smelled so good...this fragrance brings back many fond memories.  Tabu was expensive back then, now it&#x27;s very affordable and smells just as wonderful.</li>
    <li> It was to be a gift.  It smelled horrible, as if it had turned; four women agreed  Too late to return.  Lesson learned after previous such problems: don&#x27;t trust perfumes and such via Internet; they&#x27;re probably old store stock that should be dumped.</li>
    <li> Great bargain.  Convenient.  Would highly recommend seller</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a lady, I had to get some for myself. The spicy musky notes are really nice! It smells alot like Opium, and its a heck of alot more affordable.</li>
    <li> Great price for a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Oh boy do I love this perfume.  I get so many comments and it lasts all day and not wildly expensive.</li>
