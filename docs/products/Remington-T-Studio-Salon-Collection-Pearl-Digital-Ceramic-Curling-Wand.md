<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This makes the perfect curls and waves. This product brings a glove for protection which its good even thought its not that thick but it helps! the curling wand its awesome and its light weight.</li>
    <li> The wand works wonderfully. 5 stars there.  My only complaint is that the glove that came with it wasn&#x27;t protective at all.  It was no different than a winter glove.  Might keep your hand warm during the winter, but it certainly won&#x27;t keep you from getting burned.  I bought a separate heat protecting glove at Sally Beauty Supply though, and that took care of that problem.</li>
    <li> I lovec this wand! I would use it everyday if my son would allow it lol</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Good experience</li>
    <li> I have medium-shortish hair and it just didn&#x27;t work at all. Made it flip weird. Worked really good on my friends long hair tho. Wish I would&#x27;ve never wasted the money</li>
    <li> Amazing iron. Gets so hot I have two burn marks now.</li>
    <li> It took me a couple times to figure out how to get the curls just right. Super fun and I love curling my hair now. Simple to learn how to use if you&#x27;re willing to put the effort into it. Love having the glove.</li>
    <li> Amazing ! My first time using a wand and I have been so shocked at the power of this thing. I have washed my hair and found the curls miraculously came back without me doing anything! How does that even happen!! I don&#x27;t know but I truly love this thing.</li>
    <li> perfect wand. give perfectly structured curls or if wanted it gives loose waves.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand! I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems other people spoke of with my hair slipping off of it. I believe some people just may not know how to use them properly. I love that you can set the temperature and also that there is a lock to prevent you from accidentally changing it. It is very light which makes it much easier for me to use when it takes a while to do my hair. The tapered wand allows me to control how tight or loose I want my curls to be and the temperature settings help with that too. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to get the wavy curls that we so often see today. Best part is they last even after I sleep on them!  I wish I had learned to do this long ago! There are a ton of tutorials out there If you don&#x27;t know how to use a curling wand. I guarantee I you have med-long hair, once you get use to a wand and see the beautiful curls you can achieve with it, you will never go back to a regular curling iron ever again!</li>
    <li> Totally worth it for the price! My hair is super flat and straight and Ive always wanted alittle wavy/curly-ness to it. Ive tried everything from perms to the curling iron and it reallly didnt seem to help. It would never hold. Until a friend of mine told me about the curling wand. I looked at other reviews and even looked at videos and it seemed promising. I purchased it and the wand shipped very fast. I even got it a week before my actual estimated deliveray date. I dont use the gloves because they are alittle loose on me but as far as the wand goes, I completely love it. I use it all the time, my curls stay in place all day. However if you have fine hair like me I suggest using a heat protection spray, they are usually $5 at Walgreens. Although I use the low heat, it still burns my hair, but nothing to crazy where heat protection cant fix.</li>
    <li> I adore this!&lt;br /&gt;great curls&lt;br /&gt;heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;wide range of heat settings</li>
    <li> It really worked for me, my hair looks amazing. Totally love it, it helps me a lot each time i need it.</li>
    <li> Used to curl bridesmaids hair in my wedding and turned out beautifully! Shipped out fast too! WOuld recommend to  my friends and family. ..</li>
    <li> It is awesome... I bought it from another site for half the price on here, just so I could get free shipping lol .  It was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> She likes this iron iron a lot for her spiral curls.  She just stated the glove is kind of awkward to get use to.</li>
    <li> She wanted this one for her Birthday. Says it works well she has not used the glove with it yet.</li>
    <li> I love it. I used it four days ago and my curls are still in tact</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe a hair product this affordable works so great!  It works on my super fine hair and with my daughter&#x27;s very thick hair.  The hair holds a curl so well, unlike any other regular curling iron I have used.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. .nice bouncy curls that last.</li>
    <li> Love this, just got to get used to using it!</li>
    <li> I had no problems doing my daughters hair and I am hair style impaired. I do wish there were two gloves instead of one, because I tend to switch my hands around a lot.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this curling wand just to give it a try because I wanted to curl my own hair. I&#x27;ve always had difficulty curling withstraightener and I don&#x27;t know how to use the regular clamp curling iron. I think I&#x27;m in love with the Remington curling wand. Not only do I love the pink and black color but the item gets the job done! It was really easy to curl my hair even though I&#x27;m a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand heats up really quick so be careful and try not to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this not knowing if it would work on my short bob hair, and it works perfectly! Ladies if you have short hair and want beautiful curls or waves, this is your wand! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
    <li> Wow!!  I love the ease of using this (although you need to take your time to curls your hair or you&#x27;ll get burnt).  I&#x27;m 50 and I&#x27;m allowing my hair to go  full gray and natural, so the loose curl look allows my hair&#x27;s pretty colors to blend together while I&#x27;m transitioning.  This is my first time using one of these wand type curling irons.  This one had many good reviews, so I bought it.  I love it!!  I can curl my hair (allow it to dry, section hair in  2 or 3 horizontal layers, then hair spray the part your about to curl, curl it then hair spray the finished curl again).  then the next day after sleeping on it, I have more beautiful loose curls!</li>
    <li> Camequickly, however I gave it away as I could not use it  since you had to curl your hair around it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ever wand curling my hair and it was amazing! The wand curler heats up in under 10 seconds which is a plus if you&#x27;re on the go, it also comes with a glove which is a bonus if you do not want to get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t hard using the wand curler, it may take practice in hand techniques but use whatever is best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls stayed ALL day, I didn&#x27;t have to use any holding spray or moose, and I didn&#x27;t have to re-curl any of the curls I previously put in. When I say all day, I mean ALL day, I came inside and the curls still looked AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and came on time because I needed the wand curler for a specific event, so well done Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put a picture up of the heat protectant spray that I used with my curls. This was the only product I used in my hair for the curls. They curls came out bouncy and shiny..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend using a heat protectant for your natural hair and/or weave so there is no damage done.</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments when I use this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dreaming of having a curling wand forever. I absolutely hate clamps on curling irons, I never even use them. I just twirl my hair around the barrel just like with the wands. I wanted to switch over to the wands, but always told myself it was pointless because I already had a curling iron that worked just fine. However lately, my normal curling iron has been crapping out. So I decided it was time to finally buy the curling wand I&#x27;ve been dreaming of. After comparison shopping, I decided on the Remington Pearl wand. Not only did it get good reviews, good heat, automatic shut off, digital controls, and is pretty stylish looking, you can buy it on Amazon for an AWESOME price.&lt;br /&gt;This has to be one of the best investments I have ever made. Within minutes of having the wand delivered, I opened up the box and plugged the wand in to use. I think I had the heat set around 350, (hotter than my old iron even goes) and within minutes I had some nice, relaxed curls. This curling wand works like a dream! :) Everyone wanting to have beautiful, shiny curls needs this curling wand!</li>
    <li> Good but the curve is too small for me</li>
    <li> Really love this curling wand! Works great on African American hair as well for smaller curls or big curls! Good for all races!</li>
    <li> It is not user friendly and everytime you use it, there&#x27;s a chance to be burn.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love how you can change the temperature of the curling wand, and I love that it came with a glove so I don&#x27;t burn myself!!!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love the wand.. makes curls so much easier and they last longer than the normal curling iron.</li>
    <li> It really works... Just watch out cuz u will burn ya skin off quick lol</li>
    <li> Nothing can curl my hair the way I want. I&#x27;ve tried the typical curlers all my life and within an hour I have a couple small waves left. My hair goes below my waist, and hair spray isn&#x27;t enough to hold all that weight. This gives me beautiful curls and they last ALL day or ALL night, even both :) If I curl it in the morning and don&#x27;t wash it till the next morning, it&#x27;s still there.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and gets hot. The only problem is the shape, it gets narrow at the tip, and the curls aren&#x27;t as nice as rods with a more consistent thickness throughout. But it curls my hair very quickly and I am generally satisfied.</li>
    <li> i love this curling wand! the heat protectant glove that comes with it i found just gets in the way, so i just dont use it but the wand heats up super fast and cools down rather quickly when you turn it off. highly recommend</li>
    <li> Definately worth the price! you can do so many waves/ curls with this wand! i have long thick pin straight hair and normally cant hold a curl for more than 10 minutes but i can curl my hair with this and use no hair spray and they stay over night!!!!! its amazing!!! It DOES get very very hot but the glove was included, make sure you use a heat protectant spray! :) SUPERRR FAST SHIPPING TOO!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a wand, and I did burn myself once. But, even as a beginner, I was able to curl all of my hair with no trouble in ten minutes, and they&#x27;ve stayed all day. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well it works on my stick-straight hair. I&#x27;ve never had lasting curls before! Very easy to use, haven&#x27;t even burnt myself as I use the glove religiously. This was an excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Extremely hot but doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. Perfect ringlets every time. There is a learning curve whenever you use a wand but I love the soft waves they give.</li>
    <li> I really like how easy it is to use and that it&#x27;s a great new way to curl hair. Takes a bit of practice figuring out how to get the best curl out of it but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling wand. Great price and is easy to use once you learn to do it properly. I use it almost everyday and works well on many different textures and types of hair. I recommend it to anyone looking to try a curling wand for the first time, or even if you&#x27;re a regular user.</li>
    <li> Love love love this thing. So awesome and creates the perfect curl. Completely fool-proof, I was sure I was gonna mess something up somehow!</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get used to, i burned myself a few times  but good product! Gets very hot too!!</li>
    <li> Love it! It does the perfect curls and I am so happy that I finally found one that is so great and cheap!!  Will recommend!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent! My hair got curly as never and stayed for all day long! Just loved! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Really Easy to use , all you have to do is hold hair tight for 15 to 30 sec , I have a lot of hair pulse it&#x27;s really long and I still finish my hair in under 25 minutes .</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter loves this!!!  I feel comfortable with her using it because it does come with a glove.</li>
    <li> This item came with a fairly good packaging however the box was slight distorted, i guess because of how it was packaged. I love that this has different heat level, between 250-400 i guess (not specific). The spiral coil is a plus and i dont have to bother with the tangling. My only issue is that the stand was a little bit more sturdy</li>
    <li> For a well known name brand , this Remington iron is superior to more expensive models, and after working with it for a while, I can make a variety of curls. As a professional hairstylist, I use this on a lot of my formal styles . It gives you whatever type curl you desire, without the limitations of a standard clamp curling iron. I go both the Remington wand AND the BeadHead deep waver for only $43....what a steal! It comes with a black glove to protect from burns, which most other models do not include.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo24HZY73OCNSCD]]I am in love with this wand and its only been 1 day! Super easy to use and the curls last all day! I am the girl with the hair that WILL NOT curl. I have had mild success with curling by flat iron but man, the damage incurred is just not worth it! This wand not only took me under 15min to do my entire head, but it also lasted all day with ZERO, let me repeat that ZERO hairspray! I cant believe it! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome Curling Wand, doing the job perfectly over 4 months. Wife wanted this special model and type, and she has been very happy with this product of Remington. Good price as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH SO EASY TO USE ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT. IT TAKES ME LITERALLY 10 MINUTES TO DO MY HAIR AND IM OUT THE DOOR. THE CURLS STAY IN ALL DAY WITHOUT HAIR SPRAY AND MIND YOU I AM A PACIFIC ISLANDER WITH SUPPPER STRAIGHT HAIR. I USED OTHER HAIR CURLERS AND IT WOULDNT HOLD IT WOULD LAST ABOUT AN HR. TO 2 BUT THAN BACK TO IT BEING STRAIGHT. THIS WAND I HAD NO PROBLEM MY HAIR WAS STILL CURLY OR WAVY TILL THE NEXT DAY. I CAN NOW DO LOOSE CURLS OR WAVES WHICH EVER I PERFER. LADIES AND GIRLS OUT THERE YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE! IT&#x27;S SO WORTH THE MONEY AND IT&#x27;S A MUST HAVE!!! :) BUY IT! DON&#x27;T THINK TWICE BECAUSE I&#x27;VE BEEN EYEING THIS FOR MORE THAN 4 MONTHS READING REVIEWS AND EVEN WATCHING YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND LET ME TELL YOU I SHOULDVE BOUGHT IT SOONER! I USE IT EVERYDAY BUT NOW I HAVE A NEW TOY WHICH IS THE BED HEAD DEEP WAVER AND I&#x27;M LOVING THEM BOTH!! HOPEFULLY THIS HELPS YOU.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how fast this heats up, does everything you&#x27;d expect from a curling wand. Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very nice iron for the price, it came fast too. The iron itself has a digital front, which makes heating it up a breeze and exact! It also comes with a heatproof glove which is handy, i know some people don&#x27;t like the glove but it sure beats being burned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed hair, so it&#x27;s natural curly. When i straighten it and curl it with this iron, it holds the curl really well. I can tell the iron is good quality because of this!</li>
    <li> All pieces to the product were present and it does work fine. The glove had a funny spell and was not clean though.</li>
    <li> My friend has this curling iron and she recommended it to me. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up fast, and also up to 450 degrees! But you really don&#x27;t need to use that much heat.&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse, semi-curly, frizzy hair, and this is now going to be my go to product for whenever I want to define and tame my curls. Already got compliments on my hair today &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! and so easy to use! it gives awesome curls but you do have to be careful when using it.</li>
    <li> I tried this curling iron and it definitely works, but as much as I have tried to get used to winding hand around it I find myself still petrified of being burned.  So the curls I create seem to look kind of &#x27;odd&#x27; as I&#x27;m winding my hair in a non-adept way because I&#x27;m afraid of burning myself.  Also it seems to really dry out my fine hair, possibly because it&#x27;s taking me longer than it should to wrap it around the iron.  I tried using the glove too, but it seems to make me even less adept at winding my hair.  I know some people have great success with this curling iron, but personally I feel it&#x27;s not for everyone and I seem to be uncoordinated with it trying to move my arm right in front of the mirror.  I prefer the curling iron style with the clip and starting higher up, winding it around through the hair for less damage.</li>
    <li> I dont have the patience to figure this out. It looks easier to maneuver than it actually is. My hair stylist even hated it. great idea horrible execution</li>
    <li> I.absolutely love this curler! Such cute curls. And it works really quickly, too. Would definitely recommend. Came with the heat glove as well but i don&#x27;t use that. Can&#x27;t grip my hair with it on.</li>
    <li> I love wearing my hair in loose curls but by the time I arrive to where I am going my curls are no more. My friend used her wand to curl my hair one night and not only were the curls beautiful that night BUT the curls were stitt there almost a week later!!!!!!!!!!!! Even after I would wrap my hair at night my hair would still pick the curls right back up. Though they were looser than the the first few days people thought I curled my hair daily when they were the same curls as before. Had to buy one for myself. Warning however it starts off hard to do it yourself at first but once you get the hang of it youwill love it too! Heats up and cools down in no time. Doesnt take long to curl my whole head like it use to. Works on all hair types, so happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This product had high hopes but unfortunately my hair slid off and it was really hard to use. I would purchase a product like this if it has the rubberized wand so my hair was not sliding up and down.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair but it&#x27;s coarse and just crazy. So I got this for when I want to dress up and look like a girl with &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; curls. This thing heats up within a minute and stays pretty hot [I have it on the highest setting]. It comes with a glove that looks skeptical for protecting your fingers but it really works! I&#x27;ve held the wand and it felt warm (obviously) but it was a good layer to protect your skin from the hot tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curls kept for about 6 hours before becoming very loose [but that might have more to do with the texture of a person&#x27;s hair]</li>
    <li> Makes great curls. Remember to always wear the glove, will make a nasty burn.</li>
    <li> Worked, but not what inexpected</li>
    <li> Do you like third degree burns? No? then skip this product. The only way to work it is to grip it with their magic glove. They only provide one, whereas you really need another as you maneuver the second hand in the hopes of a curl. Your cheek will probably get a blister as well by then. By the time you manage to do that, especially if you&#x27;re a young tween like my daughter, you&#x27;ll have severe burns.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday and have used it twice already!  I styled my 5-year olds hair with it this morning as well as my own and I love this tool!  It gives natural looking, wavy textured hair!  And, it holds!  I will have to wash my hair to get the curls out, that&#x27;s how good it stays put!  It&#x27;s a little awkward to get used to at first, but the heatproof glove really helps with using the tool!  It&#x27;s money well spent, that&#x27;s for sure!  I will be wearing my hair wavy/curly a lot more often thanks to the Remington T-studio Curling Wand! :)</li>
    <li> It took me a little while to get used to a curling iron without a overlapping bar but once you get the hang of it, it works really well.  The only reason that I give it four stars is that you have to be careful with the temp.  Too high can fry your hair.</li>
    <li> i like this wand, because i can do my daughters hair very quickly.. and mine. because of how hot it gets, you have to be careful, the glove doesnt help because you can&#x27;t grip the hair well with it, so you just have to be careful, other than that, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this curling wand! It is awesome!</li>
    <li> I never have had any luck with curling irons or hot curlers. I decided to buy this after doing extensive internet research and even looking on YouTube for tutorials on how to use the clipless curling irons. This is by far the best value for your money. I went out on Saturday night and got compliments from friends and complete strangers! The next day, my girl friend came over to use it to see if she wanted one. Before she even left the house we went to Amazon.com and she purchased it on the spot. I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to curling my hair and I was able to walk out of the house looking like a professional curled my hair. Definitely a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I watched several tutorials on YouTube to make sure I&#x27;d know how to use this. After debating back and forth between this and the Conair You Curl, I saw better feedback on this Remington so I went ahead and bought it. I used it the same day I received it and it was great! Heated up in literally less than a minute. The glove is very useful because I was just a beginner with clampless curling irons and felt the heat a couple times and was thankful for the protection it provided. Like I said, I am a beginner, and with very thick hair, so it took about 30-40 minutes. But I only had to do each piece once and the curl looked amazing. I went out that night and the curls did loosen up a bit but still looked pretty. I&#x27;m definetely thankful I decided on this curling wand. Now that I&#x27;m used to it, it&#x27;s SO quick and easy. I use it 2 or 3 days of the week. VERY HAPPYY!!! :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She used to only straighten her hair. Since I bought this, she no longer wheres her hair straight... That should tell you something.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the product I received was defective.  When I plugged the iron in it would not turn on, and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I paid $24.77 for this Remington Curling Wand. I didn&#x27;t expect anything amazing for such a low price, but I am very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve gotten. I have long hair, a few inches past my shoulders and very thick! I usually have trouble curling it because it takes a long time to get it all. This product made each curl take a few seconds. I took my time, to do it correctly and use the glove and it only took 45 minutes for me to completely curl my hair for the first time with this. I will definitely be recommending this to all of the girls I know!</li>
    <li> Love is not the word. This wand is awesome.  Be careful it does get hot.  Curls are long lasting.  I&#x27;m telling everyone I know to get one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curling iron before, but this one is great. I created curls a night before going to college, and in the morning my curls were great. I retouched them because I have relaxed hair, and my hair shaft is very fine, so the ends are hard to tame. But is great, you can get from defined curls to waves or loose curls. I definetly love it. And the quality of the product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Its great, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair but since I have very long hair I wish I have bought the bigger one.</li>
    <li> ***AMAZING PRODUCT***I didn&#x27;t even purchase this curling wand on Amazon, but I am so obsessed with it I&#x27;m writing a review. I loved the look of my hair when I curled it with a regular curling iron, but it would take me at least an hour and no matter how much hairspray I used, it would be nearly straight in an hour (and I have naturally wavy hair). I bought this wand on a whim, and I was instantly amazed. It heats up in seconds and once you get the hang of it it is so simple to use and takes my full head of long hair only 20 minutes to curl. The thick to thin rod allows for a variety of curl sizes and this Remington product comes in 2 sizes. Since I got this a few months ago about 5 of my friends have purchased their own. I get compliments on my hair every time I use it, even from random people. I&#x27;ve used it on 6 friends, all with different hair lengths and textures, and it works wonders on each girl. My favorite part about this product is that your hair will remain perfectly curled until you wash it. I have curled my hair in the morning, taken a nap in the afternoon, slept on it overnight, and it will still look fabulous the next morning- even if i brush it! Since the curls stay perfect you don&#x27;t need to put any product in your hair, making the curls look natural and healthy. I recommend this over any other product- it is such a steal at its low price! I suggest you play around with it before the first time you want to curl your hair to see what works best for you (for me its holding the wand upside down and wrapping the hair around the barrel away from my face) but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s super easy and the glove makes sure you won&#x27;t burn your hand! AMAZING PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this.  -The curls stay all day long  -can be looser or tighter, depending on how/where you place your hair on the iron  -it&#x27;s cute!  -Way cheaper than similar products but works more effectively  Just remember, styling PRODUCT is VERY important!</li>
    <li> Purchased this curling wand based on reading multiple reviews. The glove is definitely needed and iron heats up to a perfect temperature for hard to curl hair. My daughters hair just does NOT hold curls, but we tried it on her hair and after 24hrs...the beautiful curls were still in her hair...could not believe it! I purchased the flat iron that matches this and both items are fantastic! Very happy!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling wand for my wife to use on her long hair. She loves it, for it curls her hair just like a permanent.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars due to how I received the product. It was scratched and damaged and came all jumbled. The product itself I know is good since I was buying this to replace the one I lost, but didn&#x27;t want to keep a damaged one.</li>
    <li> I ordered three of these - one for myself to use on overseas travel as it has dual voltage and two as gifts for family that lives in Europe.  Only one of the three that arrived had the dual voltage function!  I researched and purchased this product specifically because it was dual voltage.  I opened my iron before leaving and confirmed that it was in fact dual voltage.  Satisifed that all was well I took the other two with me and gave them as gifts only to discover after the recipient&#x27;s opened them that the other two were NOT dual voltage meaning I gave them something completely useless or they must purchase an expensive converter to get them to operate. All three irons are identical with the exception of the dual voltage function and I am completely baffled why one was what I ordered and two were not.</li>
    <li> I was trying to use a traditional curling iron and it simply won&#x27;t hold my hair. I don&#x27;t know why, but even with tons of hairspray, a regular curling iron will not keep my curls. I have really long, thick hair (long meaning it&#x27;s a my waist from behind at the longest point), and this curler keeps my curls in ALL DAY LONG (no product). I bought the small one but I&#x27;m thinking of getting the larger one because I don&#x27;t want tight curls, I want big waves which look better with long hair like mine. Can anyone comment on the type of curl you get from the larger version??  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  Never worked out of package.  Buyer Beware, because item cannot be returned after 30 days, so, don&#x27;t buy as a gift and open right away. ![[ASIN:B003V265QW Remington CI95AC/2 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand, 1 Inch]]</li>
    <li> I use this iron for everything from waving the ends of my hair to doing a full-head spiral curl.  The curls hold great.  The wand eliminates the ugly curling iron ends and crease you get from the clamp.&lt;br /&gt;I expected the glove to be bulky and annoying, but it is NOT.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I received my order right on time and curled my hair as soon as i got it! It gives you those beautiful taylor swift curls and the curler gave my hair so much shine. This curled my hair in about 3 seconds and i don&#x27;t need hair spray! Don&#x27;t hesitate buy it! Its cheap too!</li>
    <li> My daughter snuck this onto my wish list, so I decided to surprise her. The iron works EXCELLENT and we both have really long thick hair.  Was a great gift for both of us!!</li>
    <li> So far, this has been really slippery to use. The hair keeps sliding off the end. Hopefully with time that will change but the pros are that it heats up well and the glove does a good job of protecting your hand.</li>
    <li> This was a big hit as a Christmas gift. Note that the diameter changes along the length of it, which I&#x27;m told is new cutting edge technological advancement. :)</li>
    <li> I have never been able to curl my hair but with this I can curl it easily and quickly. I am not the best at it yet I still need a lot more practice. The glove has some pros and cons, I like how it keeps me from burning my hand but it does get in the way of trying to seperate my hair. With more practice I will be able to use this like a pro!</li>
    <li> I loved this curling iron. It is easy to use and curls my hair better than any other curling iron has! I would recommend this to anybody!</li>
    <li> I love my curling wand. I have really long, really thick hair, and it used to take me two hours to have a head of curls with my old metal curling iron and even then, the curls lasted a day, using tons of product. With the curling wand, I can curl my hair Monday and still have soft waves on Wednesday. And it only takes 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
    <li> Ever since I put an order on this I have been waiting to get it to use it. . I got it last night but only to find it does not come with the heat protective glove. . I need that to use it without being afraid I am going to burn myself. very upset at this I always had no proble with a,azon but I guess now I do. . can anyone tell me how I can talk to the seller &amp; let them send me one its not fair I paid for something &amp; I dont get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the help!</li>
    <li> This curling wand makes the most beautiful curls it&#x27;s just sooo hard to use at first i burned myself the first day i got it:( It takes getting used to and practice because its way different than a regular curling iron but other than that its great the curls come out perfect just like they are supposed to and i love how the end is bigger than the other part because then you can make smaller or bigger curls like you want. i would recommend this just be careful!</li>
    <li> I love this tool! I wish it had existed during my high school years! As I get older my natural curls get more wild and unmanageable which makes the wand a necessary tool, especially when I am trying to look polished.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, heats up very quickly and it gets HOT!!! be careful.</li>
    <li> i have been very impressed with this product and already convinced one of my friends to buy one.  there is a little bit of a learning curve to use it but i have never been able to curl my hair so fast in the past.  occasionally some of my curls come out kind of crimp-y, and i cant figure out why- i might be twisting the hair accidentally as im wrapping it?  but i can usually just re-curl the piece of hair with good results.</li>
    <li> a tad difficult to use at first but after getting used to it - and past the burns on your fingers - it is the best curler, pull down on the curls to turn them into waves - running your fingers through it turns it a little frizzy, haven&#x27;t tried the wider wand but this one will do tight or lose curls, it does take a lot to get used to though, curls last for multiple days if you take care of them right</li>
    <li> Awesome curls. Gets super hot. Love that it comes with a glove. Great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not great at styling my own hair. I read lots of reviews before purchasing this wand about how simple it is to get great results, and it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m able to create loose beachy waves or tighter curls depending on how I use this wand. There is a little bit of a learning curve, but once you watch a video or two and do it yourself a few times, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how simple it is to use this wand. Great results every time. Because it gets so hot (and you can choose the temperature) I always use a heat protection spray on my hair first.</li>
    <li> I love my curling wand 😍....This is one of the best purchase&#x27;s I brought for my hair!!</li>
    <li> its perfect!!!! very nice quality product, and very professional... im in love</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use.  It burned my hand few times.</li>
    <li> Included glove does NOT sufficiently protect your hand from the heat. Ouch.</li>
    <li> Works very well, best curling iron for the price! Very easy and quick to use!!! This is the best curling iron ever! :)</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  It is not a real Remington curling wand.  I have used this product a few times, hoping that it might magically work but it smells, burns and damages my hair.  I threw it away!!  Bought one for my daughter as well and she is having the same issues with hers.  The actual curling part seems like it&#x27;s painted.  It&#x27;s not ceramic at all.</li>
    <li> Very easy to curl hair. Love it</li>
    <li> Works so well! My hair is really fine and extremely straight genetically. Therefore, it is hard to hold curl. But this thing is perfect. My curls last all day, and i can fall asleep, wake up and still have curly hair lol! No hair spray needed!</li>
    <li> Really good quality ! I love it</li>
    <li> After reading all the negative reviews about how hard it was to do this (without a clip) I almost didn&#x27;t buy this for my daughter. But she says it is easy and she does not need the glove. She uses it everyday (for a month now) and is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It takes some practice to get use to but once you get the hang of it, it works great</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Got it on the second day after I ordered this! But I gotta give this a four star review because the box says it comes with the glove but my package didn&#x27;t include any glove :( But overall, great product!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and after watching tutorials on Youtube it was easy to use.</li>
    <li> This wand is perfect and the price vs the quality makes me feel like I&#x27;m stealing! Love it!</li>
    <li> very bad burn on my hand, multiple burns</li>
    <li> This is a really great curling wand, at least for my hair type which is lightly curly and thin. After one burn now I manage how to use it and it is really easy. I totally recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself because curling Irons make my hair very frizzy. I love this wand, so easy to use and I get soft beautiful curls and thats amazing cause my hair is so thin.</li>
    <li> Got it for my sis and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Love it.  Does so good.  Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It does the job. Produces nice curls. Heats up very nicely.  Remington has great hair styling productions. I love Remington products.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. And makes the curls look more &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; And gets hot fast.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling wand. But it creates curls that are natural looking. Similar to Julia Roberts natural curly hair in the movie pretty woman. If you want curls that are barrel type curLs and look circular then buy a clipped barrel curling iron. However, this wand can make those types if you keep curling around the one inch part of the wand. This is a very good wand bc I can create curls in an instant and they stay on extremely well even without product. I have asian fine straight hair and sometimes my curls don&#x27;t hold with barrel curling irons and I find this one does a great job at it. I did not think it was hard to control. I can see why people complained about burning their finger. If you touch the wand then yes u will burn yourself but I used the wand the first time without a glove and I was fine. Just be careful when you control it. I found it was idiot proof and easy to use. In fact i loved it but it honestly wasn&#x27;t the type of curls I thought I was going to get. If youre unsure how the curls will look like or how to use this product I suggest going on YouTube and watch videos to learn. The price is well worth it. Very reasonable and worth the result. I have used many curling irons and I have done hair for weddings before. I like this product but I suggest start at the lowest temp setting n adjust as accordingly. U do not want to burn ur hair. I would use a mask or product in your hair prior to curlin that will protect it from burning. Also I bought my curling wand at target for the same price. But if u don&#x27;t want to pay for shipping then go with amazon. Good luck. Overall great wand!!! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Very tight curls. Easier if someone else does your hair, but I&#x27;m not great at self hairing. Super fast, heats up quick and works like a gem</li>
    <li> Love it. It gets really hot and I curl my hair quicker then usual. They arrived at my home quick and they were affordable</li>
    <li> Great and quick service and I am a happy customer. All was as I expected it and I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very well made- the heat is consistent from base to tip, giving your hair  the truest curl possible. HOurs after my style is set, the curls are still holding tight. The glove is a perfect companion, but after some experience, you may not need it as this curling wand has a cool tip. Also, it&#x27;s very durable- dropped many times on a tiled floor and still works as if it&#x27;s just out of the box. Great product, Remington!</li>
    <li> This iron is so perfect!! It makes my hair the perfect spiral curl and the curl stays in for so long!!! It gets super hot up to 400 degrees so be very careful with it. Since it gets so hot, the curls are better. I&#x27;m obsessed with it and I get an enormous amount of compliments on my hair after I use it. The iron come with  glove because it gets so hot but if you&#x27;re very careful and watch what you&#x27;re doing and having practice using it then you won&#x27;t need the glove. I would suggest using the glove because you can get burned pretty fast and its not fun at all. I learned how to curl it the perfect way from YouTube videos. The first piece you do curl one way and the next piece curl it the opposite, that way it won&#x27;t mesh together and they pieces will stay separate. You will love this iron and have that awesome spiral curls that are super popular right now!! Good luck.</li>
    <li> So this iron gets you the Taylor swift curls. I think it&#x27;s great but hard to do on yourself, the glove doesn&#x27;t work that good. This thing is incredible because after you wrap your hair around it your done, no more waiting and holding for it to curl. It gets very hot, maybe thats why. So I&#x27;d be carefil about damage. Also, not a good iron for above the shoulder short hair. Too many risks for burns.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. Not as easy to use as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Excellent wand, fast and easy to use, holds the curls for a long time.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve never written a review, but I thought this would be a good starter! I am really starting to love this. I got it yesterday (Friday, August 12) and I used it right after the UPS guy handed me the box. It started up well and heated up extremely fast. After reading reviews and watching YouTube videos I knew to use the glove once I was starting off, but halfway through my hair I decided that I wouldn&#x27;t need it. BIG MISTAKE. I burned two of my fingers really bad, it was REALLY painful. Beware of the heat! And wear the glove! Don&#x27;t  be an idiot, like me! But while I was using it, it was really difficult for me to get used to it, it was a bit awkward, I&#x27;ve never had any luck with curling irons, I&#x27;ve stuck to curling my hair with my straightener ([[ASIN:B003V3AZJY Remington S6500 Sleek and Curl Ceramic Pearl Multi-styler Hair Straightener, 1 Inch]]), but after watching a bunch of YouTube videos and reading reviews, I decided to try this out. It was difficult to get used to and the curls were awkward. After getting burned, I wanted to return it.    But I showered, tried it again later that night and the curls were a lot better. I slept on them and woke up with amazingly cute waves! I was super excited that 2nd day curls looked this cute. After a busy day of walking around the mall, Wal-Mart, and being outside, they looked the same as when I woke up! I showered and just curled my hair to have 2nd day curls for church tomorrow, and it was even easier to use! It took less than 10 minutes and I have a lot of hair! I&#x27;m falling in love with this curling wand, and I&#x27;m pretty sure by the end of the week I will be a pro, practice really does make perfect! :)     This curling wand is cute, heats up really fast, and is easy to work with after a few times of practicing! It&#x27;s an even bigger plus that I have a Remington Pearl Straightener to match this, although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be adding to the collection for a while!     So, the bottom line is, yes, get this curling wand! It&#x27;saffordable, cute, and totally worth it after practicing a few times!     Erica</li>
    <li> Was delivered three days after ordered! Also was in perfect condition and works beautifully. Definetly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got rid of this after trying it several times and finding my hair just slid around on it and I was always worried about burning my fingers.  I prefer easy when it comes to stuff and I didn&#x27;t find this easy to use.  I went out and bought the old fashioned type that grabs an end of hair and then you twirl it around a spiral heated element.  Much easier, similar results and no burned fingers.  The glove they give is helpful, but my hands are very slender and they made grabbing the hair difficult.  It might be fine if you get the knack, but I didn&#x27;t have loads of time to keep practicing.  I prefer no fuss!!</li>
    <li> I had only moderate hopes when I bought this, and WOW am I impressed! The curls it creates are amazing, and they hold like curls never have before! I have fine, straight, long hair. Normally, my curls will fall flat within a few hours, even WITH hairspray or other products. These curls held ALL day, with NO products, on the first try! I&#x27;m honestly a bit baffled, because I never thought that was a possibility for my hair. I don&#x27;t know what it is about this iron/wand that does the trick, but I&#x27;m ecstatic!     I bought this iron because my husband bought the Remington Pearl rollers for me a while back. That was one of the first appliances to really curl my hair, and I&#x27;ve tried everything. Based on that and the price of the wand (cheaper than the rollers) I had to give this a try, despite all the burn warnings I&#x27;ve seen in reviews. I&#x27;m not a professional by any means, (and I&#x27;m rather clumsy) but I&#x27;ve used this wand several times without incident. I AM, however, accustomed to wrapping my hair around the barrel of regular irons, so I didn&#x27;t have any difficulty getting used to that. I have yet to burn myself, because the wand never touches my skin. I can see how if it did, however, it would result in some nasty burns, especially on higher heat settings. Be careful, ladies! I also have yet to wear the glove that comes with this. I tried the lowest heat setting the first time I used it, and it worked perfectly, so I don&#x27;t feel the need to turn it up. I think too often people decide to crank the heat settings as high as they will go, without testing first. This wand will reach 410 degrees, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessary for most hair types. Start at the lowest settings, and work your way up. If you&#x27;ve never wrapped your hair this way, DEFINITELY wear the glove, especially if you use higher settings. So far, I don&#x27;t need the glove, and doubt that I ever will. If you&#x27;re having problems maneuvering the wand or burning yourself, try practicing with it off. Might help.    The wand is super lightweight, easy to maneuver, and works better than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. It heats quickly, works quickly, the buttons are well placed/made (I don&#x27;t accidentally turn the iron off) and you can \\&quot;lock-in\\&quot; the heat setting so you can&#x27;t accidentally change them while curling. Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t have that strange burned smell it always has with other irons, including ceramic ones. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this wand. I&#x27;m so thrilled with it! The only complaint I could voice about this is the lack of a protective heat-resistant sleeve to put it in after use. All things considered, though, I can&#x27;t really complain much about that! HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> At first it did not curl at all, but then about my third time trying it it started to work.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast. Works great. Super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have very long (past the middle of my back), thick hair and this curling iron works amazing on my hair.  It didn&#x27;t really take me long to get used to how to use it either.  The curls this produces are beautiful and they last!!  With my hair being so long the curls usually fall right out, but not with this curling iron.  AND it takes about 1/2 the time it would take me with a regular curling iron!  I LOVE it and I use it often since it doesn&#x27;t take long at all!</li>
    <li> I like it. After reading reviews on thess wands for a few hours, I finally decided on this one. Although I really recommend buying one that is the same width from top to bottom, I still like this one. The problem is, the top of it is smaller in width, so as you wrap your hair around it, your hair will slip off the bottom. It was really hard to use at first, but after finishing my hair, it looked really good. I was ready to give up after the first five minutes, but I finally finished. But I STRONGLY recommend going on YouTube and watching the video \\&quot;how to use a curling wand\\&quot; by a girl named \\&quot;charmedvalerie\\&quot;. It was so helpful to see how she holds it. I REALLLLYYY wish it would have came with two gloves! I ended up using a regular winter glove, because I burned myself pretty bad with it. I think after a few more uses I&#x27;ll get used to it. My hair is soo hard to curl, and usually falls after an hour. This really did work good for my hair. It was even curly after sleeping on it. I would say be veryy careful sitting it on your counter, it WILL burn it! I layed it on a heat-resistant pad and it melted it! If you want tiny, tight curls, hold it longer when you wrap it around. I don&#x27;t like tight curls so I held it on for about 5 seconds and it was soo pretty. I would say really be careful and don&#x27;t drop it on your hand like I did. The crushed pearls in it really make a difference. It makes your hair soo soft feeling. Just USE the gloves!!</li>
    <li> product of very good quality, 100% satisfied with your purchase recommend this product to all my friends and customers amazon demanded of such items.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works amazing!! We have two!! To get the most out of it, go to YouTube and watch a how to video on it.</li>
    <li> I had a similar curling wand, but the barrel was smaller and I didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair look. On a whim I went to target and bought this, and was very surprised the first time I used it! It made my hair look amazing! If you like bigger curls and your hair WILL NOT HOLD ANY CURL! I recommend this! It worked as well as my $40+ one I was using before! The pink color is also a plus for any girly girl!:)</li>
    <li> I do like this curling iron, there is a bit of a learning curve to getting the curls &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; but with enough practice the iron is easy to master. However, I do have very thick hair (and a lot of it!) so I wish I had gotten an iron with a larger barrel. This one is just fine for tight Shirley Temple/Taylor Swift curls but when you have as much hair as I do, it can take forever. For beach-y and looser waves I would recommend going up in barrel size. Not complaining (the product does an excellent job and the curls hold for a long time without using any hair spray) it just depends on what you want.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had! They should call it a magic wand instead of a curling wand because wow! It heats up really quick and the glove is great... I would recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> My very first and favorite wand! I bought this wand at target about 3yrs ago! Still works great like day one. Curls hold up to 2 days with no hair spray!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair. In the past, I had to load on hair spray to get a curl from an iron to stay (and even then it would fall out after a few hours). I read the reviews for this and decided to try it, though a bit skeptical. I was SO impressed. Not only did my hair curl quickly (an AMAZING feat for hair like mine), but it actually lasted 24 hours without any hairspray! The heating glove is a great bonus as well, though be sure not to use it to hold the actual barrel since the iron is quite hot! Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> it was hard at first but after a few times and watched videos on youtube not bad at all, use the glove and youll have the perfect culrs in no time :) nice product!</li>
    <li> I have BIG hair, i mean LOTS of hair, and it does not curl.  It is pin straight, so I usually put it in a pony tail or straighten it even more.  I&#x27;ve bought and tried soooo many traditional curlers, and could NEVER get the results i wanted because it took wayyyy too long to curl my hair because of lenght and volume of my hair.  I forget how i even came across the Remington curling wand, but it was fate.  Next thing i know i find myself buying this thing on amazon, cuz it&#x27;s worth a shot.  I&#x27;ve probably spent hundreds of dollars on curlers and straighteners in the past, so whats another $25.  I opened it up immediately and went to town on my hair with this thing the minute it arrived.  20 minutes later, a FULL head of curls!.  I couldnt believe it.  I have never been able to curl my hair so fast, and make it look so good.  OK, so with all my hair, being curled now, it looked huge.  I slept on it over nite, and the next morning it was much more tame than when it was freshly curled.  And yes, the curls did stay in tact, except for a few ends where I just refreshed them the next day.    I was able to literally keep the curls in from Wednesday through Monday without any problems.  The curls just stayed, grant it by the last day it was pretty much coming out, but I just put it in a pony tail and off I went until I washed my hair (which I only do about every 5-6 days).    Now, the downside: the wand, pretty neat concept, except why do i have to keep burning my finger?  The glove is alright, but when you are holding the hair on the wand while its curling, it does get realllly hot and your finger is slightly burned.  I mean nothing that requires medical attention, but it gets hot.  I wish they could think of a better design for this aspect of the wand.  Though traditional curlers have the clip that keep the hair in place, it doesnt hold the hair as tight or loose as you can control with your hands.    Needless to say, I shall continue burning my finger just ever so slightly in order to get a great head full of curls in the meantime.  Whenever they decide to fix this little finger burning issue, i&#x27;ll most likely upgrade!  Go ahead and try it out, it&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> It comes with a heat protectant glove (which if you&#x27;re wary about using this kind of curling iron, it&#x27;s a big plus over the gloveless, equally priced Conair version) but I&#x27;ve used many an iron and didn&#x27;t feel the need to use it. The first time I used this, I did accidently burn my finger and the ends weren&#x27;t curled perfectly, but after that first session I&#x27;ve been a pro. I love the variety of waves you can get with the barrel size, as well as how quickly I can do my hair! I&#x27;ve never been able to style it in 10 minutes before (the exact amount of time before I had to dash out the door or face being late to class, a gamble that paid off), and since you don&#x27;t waste time carefully arranging it in the clamp, it&#x27;s easy to grab a random section of hair and wind it around. My hair keeps its shine and has great springy curls that relax into natural looking waves as the day goes on.    I&#x27;ve used this iron on my friends, and one of them has very fine hair that hasn&#x27;t ever held a curl well but with this iron, hers lasted through the next day even after she slept on it. I also loaned it out before a party and both girls came up to me with rave reviews. Two of them are considering purchasing this.    I would definitely recommend this wand to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I use this curler for my long hair extensions.  It curls very quickly but you need to be careful. It gets really really hot. I burned my forehead. :(  But other than that I love this curler</li>
    <li> I think the varied reviews on this product might be related to personality type and style type desired.  As for me, I have long, thick hair.  Normally, I tie it in a knot on top of my head after I wash it, and go.  But on frigid days, I like having the option to blow dry it, but rarely have time to style.  And, when I blow dry, it inevitably has some frizz to it, so I have to do something... this wand is the answer!! It&#x27;s amazingly simple... there doesn&#x27;t have to be any sort of technique, really.  I just grab it in sections, and wrap... I get a loose wave, body, and it smooths out the frizz.  Moments later, I&#x27;m out the door. Hours later, it still looks great.. even natural! Thanks, Amazon!  I never would have discovered this wand if it weren&#x27;t for it being a feature sale of the day.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin. There&#x27;s a lot of it, but it&#x27;s thin. It&#x27;s NEVER been able to hold a decent curl that I&#x27;ve done on my own. I&#x27;ve never found a curling iron that works for me. A friend of mine recommended a \\&quot;wand\\&quot; style curling iron. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this one! My hair curls and STAYS curled until the next day. It really is a great product. Be careful, though, it is extremely easy to burn yourself. It takes a couple of times to get used to it.</li>
    <li> gets super hot, which is perfect for my thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;Love this</li>
    <li> I can not review because this was purchased as a gift, but I&#x27;m sure it will be great.  It was not purchaed for myself.</li>
    <li> use the glove or burn hand. It was given to you for a reason. Curls quickly and nicely. Wife didnt like the glove at first. But after burning herself she uses it everytime.</li>
    <li> Since I have not used a curling iron like this in the past, without a clamp to hold the hair in place, it has taken some adjustment to learning the best way to secure the hair with the glove around the curler.  When using it, I have set the iron on the lowest heat which seems plenty hot.  I actually had a friend fix my hair for me on the day of my son&#x27;s wedding with this curling iron which was brand new at the time.  The curls turned out really nice and I got lots of compliments on my hair.  My friend said it was easy to use once she got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few days back and tried but it didn&#x27;t work so well. I have straight hair and this one doesn&#x27;t help. The light waves that I got are also not so great. Returned this item.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this curling wand and really wanted to like it based on all the reviews. But in the end it&#x27;s only a 3 star for me. I will have to say that the wand heats up quickly and the curls that it produces stay a long time. However, I had trouble getting my hair to stay in place on the wand (the surface is too slick) and I just found it a little too awkward to handle. Also, the glove that came with the wand for heat protection is more or less of a joke because it is so thin. I think I may use this to curl a strand or two to frame my face but otherwise I will use the standard curling iron to do the rest of my hair. This may be a better tool to do someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair toy that I have purchased in a long time! I am the least capable person when it comes to styling hair. I visit the hair salon once a week to get my hair curled. This is simply because I can not get the desired curls at home on my own. I bought the curling wand in hopes to achieve my desired look. Again, I am so not skilled at using a traditional curling iron or flat irons to curl my hair, but the curling wand makes me look like I have the skills of a PRO! My hair is about 4 inches past shoulder length in the back, so it is very easy for me to curl the back of my hair. The front is layered so it is not as easy to use the wand to curl the front (I still use my flat iron to style the front of my hair). I agree with other reviews that this item is not for shorter hair, unless you have experience using the wand and know you can style your hair with it. If you have no experience using a curling wand and/or have limited skills styling hair I would suggest going to youtube and watching tutorials on how to use a wand. There are reviews and tutorials on this exact product. They helped me decide which product to buy!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!! EVERY TIME I USE IT MY HAIR LOOKS AMAZING!! I HAVE GORGEOUS CURLS INSTANTLY!! GET IT GET IT!! YOU&#x27;LL BE HAPPY YOU DID</li>
    <li> I get seriously great curls with this wand. They still look awesome even after being pulled back in a pony tail during a three mile bike ride in 110* heat. I just take the pony tail down when I get to work each day and finger comb out the curls or use a large toothed comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviewers who say this product is dangerous and they&#x27;ve gotten burned and it&#x27;s too hot for hair and all manners of other complaints, but I have not had any bad experiences with this product at all and I was a 100% beginner when i received this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest watching a couple of vids about using wands so that you can get a good understanding of how to do it. It&#x27;s very similar to using a curling iron, but the main difference is that you wrap your hair around the wand, rather than using the wand to wrap your hair with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do one side of my head at a time and pull the other into a hair tie to keep it out of the way. I do use the hottest setting most of the time because of my bike commute to work, but if I&#x27;m doing my hair other wise, I use the lowest setting. Working in 1/2 inch to 1 inch sections on the right side of my head, I hold the wand in my left hand and brace my wrist against my head somewhere so mhy hand does not move and the tip of the wand is pointing somewhere towards the floor. I have the glove on my right hand and with the hair in my fingers, I wrap it around the wand from the handle to the point. I leave it about three to five seconds and let go. If the heat is too intense on the gloved hand, you can use the tip of your finger to twirl it around the barrel so it does not stay in one spot to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use product to help the curl set, not even hair spray after I&#x27;m finished, I just let the curls fall out naturally throughout the day. After 12 to 16 hour days my hair still looks great and has amazing body. Love love love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is long and thick and I loved the curls it gave me. It gets really hot, so be careful. The glove that came with it is not very heat resistant. I watched a couple of Youtube videos on curling wands to get ideas on the best way to use it.</li>
    <li> This wand is awesome!  It was a little tricky at first learning how to use it and the glove definitely comes in handy to keep from burning yourself.  The first time I used this my hair turned out amazing, though, and the curls lasted for days.  I love the look it creates.  Heats up quickly and has a nice long cord.  I couldn&#x27;t tell from picures or other reviews, but it does have the attached little \\&quot;legs\\&quot;, if you will, so you are able to set it down without the wand touching any surfaces.  I like that it has a lock mechanism to lock in your heat setting while styling.  Great product!</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter loves it.  Exactly what she was looking for.  When she uses it, it seems to hold the style all day long.</li>
    <li> I rather had to chuckle as I read many of the reviews for this curling wand and how many people were surprised by the lack of a clamp. That&#x27;s really the point of this iron. A clamp-less curling iron creates a look that is different from a traditional curling iron. It definitely takes some getting used to and a bit of practice, but there is a lot you can do with it.   That being said, I was not impressed with this particular iron. I have owned the Conair version for quite some time and I really like it. I bought this simply because it came with the glove! However, after looking at the other reviews and pictures, I am wondering if someone else did the exact same thing with the iron I bought and replaced the glove with another and then returned it! The glove that was in the box is nothing like the gloves pictured and described here. My glove was just a simple cotton glove, very much like the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; gloves that one puts on over lotion to help soften the skin. I found it impossible to manipulate my hair while wearing the glove- it just slid right out of my hand and got a bit frizzy to boot! Very disappointing. The Conair Infiniti clamp-less iron is overall nicer quality and I will continue to use that, rather than this.</li>
    <li> I love this wand. It creates luscious curls and waves that are long lasting. I researched forever on different wands and settled on this because of the youtube video reviews and the results it created. The price is another factor that swayed me towards the remington. I said if  I didn&#x27;t like it then I would be out 25.00 dollars, If I bought the Enzo wand I would be out 89.00 so this was an easy choice for me. This wand is great and I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I was not good at using curling irons with a clip so this wand is perfect for me. The glove is helpful and getting the type of curl you want take some practice but definitely worth the price. Plus it&#x27;s super light!</li>
    <li> I just got this curling wand. It works amazingly well!  all you do is wrap your hair around the barrel and in literally three seconds its curled! It holds really well too!  LOVE this!</li>
    <li> I have really straight, thick hair that usually doesn&#x27;t take a curl well at all with regular curling irons or even heat rollers.  THis wand curled my hair, curled it fast, and miraculously the curl stayed in all day!  I did pretty tight curls the first day, and even the second day the curls stayed in although more relaxed.  It is a little tricky doing the back of my own hair especially since my hair is only shoulder length, but it&#x27;s a short learning curve.  I also curled my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is naturally wavy, and her hair took the curl amazingly and it lasted for days.  So fast, so much easier than a regular curling iron, and beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Well this will b short n sweet. Works like a charm had it for a couple of Weeks now n I love it. The curls are so diverse and last a really long time. Really great product.  Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to purchase a curling wand for quite some time, but many curling wand brands are priced in the $100+ range - a bit out of my budget!  After all, my regular old school curling iron works just fine!  However, when if found the Remington Curling Wand (1\\&quot;) on Amazon, priced at less than $40 bucks (including shipping), how could I resist?  I am so glad I made this purchase!  Curling hair with this curling wand is a breeze, and you get perfect, shiny ringlets every time.  I get tons of compliments each time I use the wand; plus, I can curl my entire head in less than 20 minutes!  Additionally, I love the temperature control feature - perfect for all hair types.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend this curling wand more - get yours today! :)</li>
    <li> We have used this curling wand several times.  It is very easy to use and my daughter loves how her hair turns out.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair that does not hold a curl.  You name it and I&#x27;ve tried it.  I ordered this curling iron after seeing someone use it in a tutorial on youtube.  I was skeptical, but the price was very reasonable so I went for it.  The very first time I used this iron I had clean, product free hair.  In thirty minutes (I have a lot of hair) I had amazing curl that lasted through three days, including workouts.  It would have lasted longer had I not washed my hair.  I love this thing!  It was a little awkward to use at first.  The glove is an absolute necessity for me because this thing does get hot.  Ouch!  In fact, I use an Ove Glove.) Totally worth it to be able to have curly hair.    I&#x27;m recommending it to everyone I know, especially my friends with curl resistant hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!! easy to use, heat up very easily, loving my curls.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is the single best hair tool I have ever used. I am half mexican, half white, and I have very thick, semi-wavy hair. Regular hair curlers will curl my hair, but by the end of the night the curls fall. With this curling wand, my curls stay until the next day. I absolutely love this wand. I recommend it to everyone that I know. Great purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> I have very fine and flat hair that is about shoulder length. I have tried everything to get some body in my lifeless hair, I was thinking that this product was going to be yet another good idea of mine gone bad on how to change my look a bit. I am happy to say though that this is one of the few hair products beyond a typical hair dryer that I have actually been impressed with. First of all, I am poor so I can&#x27;t afford to keep things that don&#x27;t work, second I hate putting any sort of product in my hair so I need something that works by itself, not with the aid of sticky junk in my hair. From the second I got his out of the box and started using it I was amazed on how easy it was use (way easier than a standard clip curling iron). My hair didn&#x27;t get tangled up in it and the curls came out perfectly. I even was able to add body at my root simply by twisting my hair by the root around the thickest part of the iron. Granted, my curls loosened up dramatically toward the end of the day, but the waves where still there (with a normal iron by hair would have been flat and fluffy by the end of the day). A GREAT purchase for a person on a budget that can&#x27;t afford to waste money on products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand, there&#x27;s no question about it. The curls are lovely and my hair is much less damaged than after an ordinary curling iron. I would recommend it to anyone, especially for that price!</li>
    <li> This is a really great curler. Its simple to use and gets out really good curls. The only bad thing about it is its really easy to burn yourself, and its hard to hold your hair with the glove on. Plus, you can still burn yourself even with the glove on.</li>
    <li> This has been very effective on my difficult hair.  It works better than prior products that I have struggled with.</li>
    <li> I love my wand! It works excellent on my hair</li>
    <li> Hands down the best wand I have owned.  Great price and fast shipping.  Gets hot very fast, which is a plus for me when i am  in a hurry and trying to get out the door.  My curls last all day and than some. When they start to fall out i have great beachy waves going on that i can rock the next day.  Two of my girlfriends have bought the same wand and love it just the same.  If you are looking to get one, this is the one to get!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! Perfect ringlets every time! And u CANNOT beat the price! I will always use this. I was glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I really like the product and it has held up in quality over the past year I have owned it. The only request I would have it having a longer barrel, it is hard with long hair like mine. Otherwise it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Excellent curler. I wish it was a tad longer though for those with long hair, but I&#x27;ve learned to work around that, I just do it in halves.</li>
    <li> I just got this the other day and i was kinda hesitant because i have kind of wavy hair and its frizzy so i didnt know if it would work and look nice on my hair but i used it and i love it!! the curls are so pretty. I would suggest straightening your hair a little bit before (thats what i did) but i abs. love this curling wand!!!</li>
    <li> I got this product and was excited about it. but after I opended it up it DIDN&#x27;T WORK. No matter what electrical outlit I used it would not turn on. Thanks for wasting my money.</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron ive ever used. Works perfect, curls look natural and last all day. Sooo worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have had the 1 inch curling wand and recently just got the large barrel. I LOVE these curlers! I always got clamp marks from traditional curling irons, but not with these! This iron gets really hot, which I love and i can curl my hair much more quickly than with traditional irons. This gives me great curls that last for days!!! It does take a little but of learning to figure out which hands to use and how to wrap your hair and it is a little more difficult to fit all of you hair on the small barrel iron if you have really long hair like I do, but I still love these curlers! Be patient with it, it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> love it love it love it! works well, heats up fast, and gets really hot....every female in my house hold is trying to steal it..just gives my hair the perfect spiral curls.</li>
    <li> OK so after reading a lot of reviews of this product i thought i&#x27;d buy it, it came after about 2 weeks and i absoloutely love it. Super easy to use and against what people say the glove is perfectly fine and is comfortable. :D Curls take like 20 seconds and are beautiful I would tottaly suggest this again to anyone. Btw im only 14 so girls my age would love this too.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, and it the curling wand works well on my hair. Make sure you&#x27;re careful if you&#x27;re a beginner though, I burnt my arm by going too quickly. And definitely use the glove.</li>
    <li> I am very glad that I didnt let the \\&quot;few\\&quot; negative reviews of this product hold me back because I love it! I tried this the second the UPS man left dropped it off. Now before this curling iron I had never used one before but that didnt make a difference because it is incredibly easy to use. I have fine, shoulder length, naturally curly hair that likes to do it&#x27;s own thing and with this iron I was able to curl sections that were not to my liking and get the perfect hair I always wanted. Even after a blow out I was able to curl all of my hair fairly easily in a short amount of time. The results you can get with this iron are countless, from small, springy curls(wrap only around the smallest part of the wand and hold tight) to beachy loose waves(hold the wand downwards and wrap starting from the thickest section to the smallest and hold loosly for like a second). One tip, for those of you with layers in your hair, it may be easier NOT to section off your hair, and if not easier the results will def. be more natural looking. When I sectioned my hair to begin with, it was quite difficult to get a good section of hair to curl and when I was done it looked \\&quot;fake\\&quot;. The glove that comes with it is much easier to use than other gloves you can buy at the store because they tend to be thicker, with an odd texture that your hair will stick to and become frizzy. This one is sleek enough to not add frizz and protects your hand from the heat of the iron(which is very hot!). I noticed people complaining about the glove not protecting their hand from the heat and I think this has to do with how long you are holding your hair on the wand. That is a user mistake and should not be blamed on Remington or their heat protector glove-thingamajig. If you have the iron on the right temp. setting for your hair(can take some time to get it right) you only need to hold each strand around the wand for a few seconds to get a perfect curl, and in my experience if you hold the curl for too long it looks strangely unnatural. Another thing I want to add is be careful because there are dozens of opportunities to burn yourself while using this. I know that goes for any styling tool that heats up but I read over 10 reviews of people complaining of the burn risk, use some common sense people and be diligent and dont rag on Remington for your own mistake(i own an expensive straightener, which was an upgrade from a remington one and I experienced the same amount of burns from both). I love this product but I did recieve a nasty burn on my leg(from not paying attention) and a small burn on my forehead while curling my bangs (just because I wasnt used to it yet). It is just a risk you take when using ANY heated tool.</li>
    <li> I like the curling wand.. I just wished i would have got the 1 1/2 inch.. The 1 inch leaves you hair with waves not curls.. But other then that its a great product.. It does come with the protective glove.. Would not buy again cause i want curls not waves..&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003V265QW Remington CI95AC/2 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand, 1 Inch]]</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and the curls come out perfectly! Still need to learn how to use it better since I&#x27;m a bit new to curling. Love how quickly it heats up and how there are so many different settings! I find the heat glove useless, but that&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t have any trouble with just putting my fingers on the black tip even on the highest setting.</li>
    <li> Came in the mail, works well.. 5 stars ^^  recommend you do reaserch on your hair to determine your heat settings!!</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand, I got one for myself earlier this year and just ordered another for my sister. To power on, hold down the power button. I thought there was something wrong with mine because I couldn&#x27;t get it on until I googled it. Makes great, long lasting curls. The glove is great to have too!   My sisters and I have very thick hair, it takes a long time to curl, because you have to separate it into small sections to use this wand, but it works wonderfully for our hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wand. Heats up quick and the glove fits perfectly and protects well. My only concern is the quality of curls but that is only due to user inexperience. I just need more practice sectioning my hair...I&#x27;m happy I bought this, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Just perfect .....i love it</li>
    <li> Very cool item was excited when I got it. Only problem which isn&#x27;t with amazon, is that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use on short hair (can&#x27;t reach the back by yourself without burning yourself), and the glove is useless. Expect to get burned a few times. It takes a long time to actually do my hair with it, but the end result is cute bouncy(or wavy) curls that look natural. I suggest to look on youtube for tutorials on how to use this product! it will help tremendously :)</li>
    <li> I have ordered this wasn&#x27;t TWICE now. First time, it didn&#x27;t turn on period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second one came, it worked ONCE then never turned on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my other appliances work in the same plug in no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has turned into waaay more of a hassle. Sad thing is, I bought it to go to a Gala for a job that I could have reallt used... I needed to be elegant... and it not working torally threw my night off. Needless to say, I didnt get the job.</li>
    <li> As the tittle says it. I recommend this product for people with long hair that have experience with this type of iron equipment. I have short hair and it&#x27;s been a pain trying to fix my hair even with the glove.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be easy to use especially with the glove. the glove doesn&#x27;t really help and my ends don&#x27;t curl right...I have short hair and I am hoping once it grows out this will work better on my hair. also this gets extremely hot so be careful. I would buy a holder that suctions onto the mirror if you have small children.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I was hoping for but it did keep the curl really well and I enjoy using it with my little girls.</li>
    <li> Got this gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Although my hair normally doesnt hold curls very well, when I curled it with this curling wand and added a little hairspray it held all day long. I even slept in it and all I had to do was go over my curls and it looked great again !   It does take a little to get used to but once you get it going its fast and easy. You have to make sure you wrap your hair all the way to the end so it curls the ends well.    This product comes with the glove to prevent you from burning yourself but I find it eaiser to curl without it..... just be extra careful !   I get tons of compliments when I curl my hair with this wand and would recommend it to anyone !</li>
    <li> Works great! Love that it came with the glove</li>
    <li> I got my Wand Today and I tried it right away ! I gotta say it&#x27;s really good and easy to use and I got it in less then a week ! Great Prouct !</li>
    <li> If you burn your arm, it is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;  comes with glove. creates nice wave and curls&lt;br /&gt;heats very quickly and curls have good hold</li>
    <li> This curling wand is AMAZING it Holds a curl so well it has just the right heat temps tire I love it and it leaves ur curls sleek and shiny I love this</li>
    <li> - Curls last forEVER! Even after going to bed they stay in!  - Yes, takes some getting used to, but you guys act like there isn&#x27;t a website called YOUTUBE! Watch some tutorials and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it real fast &amp; your hair will be beautiful with the quickness  - And with the quickness, I mean 10 minutes! I have a LOT of hair too    - The GIRLS who can&#x27;t handle this curling wand are some suckas. Pull that stick out of your butt and stop being a prissy BASIC girl</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand. The wand actually heated very quickly and the curls came out absolutely perfect. The curls were very tight and I could loosen them if I wanted that type of affect. This wand can be used for perfect beach waves and amazing curls. I was surprised that this was very cheap for a curling wand with such good quality. I&#x27;m so excited to use it in the future! Defiantly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Came really fast! Really great. The glove does help with the heat. Not like u Dnt feel ANY heat but it makes it bearable. Curls were very nice and didn&#x27;t have to hold the hair on long for it to form. And especially for me never have tried using a curling wand the curls came out awesome regardless the fact that I felt I might have be curling them wrong lol</li>
    <li> Love it. My hair stays curled all day.</li>
    <li> I am very \\&quot;cack-handed\\&quot;, i.e. not very dextrous particularly when trying to style my hair. I have 3 different curling irons, mainly the clamp type, as well as a triple barrel waver and hair straighteners. I have been wanting those nice loose waves but haven&#x27;t been able to create them with the tools that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because it wasn&#x27;t expensive and thought it would be good to try out, not costing me much if I couldn&#x27;t get to grips with it. I am very pleasantly surprised at how easy this is to use and the results I get. I have shoulder length, layered, medium thickness hair and purchased the larger 1.5 inch size.  I usually set it to 374-392 degree setting. After watching a tutorial on Youtube (yes, I am THAT useless) which suggested you hold the iron pointing down while spiralling your hair around the barrel AWAY from the face, I get those nice loose waves which frame my face without being too ringletty and Shirley Temple. The curls do drop throughout the day, but that&#x27;s quite a nice look in itself. The heat resistant glove isn&#x27;t GREAT but it&#x27;s better than nothing. The iron gets pretty hot so I&#x27;ve ordered a separate glove to see if that&#x27;s any more heat resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend using a heat protectant spray when using this iron as temps reach 410 degrees. I use Paul Mitchell Hot Off The Press which works and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I took a star off is because the control buttons are positioned in such a way that I&#x27;m always accidentally pressing them while curling my hair and unwittingly changing the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m VERY happy with this curling iron and have since got rid of two of the other tools I have in favour of this one. I have got a lot of compliments and have used it pretty much every day since it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY</li>
    <li> This curling wand works amazing for the price. It heats up and is ready to go in less than a minute. It does get super hot though so I recommend wearing the glove while you get used to using it.  I would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> natural looking curls</li>
    <li> Item shipped and arrived as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product. The curling wand is light weight and convenient to put away in a drawer. Also, it gets extremely hot and cuts curling time in half. After using the wand, your arms aren&#x27;t tired. The price is great also. Other brands range around 30$ whereas the Remington curling wand was purchased at 26$. I highly recommend this product to others:)</li>
    <li> How on earth have I waited this long to buy a ceramic curling wand?! It is awesome and heats up super fast! Woohoo and welcome to the 21st century!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m pretty sure my last curling iron purchase was in the 90s. Not even kidding.)</li>
    <li> This is the worst curling iron ever! Youtube and commercials make it look so easy, but I think you have to be a hair professinal to even attempt using this kind of curling iron.</li>
    <li> This wand is great you can sleep in your curls and wake up and still have perfect hair. You will need a learning curve. The glove that cones with is a must for first time curls.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. Its perfect for creating beautiful beach waves and loose curls. I have very thick hair and it holds the curls all day, even without hairspray. I find it much more convenient than regular curling irons, since its clipless it isn&#x27;t harsh to your ends. Its fast and easy and it usually does a perfect curl in about 20 secs. I love love love!, I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 years now and its still in perfect condition. :)</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! There are much more expensive irons, but I am glad I chose this one-works great! I&#x27;ve recommended this product to a few friends.</li>
    <li> I love my new styling wand! it works great and is super easy and fast to style with. I love all the multiple styles I can do with this wand and how quick and easy it is to use. heats up fast. works great on my thin hair and great on my sisters thick hair as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wand. You just need to use it a few times in order to get the hang of it. It creates beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> Great for my extensions and hair. And for the price can&#x27;t complain...</li>
    <li> As a first timer to curling my hair, I didn&#x27;t realize that there were two types of curling wands, those with the clamps and those without. I ordered this one, and when I received it, had no idea how to use it, even after reading the instructions, for some reason. It just didn&#x27;t communicate. I ended up looking up instructions for how to use this type of curlers on youtube.  While I am still by no means amazing, the curler is fairly simple to use and produces great results. It has a variety of heat settings which makes it convenient for most hair types. My hair holds the curls, although I use protecting and holding spray (2-in-1) before and after every curl.  Unfortunately, I have a tendency to occasionally burn myself on it. The glove makes my hands too clumsy, so I can&#x27;t really rely on it. The only other problem I have with this curling wand is that I find that while wrapping my hair around the wider base it tends to slip down the wand, no matter how I hold it. However, if you are looking for a curling wand that has no clamp, I believe this to be a good product, especially seeing how quickly I picked it up after watching a quick how-to video. I did my whole head that night, and it looked fabulous. ;)</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair that has NEVER been able to hold a curl when using a regular curling iron.  Usually if I curl my hair, the curls will fall flat within an hour.  This product does require some skill- the first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results, mainly because I wasn&#x27;t sure of the technique to use!  I actually went on youtube and watched a turtorial on how to use a curl wand.  Once you get the process down, it is AMAZING!  My curls last ALL day long!</li>
    <li> I love the way this curling iron looks , it&#x27;s pink, very girly and it&#x27;s also made out of crushed pearls. I like that you can lock your temperature setting so that you don&#x27;t turn it off by mistake while curling your hair. It comes with a heat protectant glove for your hand to prevent burns. It gives you wonderful curls and the curls literally will last for two days if you wanted it to. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it goes from thick at the base to skinny at the tip and while curling your hair, it tends to all slip down towards the end. I guess you just have to get used to using it and holding it at a certain angle so it doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> I have used this 1 1/2\\&quot; curling iron once on my fine, but thick long hair.  It was a comedy of me watching myself in the mirror trying desperately to keep my hair from sliding down to the end of the iron. Thank heavens for the glove because I was a hot mess trying to get the hang of this.  The ends were scraggly more often than not, but a quick wrap around the barrel for a few seconds fixed the problem nicely.  I&#x27;ve used clip curling irons my whole life, but thought a clip-less would be suited better for making the trendy loose locks look.  I think a straight barrel would be easier to use.  Anyway.  After I was finished, my curls were tighter than I wanted and I thought about purchasing a larger, straight barrel.  But my hair was so full and pretty that I was on the fence.  My curls did relax a little after a few hours and looked like perfection. I slept on the curls and the next day they were still in great shape.  All I had to do was carefully brush my hair to tidy things up and was set with gorgeous hair for a 2nd day. I want to keep this curling iron now.  Not giving it up, no chance.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to handling my hair with the tapered barrel.  4 stars for the learning curve.</li>
    <li> Both of my daughters have fine thin hair that has never held any kind of curl very long, but this thing is awesome!  It takes half the time and the curls last forever!  They literally will still look good even the next day!  I totally recommend this for anyone who has had trouble getting curls to last!  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is spoilt. The power keeps shutting off after two minutes of curling. Lowering the temperature seems ineffective. It&#x27;s now a white elephant on my dresser :(</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I have very thin hair and it is not easy to find a product that curls my hair well (my hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl). But this product does the job, and might I add pretty quickly. My hair held a curl done by this wand for about 12 hours; it ended up turning into a beachy wave at the end, which is pretty good for my hair type. I actually preferred this heat glove (included) compared to other gloves that come with wands, this glove is not scratchy like other gloves. The scratchy gloves I am referring to remind me of like an exfoliating shower glove (I hope that makes sense). At first it took me some time on how to properly use it without my hair slipping off the barrel; because it&#x27;s ceramic, but I got the hang of it. You just have to hold the wand upward when curling, then turn it down when ready to release curl. But overall would recomenmd to anyone. I curled my friends hair and she has naturally curly hair so her curls came out extra bouncy.</li>
    <li> well first off this curling iron is a little hard to get used to at first if you are more used to curling ur hair with rollers and the traditional \\&quot;duck bill\\&quot; curling iron. but once you get used to it its freaking amazing! my hair is naturally wavy and the curl holds in longer which is great! so all in all i love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> I love love love this wand its sooo beautiful! The pale pearl pink color is just too cute. Also tje curls I get are amazing! It takes me only 20 mintues to curl my whole head! I love it and I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my girlfriend because she loves to curl her hair a lot. She love it :)</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about how great this curling wand was so I decided to purchase it and I have to say it is truly AMAZING. I&#x27;ve curled my thick/short/curly-wavy hair with it twice and if you know how to use it properly it can work wonders. The curls come out nice and smooth and the glove that is provided with the packaging helps a lot. The temperature lock feature is great so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn the wand off while moving it around. I had never heard about a pearl ceramic coating but I must say it does a great job and keeps my hair looking good. Also my curls have lasted days with the help of a small amount of hairspray when I finished curling my hair. I would definitely recommend this product, good price and great quality.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The glove is useless for me, but a good idea for those who have no idea how to use the product. The &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; is quick and easy to use, and curling long hair isn&#x27;t a problem anymore.</li>
    <li> I was reading some of the reviews in here and was thinking to buy it or not. I gave it a shot since it was a good price. When i got it I opened it right away to test it. It heats up fast. Within a min. It takes about 5 seconds to get a curl. This curler makes perfect curls. I love it. My curls last all day. My hair is still curled in the morning of the next day. I love this curler. The best i have ever owned. I would recommend buying it. Only thing is the glove isn&#x27;t that good. I have gotten my fingers burned even with the glove on.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I actually purchased this Wand from Target all the girls in Our Family use it constantly and I personally recommend it for its versital uses and much quicker than the curling iron. \\&quot;</li>
    <li> Awesome just as described</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and so far all I hear is how she loves,loves her new curling wand.</li>
    <li> The curling wand is soo soo much better than a curling iron. The best purchase I have made in a long time. I Highly recommend this product. I didn&#x27;t use that heat glove..but I did burn my fingures a couple of times. It also curls my hair so much faster than any other Iron I have used.</li>
    <li> I gave up on trying to curl my long, thick hair years ago. Which is why I was skeptical that this product would work. I could never keep curls in my hair from generic curling iron, even with a pound of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling wand is really a miracle for me. Not only did I receive it THREE days after placing the order, but my hair has stayed beautifully curled for 12+ hours so far WITHOUT hairspray or any kind of hair product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite hard to use at first (your hair slips around on the wand) but it&#x27;s easy to get used to. The glove really does come in handy for those prone to being clumsy. The wand&#x27;s highest temp is 410 degrees and it curled my hair in about 20 minutes (keeping in mind my hair is really thick and mid back length).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and price of the curling wand and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have amazing curls in a short amount of time!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair that is hard to curl.  I have been looking for a curling iron that can give me some curls that will not go flat before I walk out the door.  This product had good reviews, and I really like Remington products.  So I thought I would give it a try. I am beyond disappointed and will be returning it.  I spent over 30 minutes trying to curl just one section of my hair and didn&#x27;t get anything more than a wave.  I put it on the highest heat setting, tried large pieces of hair, small pieces of hair, I tried leaving it on the iron for longer periods and shorter periods, I tried to switch the hand I was using the iron in...you name it, I tried it.  And I got a wave.  I do not recommend this iron at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my girlfriend last Christmas.  She uses curlers and  had mentioned that the metal often burns hair product on to the surface.  I thought since this was ceramic, then the surface may be easier to clean.  And luckily, it is.  So no longer do you smell the build up burned scent of old hairspray.  She also mentioned that the item heats up quickly and stays warmer more evenly across the surface.  The glove is a nice extra to protect against getting burned.  Overall, she was very happy with the item and I was very happy with the price.  I thought this was a good gift, but it turned out to be a great gift.</li>
    <li> i love it! It does so much in such a short time!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a christmas present and my sister loved it. Said it worked really well and was easily the best curling iron she has had.</li>
    <li> Perfect curls everytime</li>
    <li> I got the smaller size. Tight curl, needed bigger one!</li>
    <li> Very Good Wand Curler! Works Wonderful With Brazilian Hair! Definitely Recommend!</li>
    <li> So I bought this to curl my hair with, but I sometimes forget how lazy I am.  This is a lot of work for me especially because I have super thick and long hair.  It&#x27;s great if one of my friends uses it on me, but for me to do it by myself, not so much.  With that being said, it does curl my hair and I don&#x27;t have to keep my hair wrapped around it for more than a few seconds.  If I were someone who likes doing her hair, then this would be a GREAT tool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not someone who curls my hair on a daily basis. And when I do need to break out a curling tool I used to go straight for my handy-dandy 1 1/2 inch jumbo curling iron for loose waves at the tips of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my curling iron went kaput, and so for Christmas I was given this curling wand. I&#x27;m a very low-maintenance kind of girl, and a little accident-prone, so I need tools that are easy to use. This curling wand unfortunately did not fit my bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just got way too hot for my needs, and even at lower settings I was nicking my fingertips (that glove made it difficult for me to feel what I was doing), my forehead and my ears! (I told you I was accident-prone). I also found it difficult to keep my hair wrapped around the proper width because the pearl wand was so slippery without a clamp. I won&#x27;t even go into the difficulties I had doing the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a solid try at least 3 different times, and even watched a few YouTube videos for visual guidance, but ended up frustrated and with my hair in a defeated ponytail each time. If you are someone who likes using hair tools, or playing around with styles, then you might want to give it a try. I however, ended up returning it and getting a replacement 1 1/2\\&quot; curing iron that works just how I need it to!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron because my hair always got caught in the clip on a regular curling iron. I found it harder to curl with the regular curling iron, and found that it took too long to curl with a straightener. Makes my hair look great. I can go tight curls, loose curls, just curl the ends. I loveee it! I&#x27;d consider it a definite buy for women with long hair!    Pros:  Easy to use  Fast curls  Great price  Versatile- curl all of your hair, or just the ends  Hair doesn&#x27;t get caught anywhere    Cons:  Heats up slowly sometimes, starts at 354 degrees, until you increase it.  Not the best choice for short hair  The glove included does NOT protect fully against the heat</li>
    <li> I was using Remington curlers but they were not giving me the definition of curls that I wanted so I decided to buy this. I love the new type of curls I can get with this device - even in a short time. I have naturally curly hair so it might be that they hold better for me than they do for other people.&lt;br /&gt;The device heats up pretty fast, and I usually go with the preset temperature if my hair is clean. I&#x27;ve only gone higher a couple of times when my hair had a lot of product in it. I usually get very natural looking curls. It takes me about 20 minutes to get through all my hair and I have medium length hair that&#x27;s very frizzy. The curls hold until my next wash and sleeping doesn&#x27;t affect the definition much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is very light which makes it easy to put in a suitcase. I am traveling with it now and I forgot the glove it came with - which led me to burn my fingers a couple of times ( nothing bad). However, I didn&#x27;t use the glove much at home either because I can&#x27;t hold my hair as well - it slips faster. The wand does not have a clip-on so you have to be able to hold it. I burnt one of my ears a little bit because of that too. Nothing scarring or permanent, but it takes a while to get used to, especially if you don&#x27;t like using the glove. That&#x27;s why I am only ranking this as a 4- otherwise the price-quality rapport is very good.</li>
    <li> i was looking into curling wands like this for a while ever since i had seen one at a local drug store.i looked into a million different ones before finally purchasing this one and im glad i did.for $20 this is the best investments i have made in quite a while.im no pro at curling.im had no clue what i was doing when i first tried but i quickly learned.it heats up fast and works like a dream.i cannot stress how much i needed that heatin g glove either.this is such an amazing buy.i would recommend this to any one and everyone</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this wand.  A friend recommended the product to me after I asked her how she managed to get such beautiful curls.  I wasn&#x27;t sold at first, I mean, everyone&#x27;s hair is different- so I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to spend $30 on another hair product.  My hair is long (down around my lower back area) and THICK, but it usually falls flat within a few hours or so whenever I try to style it.  I was afraid this product would leave me disappointed like the others, I had tried traditional curling irons, leave in curlers, and even hot curlers, and nothing seemed to work.  Even my hair stylist agreed that my hair was difficult to style- so I knew purchasing this wand was a gamble.  I am really glad that I decided to buy this product, because it works great!  Upon opening the package, you&#x27;ll find an instruction guide, a glove, and a very girly, cute pink wand.  It only takes a few seconds to heat this little guy up to 410 (the highest setting) so by the time you get your hair clipped and ready, it&#x27;s ready to use.  I recommend wearing the glove on the hand you&#x27;re using to do the actual hair wrapping.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of touching the wand with your gloved hand, it&#x27;s pretty heat resistant, but do NOT firmly place your fingers directly on the wand.  Your hair works sort of as a \\&quot;barrier\\&quot; between the two, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  Once the wand heats up, take sections of your hair and loosely (will create wavy, loose like curls) or tightly (springy, tight curls) wrap around the wand.  Hold for 5-10 seconds (depending on how tight you want your curls) and let go.  TADA (it really is magic) beautiful curls.  I find my curls lasting well through the day, and even after sleeping on them I still have that \\&quot;beach waves\\&quot; look, which my hubby loves.  I highly recommend watching some Youtube tutorials before beginning, it will help you learn how to use the wand quickly and achieve the look you want.  It took me about 20 minutes the first time I used it, but on average it takes about 10-15 minutes for me to curl all of my hair (and trust me, there is a lot of hair! haha) HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! I swear, it&#x27;s like a magic wand. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different curling irons to get those perfect curls and they&#x27;d come close, but it&#x27;d take about 45 minutes to do all of my hair. I got this and got amazing perfect curls done in 15 minutes! And everyone kept complimenting on it throughout the day.   It gets hot in a matter of seconds. Just be cautious while curling because it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself. I don&#x27;t use the glove though. Personally, I find it makes it harder for me to tell whether I wrapped the very end of my hair around or not.</li>
    <li> Making curls is so much easier!  There is a major learning curve (which I expected) and getting to the back of the head is really tough!  On the other hand I was happy with it with the first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the glove is a waste of money.  I was hoping it would really block out heat and double as a cover (I have a felt cover for another curling iron that I love to use to travel and easy fast storage), but it says right on the package the glove is not meant for more then a a way to hold the hair onto the curler, and if you touch the curler directly with the glove you still feel A LOT of heat.  You could totally get a way with buying a better glove like those stretchy ones then have 2 to where, but honestly I&#x27;ve found I can be careful enough to not need it.</li>
    <li> Love this iron. Have to get used to using it, as it&#x27;s different but long lasting curls.</li>
    <li> Takes seconds to curl, but curls don&#x27;t come out for hours! Amazing product, beware the high heat settings, and wear the glove.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I just got this for Christmas, and I was worried it would take an extremely long time to curl. Usually I take an hour or more to curl my hair because my hair is really straight with no curl.  So decided to try this.. literally 20 minutes later I was finished with gorgeous Taylor Swift hair.  I recommend this product to everyone especially if you have difficulties with your hair not holding a curl. This is honestly a magic \\&quot;wand\\&quot; ;) It heats up really fast and really hot. I had to ask the person who bought this for me if it was really expensive.. nope, just magical.  IT WILL BE YOUR FAVORITE CURLING IRON! Seriously, such a good investment. I didn&#x27;t even burn myself, and its not very hard to figure out. Also dual-voltage, which is always a plus if you live over-seas like me.  I give this a 10 out of 10. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, my daughter loves it! Easy to use and effective.</li>
    <li> The Amazon.com Product Description of the Remington CI95AC/2 is detailed and informative. I bought this for my wife (she is a professional cosmetologist)she said after using it several times (on her-self and others)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;I guess my main complaint is the cord, it is so short! I am used to longer cords on my heat styling tools and having such a short cord is a bummer, I have to be right on top of an outlet, just not enough reach to do a clients hair with out a bit of discomfort. Even doing my own hair it was a challenge. I lost the glove almost right away, but I have experience with hot tools, so that is not a big deal, but you might want to keep an eye on the glove and not loose it. That being said, the few times I did use the glove I found it cumbersome and awkward to use, and ended up taking it off.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I found this iron works best on hair that has been layered and about medium length. Fine hair is a bit \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; and I was having some problems with the hair slipping down the length of the rod before I could get all of the hair wrapped around the barrel. My hair is fine in texture, but I have a lot of it, it is long and all one length, I got beautiful springy curls, that lasted all night and into the next day!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I do think this iron is much easier to use on someone else, except for the short cord! The Ceramic barrel scratches pretty easily, it is slippery, with no snagging on the barrel however, hair can (and does) get caught on the top of the iron. Overall, I think this is a good iron, and with all tools you learn how to use them to get the best results. I am very happy with the curls I have been able to create for my clients, and the curls are very long lasting, I would have rated this iron higher, but the short cord is not something I could ignore.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Heats up QUICK!&lt;br /&gt;  Amazing long lasting curls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: SHORT CORD! uugghhhh&lt;br /&gt;  Awkward glove&lt;br /&gt;  Snagging the hair at the top of the iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc: Much easier to use on othersof the iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc: Much easier to use on others</li>
    <li> Omq !! I loue this Curlinq wand, it heats up amazingly at first I couldnt qet the hanq of it now im a Pro!!</li>
    <li> I have been a curling iron girl my whole life.  I decided to be different and try a curling wand and bought this one.  I am amazed at the strength of the curls it creates.  It is quick and easy to use, however you can burn yourself easily so use of the glove is recommended (I&#x27;m nursing a blister on my thumb right now).  The only critical thing I could say about this wand is that it seemed to take a long time to heat up - especially when comparing it to the Remington straightener I purchased along with this.  Otherwise, great product and a wonderful new addition to my primping collection. :)</li>
    <li> Not that much better than a ceramic curling iron, honestly.  I have shoulder length hair.  Maybe it will work better once my hair grows out a bit more.  But, for the moment, I will stick to the traditional ceramic curling irons.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling wand.  I&#x27;m still learning how to use it but the curls come out really nice and the last.  It&#x27;s easy to use but I did not use the glove and got a few burns so wear the protective glove.  Nice product.  Heats very quickly.  I&#x27;ve received alot of compliments on my curls.</li>
    <li> I have hair that really resists curl and with this wand it stays curly all day with no hairspray, although it does relax a but throughout the day. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I returned this because the glove it comes with was soo cheaply made. It was just a cloth glove. The barrel itself was smaller than I imagined and gave me crazy curls. I could have tried harder, but with that glove, it was just a pain to try to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> This wand is great for at home use.  The cord is too short, it would be great if they had a longer cord, other than that, the curls are beautiful.  It&#x27;s on my YouTube channel, where I did a video of me using the wand.  You can check it out for yourself.  My YouTube channel is nadiavassellbeauty.  Good purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed other than the cord.</li>
    <li> Great. It curls nicely. The heat settings heats fast and the adjustments is perfect. $13. The price is a total win</li>
    <li> After less than a year, this product stopped working. I only use it about once a week and now it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> Great wand! It gets hot sooo fast! I would recommend this wand to anyone whom love curls and love to get them quick without making the hair look dry. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous long lasting curls..but took me forever..im really going to have to figure out and get used to how to wrap my long hair around this thing.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, black, and absolutely straight. It has no texture whatsoever and has never been able to hold a curl. I was skeptical about the wand, but I tried it for the first time and I love it. I curled it without using ANY hair product, and it has held these curls all day! It takes a while to learn how to use it, and I&#x27;m still learning; be careful you don&#x27;t burn yourself because I did a few times! Other than those minor issues, it&#x27;s amazing. It really just looks like I came out of a professional salon. I love it and HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a wand for a while &amp; this was the cheapest, which made me over think about buying it, but I did. Best investment ever.</li>
    <li> A friend used one of these to style my hair, and won me over.  I have very straight, fine hair and it has never held a curl for very long without a using enough hair spray to make my hair hard.  However, with a little spray, these curls were beautiful and my hair was still soft. I even slept on them and they lasted the next day! I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I recieved tons of compliments on it the second day.  I will say that it takes some getting used to.  It would be easier to use this on someone elses hair than your own, but I have never spent much time on my hair and am no good at styling.  Saying that, even I looked like I know what I&#x27;m doing with this thing.  It gets really hot, really fast. You might laugh at the glove, but use it! It won&#x27;t protect you completely but it will save your finger tips.</li>
    <li> Wand seems to work fine, but chose this iron over others because it included the glove.  When I first opened it, I noticed the glove looked different than the one shown on the box, then I happened to read the tag on the glove, \\&quot;Not Heat Resistant\\&quot;! Are you kidding? They put in a glove that is not heat proof, protective, resistant, whatever you want to call it, whatsoever! Now I will have to order the glove to use the iron, I know others said you can use it without the glove, but not the way I was shown to use it.</li>
    <li> Bought for Daughter she loves it!</li>
    <li> This Remington curling wand have a very stylish look.  I found the curl size to be adjustable.  I found the tighter I replied the wand around my hair the tighter the curl, and vice versa.  I found this wand to work on different lengths and thicknesses of hair.  The only thing I found was it is super easy to burn your self on. I burned my self 3 times just in one curling session.  It does come within glove, but if I used the glove I couldn&#x27;t hold my hair.  But however the pros out way the cons, so therefore I would recommend the Remington CI95AC/2.  Hope this helped</li>
    <li> Easy to use &amp; heats up fast. Provides a heat protection glove which has saved me from many potential burns. Definitely a product I would reccommand to anyone looking change up there look! Go bold!</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand! Once you get the hang of how to use it, it&#x27;s easy. My hair is SO hard to get to hold a curl, but this wand is like magic...my hair stays curled for over 24 hours...that has never happened before! I highly recommend this curling wand.</li>
    <li> it makes perfect curls....... love it!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the 1\\&quot;-1/2\\&quot; wand on amazon and since it was so inexpensive I was a little iffy about it but other reviews were good so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  I curled my hair with it and the curls are beautiful! They spring right back into shape and haven&#x27;t fallen out.  I&#x27;ve now slept on it for two days and my curls STILL look like the first night I did them!  I&#x27;m honestly amazed... And I got compliments on it all day long!  I&#x27;m never using a curling iron again, and I just placed my order for the larger curling wand too so I can make larger, wavy curls.  Great product.  It does heat up very quick and its very easy to burn yourself on it, yet I find it difficult to use the included glove so I am just extra careful. My cousin has a Paul Mitchell one that&#x27;s triple this price, but we get equal results.  Buy this!!</li>
    <li> Great item for curling your weave on the go and whenever the need arises. I highly recommend it. The product was priced reasonably and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> This curler takes some getting used to, but it works! I have very thick hair, and it curls it in less time than my straightener. One thing to remember, that I found on a tutorial when I was having trouble, is that it helps to point it down when your wrapping the hair. And, you still might have to section your hair if it&#x27;s thick until you get the hang of using it. Definitely a product that I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> Ahhhh ❥ I am so in love with this wand! I have hard to curl hair and this iron only takes about 3-5 seconds to get a very bouncy curl that last ALL day long with no hairspray. I was very impressed and extremely happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Love love love this! No hair pulling and super easy to use. Even has a little finger glove to protect from heat.</li>
    <li> The curls last all day and i even slept in them and they still stayed sliky, shiny and boncy my only issue was that the hair slips a little while curling which gets annoying</li>
    <li> I use this EVERY day. It is easy and I don&#x27;t know what I did before it. The different heats help with styling different hair types and the automatic shut-off is great, in case you forget to unplug. Plus, it takes less than two minutes to warm up which is perfect when you are rushing to finish your hair in the morning. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s So Easy To Use, I Do My Hair All The Time Now&amp;Even Though My Hair Is Very Thick &amp; Course, It Makes It Look Straight, Curly And Beautiful! No More Curling Irons For Me.</li>
    <li> Works ok. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have super long hair like I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this works fantastic if you know how to do your own hair. I know nothing about how to style my own hair and have problems getting it to do what I want.</li>
    <li> I have really straight, thick hair, and for most of my life I have not been able to curl it without a large can of really strong hair spray. With this wand, I have been able to achieve perfect ringlets that hold all day long. (I still use the hair spray, but nowhere near to the extent that I did before. I recommend watching a Youtube video on how to use this product before trying it, as it is definitely a different method and feel than your traditional barrel curling iron. Also, I like that since there is no clip like with the barrel irons, you&#x27;re less likely to have that awkward &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; at the tail end of your hair where the barrel had clasped the hair. There is a heat-resistant glove that comes with the iron, but I&#x27;ll be honest--I think it makes the curling process clumsier, and harder to manipulate the hair. Perhaps that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m not as experienced with this curling method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: controllable temperature, holds curls well, tapered barrel allows for variety of curl, heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;Cons: easy to burn fingers (which is not the fault of this product, I know it&#x27;s user error)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend. It was a great price, and did what many irons in my past have failed to do.</li>
    <li> it gets super hot, it burn the hell of me lol but it was my fault i dropped it. i love my hair.</li>
    <li> I really was impressed with this hair wand. There are just so many kinds out there, but I didn&#x27;t want a cheap one that might break or fry my hair. Thankfully there are lots of videos on the internet with real reviews of where the most affordable hair wands can be purchased. Time after time, Amazon was mentioned. So I took the risk and bought a hair product online and I am glad I did it. I really was taken back on the quality of this hair wand. I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks now, and I love it. I might get the larger one as well. And the hair straightener. I really love the pearl line of products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair with a regular curling iron, and this wand made it so easy. I have really thin hair that never holds a curl, and these curls lasted two days, which is great. It&#x27;s really easy to use and curling my hair only takes around 15 or 20 minutes. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very straight and very fine Asian hair that barely ever holds a curl. This is the first curling iron I have ever purchased that actually curls my whole head in less than 10 minutes- and stays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use a heat protectant and hair spray afterwards and it&#x27;s perfect :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and like the other reviewers- buy it! You will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;(With or without the glove, I had no issues with burning myself)</li>
    <li> No curls at all! so it is now collecting dust in my closet. The glove was the best part ugh</li>
    <li> A little background info about me: I hate doing my own hair and have always been terrible at it.  I only just started using a blow dryer this year because with the right products my hair looks fine drying naturally.  I do know how to straighten my hair, but used to just do it when it was already dry.  I thought curling it after it&#x27;s straightened would be a little fancier.  I have thick hair, but it&#x27;s only just past my shoulders, not that long.  It&#x27;s soft and not coarse, and it is naturally wavy, tends to be on the frizzy side and is not oily.  It usually holds curls ridiculously well (at the salon, that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated for weeks about whether to hop on the clipless curling iron bandwagon or go with the traditional clip kind...  After seeing such great result photos for the clipless wand, for some reason I thought this would be so much easier than the clip kind and would frizz my hair less.  Instead, I get frustrated because I don&#x27;t have enough hands to make sure the hair is even when I go to curl it (I have to grab my hair with the gloved hand which messes up the strand I am about to curl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, to curl my whole head with this thing would take me an hour!  Luckily I got it to just kind of make the top layer/ sections in the front sexier than just having straight hair.  In order for the curls to stay put I have to do such tiny sections of my hair so that the heat penetrates all of it.  It seems to work better if I do the same section 3x, but it&#x27;s annoying to do that...  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the glove does almost nothing.  I would have loved for it to be silicone coated so that I could actually touch it the whole time so that the ends of my hair get curled too.  As it is, I can&#x27;t really touch the ends of my hair to the thing without my hand getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed, but I am still on the fence about whether or not the clip kind would have been better.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair and me not being good at styling... but if you&#x27;re like me and you aren&#x27;t used to curling your hair like a pro, don&#x27;t expect miracles from this curling iron.t styling... but if you&#x27;re like me and you aren&#x27;t used to curling your hair like a pro, don&#x27;t expect miracles from this curling iron.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining about the glove. It&#x27;s perfectly fine unless you&#x27;re purposely holding the hot wand at 400 degrees. Come on now. It&#x27;s better than no glove, and the price is great for what you&#x27;re getting for. Received this about 2 days ago. Curled my hair in about 15mins (I have thick/long hair). The adjustable heat is great and the autoshut off is a must because I am very forgettable. Anyway I went to sleep expecting my curls to have disappeared but they remained bouncy as when I first did them.</li>
    <li> If you want a no-clip curling iron, BUY THIS ONE.  The 1/2 - 1 inch creates smaller, tighter curls, almost ringlets, while the 1 - 1 1/2 inch creates larger curls, or waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pay more for anything else with a fancier name on the side.  Get this one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful with the pink and black!! It hits up really fast and the curls are done very nicely!! Can&#x27;t wait to use it for work!!!!</li>
    <li> love it it doesnt take long at all... love how it doesnt burn the crap out of my ends like the clip ones do cuz u start at the root1</li>
    <li> i bought this product from walmart and i was really surprised that it worked so well. being that my hair texture is very thick and heavy this iron made really nice bouncy curls. I love it......just be careful it will burn the mess out of u tho : )</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far, but I really love it! It made my hair full of volume and long lasting sexy curls which is really hard to achieve on my naturally thin hair. Everyone was complimenting my new do! I am looking forward to using it more often and finding new styles!</li>
    <li> This curling wand I guess is good but my daughter says that it is hard to get used to and it was a bit pricier than I thought it deserved to be.</li>
    <li> With most curling irons my hair looses the curl after a few hours. This iron gets hot enough that the curl holds! I find this iron easier to use than the ones with the hair clamp, my hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled trying to release the iron. Since the iron is larger at the top than the bottom, the curls look more natural. I do like using the glove to protect my hand from the heat.</li>
    <li> This is the wand for you.  My sister and I have crazy-thick hair, and this sucker will put a spiral curl in for two days that brushes out to a lovely soft curl for two more (if you don&#x27;t wash it).  Really fantastic buy.</li>
    <li> This is great. I bought it for my daughter and she lovesit.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is great , easy to use , digital readout, glove for your hand, heats up quickly even my 13 year old daughter can use this by herself I would recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s trying to do really quick curls in there worth the money.</li>
    <li> I read another users review about the barrel being slick and I honestly thought she was an idiot that didn&#x27;t know how to use a taper wand... Either I too am an idiot or this wand barrel is just too slippery.  I would start with my hair at the base of my head and wrap it but all the hair would scoot right down to the bottom make these tiny tight curls.  I am sending this back today and will continue my search for the perfect wand &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> I got this curler for my birthday, and I must say I am very impressed. It takes little to no time to curl my hair and it is GREAT right before school if your crunched for time but you want to look like it took a lot of effort to do your hair. Since I&#x27;ve gotten this, I cannot tell you how many compliments I have received. It goes up to impressive heats for such a modest price!Overall,great product. If you are looking for a great quality but still cheap curling wand, this is definitely for you!</li>
    <li> I oredered the curling wand and received it within two days and worked exactly how i thought it would. The curls are beautiful and the wand is incredibly easy to use. It makes curling my hair faster than using a curling iron with a clamp and im extremely pleased with this purchase....would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> My hair can NEVER hold a curl. I have gone years when I was younger paying hundreds of dollars for a perm only to have flat hair two days later. I have tried countless curling irons, products and sprays. Nothing. I bought this after seeing my neighbors hair after using this and reading the reviews. I have nothing to compare it to however I LOVE this. It was very easy to use. It does heat up to 410. I use a ceramic plate underneath when I put it down as to not burn anything. I did try my first round with the glove. That works very well. You can slightly feel the heat thru the glove but it&#x27;s not burning. I curled all my hair and it lasted all day. I will say my hair was not curly the next day like some of the other reviewers. I have since used it several more times as well as doing my daughters hair and have gotten used to the hand positions, curling and use without the glove. It&#x27;s so worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I bought this thanks to my hairdresser, he has a similar one but his is rediculously expensive. When i got it i tried it out on my friend and it is so awesome the curls are super cute and last soooo long, i just fell in love. I recommend it 1000%</li>
    <li> If I had used it first I probably would not have wasted my money. It works wonderfully but I really do not like the wave look it gives me. I would much rather spend less time styling my hair with a curling iron. The reason I gave it four stars is because it absolutely works like it says. If you do not mind taking the time to style it this will give you the wavy look! I also like it because sometimes a curling iron will leave the ends of my hair looking ridiculous and with this you can control where the hair is or move it easily. This also lasts longer on my hair than any curling iron ever has. My waves last all day long. I bought salon clips to hold up the strands of hair while I was doing each piece and this seems to help with the time consuming portion of it. I think I spend about an hour doing my hair and my hair really is not that think but I like to do small parts. So if this is not an issue for you and you want more of a wave than a curl than you should absolutely buy it and it is worth your money!</li>
    <li> I am not the most talented when it comes to curling my hair. I&#x27;d even say that I&#x27;m a bit unable to do so. I bought this and love it. It&#x27;s easy to use and after following a Pintrest pin on how to curl shot angled bob, I finally got it to look like all the photo&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve wanted my hair to look like! It is a great tool.</li>
    <li> This iron is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe the price either! It took me less than 15 minutes to curl my entire head of hair. It goes from 266-410 degrees and it&#x27;s fast at getting curls! I am a licensed cosmetologist and I was seriously impressed.</li>
    <li> Gets Hot fast and curls my hair so well! Super easy to use and better than a regular curling iron! Definitely worth $20 and even more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely fast and easy to use. Just make sure you use the protective glove and pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing or you&#x27;ll end up with some burns, especially when you start out.  I also noticed that I got better shaped curls with clip-curlers, even metal ones, because the way you have to twist your hair with your hand for clipless. But that could just be my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Curls just the way I like. The heat from this device dont play!!</li>
    <li> Best Internet product bought:) It is very cool and helps you a lot , with every type of hair :)</li>
    <li> I tell you this is the most amazing product that made my life much easier! This pink beauty heats up so fast like in seconds and as I roll my hair onto, I don&#x27;t even feel slightest heat let alone burn my fingers..and first time I tried it, I just rolled chunks of frizzy hair and it came out as smooth as silk coils...Loving it so much..Thank u Remington for a killer product..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good thing that this curling wand is relatively cheap, because I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m entirely happy with the results I got with it. First, there is a bit of a learning curve if you&#x27;ve never tried to curl your hair this way. You need to figure out a good way to hold it, position the wand, and wrap your hair around it in order to get the results you want. Sometimes, it just didn&#x27;t work for me and my hair just unwrapped with no curl, just a strange looking crease. I was able to get a little better at it with practice, but still, it&#x27;s not really intuitive. And then, I burned myself pretty badly once or twice. This my fault of course, because I didn&#x27;t use the glove. But I don&#x27;t feel I get a good drip on my hair using it, so I think I&#x27;m just going to have to get better at it without having to use the glove.&lt;br /&gt;I found that I get the best curls with a smaller strand of hair, but of course it takes forever to curl my whole head this way. When I use strands that are an inch to one and a half inches, it just does not work! I get maybe waves, but not curls. I&#x27;m not returning it because one it&#x27;s a hassle and it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, and the waves are not bad, and it&#x27;s nice to change up your hair once in awhile and add texture to it.&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I had was that after doing my whole head, there was a lot of frizz. I used a heat protecting spray and then a smoothing cream afterwards, but it didn&#x27;t really get rid of the frizz and of course the smoothing cream undid some of the curls.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe the curls have much lasting power, at least they don&#x27;t maintain the same shape throughout the day, but they maintain the waves and the texture. It certainly doesn&#x27;t hold after having slept in the style, at least not for me.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I think that I can produce better results if I practice more and use better products, but it&#x27;s still pretty time consuming for just wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it to give my hair a little lift and it works great. It also works well with long hair and curling hair.</li>
    <li> The packaging of this product was tasteless...horrible... The only reason it never got  5star .However ...the product is great makes wonderful voluminous curls...recommend item for ladies like me who loves perfect curls</li>
    <li> Curls great. Heats fast.</li>
    <li> The curling wand held the curls very well.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and thick, this wand did the trick.  Easy to use and handle.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is 13 and she absolutely loves it! You won&#x27;t be sorry buying this.  It comes with a glove that keeps your fingers from getting burned and it very good quality.  Curls stay in for 2 days and turn to soft gorgeous waves! Buy it now, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really curl like I wanted</li>
    <li> This can get hot- so use the glove it comes with;)i found it works weel but when doing other people&#x27;s hair- on my own it was very hard to get a grip.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cousin as a birthday gift, it works great and it made her hair looked really nice. I will certainly order one for myself</li>
    <li> I really like this curling wand.  Even though everything that I read said that the wand is harder to use than a curling iron; It was much easier to use than a traditional curling iron to me.  Also, most curling wands come with a 3 finger glove that are very large and too hard to use.  The glove that comes with this product fits my whole hand well and does its job of protecting my skin from the heat.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It heats fast and is easy to use (If you have some practice with other hair styling devices and long hair), makes pretty nice &amp; shiny curls in diferent shapes and sizes, and comes with a protective glove. Plus is pretty and its price is reasonable. I liked it a lot!    A Con: The protective glove is not so protective.... and to get the curl well done all the way to the end, you have to hold the hair in place and it gets very hot!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight and gets hot fast. This is my first curling wand so I have Nothing bad to say</li>
    <li> This handy curling wand is SO much better than any curling iron I have ever used. Nice that you can change heat settings, and you do need to get a technique down (so you don&#x27;t burn yourself), but with the glove and a little caution you get THE best curls ever! I have med length (layers) hair and get nice spiral curls that last all day (and the next!) without ever using any hairspray. Wish I had one of these years ago!</li>
    <li> The curls come out just as I want, and the glove that comes with it really helps! Good product, def recommend buying it&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Ladies good hair tool</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair but I don&#x27;t like the way the natural curls look, so I&#x27;ve tried multiple different curling irons and none of them worked before. While my hair will stay straightened, it would never hold a curl made by a curling iron. That is, until I tried this product, It worked SO well on my hair. It gets super hot and heats up really fast, it&#x27;s really easy to use, and it&#x27;s pink! I have nothing bad to say about this at all. It worked great! The curls stayed in all night and into the next day even after sleeping on them! :)</li>
    <li> This works wonders... I have curly hair but once I blow dry straight its hard to get any bounce in my hair and with this it brings volume and it stays for the whole day. Love it.</li>
    <li> I chose a rating of 3 stars because i really loved this product. Although, after having it for about two years it began to stop working. It began to turn off while in the middle of curling my hair and i would end up having to repeatedly turn in back on. This went on for about a month before it finally stopped working completely and would not turn on at all.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very excited with this new wand, she loves it and seems to work well.  would recommend it</li>
    <li> My twin daughters got this wand as a birtday gift for their twelvth birthday......they love it!!!!  easy to use and makes their hair look professional done.....well worth it...</li>
    <li> This product is great- it heats up very quickly and the heat is adjustable which I found gives you a variation of curls (the hotter, the tighter the curls).   One thing that you need to know (that frustrated me about the other reviews) is that it is NOT supposed to have a clip. This is a different product for a different style. Curling irons with clips give you a flat round curl. This product gives more of a natural looking wave to the hair- depending on how hot you set it, the more defined or natural it will look. (rumor has is this is the kind of tool Taylor Swift uses to get her tight wavy look)   I also believe this product is better for longer hair- i&#x27;d say 2-3 inches past shoulder length at least.   Also, the glove really isn&#x27;t so bad. It&#x27;s thin and if you hold the barrel, it will be hot. But for holding your hair around the barrel, it helps a lot since if you bump it you wont get immediately burned.   Just be careful. And yea it is also easy to hit the buttons while using it, but the on/off button needs to be held so it wont shut off- just temp adjusted. It&#x27;s not the end of the world to be conscious of how you&#x27;re holding the product. Especially for the price. I&#x27;ve found that straighteners this price aren&#x27;t usually very good, but this far exceeded my expectations based on my experiences with flat irons.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! My daughter has very fine hair that never holds curl, but with this wand a little hairspray it was like a curl miracle! The curls stayed all day, even with her running around and dancing like a crazy woman....And for under $20!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, I got this for my wife for christmas, she had been saying she wanted a new curling iron and as a guy I&#x27;m fairly clueless.  I got this thinking it might be good, and it seems like a good deal.  After receiving it in the mail she seen it, so I went ahead and let her try it and it was horrible.    As others on here have said the only way to really keep your hair on there is by hand, with the glove.  I tried myself to even help her and hold it on there as she turned and curled it.  The small curls we got after about 20 minutes of fooling with 1 small section of her hair did look nice, but my hand was hurting pretty bad and we realized for us to finish her entire head of hair it would probably take another hour and a half and maybe a trip to the burn ward.      So to sum it up, bought it as a gift, found out how dangerous and bad it is, it is now being returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> Works well, includes glove to prevent burning your fingers</li>
    <li> Make beautiful curls!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I purchased this iron for not only my own selfish wants, but also to use on my clients.  I am a hairstylist and extension specialist.  Alot of my clients like the look of the big loose barrel curls.  You can get them with a regular iron but you always risk clamp marks.  So as a stylist I am always looking for ways to better the service I can provide. I just never broke down and purchased a professional wand because they are so darn expensive. So when I saw this one and the price was decent I said \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot; and bought it!&lt;br /&gt;I must say that it passed my approval day one when I curled my entire head in just a few minutes and the curls lasted ALL DAY and NIGHT (this says alot as my hair NEVER holds a curl)&lt;br /&gt;I love that the temp is adjustable so I dont risk burning fragile hair.  The only con to this iron and my biggest pet peeve with hot tools is the CORD IS TOO SHORT!  Why dont these companies add a couple extra feet to the cords?  If the cord where longer it would have gotten 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This thing gets so hot! Really curls great</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I am a total disaster with a regular curling iron. I found this curling wand easy to use. Yes, it gets really hot (410 degrees!). It worked really well on my stick straight impossible to curl hair. It is a little time consuming to use but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Works like how it should!</li>
    <li> When i was using this curler it worked so good it was kinda hard to grab hair with the glove so i decide to take it off and curl without it. on my first curl it did an amazing job and made it look super bouncy and shiny. i touched the barrel a couple of times but not enough to burn. when i tried it on my 2 inch bangs though it made it look kinky and gross but it stayed even after i tried to straighten it out so i pinned it back. so i dont recommend it on short hair. but when i finished after about 15 minutes on my stomach length hair it looked amazing!</li>
    <li> Turned my hair into a frizz ball&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because it heated up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Returning it and going back to my hot air brush which leaves my  hair like silk.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that you had to physically wrap your hair around the hot iron with a glove. There&#x27;s no handle to capture the hair and twirl around the iron.   My mistake, I should&#x27;ve looked into this more.  WAY TOO MUCH EFFORT AND SKILL REQUIRED.</li>
    <li> First off I just have to say.. OH MY GOSH I LOVE IT!!! This is literally the most perfect curling wand or even curling tool I have ever used/owned! I got it in the mail today maybe 30 minutes ago and I am already hooked! I have long, blondish brown hair that&#x27;s semi thick and I couldn&#x27;t curl my hair for my life! Sounds silly right? But it was true. It would take me at least an hour to curl my hair, I would never 100% like it and it would fall out within 30 minutes. It was so awful that I started curling my hair with a straightener and that was a pain. As soon as I turned it on I set it to 356 degrees because I didn&#x27;t want super small ringlets. I had secondish day hair that was straightened the day before and straightened a little this morning. I was so excited that I didn&#x27;t even put in heat protection! It warmed up in seconds! I wrapped my hair around it and held it for only 5 seconds! I meant to only curl one piece of hair but I loved it so much that I curled my whole head!!! It comes with a glove (I didn&#x27;t use it) and I did end up burning myself later while curling. I will warm you though if you haven&#x27;t burned yourself before it may hurt a little. Just dab a little neosporin on it and you&#x27;re good to go! Don&#x27;t let that keep you from buying this! Don&#x27;t even think about it! Just buy it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter (14) for Christmas. She has thick, straight hair, but she is able to create gorgeous curls that hold with this curling iron. She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love this product it works on my hair snd it is nearly impossible to curl mine or much less have the curls stay but with this it does.....</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it and would not stop curling her hair. She recommends it to everyone. Worth the price I paid for and great sale.</li>
    <li> The first wand we ordered was a Conair, and it was FANTASTIC.  We lost it, so we ordered a new one...this time a Remington.  It wouldn&#x27;t even TURN ON.....so I can&#x27;t tell you how it works.  In the meantime, we ordered another Conair and it works like the first one.  It is a pain for me to go through the whole return rigamarole; that is specifically why I go through Amazon...to keep things simple when shopping.  Rarely do I have a problem like this.  Disappointed with Remington Curl Wand.  Have heard nothing from the company though I complained.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to these curling wands. I have only had experience with various curling irons. I got the 1/2-1&amp;#34; one because it was the lower price. My hair is to my waist, slightly thick and is usually mildly wavy on its own if left alone to dry. I bought this thinking I would use it like a curling iron, but quickly found out after reading the directions that it was not like those at all. This one you use two hands and hold it up in the air. One to hold the wand, one to keep the hair on the wand. The glove is so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers as you wind the hair from the scalp side to the ends. So completely different right there from a curling iron. When I turned it on, there was a number on the screen I clicked the arrows to get it to the kinda low number of 305. That seemed to be a good temperature for my hair. It curled it and didn&#x27;t seem like it was getting too hot. So I started with hair I had blown dry, which goes quite straight. I usually have to wait until the next day for my hair to get wavy/curly on its own when I have blown it dry, but this changed things. After a few strand tests I found my method of using this. Wrap from the top, until almost the very end and then just a second or two before taking it out, I would put the end of the hair around it. This wand made my hair super wavy, not curly ringlets, but like I had regularly super wavy hair. A very natural look. Well, except for the long bang area. As these were my guinea pig strands, they were on the wand a wee bit longer and so I got this shorter wave/curls area that are kinda annoying. Luckily I can tuck them behind my ears. For the other areas, I held it until my hand felt the heat then unrolled the hair out of the wand. This seemed to go well. When it was too little heat for the wave desired, I just redid it. The pink is not a soft pale pink, but slightly peachy. The 1/2 -1&amp;#34; wand seems to be a good size, for my hair length. Maybe a little bigger would be a looser wave, but I like this one. The controls are simple to use. The heat safe glove is included, I didn&#x27;t use it. I did not use any heat protecting product on my hair, but will probably use it with this in the future. In a matter of maybe 10 minutes I had a lot of bounce and body to my hair. It is really nice.trols are simple to use. The heat safe glove is included, I didn&#x27;t use it. I did not use any heat protecting product on my hair, but will probably use it with this in the future. In a matter of maybe 10 minutes I had a lot of bounce and body to my hair. It is really nice.</li>
    <li> Maybe just that I hv very fine hair, but I couldn&#x27;t get satisfactory results. Also, even on low was too hot!</li>
    <li> Who knew this kind of wand was going to make it past the mall kiosks? I am so glad that i did not send 100+ dollars on one and went with remington.Once again, remingtom did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;Using a curling wand as compared to the traditional irons can take some practice, but its well worth the time spent on trial and error&lt;br /&gt;This wand heats up in a matter of seconds, it tops out at 410 degrees and does a magnificent job at creating strong spiral curls. Even better, they last all day! If the curls begin to wilt, you can use your fingers or a thin comb to stroke through them and create a looser yet still bouncy style.&lt;br /&gt;My advice, handle with caution product gets really hot, so for the first time users, please take advantage of the heat resistant glove :)</li>
    <li> This wand is awesome. It usually takes me up to an hour to curl my hair with a curling iron because I have very full hair but not with the wand. It took me no more than 20 minutes to finish and my hair was beautiful! Must buy!!</li>
    <li> This is my go to curling iron, it is my absolute favorite. You can control and lock the temperature and the curls hold really well. I&#x27;ve been using mine for 2 years and evey time I try another iron I always come back to this one. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and she loves it! The price is excellent! the temp settings are great and the curls are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works really great, just be sure to wear the glove :) Curls your hair, and to boot stays curled for days!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, heats up quickly and my curls stays even the next day. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is very easy to use and leaves fabulous results. If you read and follow the directions before using, you will have no problems! Look it up on youtube even before you start and watch some of the tutorials. I love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> My daughter has a knack for doing her hair and mine too!  She loves this curling wand and uses it just about every day.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! I love it!!! It was a great idea... Oh Wao!! My hair looks gorgeous.</li>
    <li> It definitely works and does the job, so I am giving it a 5 star review. I appreciate the heat glove that they provide too. I personally only use it on special occasions because this is awful for your hairs integrity!</li>
    <li> Curls heavy, waist long hair in 15 minutes.  Takes a bit to get the hang of it, After that, there&#x27;s no going back.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my fine hair and it works fast and great! I bought one and it&#x27;s pretty easy to use. Beware, it gets really hot! I set mine at 325 and literally wrap the hair around it then 1 second later I take it off, done. It is awesome.</li>
    <li> the curls come out well..only drawback like everyone had mentioned here and from other online reviews..it is the safety issue when the rod gets very hot.. i have to use the highest setting since my hair is very thick... being a clumsy person.. a bit scared to wrap my hair around the tips.. so far have not burnt myself.. hopefully it stays like that... other than that it gives beautiful curls...</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Target after reading the reviews. My hair is long, past the middle of my back, thick and naturally curly. I wear it straightened and I guess because my hair is so heavy that curls from a salon, rollers, or curling iron never last past 30 minutes even after being heavily sprayed with hair spray.  Until now that is!! WOW! This wand is AMAZING! Takes some getting used to, but in less than 25 minutes the 1st time and my hair was perfect. I did it at night, used some bobby pins to pin them up overnight and they were perfect in the morning(without any hairspray or doing any touch-ups). Curls lasted all day and actually for a few days cuz I pinned them up each night. This is a lifesaver and wallet friendly: no more trips to the salon! Yeah Baby!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love curly hair (my hair is even naturally curly) and I have tried every type of \\&quot;curling\\&quot; tools/products out there. I own a GHD straightner, 1\\&quot; and 1/2\\&quot; standard curling irons, a crimper..  you name it I&#x27;ve probably had it in my bathroom! Although, I have never had a curl last as long as I have with this tool! It definitely takes some getting use to, but once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it, it&#x27;s breeze! Every girl should have one of these is their bathroom! Also, it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter adn have been using it for a while now. She likes it and would recommed it to others.</li>
    <li> The curling wand heats up incredibly fast with a wide range of heats and curls quickly without having to hold the hair on the wand for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> thank you the product worked well curled great tested it on a small strand of hair and left it how i expected</li>
    <li> simply loved it....:)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling iron! Curls my normally straight hair great! and stays curly for a long time. The glove helps a lot to keep me from burning my fingers. Great product and it&#x27;s pretty, too!</li>
    <li> Ok, so this is my first review on AMAZON, but I figured I&#x27;d start with this one! I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I&#x27;m so happy with it already. And for the price, it is SO BEYOND worth it. I&#x27;ve seen similar curlers for $150+ at the beauty shops. This is all you need. IT takes a while to get a hold of it, but so easy once you learn. I had SO many compliments on my hair. I use it for waves, not curls. Not sure how you would use it for curls, but it works WONDERS if you want loose waves.</li>
    <li> I love love love this! It curls super quick and gives salon results...  Everyone always asks me how I curl my hair....  I for sure recommend this to EVERYBODY!  Very affordable and very awesomeeee.  I don&#x27;t really use the glove it came with, I find it easier to just not...    so anyways, buy this its amazing :]</li>
    <li> This is not for beginners unless your will to take the time to learn before getting frustrated with it. It&#x27;s a great wand I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it!! It works just like it should I would buy a different size because I love this one so much!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it,  this does the trick with ease.  I am obsessed</li>
    <li> Works amazingly, fast and beautiful curls that hold!</li>
    <li> Love this wand! Works great, easy to use!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Your curls will come out so nice and also recommend getting the Remington pearl straightener I have both and they both work wonders.</li>
    <li> Love it! I had no idea it would heat up so quickly and curl so quickly, its really fast, it takes but a moment to curl my hair  now.&lt;br /&gt;High build quality feel to it. Smooth , snag free, light so doesn&#x27;t make your arms ache.  A useful  choose your own heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;It is a much higher value product than the less than $20  it is  up for. I am so happy I chose this one.</li>
    <li> This is one of the things I bought my girlfriend for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. The moment she used it before we went out on Christmas day, she came out to show me her curls because she was so happy with it. She gets compliments on her curls all the time and she is now recommending this product to all of her friends. She loves to brag about how wonderful and easy to use it is. As a guy, I don&#x27;t really know much about it. But she&#x27;s been using it all the time for about a month now and now a lot of her friends, and even my mother, plan on getting one. Hopefully it holds up as far as durability and normal wear goes. But it didn&#x27;t cost to much and it made her really happy, so I&#x27;m very happy with it as well.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> This curling wand is amazing. It is great for the price. At first it was hard to use because it was new to me but now I am pretty good at it and teh curls look great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and it curls her hair nicely. I personally like her hair straight but when she does use this to curl it looks amazing. She hasnt burned herself yet (knock on wood) but i can definately see how it would be easy to do. And on another note dont leave it on long because i seen a video on youtube and the girl burnt her hair off. So be careful but works very well on my wife. She has long thick hair if that helps anyone.</li>
    <li> It does get really hot, like other users said, but it is a curling wand....    It does an awesome job, it takes a little bit to get used to how you use it, but once you get the hang of it you can have your hair done in no time!</li>
    <li> I have watched many youtubers talk about this and I have the herstyler wand in 1 inch. and i wantedd something smaller, the curls came out super quick, and they lasted forever i tried brushing them out, pulling them, and they stayed. I love this so much!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it easy to handle and the porcelain tip makes it a good surface and it get HOT.</li>
    <li> Works great, my wife looks hot!</li>
    <li> This wand was really nice, it came in the original packaging so I knew it wasn&#x27;t used. The first time I plugged it up it got really hot and I was just giving it a test, so I curled a few pieces of hair, the curl was so pretty! It gave me the same kind of curls my hair-dresser gave me for prom, I was very impressed! Great product.</li>
    <li> I love my curling wand, it is quick and easy and very efficient. Great investment for a low price, constantly receiving compliments every time I use this product.!</li>
    <li> I Loveeeeeee my curling wand ! Arrived earlier than the delivery date, so was already pleased before I opened the package. Once u get the hang of wrapping your hair around the wand you will become faster at curling your hair, and you might not need the glove. BUT PLEASE DO USE THE GLOVE WHEN YOU INITIALLY START USING THE CURLING WAND ! The wand gets Super HOT real fast ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Works perfectly, so far :-)</li>
    <li> The one-star rating isn&#x27;t for the product itself but for the item description. It was listed as \\&quot;international voltage\\&quot; but when I got the wand it clearly stated it was only 120v..definitely NOT dual voltage! I was really excited to try this product but instead I have to return it..don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re expecting dual voltage!</li>
    <li> I just love this curling styler ..I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and when I use it I get so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mixed and have curly hair well the curl isn&#x27;t the same anymore so I was looking for something to help..&lt;br /&gt;This does the job and then some ..&lt;br /&gt;It lasts all day too..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit time consuming but worth it..&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a heat resistant glove..&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying all those reviews can&#x27;t be wrong..</li>
    <li> This works really well</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! It heats up soo fast and the curls look great, my only problem is i think the barrell is too thin but thats just because i like big curls other than that great buy very happy :)</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this from Amazon and then purchased it from another vendor and I love it! It gives me full curls. Once you get used to not having the duck clip it&#x27;s an awesome. The less amount of hair you put on the wand - the tighter the curl - the more hair you put on the wand the looser the curl. I am now looking for the bigger one!</li>
    <li> I might work for someone with longer hair, but not for me, i tried a few times and it seems that the curls it produces are too big and the volume is just excesive, now the wand is sitting in one of my drawers until my hair is longer so i can give it another shot</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this curling wand. It gives you beautiful curls that stay! You don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray and these curls last all day long. I highly suggest this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This wand works really well for the price … but beware the size of the barrel you order.  My hair is on the finer side and this size is too small - my curls are too tight.  I want modern curls, not Shirley Temple curls!  : )  I like being able to touch the tip of the wand without burning myself because of the heat-resistant tip</li>
    <li> I really wish this curling iron was easier to use.  The glove that came along with it was useless.  Loved the curls when I finished.  The curls definitely stayed x 2days.  Even then if you wanted to go without washing.  Did not use any hairspray!</li>
    <li> Went to the mall kiosk and had my hair curled by the man with the fancy EXPENSIVE wand. It looked great, but I was not willing to pay almost $100. Went online and found this wand by Remington, crossed my fingers, and ordered it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! I tried it on my litttle sister first, and progressed to doing it on my own hair. Awesome curls that last all day (and sometimes into the next day). My only caution would be to use the glove that comes with. I neglected to put it on once, and suffered a pretty decent burn on my wrist. Very satisfied, so happy I didn&#x27;t give in to the pushy sales guy at the mall!!</li>
    <li> Ive had this for about 2 weeks and used it for thanksgiving dinner.  everyone loved my hair.  it doesn&#x27;t give you the same curl as it would with a regular clip curling iron. it takes about 2 minutes for it to heat up to 360 degrees. i was planning on not keeping it in my hair for so long so i can get a looser curl when i wanted, but it didn&#x27;t do it.  it actually keeps the curl size.  not complaining though because that&#x27;s what its suppose to do. now i will buy a bigger barrel for looser waves.  you cant go wrong with this product though. don&#x27;t waste $80-100 on other \\&quot;fancy brand name ones\\&quot; when this does the exact same thing ! instead buy something else with the extra money you saved :)</li>
    <li> I am thouroughly enjoy using my new remington curling wand. It takes a little getting used to because it different that traditional curling irons but the soft, holding curls are worth the practice(:!</li>
    <li> I received my item yesterday and was excited to give it a shot. If you&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before i suggest watching some tutorials on youtube before you purchase it.   I love curly hair, but clip curling irons always come out great in the beginning and an hour later my hair falls flat. I have thick heavy hair and curls just don&#x27;t work well for me unless i use an old fashion sponge curlers set and that just gives me puffy unruly hair. So i was looking for a curling iron with a high heat in the hopes that the curls would stay and they did. I placed the iron on the highest setting and started wrapping my hair. It worked great. The biggest problem was using the glove to keep from getting burned. The glove protects your hand but it makes it difficult to feel your hair as you trying to pick up and section off your curls i ended up taking it off and curling through my hair without it. with that being said i did managed to burn my finger, if you choose to use the product without the glove be extremely careful ! It took a little bit of fussing with (I&#x27;ve never used a clip-less curling iron before) but i managed cascading curls in under 30 mins which on my hair is nothing short of a miracle.   Pros: the iron heats up quickly you can adjust temperatures up to 410 degrees the tapered design makes it easy to do different types of curls and waves it&#x27;s versatile.    Cons: the glove is kind of useless, and you need to be super careful when using the iron or you will burn yourself pretty badly. If you&#x27;ve never used a clip-less iron before it will be difficult to get the hang of wrapping the hair around the barrel especially because the tapered barrel can sometimes cause your hair to slide.   I curled my hair last night and i still have bouncy springy curls the next day.   Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and i see myself using this product again and again.</li>
    <li> excellent. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the best at using it, I will admit that. My friend usually does my hair with it and it always comes out beautiful. I have wavy/curly soft fine hair and it tends to be hard to keep the curls in tact. The wand does a great job at keeping my hair soft with beautiful curls of all ranges. It gets extremely hot and as a beginner I recommend using the glove provided. I&#x27;ve burned my fingers a couple of times trying to be quick and not use the glove.</li>
    <li> this wand is magic. I read a ton of reviews on many different curling wands before i decided on this one, and boy am i glad i did! It is a very chic pink color, and so EASY to use! i have tried curling my hair with heated rollers, sleep-in rollers, curling irons, flat irons, everything...and nothing has ever given me good results. too much curl or unnatural looking or falls to quickly. BUT with this wand, my hair (which is thick and long down to my lower back) less than TEN MINUTES to do!!! and the curls look natural and i have never had to re-do a single curl! and they stay all day and even into the next day. i cannot express to you how amazing this product is. i didnt find the glove to be very helpful, mostly bc i cant feel my hair through it and so i dont use it, and i havent burned myself yet...you just have to be careful when you get the the tip...not that hard. overall this is the best 25 dollars i have ever spent! watch a couple of youtube tutorials to show you how to use it if you feel lost, but please buy this and you will LOVE IT!!!!! I am thrilled with this product!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very long, straight hair. When I curl my hair it requires a lot of product, time, and patience, and it is normally not worth the effort, since it only lasts for a few hours. I tried this wand yesterday for the first time with my hair just washed (which normally makes it harder to curl) and barely no product (just some [[ASIN:B001B7MAU4 W8less Plus Extra Strong Hold Shaping and Control Hair Spray by Rusk for Unisex - 10 Ounce Hair Spray]]). It took less than 15 minutes to do my entire hair and I soon realized that the curl where there to stay! The hair did not relax even after a few hours, and the curls kept their shape after my nap (yay!) and even until today, where I didn&#x27;t even have to retouch them!  Pros:  - Heats extremely fast and shows the real temperature all the time  - Allows for different size of curls  - Keeps the curls all day long  Cons:  - If you are not used to curl your hair it might be a little difficult. The barrel is really slippery and might be hard for some people to get the hair around it.  - It does not come with a protective case, which would be nice for storage  - The glove is worthless, but I didn&#x27;t need it at all.  So even if you have super long, straight hair, you can have yours done in no time with lasting results!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. I think the wand is ok but I thought it was gonna be softer because of the pearl material. But no, is just nice pink plastic, nothing fancy. But I still like it. The heat protective glove is a joke, in the picture on the back of the box you see one thing, but get another one! Low quality material... I will have to buy another one, next curling tool Im buying will be a babyliss or something more expensive and nicer.</li>
    <li> I have straight, long, thick hair, and this works fine.  However, I had to do a search on YouTube to see how to use the curling wand because it does take practice to get the hang of it if you&#x27;re used to the clipper style hair curlers like I am.  This heats up quickly, and I rarely use the glove.  The glove is supposed to protect your hand while you&#x27;re wrapping your hair, but I find that it sometimes just gets in the way.  If you&#x27;re a beginner, definitely use the glove!  This thing supposedly heats to 400 degrees!  I think this is better to for a tousled look instead of a structured look.  Makes great gentle curls like Taylor Swift, but pass on this if you don&#x27;t have the time to practice using it.</li>
    <li> Still using after a year</li>
    <li> I bought this curling wand because my hairdresser charged me extra to curl my hair with it, so I bought my own and I love it. It really gave me that salon look I was going for. And when the curls fall from using this curling iron it looks even better</li>
    <li> My first go around with this wand! Not half bad! It gets super hot fast, just need to learn to hold it! Watch a video &amp; read the directions! It does what it needs to for a great price! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This curler get really hot and heats up quickly which is great, only complaint is that I wish it was thicker and I don&#x27;t see the point in it being tapered at the end. I knew that when I bought it though so really no complaints which the actual quality of the product.</li>
    <li> great product. would totally recommend~~~~ same quality as high end brands!... dont waste money on any other,this is the best... t</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine, silky hair, and for years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a method or toot could keep a curl. With regular curling irons, my hair would turn straight in a matter of minutes after I curled my whole head. Sprays and products never worked either. So finally my friend told me about this, and it is literally a gift from God! M hair now not only curls, but it stays for DAYS and I don&#x27;t use any kind of product or spray to help it. Just some heat protectant and bam, beautiful curls. I really do reccomend this tool to others who are having the same problem I had. Plus I have long hair,  so I made a mistake and chose the smaller barrel on the wand. If you want bigger, looser curls, get the bigger size. The only complaint I have about mine is that because the wand works so well, my curls come out tighter so I have to brush through them.multiple time. But they still stay!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandaughter, she had used a friends and really liked the results, she was not dissapointed</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my hard-to-curl hair. I naturally have really kinky curly hair and I will straighten it and add curls in with an iron. Most irons will curl it well and then the curls will fall out within a few hours. This product has been able to lock in curls for an entire work day for me without any issues! I recommended it to all my friends. My sister and best friend bought it! They have normal straight hair and it will keep their&#x27;s curled for days! I&#x27;m so jealous but that&#x27;s on me, not the product! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have very thin and fairly straight hair. I always wanted a boho type curl look but could never find anything that would help hold a curl. This curling iron is awesome! It took some time getting used to not having a handle and I learned very quickly that the heat settings are super intense. Be careful to not set it too high or you&#x27;ll burn off your hair (seriously!) All in all, with a few trial and errors, I&#x27;ve loved my curling iron the past year!</li>
    <li> None of my curling wands work better than this one. It was simple to use and my hair held on even without hairspray! My hair usually doesn&#x27;t really do well when it comes to curling irons, however, this wand provides my hair with beautiful curls and curls within seconds. I am so happy to have found a curling iron that finally works with my hair and lasts throughout the day without hairspray! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand. I ordered it to do my hair for a wedding and it did an amazing bouncy beautiful curl. It heats up very fast and it doesn&#x27;t take long to curl your hair like other curlers. It was just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, creo que es muy comodo y rapido, absolutamente sencillo, no duden en comprarlo, la mejor temperatura para utilizarlo es a 410 :)</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use this myself, my daughter used it on me and I love the way it curls and holds a curl.  I have thick hair and it worked great!</li>
    <li> First, if you are used to more traditional curling irons, watch out for this one: it heats up super quick, doesn&#x27;t have the clip piece to grab your hair, hold it, and curl it around the wand.  You don&#x27;t want to experiment right before you&#x27;re going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I LOVE the heat protectant glove that it comes with.  You may not need it after you get used to the curling iron, but it is a bonus having it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, due to the barrel size, you can get different sizes of curls and waves.  Smaller at the front of the curling iron and bigger at the end of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this works well on thick hair (mine) and fine hair (friends I&#x27;ve helped to get ready).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, great tool to add to your beauty closet - just be careful - being ceramic, it heats up super quick!</li>
    <li> Very happy with quality and results. I always feel like I have to spend more money to get better quality. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance with this.</li>
    <li> Its very easy to use and makes beautiful curls . In few minutes you have your hair very nice. We love it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best curling iron I have ever used. It makes beautiful curls that last all day, and that look really natural, too. Every time I wear my hair curly, I get so many compliments! At this price, it is so worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I read so much review and decide to give it a try&lt;br /&gt;the pros:  Very Light weight compare to many other wands out there, Heats up super quick, creates very pretty loose curls, beach waves, retro curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cons: only right hand glove so does challenge you to reposition yourself Especially if you want the thicker barrel to curl the bottom of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Harder to work on esp with layered hair the curl will tend to fall ( If you have layered hair I strongly recommend you buy the smaller size , so at least the hair can held tighter together, if you want bigger curl just grab more hair when curling )&lt;br /&gt;FRIZZ !!  ok this is the major reason I don&#x27;t like this wand everything was expected  such as the hard to curl, right handed left handed issues,  However I wasn&#x27;t bother by it but only the Frizz it creates really bother me.  It made my naturally thick hair Dry, Stuff, and so Frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hot tools curling iron normally gives me the smooth shiny finish  therefore I was so used to the pretty smooth look, I was so disappointed that this wand gave me the frizz that made my hair look less bouncy and no shine at all.&lt;br /&gt;I comb it out apply some shine serum and some moisture cream with all that when its finally start to be less frizzy my curls are half fall apart.  Also the ends of my hair felt very dry and the texture were not soft at all.  I held the wand on each 1 inch section of my hair for 5 seconds on the lowest setting ( I do this because my hair naturally can hold curls very well with no spray)  but even so it dried out my hair so much .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will have to continue to search for a non frizzy wand  but I do recommend people who have very fine hair  maybe you won&#x27;t experience the frizz like I did, but you might expect to have a hard time keeping the hair wrap on the barrel without sliding down.  good luck</li>
    <li> Arrived when it said it was going to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;Came in perfect packaging.&lt;br /&gt;5+ stars for quality...definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> i have had mine for about 6 months and ive become a pro at it. yes you can burn yourself easily with it and it does take practice but doesnt everything? i bought mine from walmart...(its the same price just without the shipping cost. also dont use the glove it gets in the way. i also love the wand more than a regular curling iron bc its ALOT faster and i love how the curls come out. they are more of a wavy curl then a prom curl.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair looks when I use this, I receive so many compliments. The price for this was really good, (cheap). *Two thumbs up* thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Perfect. Works great with my long thick hair. Great curls.</li>
    <li> Works great and good price...didn&#x27;t get here like it was suppose to with prime but it works awesome, makes pretty curls</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! I have never used an iron like this one and it is really good ... Gets u the curls u want ..the only thing is I gotta learn to use it other than that it is great! It come with a glove too and I am very happy coz I would have burnt myself every single time. Not expensive and works like a charm - a great combo!</li>
    <li> It did not seem like it would have much affect to my hair, but it works fantastic! Glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> Gets hot almost immediately! Amazing:))) But one down side is that you might burn your hands if you dont use the gloves</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight hair that never stays curled - even when a professional does it and uses what seems like an entire bottle of hairspray. I don&#x27;t know what magic powers this thing has but it works! I can sleep on the curled hair and still wake up with some bounce in my hair. AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I love this product. i needed a new wand so i looked and i decided on this one and man was it a good choice. the curls are beautiful and im all around in love.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is unbelievable. In the past I&#x27;ve tried other curling irons, hot rollers, overnight rollers, the curling with a flat iron technique, and having my hair professionally styled. My hair has always refused to hold curls unless I made it sticky and hard with spray. NOT TODAY! I was just testing the iron out and decided to see what it could do with no spray. The curls held! All day! Soft, bouncy curls! WOW! The digital temperature display and fast heat up time and just bonuses to the cream of the crop feature: when it curls, the curls stay.</li>
    <li> This iron has put ringlets in my hair with little effort. I would give five stars... but the silly glove is not worth it. I could have used any of the ones floating around my house.... but the curls!!!! The curls are beautiful, shiny, (from the coating on the iron), and have lasted me through two sleeps before I couldn&#x27;t use them anymore in some way. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron. It has heat settings to suit all hair types and just curls so well.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool!! Love it --</li>
    <li> This one I gave to my Grand daughter and have had no complaints from her. I consider that a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> this is the best thing ever....it makes tight curls in 10 seconds that last days, yeah i said it DAYS!!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it supposed to. Love it, and a great deal for this product, buy it I.guarantee you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> Watch on youtube on how to use it once you figure it out its great!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Really hot!</li>
    <li> I used this on my daughter&#x27;s long, fine hair and it turned out gorgeous! The curls looked so beachy and natural. I was surprised how well the curls held too. I&#x27;m impressed! I wish my hair was longer so I could use it too!</li>
    <li> I had serious doubts about this product. It usually takes me and hour and a can of hairspray to curl my hair. An hour later my hair is straight. With this product I used no hairspray, curled my hair in 15 mins, and the curls lasted 3 DAYS. I am astounded. This works great and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this curling wand. THE BEST CURLING IRON/WAND I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Heats up really fast &amp; my curls last for days!!!! 5 STARS</li>
    <li> Got it for her X-Mass gift and she has used it religiously since. Has not touched her classic curler, or her straightener since. When I ask her about it, she is all smiles...  Best gift I could have gotten her.</li>
    <li> After curling my hair, it feels so dry and damaged. I&#x27;m not really convinced if this curling iron is actually ceramic.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is for long hair, which one uses with a heat resistant glove, as there is no other way to hold the hair next to the hot iron.  I have short hair so this was not at all what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great preformance and gets hot very quick 👌🏼</li>
    <li> I liked this Curling Wand.It is light and heats up really quick. However, I have a question would it work in countries which have 240V?</li>
    <li> This is an amazing little thing. It creates the most amazing curls! My complaint would be that there is so little friction between the hair and the barrel, that hair tends to slide towards the tapered thin end, which at around a half an inch, is kinda annoying.  No big problem though... you can still get crazy awesome curls! The glove could be better since it only really protects from accidentally touching the barrel, not for using your hand to keep curls down.. well I would still buy this.  Its a little tough to get used to at first but once you figure out how to cur effectively then it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well with my Straightener/curler device, partially because as you curl, you&#x27;re also pulling on the hair. I hate traditional curling irons because I feel like I don&#x27;t have as much control, and they always leave a line. So the curling wand is perfect for me. It&#x27;s very quick. I have long hair and I can curl all of it in under 20 minutes. It&#x27;s also very easy to do any little touchups for spots you missed. And most importantly, my hair holds a curl very well with the high heat this offers. No need for me to load a ton of hairspray on. Just a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove is not meant for touching the wand, at least not for prolonged periods, but it does quicken the process because you&#x27;re a little less &amp;#34;scared&amp;#34; of burning yourself. I feel like any old cheap winter glove would serve the same purpose. A more heat-resistant glove, or at least one that goes further up onto the wrist, would be more protective.</li>
    <li> Except that my gf has burned herself twice all ready everything else is awesome ; first time she turned on and the the 1st curl she made she felt in love ! And I&#x27;m just glad this works for her she will be happy and confident.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I always have flawless curls and super easy to use. I never write reviews but this product was affordable and workwe out. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her new curling wand.  Perfect size and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this wand give me perfect curls and it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
    <li> I just received this item today and haven&#x27;t used it so the rating isn&#x27;t based on the product but rather the faulty product description.  I ordered this curling iron as it was listed as having worldwide voltage but the box didn&#x27;t list it as being dual-voltage as I&#x27;ve seen before.  I opened the box and the instructions only specify 120V so I went to the Remington website which states this item is NOT dual-voltage.  Bummer...it&#x27;s going back...</li>
    <li> I first saw a curling wand of this type on QVC by a different retailer at a much higher price.  I am a product and styling junkie so I wanted to try this at a reasonable cost to see if it was all the hype like the demo on TV.  I love this.  Yes it takes some getting use to..and I am by no means perfect at it yet but it gave my relaxed hair a nice loose wavy look.  I fingered through my curls instead of combing them out and I love this naturally wavy look.  I read some of the other reviews and I agree that the glove does not really work but gets in the way.  I was initially afraid to try this at a really high heat but I&#x27;m going to try it again tonight at the highest to see what a difference it makes in the curls I get.  I had a hard time curling the back of my hair without picking up portions of my hair I was not curling.  Takes some time but no doubt that there is no reason to purchase one at $100 plus when this pink guy is available.  I will continue to practice when I am not in a rush.  Going out for Valentines day this weekend so I intend to use it with great success.  Buy this one if you are on the fence.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!!</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this, i have tried many irons over the years and nothing is as great as this, it heats up so fast ( remember the days of waiting for ages for them to warm up) it gets very hot very quickly so be careful, i cant use the glove it gets in my way but if you can i would, i have already burnt myself once. The curl is so adjustable it sets great and holds up to Florida heat.</li>
    <li> I have always used a straightener/flat iron to curl my hair because it&#x27;s easy and quick. I was skeptical in using this because I was afraid that I would burn myself because it was my first time using a curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic felt a little cheap but it did its job and didn&#x27;t melt or get too hot to handle. The wand gets MUCH hotter than my straightener. It creates much cleaner curls than a straightener. The first time I used this product, I curled my entire head and believe it took less time than using the straightener (which I have been doing for quite some time now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a decent curling wand for a couple of years now, but finding a nice one for a low price has been a major issue for me. This curling wand has been amazing so far. It gives vibrant curls and is very simple to use for anyone. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love my curling iron. It heats up very fast &amp; gets the job done! I have very long, thick hair &amp; I&#x27;m surprised to say that this iron curls my hair &amp; it lasts all day. I highly recommend this iron &amp; it&#x27;s not ridiculously expensive.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely fashion just as pictured.  I have no complaints I saw this wand in Target in NY for $27 and I&#x27;m glad I found it on here.  I use this to help create diverse styles for my relaxed African American hair and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have one of my own and bought one as a Christmas gift! Great wand....difficult to use the glove while trying to curl hair so be careful....that thing gets hot!!! I like it, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, it work great!</li>
    <li> This curler is amazing! I have super thick hair that barely holds a curl for more than half an hour and with the humidity where i live it is almost impossible. But this iron had my hair hold all day outside plus it was still curly after being in a bun for 5 hours! It is amazing!</li>
    <li> love this curling wand. Came as pictured, and it does a amazing job.</li>
    <li> Great product heats in under 30 seconds and happy it came with a glove. I have Amazon prime and got 2 day shipping which came on time love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived 4 days sooner than expected, great quality and works perfectly fine !</li>
    <li> i love this every time i do my hair everyone wants to know what i do it with this is just to amazing it heats up fast not heavy and supper quick to use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a curler which would give me big natural looking bouncy curls but instead this gave me small African looking curls also makes hair frizzy and dry didn&#x27;t like it at all got the conair one instead .</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. I literally use it all the time. The glove, though..they could&#x27;ve kept it. Perhaps I&#x27;m not using it as it&#x27;s purpose but I still burned my hand with the glove on, so never used the glove again. As for the wand, SO VERY SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> I have a huge scar on my hand from burning myself with this extremely hard to hold curling iron that heats up to ridiculous temperatures.  I suppose I should have suspected when the curling iron came with some sort of weird glove to wear for protection, but unless you&#x27;re a professional stylist, it is too much to manage.</li>
    <li> Great product, curled my hair better than any other curler ive tried. I would definately recommend this product. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  My hair is thick and a little below my shoulders.  It does not hold curl very well, and with this the curls last an entire day without hairspray.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was also a skeptic on this product as I have pin straight asian hair that doesn&#x27;t normally hold curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was amazing it heat up so fast and curls held strong! Looked natural and works quick. Perfect for when you want to add a little volume to your hair and don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST FRIGGIN PRODUCT IN THE WORLD! I WANT TO KISS WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THIS PRODUCT! THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST PRICED, SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS, AND EASY TO CLEAN. PLEASE WEAR THE GLOVE OR YOU WILL SUFFER FROM BURNS. I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
    <li> I will recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;I like this product&lt;br /&gt;The wand is in a good shape like promised&lt;br /&gt;:) :)</li>
    <li> Totally pleased with this buy! I have really long hair, a bit past the middle of my back. It&#x27;s not too thick, but I have a LOT of it. (if that makes sense). I have been wanting to get a wave perm in my hair for over a year to get more volume, but my mother has begged me not too because of the harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ve tried just about everthing to achieve that perfect curl, but no such luck in getting any kind of curl to stay in my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;This done the trick. I recieved this less than 2 days after I ordered it. As soon as I saw it on my doorstep, I brought it in and started working. It took a bit of practice and getting used to, but with the protective glove, it was easy and actually pretty fun! I did my whole head and just loved the way it looked and felt. I had a photoshoot the next day, and didn&#x27;t even have to wash my hair and redo it. It stayed in over night and I only had to touch up a couple of pieces of hair. Just make sure you srpray heat protectant on your hair and use the glove!</li>
    <li> I will never use this again.. So terrible.  so hard to use and my hair looks rediculous.  Sorry to the next person that uses it</li>
    <li> This is a horribly designed product and is very difficult to use.  It is not a typical curling iron as there is no lever to hold the hair in place while you twist it to curl.  You have to wrap the hair around the wand and that is very difficult - nearly impossible.  The thermal glove is supposed to help, but it is still very dangerous and one could easily get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed since I gave this to my daughter as a birthday present and it ended up being unusable.  We went out and bought a much less expensive item that works much better.</li>
    <li> Hair curler works well, and gives a different kind of curl than the traditional curler.  However, take into consideration there is nothing to hold your hair to curl it. So they give you one glove to use to protect your hand.  It does get hot through the glove. Also, both my daughter and I continue to burn our other hand despite how careful we are because of the way it is made.  It does make beautiful curls, but you will burn yourself to get them with his product.</li>
    <li> gives me gorgeous spiral curves. was very affordable. Only problem was that it was slightly damaged when received, tip was bent and snags my hair a little but it is still effective.</li>
    <li> For a decent/ inexpensive wand, this Remington Ceramic curling wand works like a $200 curler wand. I was very please with the curler and how fast it heated up. The glove came very handy as well!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous when I bought this because the rating was pretty low. But it seemed like most of the negative reviews were because it didn&#x27;t have a clamp, but that was exactly why I wanted to get it. Here is my thoughts    Cons:   - it is harder to use than your average curling iron. Its a bit like being 12 again and straightening your hair for the first time. But by the time I got to the last layer of my hair I was doing prettyy good.  - \\&quot;heat protecting glove\\&quot; is a bit of a stretch. its pretty much just a piece of polyester blend. but its better than nothing.    Pros:  - you get natural looking curls. More like Taylor Swift than neat ringlets that you would get with a regular barrel curler. that&#x27;s why i bought it. its looks like a might just have beautiful curly beachy hair rather than my usual wavy.  - its not that hard once you get used to it. (but i would say that if you aren&#x27;t very good at curling your hair with a normal curler, this is probably not the product for you. if you are pretty good, then this is a great way to mix it up.    Over all: get it. you might burn your self the first time (I did.) But once you get the hang of it, its like riding a bike.</li>
    <li> I got the package quickly in two days and tryed the iron right away. I plugged it in and was happy to find the heating control is digital so you just press the buttons if you want the heat higher or lower. I set it at 375 and it was too hot so turned it down to about 350, the curls set pretty fast and gets pretty hot, I curled all my hair in about 15 minutes. You definatly should wear the glove that comes with the iron, I burnt my finger a little even with the mit on. Overall it&#x27;s a great curling iron that gives those beautiful retro wave curls that I love.</li>
    <li> I love the NuMe curling wand... but it is $200. I had always thought that the name brands would hold my curls better but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. This wand goes to 400 - 410 and it does the trick. The wand is a lot different than the original curling wand. The wand creates a bigger looser curl like what most movie stars have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A trick is to use the wand upside down in order to get a better curl. *&lt;br /&gt;The glove is super small and barely fits on my hand.  It is nothing but cotton. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me so I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of curling wands with this Remington product being the least expensive. The good news is that it works just as well as the others. I tend not to use the heat resistant glove because I find that it can cause static in my hair - but it&#x27;s not needed at all. The lowest heat setting is 266 degrees, which is higher than some of the others that I&#x27;ve used, but it works so quickly that you barely need to hold your hair on it for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used my sisters wand and I love it, being mixed with really thick hair its hard for the standard curling iron to curl my hair and hold the curls! With this wand I get atleast 2 days of curls with out even using hairspray! This is by far one of the best products I,ve ever purchased!</li>
    <li> Not that hard to learn how to use it, I like the curl and is long lasting. It arrived on time, product as described...no complains. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am a stylist and this little product has saved my life when it comes to curls. The heat level is 410 the average on styling heat tools , and it has worked very well since i bought it. Perfect curls every time and on every single type and texture of hair. The only drawback is that it doesnt come with it&#x27;s own thermal glove. The glove it comes with is cloth and not meant for heat styling so you wioll have to purchase one in a beauty store.</li>
    <li> Returened this item for two reasons. First, I need to travel and this is NOT a dual voltage so it is not theta useful outside US. The second reason, and the most important, it would not hold my hair whatever I do. I am used to having some thing to hold the hair on the curling iron but I wanted to give this a try but I could not with anyway to keep my hair there and it was too much trouble for me. If you know how to hold you hair in the place and do not need dual voltage this might be good for you. It does heat and curls my hair but with extra efforts than my old one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Curls Come out great even without any product in my hair! A must-have!</li>
    <li> My go to for perfect hair day</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand</li>
    <li> So easy to use, and it works great! The price is fantastic compared to other products and it works just as good as the super expensive ones. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling wand. Every time I use it I get compliments on my hair! It is a little tricky to learn how to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, this thing is AMAZING. I love the different heat settings and the lock button is key to avoid accidental shut off. My curls last overnight and look looser but more &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; the next day.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Although the glove is more like a winter glove made of cloth, does not heat protect at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.curling wand.  It&#x27;s easier to use than my curling iron and produces longer lasting curls.  Love the tapered barrel for different curls and the temp controls are great for different types of hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I find it especially difficult to use on my hair. I have thick, medium length hair and after about 15sec it barely curls. I&#x27;ve even watched tutorial videos just to be sure I was using properly. Guess it&#x27;s my hair type...</li>
    <li> This curling iron has many excellent features.  My two favorite are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;2. Makes curls that last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To expand- I am not a morning person, by any stretch of the imagination.  There&#x27;s pretty much no chance I&#x27;m going to get up 10 minutes earlier to wait for a curling iron to heat up.  This one heats up almost instantaneously, which is fantastic.  There&#x27;s literally no waiting.  My hair also has a hard time taking curls, but the high heat of this curling iron does seem to produce curls that last.  I don&#x27;t use a curling iron every day, but this is perfect for when I want to add a bit of curl.  I have the straightening iron from the same line, and it works just as well.  I would definitely buy other hair appliances in this line.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and my sister-in-law really liked it! I was pleased with the product! :) :)</li>
    <li> I really liked it, you do need to get used to it but the second time i used it i didn&#x27;t need the glove and i went to bed with the curls and stayed perfect for the next day.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly and created beautiful curls! My 14 year old daughter couldn&#x27;t have been happier. Would definitely recommend it !</li>
    <li> I bought the 1/2-1 inch wand. This is a wand from Heaven! Heats up Instantly, does not burn hair..digital screen is amaze-balls and it goes as high as 415 (cnt remember). I&#x27;m african/american so for those who wear extensions or even your natural hair it does wonders and gives your hair beautiful waves. Item is as decribed in the promo video. I love and has always worn my hair straight but after using this wand I am hooked!! LOL It gives the hair a natural shine and it comes with a protective glove. The curls are extremely bouncy and can last up to 3 days once you twist it up at night or you the bendy roolers. I 100% recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she LOVES it.  Does a great job on her (very thick) hair and the glove that comes with it is a great bonus.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the ease of using this, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is really easy to use and the curls last all day without even using hairspray! I am glad this came with a heat protective glove, too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was a great gift, and from what I here has worked very well. The price was not bad, and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use...I got used to the wand after trying and playing with it for a few minutes. It gives my hair wonderful curls that last DAYS after I curl my hair! I do recommend using an anti-heating spray of some kind before you curl your hair. On top of that, I always use a hair mask afterwards since high heat would take out all the moisture out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have very straight Asian hair, but curls great with this curling wand.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing to ever happen to me. I have medium length, fine, thin hair. It only holds a curl for about 10 minutes and forget about brushing it or shaking the curls to separate them---if I did that they would be gone in a second!  The first time I used the wand I used a heat protectant spray before curling, then curled, separated, AND brushed and the curls stayed ALL DAY WITH NO ADDITIONAL PRODUCT!?!?!?! I was amazed. It gave me what looked like naturally curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time (after watching some youtube vids), I managed to give myself Kardashianesque waves. Compliments ensued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike others, my curls do not look better the next day. They are pretty much non-existant, but it only takes me about 15 minutes to do my entire head so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I really like my new curling wand. Handling is totally easy and it produces really nice curls. And this for a great price!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was having a really difficult time using my curling iron to put curls in my hair.  This product exceeded my expectations by far!! It is very easy and simple to use.  The curls stay in my hair all day.  I also use this on my daughters hair as they are cheerleaders and their hair must be curled.  I have and will continue to recommend this to all of my friends!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any kind of curling iron but I have got my hair permed a couple of times before and I absolutely hated it.&lt;br /&gt;So, I don&#x27;t know what made me want to try to get a curling device but I searched and searched and read reviews and finally I came to this product.&lt;br /&gt;First when it got here, I was so disappointed because it only works with 120V and it is not a universal voltage one.&lt;br /&gt;Well I live in Australia so that was really a bad news. I didn&#x27;t want to pay postage for return and fortunately I had a converter, I decided to keep it and try.&lt;br /&gt;I was scare to use it at fast after I read all the \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; stories so I was pretty careful to be honest but I didn&#x27;t get burnt at all!&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use and delivers a great bouncy curly hair every single time I use.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to hold the hot barrel with your hand but just to pinch the tip of your hair so you wouldn&#x27;t burn your hand at all.&lt;br /&gt;With your elbow up making the fat side up, your hair wouldn&#x27;t slip down the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;I only set it on the lowest temp but it still works so good and I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that this wand is not universal voltage product. Most of these products now are able to be used anywhere in the world so it was so disappointing especially when I live in Australia(240V) and often go to Japan(100V).&lt;br /&gt;I am lucky enough to have a converter at home but this only converter I&#x27;ve got is sitting in our kitchen so I have to curl my hair in the kitchen with a small standing mirror..</li>
    <li> Love the digital temperature. Cute pink. Curls pretty well</li>
    <li> Great product,ideal Christmas Gift!.My wife loved it.Prompt service and delivery!.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I love it in every way!</li>
    <li> This is really the most amazing hair tool I have ever purchased. My curls are normally flat by midday since I have pretty fine hair. I tried this thing and they lasted for about three days and would probably have lasted longer if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair. The second day the curls were a little looser, and the third day they were waves, but still shiny and bouncy. That&#x27;s another thing - the shine you get is amazing. It also heats to 410 degrees and works super quick. I have long hair (to about the bottom of my shoulder blades) and it took me about 15 minutes to do my whole head. I tried this item on my step daughter, who has pin-straight hair, and it also lasted for days. Her hair is really thick and straight so it took a little longer with her - about 30 minutes. Even pin curls don&#x27;t work on her, so I was definitely impressed. Would buy more, and probably will for gifts.</li>
    <li> This curls so fast!! It usually takes me an hour but this makes it take 30 minutes... the only set back is if you want loose curls i would not recommend this. But if you want ringlets, and Shirley Temple curls then BUY!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to use it! Maybe I use it in the wrong way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that it comes with the glove, seeing as it heats up to over 400 degrees. I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I expected to. I&#x27;m sure if you practice with it, your hair will look amazing.</li>
    <li> The best ever. It works awesome to me.</li>
    <li> Its very time consuming but the curls look great.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this curler so much. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend on a $200 curler that would&#x27;ve worked exactly the same.</li>
    <li> remington always makes me happy. this made my wife especailly happy. she don&#x27;t need to go to salons to get her hair fixed anymore.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a really nice iron and was recommended to me but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work well. Only my ends would curl and not the whole piece.</li>
    <li> Its really nice , comes with a glove.</li>
    <li> This curler was so great I bought two of them. My daughter loves it and it makes the nicest curls. gets VERY hot and works very well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this wand for over 3 years now. Still turns on and heats up like a champ. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while!!</li>
    <li> One of my greatest investments</li>
    <li> So I have this long, thick, wavy, unruly hair and straightening it just takes too long and is too unhealthy in the long run. The first time I tried it I set the heat too high and my hair curled up too much (gave me a bit of a pin-up look, which is a bit too much for the everyday look - for me), but now I&#x27;ve gotten better a what temperature and how much of my hair to curl. If you only curl half the length of your hair and you don&#x27;t hold the hair on the wand for too long, you&#x27;ll get that beachy, wavy, awesome tousled look. I&#x27;M ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Love this! And the curls last longer than a metal iron. Even in the southern humidity.Tight curls.</li>
    <li> Love how easy it is to use, the spirals are so cute, bouncy, and soft. I definitely love it and am so glad I tried it. Its a great price! Plus I don&#x27;t need hair spray either to keep it in place it does so naturally, would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I FINALLY get the curl I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many Remington products before, flat irons, hair dryer, shaver...whatever! So when I saw this wand among the rest I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it! Boy am I glad that I did! This is so awesome I can&#x27;t express it! This gives you beautiful luxurious tight curls when used from top to bottom, extremely small and tight when you just wrap the hair around the narrow end, and bigger voluminous but still tight curls when using only the wider end. And best of all, it actually lasts for days!!! I def recommend this!! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. Only thing u don&#x27;t have to leave in your long it really curls quick.  It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This has FOR REAL changed my hair. I have 3A/3B curls and some of the tendrils are super curly at the top, and straight at the bottom. I was worried I would have to cut the ends off, but only some of them look bad. I decided to buy this wand as a last ditch effort. Now I just pick the pieces that aren&#x27;t curling like I want them to, wrap them for just a second around the wand, and they blend right in. It&#x27;s really great. A month ago I was hating my hair, and now I&#x27;m loving it again.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is hot hot hot! The sleek no-clip design makes curling that much easier! It takes a couple of tries to get used to if you&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before. The variety of temperatures makes even hard-to-curl, thick hair easy to curl. There&#x27;s even a heat protecting glove to avoid those nasty curling iron burns that turn into throbbing blisters. No. Fun. So avoid all that chaos by getting this curling wand!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. My hair is somewhat long and straight and has trouble holding a curl for very long. This curler not only gave me wonderful curls but they lasted for two days. Be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the price and it&#x27;s on discount right now. It heats really fast and makes beautiful curls. I just have super long hair so it don&#x27;t curl all the way. It&#x27;s best for medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Its a good product, gets warm up very fast, versitile in shaping curles, easy to use! Just be careful with keeping your hair on curler for too long, it get very hot and you may damage your hair easily. Use heat protection spray for your hair before curling!</li>
    <li> This product saves a girl on the go like me time, easy to use with the glove cus it gets pretty hot and I bought two for my girlfriends. And the pink color adds a feminine touch to it..my best hair styling tool. Love It, a MUST HAVE Ladies!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand so much. Every time i use it , I get tons of compliments on my hair. The best part is - I get salon results without spending more than 10 minutes on my waist length, thick hair. A +++</li>
    <li> I wrap my hair around this and it slides straight down. you basically have to have frizzed out hair for this to work, and my hair is too long to wrap enough around this tiny barrel. literally worthless to me, you can have mine.</li>
    <li> this Christmas gift was a hit with my granddaughter.  she said it is much easier to use then the iron hair curler.</li>
    <li> Bought this not knowing what to expect.  Took a little bit of trial and error to figure out how to use it --but once I figured it out, I love the end result.  I have fine wavy (frizzy) hair that I usually straighten. Curl never seems to hold, but with this curling iron the curls lasted all day, weren&#x27;t frizzy and even looked good still by the next morning.  Definately impressed by the hold and smoothness of the curl!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE CURLING IRONS BUT I HAVE PEEK A BOO COLORIN IN MY HAIR AN IT REALLY HURTS THE BLOND SO I HAVE BEEN WANTIN TO GET AN I DID.....ITS AWESOME EAZY AN I LOVE IT I USE IT EVERY DAY SO FAR! I DO US IT UP SIDE DOWN WERE MY HAND IS OVER MY I THINK IT LOOKS BETER MY CURLYS COME OUT BETTER I HAVE MOVIE STAR HAIR LOL BUT I WOULD SAY BUY IT IT REALLY CHEAP THE CHEAPEST ONES I HAVE FOUND I HOPE THIS   HELP:D    PS BE CAREFUL IT HURTS IF U BURN URSELF US THE GLOVE!</li>
    <li> I completly am in LOVE with this curling iron! It works reallly good! i use it frequently it gives your beautiful spirals and lots of body! I highly recomend anyone searching for perfect curls THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU! I am in love with this!</li>
    <li> this is so amazing. it makes my curls stay in for a long time, something I&#x27;ve tried with every curling iron and it doesn&#x27;t usually work but with this it did. it came exactly when expected, no surprises its just like the picture! id recommend this product to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> i bought this iron about a week ago and when it came i was so excited!! i ripped it out of the box and tried it out. at first i was panicked because it wouldnt turn on (some of the other reviews said this) so i held the power button down for like 3 seconds and it turned on immediately and began heating up. i LOVE IT. it&#x27;s so nice! i have supperr curly hair thats wavy too and it sometimes gets frizzy, so this is like my secret weapon now if i wanna keep it natural. the only bad thing about this is that when i&#x27;m trying to wrap my hair around the iron itself it will slide up and the grip isnt very good. but if you do it right the curl will turn out amazing!! this is my first curling iron that i&#x27;ve ever owned that i am really good at using. if you are considering buying this please do it!! you will not regret it.  love love love. &lt;3 &lt;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the curling iron today, it wasn&#x27;t damage thankfully&lt;br /&gt;But i haven&#x27;t used it yet, i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s 100-240v or not&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s written 120v 60hz&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping it&#x27;s 100-240v , our house is just a 200voltage , i need someone to tell me if i can use it or give it away??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating at all, the product is very good and the results you will love it, I do my hair and lasts up to two weeks, its amazing.</li>
    <li> The curler works great! It even comes with a safety glove for protection. It makes different sized curls to give your hair a natural, flow-y look. And for any Taylor Swift fans out there, this is the curler she uses!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! It is a good product and easy to use. I like the way it leaves your hair looking better than a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I could never be bothered to curl my hair using a regular curling iron. No matter what I tried I just couldn&#x27;t figure out the appropriate way to hold it or clamp my hair and always got frustrated and ended up forgetting about it. So when I found this curling wand I took a chance in purchasing it and was pleasantly surprised. It is incredibly easy to curl your hair using this wand and the results are great. Depending on how tightly you wind your hair around it will tell you what kind of curls you are going to get. The thing I also really love is that it is nearly effortless to do you hair and yet it comes out looking great. This is the first product I have been able to use right out of the box to get great curls quickly and easily. I love my curling wand!</li>
    <li> Easy to use to get lovely spiral curls. Like that it comes with a glove- please use it as this baby gets HOT!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! I also liked the curls I got, but found it to be almost too much work for me. I have carpel tunnel and having to use both hands made my arms go numb. The &amp;#34;heat resistant&amp;#34; glove that comes with the wand doesn&#x27;t resist heat at all, it is just a regular knit glove. I burned my hands and fingers several times when I used it. I&#x27;m not sure if I would recommend this product or not, as it does work, but isn&#x27;t very convenient. I think if I order another one it will be one with the small clamp to hold the hair.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I had to for this one. This wand is the best purchase I ever made! I have a toddler and I don&#x27;t have the time to do my hair. I have very fine hair. I have the curling iron and it usually takes me about an hour and it never holds the curls. This wand only took me 15 minutes and it actually stayed curly! So I threw away my curling iron.</li>
    <li> I only have experience with two wands and this one is amazing !&lt;br /&gt;it gets really hot and my hair always comes out amazing with it!</li>
    <li> So everyone is on the curling wand trend so I thought i&#x27;d give it a try. Its really cool didn&#x27;t come in original packaging which made me a little nervous but i plugged it in and ti works fine. The curls are really nice once u get the hang of how to use it but your in for alot of burns (nothing too severe). The wand gets REALLY hot and the glove does help a little so dont get too carried away with touching it. But practice makes perfect...</li>
    <li> This is my first wand and I LOVVEEEEEEEEEEEE IT!!!!!!! It gives me PERFECT CURLS, that are sooooo bouncy and cute..... Worked just as expected, heats up fast and easy to use.....</li>
    <li> I love my this curler. It works just fine, heats up pretty quickly and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and it is a little short but it works perfectly for a quick do!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, wavy hair that simply refuses to stay straight or hold a curl with seemingly every heating tool I&#x27;ve tried. What makes styling my hair all the more difficult is the fact that&#x27;s the strands are thin and delicate, so I don&#x27;t want to turn the heat up too high for fear that it will fry my hair right off my head; but if it&#x27;s not hot enough, my strands will be curled, but only for about 15 minutes (tops). No matter how much I sprayed the heck out of my hair or used supposed &amp;#34;tried and true&amp;#34; products with my styling tools, NOTHING seemed to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got an Amazon gift card for my birthday and decided to give this iron a try. All I can say is somehow this one just works. My hair will hold curls, beach waves, or subtle twirls all day long. I don&#x27;t know what makes this different from everything else I&#x27;ve tried, but I love this iron. This is significantly cheaper than most other irons, but surpassed all my expectations. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This Hair Curler was very fast, it heated up in less than 2 minutes and took each curl about 20-30 seconds. Super Fast. Just Be careful because it is very hot! I almost burned myself!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of crappy $20 hair tools - from straighteners, hot rollers, to curling irons. I&#x27;ve had my hair curled by expensive ceramic versions of this product, so I figured I would give this cheapo a shot. I was ASTOUNDED by how well it worked. It gets very hot, sure, and you can burn yourself if you&#x27;re not careful, but I feel like the learning curve to get amazing curls was about ZERO. In 15 minutes my hair looked like Little Orphan Annie, and a quick brush through, which usually destroys the curls and gives me a puffball, left the curls looking like natural curls. The next day, I look like my hair is naturally wavy. Really, what a great great deal on a super effective product. The best bang for your buck in the market of hair electronics.</li>
    <li> good service. i did not expected to be early than i thought. i really like this curler. it last longer than i thought. it can take about a week or more.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It gets the job done! It works for short long real and fake hair! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this. It&#x27;ll be you best friend!</li>
    <li> very easy to use.  beautiful curls</li>
    <li> This has a high rating so I bought it, not realizing I have short hair. I&#x27;m sure it works great for long hair.</li>
    <li> I try not to use this everyday but i absolutely love this curling wand thank you very much very happy with purchase !!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews. That&#x27;s how good this is...I have medium length fine hair. With a curling iron, I usually need to put a lot of product in my hair in order for curls to stay and tease my roots for volume. I just got this curling wand and tried it for the first time today...lightly misted my hair with a small amount of  hairspray and brushed that out, then curled. You only need to hold the curl for about 5 or 6 seconds and it holds...for the entire day. Lots of volume and bounce and you can run your fingers through it without losing the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, but since I&#x27;d never used one before, I wanted to make sure I liked it before investing in a more expensive one. No need. I can&#x27;t see a more expensive one doing any better than this. I have absolutely no cons for this product. 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works like a regular wand</li>
    <li> It does curl....I like it. Make sure u wear ur gloves tho while u&#x27;re doing it!!</li>
    <li> awesome wand very fast and easy to use.</li>
    <li> could have been better</li>
    <li> Works great! Perfect baby curls!</li>
    <li> Bad description on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;120v and electricity here 220v</li>
    <li> I could never get a curl to hold and I&#x27;ve bought diffrent brands from conair or hot tools but no luck. This curling wand holds the curl until the next day but I wish I would of bought the thicker wand because the curls are too tight for my liking.  I&#x27;m still learning how to use it right but I love it so far :) Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> Really good hair curler, curls hair even after you gave straightened it. Definitely worth a purchase</li>
    <li> I love it! I love the way it curls and its super easy. I dont use the glove, it makes it difficult to hold the hair. But other wise I love it.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the very best curling wand that I have ever used. I loved it so much, that I ordered another one in a different size. It is extremely powerful, you DON&#x27;T need to hold it on your hair for more than two seconds to achieve results. Because it is so powerful, there is a risk for damage to your hair; you need to prime your hair with a heat protector spray AND a small amount of oil/moisturizing serum all over your ends. The reason that heat tools damage our hair is because they dry them out, you prevent that by making sure that your hair is moisturized. With long hair, the oil from our scalp doesn&#x27;t reach our ends, which is why we long haired girls have to manually apply it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  It also gets hot quickly</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, easy to use, cute bouncy curls, and curls even stick straight hair.</li>
    <li> Best curling wand ever. 2nd try and i managed with salon quality style within minutes. the curls held until i washed it out. Best buy ever!</li>
    <li> Loooovveee this! This is my first curling wand I ever bought and I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Whenever I curl my hair the curls never last and start to fall. After using this wand I had beautiful bouncy curls that lasted all day long! Seriously this is amazing and for a great price.</li>
    <li> i love this it makes gorgi curls I really love I&lt;br /&gt;best wand ever&lt;br /&gt;it is fast heat and makes it really easy&lt;br /&gt;but if u burn ur self it really hurts</li>
    <li> I loved this iron,&lt;br /&gt;got super hot very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use a glove if you don&#x27;t know how to use a curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;Also do not drop it, ha.&lt;br /&gt;I dropped mine once and the tip fell off,&lt;br /&gt;hadn&#x27;t stayed on since.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! It is a little bit frustrating because I&#x27;m not an expert yet but I really like it because it gets hot, but not too hot.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying that this is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very long and naturally straight hair which does not hold curl for more than an hour or two with other curling irons.  I bought this curling iron at Wal-mart about 3 or so years ago on a whim because I&#x27;d always wanted to try a wand-type curling iron.  It took a little bit of getting used to and I pretty much threw out the glove from the get-go (I feel like it just gets in the way and creates too much static electricity in my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with this curling iron because the curls it creates are just beautiful. I usually curl sections that are about 2 inches wide on the &amp;#34;pre-set&amp;#34; heat setting (I think it&#x27;s about 360 degrees when you turn it on and that&#x27;s the temperature I use although there is quite a range for temperatures) for about 7-10 seconds.  If I curl my hair in the morning, my curls last all day and through the next day.  By day 2, the curls soften up and this is when they are my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I shared this curling iron up until Christmas of 2013 when I bought her one here right off Amazon.  Now we each have our own and won&#x27;t have to fight over just the one curling wand anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have naturally straight hair that just does not hold curl with other curling irons and are thinking about trying this one, go for it.  I absolutely love this curling iron. It creates beautiful curls and with all my hair (which is down to my lower back) it only takes me about 20 minutes to curl my hair with this curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and I was very shocked at the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a wand curler</li>
    <li> Same as what I bought at Target! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this wand. It curls my hair quick and I have thick hair too. It looks so amazing when I&#x27;m finished. I would recommend this wand to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Quick results when curling!  Works great, heats up very fast, and am thankful for the protective glove to wear during use.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Flawless curls in such a small amount of time! LOVE IT! I recommend with no hesitation! Get this wand!</li>
    <li> I love using this to curl my hair. I had to get some help if I want to curl my entire hair but can do it alone if I&#x27;d just put waves in the ends of my hair. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This curling wand can really get the job done! First time curling wand users may have to practice a few times to achieve their desired curly styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- IT GETS VERY HOT! USE WITH CAUTION.</li>
    <li> I have only used the curling wand once but I can say when I used it I loved it! The wand heats up very fast, and also automatically turns off after an hour of use as advertised. I cannot say how long my curls lasted because as soon as I finished curling my hair ( took 3 hours) I had to go out in the rain and my curls were destroyed instantly. I will try it again when I have some free time.</li>
    <li> So I was so excited to finally get this and I must say it did produce some very nice curls. However, I do want to warn anyone who has a lot of thick hair like I do. No exaggeration, I have a lot of hair, and its very thick. It took about an hour to get my hair done so if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time, you may want to think twice about this product. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t take as long for touch ups, but if you go back to completely straight again, it will take a while to do it all over. Also this product gets very very hot. Its much easier to use this without the glove, but I don&#x27;t recommend using it without the glove. I burned my hand a few times, but I also burned my ears twice as well so everyone needs to be careful. If you have a lot of hair, i&#x27;d recommend putting it into sections to make it easier. I also don&#x27;t know how long the curls will last. I have never been able to keep curly hair as it always goes right back to being straight. I just used this today for the first time, so we will see if they last overnight. Overall, good product. I like the curls it produced.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and uses it often.</li>
    <li> Love this wand - so easy to use and gets hot so quickly. Glad they included the glove, as well!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the price and the number one best seller rating. As soon as I plugged it in I was impressed. It has a temperature reading on it and it heats up within a few seconds. I have used several curling irons and straighteners. This one is by far the best! After reading several of the one star reviews I laughed because I picked it up and curled all my hair withing minutes. I had it on a lower setting and my hair does not smell burnt at all. I have extremely long coarse hair, and I was so surprised to see ringlets instantly. I noticed that the barrel was slippery and a bit tricky to maneuver however it was not as hard as others said. The curls are fluffy, but with a little styling product should be beautiful. I am considering the next size up for a bigger curl. Don&#x27;t go by the one star rating this product is not that difficult to use. If you have spent time curling your hair you shouldn&#x27;t need much practice or the glove, just be careful. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> this made my curls last forever even after a dance class, and didn&#x27;t leave that  gross burnt hair smell. i love it</li>
    <li> This is an awesome curler. I bought the smaller size originally and it makes curls a bit to tight for my liking, but it works awesome to loosely curl the ends of my hair. I&#x27;m saving up for the larger one. These work quick, last long, and they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair look but I have problems with it actually working correctly. And what I mean by that is sometimes I have to change locations were I’m curly by hair (like to another bathroom) and when I unplug the want then plug it back in it doesn’t like to turn back on. I have to wait until it cools down then plug it back in and then it will start working again. The other day I had the wand plugged in for over an hour (I have a lot of hair and I’m slow at curling) and it just shut off. Maybe it’s a safety feature but it was annoying none the less because I had to wait for it to cool down before I could continue using the wand. Besides that issue this works perfect and I get some many compliments when I curl my hair with his. There is a learning curve but don’t give up, the curling gets early.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It takes about 10-20mins to curl my hair. I have thick african american hair and it curls beautifully. I love this and will recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I am mixed race and have curly hair that gets really frizzy and kinky. I straighten my hair and then use this product and it comes out amazing, and the curl holds for 2-3 days. I also created gorgeous curls on my sisters straight, fine hair. I would recommend this product for any hair type. I purchased at Target for $25.</li>
    <li> I got this for college frosh daughter...she loves it.  Was her first Christmas gift to open and use.  Makes a variety of curls, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have long fine hair (but a lot of it) and my hair has never held a curl easily.  I have never been able to curl my own hair, I have always had to go to salons and have them use tons of hairspray.  I did my whole head with this product with very little hairspray and it looked great!</li>
    <li> I recieved my curling wand today and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. It heats up HOT and Fast. the barrell is smooth as silk and the curls are beautiful, they last long, and take 6 seconds each to do. I never was able to do my hair so fast before !!!! GREAT BUY. i def reccommend!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product does deliver when it comes to bouncy curls, BUT it&#x27;s much easier if someone does it for you. It&#x27;s easy for me to do the right side but the left is more tricky. If you do it right you don&#x27;t even need the glove..</li>
    <li> Works better than other curling irons I have used before, with the lifting piece. I like how you can adjust the heat.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before, there is a learning curve...as the burn on my ear can attest. However, this product is everything it should be. The swivel cord makes moving to different sections easy, the adjustable temp is awesome for getting even my stubborn hair to take the curl, the glove protects my hand from the heat despite me being very temperature sensitive. The curls come out beautiful and look real, and best of all, unlike old fashioned curling irons, it doesn&#x27;t leave that hideous &#x27;dent&#x27; in my hair.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews on products, but I felt this product deserved a review.  IT IS AMAZING.  My daughter has long thick hair, and I didn&#x27;t know if it would work.  It was on sale on Amazon for $14 when I bought it so I figured I would give it a shot, and it works awesome.  I have added a picture to show how good the curls look.  Also just to save my husband embarrassment, this is obviously not Jeremy reviewing this, it is his wife!</li>
    <li> Best curling wand in the world. Gets the job done in no time.</li>
    <li> It heats up really fast and works well but it&#x27;s  a little too narrow the larger one would work better</li>
    <li> The glove is super awkward and I really don&#x27;t know how to work this thing (I&#x27;m terrible at doing hair)-- but I&#x27;ve had friends do my hair with it and it turns out great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than other expensive brands I have bought. If needed I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This iron is amazing. Short version: the curls this thing can produce are unreal and well worth 100$.&lt;br /&gt;Long version: My hair was curly when i was younger, but i all but ruined it by coloring, straightening, processing, etc. for 5+ years. As i got older i realized i really wish i had my curls back, so i began the hunt for a new iron. I saw amazing reviews, the description was satisfying, so i bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i&#x27;m so glad i did. You don&#x27;t even need to use the glove; if you&#x27;ve never used a wand before don&#x27;t sweat it. I got the hang of it very quickly. And now i can&#x27;t stop using it. So many different types of curls!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing heats up quickly and creates smooth&amp; glossy curls. I have relatively thick, shoulder length hair &amp; it takes me about 30 mins to curl all my hair (less if i do bigger curls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even decided to test out curling my hair without using hair spray to keep it in place. I thought my hair would fall limp as it usually does, but the curls held the whole day! I was impressed to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong here. I highly recommend this iron to anyone, regardless of hair type!</li>
    <li> It works well. I just got it today and it curled my hair pretty❤</li>
    <li> So when I first opened this I was highly upset, because the color of the barrel gives away the fact that it&#x27;s not a real Remington wand. After reading all the horrible reviews I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing... For now :) !!</li>
    <li> Prior to this wand, I possessed a Conair 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel curling iron (w/ clip/clamp) to curl in the ends of my shoulder length for a professional/polished \\&quot;newscaster\\&quot; look &amp; a set of 1/2-1\\&quot; hot curlers that often resulted an awkward straight at the top, &#x27;fro at the bottom look which didn&#x27;t really matter b/c it wouldn&#x27;t last for more than 2-3 hours before straightening out again.  After seeing multiple beauty blogs/vlogs about curling wands, I chose this Remington, here&#x27;s a breakdown of pros &amp; \\&quot;cons\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;**Price, for a CERAMIC and digital wand, this is a great price - I&#x27;m unsure what a wand double, triple, or quadruple this price can do more or better?&lt;br /&gt;**Adjustable temperature at the push of a button&lt;br /&gt;**Heats up in seconds (as oppose to the 3-5m my Conair needs)&lt;br /&gt;**Wand is VERY light weight &amp; power cord swivels (considering the weird angles my arms get in as I work around my head, these simple features make a world of difference!)&lt;br /&gt;**Curls LAST all day (even on my very fine, very straight Asian hair)&lt;br /&gt;**Curls are smooth &amp; shiny (you don&#x27;t get the matted, dull look that sometimes comes with overheating, &amp; I haven&#x27;t noticed any frizzyness or split ends the day after either)&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;m finally able to achieve the vertical spiral curl - no creases, no obvious straight to curly transition, no unpredictable flippyness (which I was never able to achieve with a clip/clamp curling iron or hot curlers).  These curls are SO much easier to control &amp; style!  I believe the tapered shape also helps to achieve this look &amp; to guide my hair/finger tips down the barrel towards the tip.&lt;br /&gt;**Stay-cool tip (a friend of mine acquired a wand that doesn&#x27;t have the cool tip...I often use the tip to stabilize my arm &amp; the wand when it&#x27;s at a weird angle, so I can&#x27;t imagine not having it)&lt;br /&gt;**Auto-off (I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I panic at the elevator or lobby of my apartment building thinking I didn&#x27;t turn off my Conair curling iron &amp; make myself late for work b/c I run back to the apartment to find that I both turned off AND unplugged it!  But this \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; feature is priceless &amp; should be applied to all hot/heated hair tools).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Cons\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;I put \\&quot;cons\\&quot; in quotes because my issue with this curler is really in the ease of use, but obviously everyone has different hair types/lengths &amp; styling techniques/experience.  For my shoulder length hair, I find maneuvering the hot wand so close to my scalp to be a little stressful, time consuming (b/c I&#x27;m trying to avoid getting burned), &amp; uncomfortable (vloggers do it with such ease, but I don&#x27;t know...maybe my shoulders &amp; elbows aren&#x27;t quite as flexible or limber?).  My eye-level bangs &amp; the back of my head are particularly tricky areas - I&#x27;ve resorted to using my old Conair w/ clamp for my bangs, for the back of my head - I just take the approach of slow &amp; steady wins the race!.  So if you lack the dexterity of a hairstylist or beauty vlogger &amp; have slightly clumsy tendencies like me, this is NOT the easiest tool to master, however if you&#x27;re willing to put in the time, practice, &amp; patience - you can achieve some beautiful curls &amp; hairstyle options.  Lastly, while a curling iron with a clamp might be a little safer or easier to use, for me, I was never able to achieve the vertical spiral curls that I&#x27;m able to get with this wand, so in turn I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this curling wand will make your hair look like shirley temple. gives small tight curly ringlets. can make a beachy look.</li>
    <li> Cuts my hair curling time in half. Amazing, love it</li>
    <li> This worked AMAZINGLY! I have extremely thin, straight hair, and it would never hold a curl for more than an hour. The iron heats up pretty quickly, and while at first I tried styling using the glove, it was nearly impossible and just easier to go into it with my bare hand. It took time getting used to the fact that there is no clamp because it&#x27;s a WAND. But this product worked great and gave my hair a nice look that lasted the whole day!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great. View a demo of wrapping hair on YouTube. Glove is great to protect fingers when using.</li>
    <li> omg can this thing give a curl. it heats up very quickly and it gives ur hair just a touch of something extra. it was speedy delivery, just as described and easy to use. im in love</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 15 and I absolutely love this wand! I receive so many compliments whenever I use it. I have natural curly/wavy hair so I usually just touch up pieces with the wand for a more natural look. I haven&#x27;t burned myself in the year that I&#x27;ve owned it but if you&#x27;re worried about the open barrel then you can use the glove to protect your hand. I highly recommend this wand.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! So easy to use !!</li>
    <li> I love curling wands. I really don&#x27;t use curling irons that much anymore. This can give you spirals or waves I just personally like the larger one that is out now but I wouldn&#x27;t mind having both for different size curls. Make sure you use the glove so you don&#x27;t get burned!!!</li>
    <li> only used this product once but worked very well. It heated up quickly. Was not very difficult to use after seeing a few YouTube tutorials. Good product.</li>
    <li> It curls my hair good even though my hairs super short. I like it quite a bit and it was cheap.</li>
    <li> I am writing this under my boyfriend&#x27;s account...I bought this the other day and this wand is great! Today was my first time using it and although I had a little bit of a learning curve, my hair turned out so well! I got a ton of compliments. My hair is below my shoulders and pin-straight, so I am constantly annoyed by its lack of body. This made such a difference! All day the wave stayed in and then I retouched it tonight and it was back to its original bounce of this morning! What a breath of fresh hair. I totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have only ever reviewed one other product but I really wanted to write a review for this because I love it so much. I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and I use it all the time. I never used to curl my hair because whenever I tried it would take forever and I hated using the curling irons that have clips. I read a bunch of reviews online and finally decided to try this. I am so happy I did! I ordered the 1/2-1 inch one which is great for a variety of styles. I can make tight curls by curling smaller sections of hair at a time and holding it on longer or bigger curls with larger sections of hair. One of my favorite things to do is to turn it to the highest heat and grab sections of my hair, wrap them around the curling iron and release them immediately, making beautiful waves. I used this on my friend who has never been able to curl her hair before (her hair just won&#x27;t hold a curl) and it gave her a full head of curls. Also, this makes my hairstyle last for days, even without hairspray. The best part is that my hair is super shiny after I use this. It heats up very quickly and I find that I can use a lower heat setting on this than I use on tools that aren&#x27;t ceramic. Plus it comes with a handy glove so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers. I want to order the larger size next!</li>
    <li> I have thick long hair and this has no problem with curling it and giving me a huge range of options when it comes to my hair. It takes a bit to get used to it, but once you do, it&#x27;s amazing! The curls stay there for a long time, don&#x27;t fry my hair and they&#x27;re perfectly shaped.</li>
    <li> Really works great.  My daughter has long, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl very well and this does the trick - leaving her with springy coils that seem to hang in there all day.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> works awesome on hair curls</li>
    <li> Love this wand. I have it to my sister as I bought 2 more however I wish I had this one. It&#x27;s the best wand out there.</li>
    <li> Love this better then the nume I got at the same time.</li>
    <li> Great curling wand!  Easy to use.  Fast heating.  It takes me about 10-15 to curl my hair (shoulder length) and it lasts until I wash it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my short bob cut. Easy to handle.</li>
    <li> My hair reaches about two inches past my shoulders. This can curl it and give it beach waves but I can see that this was designed for longer hair.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is amazing. I have extremely fine, thin, and long hair that is extremely difficult to curl. I&#x27;ve tried every method possible to curl my hair- hot rollers, curling irons, buns, braids, you name it. This is the ONLY one that has worked! You can create so many different kinds of curls with it too! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> I have fine but thick hair and because of my hatred of mornings, I rarely do anything but wash and dry it and pull it back in various ponytails, braids or twists. I&#x27;ve recently been growing it out and have taken an interest in doing more to it without pulling it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair never ever holds curl. Back in the day when I was in 3rd grade (1993) my mom had the brilliant idea of getting me a spiral perm. It cost a fortune and lasted 3 days, that&#x27;s how resistant to curl my hair can be. However, when I got a hold of this, things have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m still pretty awkward with it, it&#x27;s getting easier each time I use it. It&#x27;s not quick (for me anyway) so I don&#x27;t do it often, but I do \\&quot;practice\\&quot; on the weekends. I don&#x27;t set it at the highest setting and I still get nice tight curls that loosen into really pretty waves over time. If I do set it at the highest setting, it&#x27;s almost like revisiting that ill-fated spiral and they loosen very little through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like using the glove because it&#x27;s hard to gather the hair, but I do burn myself a lot unfortunately. I think that will lessen as I get more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together, great product!</li>
    <li> I love this wand it comes with good directions and it comes with the glove although i stopped using the glove after one use, it just got in the way. The wand is very slick at first so my hair slides down and i only get to use the \\&quot;1/2 part of the wand instead of the &#x27;1 part at the top so it make my hair very spirally instead of that long wavy look, but im learning and i think i got it down after a week!!! i recommmened!</li>
    <li> After seeing what the curling wand could do on youtube, I was instantly left wanting one for myself. I checked amazon and had the Remington curling wand for a VERY reasonable price! I ordered on a Sunday, and received it on the following Tuesday! As soon as I got it, I had to try it out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had watched several videos on youtube where the girls didn&#x27;t use the glove. The Remington wand comes with a glove(GREAT DEAL) because I found out for myself how hot it really is. I started curling my hair without the glove(stubborn?) and everything was going fine, and then bam, I burned my hand by my thumb. Not a bad burn, but a burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would DEFINITELY recommend using the glove that comes with and if you are trying to decide whether you should buy a curling wand with or without a glove... GET THE GLOVE. Seriously, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this curling wand, and would definitely recommend it! Just don&#x27;t burn yourself!</li>
    <li> fast ,easy and amazing .  if you are one of those people whos hair cant hold a cural this is it .  before the remington my hair never did but now it does and the curals stay in for days and yes even after a nice long brushing out. but WARNING do not be stupid like i was the first time the remington is very hot it is 410 degrees so WEAR THE GLOVE every one always says nothing is perfect but the remington truly is:)</li>
    <li> This is a realy great product! I am 13 years old and got this from from my parents last Christmas. They got me the 1 inch wand.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price! I was very impresesd with many of the things about this wand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heated very quickly and let you know when it came to temperature by beeping, tapered for natural looking curls, came with a glove for those wary of getting burned, long lasting curls.  The curls in my hair lasted the whole day even without hairspray! Normally when i curl my hair with a regular curling iron it lasts half the day WITH hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the 1 inch wand for tight small curls, but if you are looking for large wavy curls get the 1 1/2 inch. When borrowing my friends 1 1/2 wand I found that it took a lot longer to get the curls and they didnt stay as long. But over all this is a great product and i recomend any remington products. I use their straightning iron too and i love it so much!</li>
    <li> I have tried over 20 different types of curling irons and this one is by far the best. I have long wavy thick hair and this is perfect for me. After I shower I usually put some mousse in and let my hair air dry. Whenever I feel the need to glam it up I take a couple of hairs and wrap them around the wand. This gives me sexy beach wave curls. If I have an event that I need something fancier I straighten the top half of my hair and curl the bottom. I love the fact that i can make the curls as big as I want. It is easy to get burnt so you have to be very careful. Once you get the hang of it you will never go back to any other iron.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. Heated up in about 30 secs, created adorable spiral curls, and its easy to use. I set the temp to 338 and it curled a strand in 10 secs. You can also lock it on the temp just in case you hit buttons while you&#x27;re using it. Without the lock it probably would have been annoying since the buttons are on the handle and i hit it about 3 times while using it. So i love this...so glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> The curling iron works as stated.  You have to be willing to practice with it a few times.  The curls for my shoulder length hair were actually tighter than I wanted at first so next time I will not leave the hair wrapped as long or use more of the wider part of the iron.  The glove is only a very thin piece of fabric and it did not seem to do much to protect from the heat IMO.  I bought this for my daughter and I believe it will be ideal for her much longer hair.  A nice change from the constant flat ironed look.</li>
    <li> There was nothing wrong with this item, per se.  However I did not realize a curling wand is not the same as a curling iron, which is what I wanted.  The curling WAND does not have the little curved piece of metal that clamps down on your hair so you can wrap it around the round pink part.  (I can&#x27;t think of a better way to explain it ...).  So I went to use this and I could not figure out how I was supposed to wrap my hair around it!  I guess that is why it came with the glove, so you can touch the heated wand.  Friends of mine said to watch some Youtube videos to see how to use a curling wand.  But I returned it and plan to buy a curling IRON.  I&#x27;m new to the whole actually-doing-my-hair thing and this just seemed a little too out of my league right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t really rate this item as I barely tried to use it.  But just beware that it does not have that little curved piece of metal to clamp down the section of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago at walmart. It does give you nice tight curls, but it&#x27;s really difficult to use and took me a long time finish my hair. I have long hair, so one problem I ran into was that i had to do the top half of some of my sections and then do the bottom half. I also had a hard time getting my hair to stay at the wider end. as i wrapped my hair, it kept wanting to slip down towards the skinny end. another problem is that you have to do fairly small sections, so it ended up taking me more than 2 and a half hours to curl all my hair. I also burned my self several times, as it&#x27;s awkward to use, because you have to hold it at some weird angles while you are wrapping your hair. I did find that if you wrap the hair looser, you seem to get a better curl. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend this iron for doing all of your hair, but it is useful if you  just want to add a few accents, touch-ups, or a few ringlets around the face. I will also say it heats up super fast, so it&#x27;s great for touch-ups if your in a hurry.</li>
    <li> It is so easy to use!!!! I got the most beautiful curls and it only took me about 20 minutes. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I can never curl my hair with a regular curler but this product is fantastic. PERFECT curls! and it&#x27;s alot cheaper than buying those expensive curlers. Very easy to use and I didn&#x27;t even have to wear the glove. GET THIS!</li>
    <li> The technique takes some getting used to. It&#x27;s easier to use on someone else. The curls last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have natural thick hair and this actually works for my hair. I love that it&#x27;s pink and It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
    <li> Gets hot fast.  Takes some getting used to in order to avoid burning your fingertips.  This is an economical and great working wand that curls my fine hair well.  It does just as well as other more expensive salon brands.  I just ordered a second one for my daughter!</li>
    <li> I had been curling my hair with a flat iron for the longest until i got this curling wond. It lightweight &amp; simple to use. I love the heat settings on it. It also comes with a glove so you wont burn your hand which is a great addition!</li>
    <li> love itt :) happy girl</li>
    <li> The wand is great. But the barrel is kinda small, but it&#x27;s cool, I twirled the hair more and it made it much better.</li>
    <li> I Absolutly Love it very satisfied Thank You heats up well and curls look amazing healthy soft looking curls and curls last for days each day the hair looks better</li>
    <li> I used this curling iron for my cheer hair so many times and my hair always had beautiful, effortless curls in it that looked amazing!! I never felt like my hair was burned off like some heat products do. My hair still felt healthy and smooth after multiple uses. Overall, I absolutely love this styling tool!!! It is an asset to own one!</li>
    <li> its in perfect condition. exactly what i wanted and was expecting. it curls perfectly and lovely i have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling wand. It works well and comes with a handy glove!! Does all it said it would. Great price!</li>
    <li> Great item! Makes my bob cut curly and perfect. The glove included is all right. I burned my fingers a few times. Anyway, I have several remington products and they seem to be durable.</li>
    <li> Works great and very quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good I recommended to buy it.  Is very affordable price for the work it does. I really lov it !!!</li>
    <li> i like it works good on my hair and the price is good too. it heats up quick and curl my hair</li>
    <li> Not what I expected it is very difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Ok, but not for my hair...thinish.  It seems to ruin my hair.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend  got me the 1&amp;#34;- 1&amp;#34;1/2  wand I love it works great. Gives me beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> greatttttttttttt product I love I love i love it is very handy I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better thank you</li>
    <li> This works better than ANY other curling iron/wand I have ever used - and at such a great price point! Loose curls stay throughout the day, even without using any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This radius (.5&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34; barrel) is somewhat small for my long, thick hair, and I would instead prefer a 1&amp;#34;-1.5&amp;#34; barrel. If your hair is longer than shoulder length, or just a couple inches below the shoulders, I would recommend sizing up.</li>
    <li> Great curl and fast.  Only down side is the smell from the heat and the heat glove is just a cheap winter glove. It will only protect you if you accidentally touch it and quickly pull away. You can&#x27;t safely hold your hair to the rod.</li>
    <li> I love it. Shipping was fast! &amp; I&#x27;m in love with my new wand. True to description thanks again. Will be ordering something new soon</li>
    <li> I love it. I will be using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair when she gets some lol. Worth the purchase</li>
    <li> A lot of unsatisfied people talk about the hair not staying on the barrel or hair not being wound tight enough, etc. Are people just winding it around the barrel and then letting go of their hair right away? If so, that&#x27;s probably why you&#x27;re not getting the results you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I twist my hair around the barrel, hold on to the tip of my hair, count to five (I have thin hair) and then let go. Every section I grab, I twist my hair in the opposite direction around the barrel (this prevents your curls from falling into each other if that makes sense). This tool is so much easier to use than a regular curling iron! It doesn&#x27;t crimp your hair and because you are holding your hair the whole time, you have more control than with a standard curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this wand for almost two years already and it&#x27;s still performing wonderfully. I only wash my hair every other day and my curls from day one always last through to day three when I wash my hair again. Incredible, especially because I have really thin hair and my style never lasts for more than 12 hours. Love this wand!</li>
    <li> Great curls, easy to use. Love it. :)</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this curling wand from Amazon after perusing many reviews on it (via youtube, amazon, etc.). This is an amazing tool! It allows you to get professional looking results at home...I DO NOT WORK FOR THE COMPANY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past weekend I used the wand on my kinky straight hair extensions that had been blown straight. To give you a visual, that looks like texlaxed blown out hair. I put the wand on 410 and began to wand section by section. The amazing this about this wand is that it allows you to make big curls (by wanding your hair around the bottom), small curls (wanding hair at the top), or curls that progress from loose to tight or vice versa.  Further, there is a thermal glove which enables you to prevent burning your hand when the tool is at high temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received soooo many compliments on my hair. My good friend was like...&amp;#34;I want you to wear your hair like that for my bday :)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is an amazing tool...I mean for $20...you really don&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend looking at some youtube videos on how to wand; so you know how to get &amp;#34;wanded waves&amp;#34; or pretty spirals.</li>
    <li> My hair is as straight as two highschool kids saying no homo and doesn&#x27;t hold curls but this is by far an amazing product and its hold my curls I used (bought) the 1-1 1/2 one and my curls I love them.. The glove is a normal winter glove but it&#x27;s fabulous..</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this! She has a lot of very fine hair which has never held a curl with a regular curling iron.  We get great results with thus2, just takes a little practice &amp; a little patience to learn how to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before so I was nervous about it working on my hair (thick but fine and doesn&#x27;t hold curl well), but it really works well! I&#x27;ve used it with and without the glove and had awesome results. It curls my hair way faster than a curling iron ever did and the curls stay overnight with no product. Really an awesome and easy-to-use curling wand.</li>
    <li> The product price is reasonable, the product is new. I have yet to learn how to style my hair as I like it. I am not used to a wand, but I am practicing. I think this will be perfect for summer hair styling.</li>
    <li> heats up well and gets the job done as expected. definitely a good purchase and I would recommend anyone to buy this curling wand</li>
    <li> I hate doing my hair &amp; I have never been a fan of the curling iron, but this wand makes curling my hair fast &amp; simple. Love that I have the option of small or big curls/waves with just one hair styler. Definitely a great product at a reasonable price!!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few days ago and have used it twice.  It makes beautiful curls, I can&#x27;t argue with that.  I have a couple gripes though.  It&#x27;s very time consuming and not the easiest type of curling device I&#x27;ve used.  My hair, which is short/medium in length, often slipped off.  The glove helped but wasn&#x27;t the greatest in heat resistance.  I kept taking it off to section my hair while combing it.  So I tried it several times without the glove, and yes, got a couple nasty burns on my fingers.  I will admit I usually have perms, so I am not experienced in styling my own curls.  To summarize, yes, it makes amazing curls, however, the heating glove is thin, my hair slipped off easily sometimes (it&#x27;s hard to hold the end of the curl on when your fingers get too close to the glove), and it takes a LONG time and some getting used to apparently.</li>
    <li> Amazing curler! It arrived earlier than I had expected. Probably one of the best products that I have ordered from amazon! It heats up quite fast and works beautifully. This is definitely going to be my favorite hair tool especially since my hair does not hold curls very well. The curls also last a long time.</li>
    <li> I rarely write Amazon product reviews but I absolutely had to for this curling iron. I have very straight hair, abundant and fine, and it has NEVER held a curl. I&#x27;ve tried various irons (all with clips), rollers, etc. paired with super strength hairsprays and even when I got it professionally done for a friend&#x27;s wedding the curls fell out throughout the night. I figured I&#x27;d give this wand a shot because it was cheap. I AM SO HAPPY I DID! I have curled my hair with this the last 2 days and used NO product in it and the curls have stayed not only throughout the entire night (for 8+ hours) but even overnight! This is truly a miracle for my hair and basically life changing.... or, you know, as life changing as a curling iron can be for a woman. If your hair has trouble holding a curl I strongly recommend this wand!!</li>
    <li> This may be a new wave curling iron...but it is terrible.  I am right handed, I find it very difficult to use when I need to hold the curling iron with my left hand and wrap with my right. This requires me to keep having to take the glove on and off. I have bangs that are about 4 to 4.5 inches long,  I cannot manually wrap my bangs around the curling iron in order to get wave.  The glove is bulky, if you need to do anything to change hands you have to keep taking the glove on and off.  The Iron is so hot it is actually hot through the glove.  Forget trying to use this curling iron without the glove.  To add to this if you ever loose the glove a pot holder would be required to use this curling iron.  It is difficult to wrap hair around the wand, hold it and keep it tight to get wave. In my opinion, this is a very poorly designed curling iron. I would love to exchange it but since it was ordered on line as a gift, I will be discarding it.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, hard to curl hair. No matter what I use, the curls will either fall out almost immediately after curling, or my hair will only remain somewhat wavier than usual. I curled my hair with this for the first time last night, and not only did I not use hairspray or any other hair product, but I have been touching it and playing with it all day, and it is now almost dinner time, and my hair is just as curly and bouncy as when I first curled it :) I really love this. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with stubborn, hard to curl hair. Just don&#x27;t use the glove--- it makes your hair staticy, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to not burn yourself if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
    <li> bought this because of it being the highest rating curler on Amazon. my hair does not curl easily so I thought, after reading the reviews, that maybe I should give this a try. it definitely works! it&#x27;s great that it has temp controls and it does not take that long for the curls to set. definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Hesitant about buying this product, but i&#x27;m completely in love with it! It really holds a curl, and it stays all day.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to people! It&#x27;s fast and easy to use. It heats up fast and provides a globe so one doesnt burn their fingers, leaving you with flawless curls!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great because of the reviews that I read.  I will come back to put my review after I try this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use once you get used to it. Also it heats very quicly so we won&#x27;t have to wait a long time before using it. I&#x27;m gonna buy the bigger size of this. Love it!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really not much more to say. I was in disbelief at how fast this worked. Literally heated up in 15-30secs, curled BEAUTIFULLY in 5 (including on Black hair--tested on my friend and my hair. Equal results). I actually bought both this brand and Conair&#x27;s You Curl and they work EQUALLY the same. I didn&#x27;t even use full settings--set them both for 350/360 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I might choose this over the Conair one is due to the lock-button so you don&#x27;t accidentally switch the temperature or turn it off and b/c I like the full glove better than 3-finger glove. But a) haven&#x27;t burnt my hand yet and b) the Conair one doesn&#x27;t seem to switch easily....so I&#x27;m not sure about the complaints. So either one you decide to buy will be fine :)</li>
    <li> I thought that this wouldn&#x27;t meet my standards as a curling wand. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with wands that were expensive but didn&#x27;t heat up quickly or even enough at all. I have wavy hair so of course I need to leave the wand in for a few more seconds. But this wand is perfect! Heats up in 5 secs and does the job perfect. Be sure not to leave it in you&#x27;re hair long it REALLY gets hot!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that these &#x27;wands&#x27; are for long hair - mine is just past my shoulders and I had a really hard time using this. I also got a second degree burn on my hand from it so be careful b/c it gets HOT HOT HOT. USE THE GLOVE it comes with. I didn&#x27;t and I paid for it. My own stupid fault - I underestimated the wand. LOL</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. It gets super hot and curls really fast. I would certainly recommend this item. It was easy to use even without the glove. You can make small or large curls.</li>
    <li> I tried this because a friend suggested it to me. Unfortunately this was not at all what I expected. I have thick, curly-wavy, medium length hair, and this product did not give me the desired results. It was hard to use and the glove doesn&#x27;t even work very well. Would not recommend or purchase again.</li>
    <li> So I got the product, and it&#x27;s A LOT smaller than I thought. I have long hair so its hard to curl with such a thin wand. It does work amazing though. I would just recommend the thicker wand for long hair. Other than that great item.</li>
    <li> I like this for long hair. When I cut my hair to about shoulder length it got to be too difficult to maneuver, especially in the back. It also got to be a little TOO curly. Tip: wear the provided michael jackson glove. ow!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! Super easy to use, learned to use it within a week of playing with it. You can control the heat settings, which is very nice. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl from a curling wand, but this does the trick all the way until I wash my hair. Very impressed. Shipped quickly also!</li>
    <li> Spectacular Curling Iron.  I read reviews on all the other wand irons, &amp; found the reviews on this one to be the best!  I haven&#x27;t used another wand, but I do LOVE this one!</li>
    <li> hard to use, very bulky, and dangerous for kids..u can easily hurt your self, i didn&#x27;t like it..u get what u pay for</li>
    <li> It i awesome and really easy</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using regular curling irons this whole time........ this wand is where its at! Don&#x27;t struggle with curling irons/curlers, this is so easy!!! It comes with a heat resistant glove which works pretty well. All you need to do is wrap your hair around it for 5 seconds for PERFECT curls. I thought that the barrel may be a little bit too small, but it&#x27;s perfect! If you want large curls you just use larger pieces of hair. works fantastic and cut my getting ready time in half!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a curling wand under $20 would live up to the hype of the reviews I had read, but ordered it anyway figuring I could always return it. After receiving the wand and trying it out, it is just as fantastic as everyone makes it out to be! Heats up super fast and super hot, very user friendly, beautiful beachy waves quickly, and curls LAST. I have tried multiple wands in the past and returned them all. This will be the one I keep. So affordable, yet so effective - you rarely see that anymore!</li>
    <li> This curling iron heats up quickly, you can lock temp which is a very good feature. It suits my needs.</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty curly, and short. I don&#x27;t like spending that much time on my hair in the morning before school either, so this product was perfect!! It heats up incredibly fast and the curls are glossy and smooth without any heat protection cream. They also stay that way for two days. Of course my hair is already curly so that probably helps a little, but previous curling irons wouldn&#x27;t stay. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Perfect ! I Love It So Much! The Curls Come Out Gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;I Couldnt Have Asked For Anything Better. I Love It !!!!!</li>
    <li> Got the 1/2 - 1 inch it&#x27;s amazing! It gets HOT so please use the glove!! Get this for those flawless spiral curls.</li>
    <li> I bought a larger hair wand prior to this one, but this one seems to curl my hair better.  I have very thin hair, just past my shoulders.  I did burn myself the first time using it, but have become better with time.  It does come with the glove, but I find it weird to touch your hair and grab it with the glove.  Made my hair have a little static when I used the glove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that others will find the lack of handle to hold the hair in place fine, but I did not.  Using a heat resistant glove to hold the hair in place produced less than good results.  I clearly need the training wheels!</li>
    <li> This ceramic curling iron is awesome!!! I have tried different curling irons in the past but haven&#x27;t held the curl throughout the day like this one. It heats up very quickly and makes beautiful curls that last pretty much all day. Leaves hair looking amazingly volumnous which works for somone like me who has fine hair.</li>
    <li> Does the job my 15 year old daughter wanted but be careful to use a glove as it is easy to burn fingers with this product.  Also be careful to not leave hair wrapped too long.  My daughter watched a video of one girl who had an entire piece of hair break off while using a similar product.  Fair haired people (blonds) or those with color treated hair should be very careful as this product gets VERY hot. My daughter has dark thick hair and we only wrap the hair to the end, count to 2-3 seconds and remove it getting a perfect spiral curl.</li>
    <li> This wand works wonders for waves. If you use flexi rods and need a little touch up this wand is a much better option than a traditional hair curler. Also came with a protecting glove. This wand is a very good price for the quality. Also my package was received on time and in very good condition. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This wand does wonders. I love curls so its really my only tool I need. I fell in love as soon as I used it.</li>
    <li> The Wand Makes The Most Beautiful Curls. Heats Up In Record Time. It Does Get Really Hot Though. Use Glove!!</li>
    <li> I never really curled my hair, I was lucky enough to have the natural curl that didn&#x27;t need any product. However over the past few years my hair has become more naturally straight. I bought this because of the reviews, and (with no curling iron experience) had so many compliments on just my first attempt using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature settings are also a plus, especially since heat can damage hair terribly.&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoyed the ease of use. My first time using it and I was able to finish my entire head in less than twenty minutes. (I do have finer hair than most, thicker hair would probably take longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first wand i have ever bought and it works wonders! My curls stay in for 2 days and thats never happened before! LOVE LOVE LOVE it and for a really good price! I&#x27;d recommend anyone thats thinking about buying this product to just go for it &amp; get it. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I think the pearl part is a great concept, but I could not get the hang of working without a clip.  It&#x27;s a pain to put the glove on, especially during the summer months, and even then, you can still burn your hands if you touch the wand for too long.</li>
    <li> It works very well, co-exists with hair product. My only problem was with shipping, it went to 2 different places before it go to me, and I spent a lot of time on the phone trying to work it out.</li>
    <li> Im very glad i picked this curling wand. It heats up fast and curls great! the glove that comes with it isnt the best at keeping the heat out, but its better then touching it with your bare hand!</li>
    <li> Curling wand works great!!!  I had never used one before, but I was happy to find out it is really easy to use!</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s worth it! I hate tight curls, I go for more messy loose waves. I take big sections and randomly wrap them around the barrel, let them cool while I get ready and then brush and shake them out. They last for days and look awesome.</li>
    <li> Got this for a good price. Didnt have high expectations but it works as expected. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Never used a wand before until I purchased this item and I was reluctant because my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for anything. It&#x27;s super easy to use and my Hair holds the curl into the next day I love it! No hair spray needed! I have bouncy perfect curls all day!</li>
    <li> Great iron.  Curls fast.  The longer you hold it the tighter the curl.  I&#x27;ve burned myself a couple times because I haven&#x27;t used the glove, but I&#x27;ve survived.  Excellent iron.  Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing for the price especially! i got this for a close friend and she came over a year later and used it on my hair and still works amazingly. This is so worth it!</li>
    <li> This is amazing it curls the hair so quick best curling that iron I&#x27;ve had by far it creates gorgeous waves and springy curls and it makes the curls look super soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to use</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling wand for my daughter.  She is very pleased with the wand and I feel I got it for a good price.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, loved the way my hair looked.</li>
    <li> I have used the curling wand a few times since my purchase and it is so easy to use. My hair typically does not stay curly but this has worked great for me so far!</li>
    <li> Really like this. It&#x27;s idiot-proof which is something I need in a hair styling tool!</li>
    <li> This wand is amazing.  Curls so quickly and stays in for the most part all day!  My daughter and I have really thick hair that does not curl, but this did the trick.  I purchased it specifically for her dance recital and it kept curls in most of the day with only a few touch ups.  Even with the glove, it&#x27;s still hot though, so beware of that, but as long as you don&#x27;t get too close you&#x27;ll be okay.  My husband even got in on the fun and realized it&#x27;s not tricky at all to curl our daughter&#x27;s hair with this, so she&#x27;s excited that he can do it too now!</li>
    <li> works great just what my Daughter wanted. Easy to use and warms up quick. Shipping was fast so my daughter could have it for prom</li>
    <li> Bought it because of good price and good reviews and I am not disappointed. The only thing is I bought smallest barrel and it defiantly smaller than I would like but I knew that when buying. But because it was so much cheaper than other sizes and went with it. Have to say that it takes more technique to get bigger looser waves with this barrel but overall no regret. Heats up nicely, simple, and the glove is huge bonus!</li>
    <li> Works great if you know how to use it. Does get hot but the glove works! It takes some practice but really can achieve great waves and curls with practice. My hair never holds curl. This is my miracle product</li>
    <li> This wand works great! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the buttons are a bit of a pain. You have to really press and hold the power button to turn it on/off and when I&#x27;m styling my hair, the buttons get in the way and I accidentally turn the heat up/down when my fingers hit the buttons. It&#x27;s like the heat buttons are too sensitive and the power button isn&#x27;t sensitive enough!</li>
    <li> My hair does not really curl with curling wands but this wand is great. It leaves my hair soft and shinny. However you could easliy burn yourself</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and it works just as good as expensive curling wands! Its super affordable and I love it(:</li>
    <li> Used my friends for a while so i decided to buy my own and i love it. it gets the perfect curl and heats up quickly. I hate that it takes so long to cool down though.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my daughter for her pageants! It takes a little while to get used to using it but the curls are ahhhhmazing!</li>
    <li> It heats just fine, almost too hot.  The thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is it a smooth surface  no spikes  to grasp your hair  especially if hair is short,  wound hair slips off unless you  hold it tight with the glove and sometimes the glove doesn&#x27;t keep your hand from getting hot.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter loves this for her very long, very fine thick hair! I bought this one after reading a ton of reviews for different ones on Amazon. Curl holds much better than a traditional curling iron. Also looks good if she even just curls the bottom 6-8 inches of her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn&#x27;t find the styling glove helpful (she can&#x27;t hold onto her hair with it on). I&#x27;m glad I saw in a review to look for the cool tip, like this one has, because she says that she does hold the end of her hair against the cool tip while she waits for the curl to take. It takes less than 5 minutes to heat up and she uses it on a fairly hot setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first wand she ever tried to use. She is fairly skilled at styling her hair - she can french braid, etc. so she&#x27;s pretty good with her fingers.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works for all hair types. Since I have naturally stick straight hair,I always thought I could never get any curls to stay, but this product proved me wrong.</li>
    <li> Love this wand! It&#x27;s so easy to use and the curls stay all day into the next.  Delivered when expected, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This was my first curling iron in a long time.  I loved that it came with a glove because I needed it.  I have to keep practicing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curling wand for about two years now, and I must say I love it. It gets very hot, very quickly. Sadly, if you have thin hair like me and don&#x27;t need all that heat, there are not many options in regards to turning down the heat!</li>
    <li> WHen I first purchased this curling iron, I didn&#x27;t know how to use it.  I hated it because I was not getting the results promised.  But after time, I figured out how to angle it just right to make the curls drop correctly.  It has worked great ever since.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as often as I can and couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product. Although the glove they give you for protecting your hand isn&#x27;t the highest quality, that is an easy fix. Love this curler!</li>
    <li> It takes a while to get the hang of using this curling iron. It comes with a heat resistant glove instead of having a clamp and it took me a couple of times to figure out how to wrap my hair to get a good curl but it is worth the trouble. I have very fine hair and have to use it at the highest heat setting. I do like the results.</li>
    <li> The curls look great, the temperature gets really hot which I also love. Not long after I got it, I used it for a girls night out and my friends were raving about my curls. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this wand. It heats up fast &amp; the curls actually last! I have some thick hair and when I use a regular curling iron my curls don&#x27;t last at all They fall right out but with this wand it lasts! Not to mention I get my hair done FASTER (:&lt;br /&gt;Very much recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok. It&#x27;s Easy to use,but the circle is small,looks strange.</li>
    <li> this was very hard to figure out how to use.  I may not be coordinated enough.  I went back to my old curling iron with the clamp to hold yuor hair.</li>
    <li> these curls are awesome</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend and she loves it! She&#x27;s super excited about it. As soon as we collected and got home she plugged it in and started curling my hair. The wand heats up really quickly and creates really nice curls, that lasts.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without my wand as soon as I broke my first one I did a two day shipping for the next one ..... I don&#x27;t use curling irons</li>
    <li> I love it! The curls last for at least 2 days and turn out beautiful!</li>
    <li> This gives me wonderful curls! Learning to use it was a breeze! The curls will be tight at first but they fall out and become perfection and stay that for days until I wash my hair. Subsequent days, the curls will fall out more and more but somehow, it&#x27;s still a look I can pull off.</li>
    <li> The glove that comes with,  does not support the heat this iron exudes. Great curls though.</li>
    <li> I received this in mail and absolutely love this wand. I got it in the mail and could not wait to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have straight fine hair and was skeptical. I read all these reviews and i am so glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> love this curling wand! i had to get used to using it and burnt myself a couple of times but works great once you get it down!</li>
    <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of, curls last for a long, and best curler I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> good quality product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Good product! Very hot I&#x27;ve burn my self quite a bit but it comes with a glove I keep forgetting to put on. This does wonderful curls!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and a half. Reliable, heats up fast, great buy. NO QUESTIONS ASKED! I take this everywhere so big beautiful curls, or even brush it out for a nice natural wave.</li>
    <li> Helps me achieve the kind of curls I want that would suit any occasion. I can go from curl to curls. Loves this one!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time.It takes one week between order and delivery. It came with an instruction sheet, the protective glove and the Curl Wand.I test the Curl Wand for the heat, it heats fast. I didn&#x27;t test it on my Brazilian hear already.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling wand because I used the one my friend had and it was amazing! I have a lot of pretty thick hair and it used to take me about an hour and a half to curl my hair, on a good day. With this wand, it only takes 25 minutes! LOVE IT! :]</li>
    <li> My daughter is 12 and loves doing her hair now.  She has no problems using it and sometimes even does her hair before she goes to bed and it is still very curly the next morning for school.  I am very impressed as I think this does an even better job than the ones they sell in the mall for hundreds of dollars.  I would recommend</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t work it at all.....burn myself 3 times hot damn mess nice product though. Good deal for the money yay</li>
    <li> This is a great iron for stylish curls for all lengths...I love the high heat salon setting. The only thing I wish it had was a small piece to clip the end piece of hair into twist, other than that its great. KEEP AWAY CHILDREN AND DONT GET TO CLOSE TO YOUR SKIN i.e. neck, ear.. makes a quick burn obviously. I would not recommend this for anyone under 15.</li>
    <li> This is my first curling wand. I have only seen good reviews on this item. I purchased the 1/2-1 inch wand. I really wish I got the bigger wand but that is my fault. I am still learning how to work this properly and not burn my fingers off, but after the first few tries, my curls looked beautiful. I have thinner hair, and used the 392 heat setting. My hair NEVER holds curls, unless I sleep with them overnight. I curled my hair at 4:00pm and it is now 2:30am and they are just dropping now. I am very impressed with this wand and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> OF ALL THE WANDS I HAVE TRIED THIS ONE TAKES THE CAKE.  HEATS UP REALLY FAST AND THE CURLS COME OUT BEAUTIFUL!!</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well, but my hair is so long that I had difficulty using it. It would probably work better for someone with patience and medium length hair.</li>
    <li> works great! Love the curl and how easy it is to use!</li>
    <li> Got it for my girlfriend a year ago still works like the first day she got it</li>
    <li> This curling iron works really great! I love how lightweight it is, and how quickly it heats up. The little glove that comes with it didn&#x27;t really help a ton. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how small the barrel was. I thought the curls would come out more loosely so I got the smaller barrel. These curls come out very tight so if you want a wavy effect I would get the next size up!</li>
    <li> i choose this rating because absoutely love this product. It give me what I Really Need and it get the job done .</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that does usually hold a curl but this wand is even better than expected. Curl lasts at least two days, it heats up quickly and so easy to use. Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> My 12-year old has been wanting a curling WAND.  I was a little leery about it due to the fact that it&#x27;s easy to burn your hands.  I finally gave in. She has REALLY thick hair, and it works so well!!!! I have a much more expensive one for myself, but had I known how well this worked, I would&#x27;ve gotten this one for myself instead of spending the extra money!</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Was exactly what I was looking for. Not too expensive but good quality. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars, but the missing star is probably my fault - I&#x27;m not good at using it yet, and I think I should have ordered the bigger size for my hair. Overall, I like that it displays temp, that it is lightweight, and smooth. It is almost too smooth though - it&#x27;s hard to keep my hair toward the larger end. But again, that&#x27;s probably just due to a lack of skill on my part. Good product!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this wand. She has wanted one forever, so for Christmas I decided to order her this one.  It had decent reviews, and wasn&#x27;t expensive.  She absolutely loves this, and uses it all the time.  Works so much better than a regular curling iron.  She gets lovely curls that last all day.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and thick, so finding something to giver her lasting curls has always been a challenge.  The only thing is you have to be extremely careful not to touch it on accident.  Even with the glove you can get burnt.  She did the first time she used it, but learned real fast what she did wrong, and hasn&#x27;t had that issue again.</li>
    <li> I love this wand.. I am a wand novice and have had to watch some tutorials to get it right... Several burns and mishaps later I think I got it. If you have never used one.. I highly recommend tutorials on YouTube.. Etc. This wand WILL BURN YOU! Badly... Like, leave scars for life on your ears and forehead. Lol They say use the glove.. Sure go for it if it isn&#x27;t too much of a pain. It didn&#x27;t seem to matter. I burnt the crap outta myself anyways. On a positive note.. The curls are gorgeous and hold all day with a little hair spray. Highly recommended.. Just be very careful. It arrived on time, we&#x27;ll packaged.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT! love that it was affordable and curls my hair which is hard to curl, i&#x27;d recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. It makes my curls completely beautiful and I love that it has such easy settings to adjust it too. It is very easy to curl with and you don&#x27;t have to hold your hair to the wand for too long which is great. And once you do your hair with this curling wand your curls will stay all night long and even for the next day. I would recommend using the gloves when you first use the curling wand because it is really hot and hard to do it when you are trying at first.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She had been wanting one and after reading the reviews I picked this one. So glad I did. She loves it and it works awesome! Only tool that will curl her hair and the curls stay till she washes them out. Great product for a great price! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I picked this up because I have naturally frizzy hair....not curly enough to leave natural, but very difficult to straighten. I wanted something to use after straightening to add some curl back in (crazy, I know). I got carried away the first time I used it and ended up looking like Shirley Temple. Not a good look for a 46 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want waves and not real curls, keep it on the lower setting. Heats up very fast. A bit awkward to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, easy.</li>
    <li> I struggled with this curling iron at first because I&#x27;m used to the kind with a clamp. But, it does work really well. Be careful, you can still get burned through the glove. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Have had this for a long time now. My daughter uses it every day and has so many compliments on her hair. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> the curls stay bouncy there is no need for hairspray. I love this wand I am so happy I found it.</li>
    <li> Product seems a little cheaply made. It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair the way the more expensive ceramic curlers work for my hair.</li>
    <li> If you want a curling wand, this is the best! &amp; it&#x27;s pretty. Great controls. I like the digital.</li>
    <li> For me it actually made &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; of a curl . It needs a clamp to hold while u are twisting piece of hair around wand seriously. My hair keep creeping down the wand. The only good thing about this to me is .. it really did heat fast enough for me , it was a pretty pearly pink and it did create a curl just like another reviewer said.. i don&#x27;t wanna take my precious time tryna master a skill that deals with a hot object my hands and my head. For those that have mastered this .. good for you :) !</li>
    <li> Works as described, but takes some getting used to. Watch YouTube videos for instruction.</li>
    <li> This was the only wand my grandaughter wanted and she was thrilled with how her hair curled.  We had to order on-line to facilitate purchase.</li>
    <li> Even though it didnt come with the glove and I burned myself as soon as I got it, I Love My curling wand !</li>
    <li> Love it!  Only one burn on my neck so far and it was painful but worth it!  It takes a while to get use to using a wand and how to hold your hair and hands but after watching a few youtube videos it was no problem.  The 1 inch is the way to go for thin or thick, long or short hair.  I purchase and returned a 1 1/2 _ 2&amp;#34; one and it was so big I couldn&#x27;t get curls in my daughters short fine hair and my long thick hair just got large waves.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cousin and she absolutely loves it! She is still figuring out to get loose curls, but she says it was worth the money. She can&#x27;t thank me enough. Buy this product if you want bouncy curls! :)</li>
    <li> i love this iron It can be a bit difficult to figure out at first but the results are to die for ! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have long, coarse, straight Asian hair that curls very easily, but does not hold curl for very long.  I literally can spend a half an hour curling my hair and by the time I am ready to walk out the door, the curl is limp and frizzy.  I had just about convinced myself that the only way I could achieve curly, wavy hair was to cut it shoulder length.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this curling wand.  I read the reviews on Amazon and was very excited to purchase it.  Even though it qualified for Prime free shipping, I paid the extra $3.50 to get it overnight.  I am a temporary duty assignment out of town, but couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to order it.  I&#x27;ve had it for four days and it has totally changed the way I think about my hair.  The temperature setting is great.  I use the highest setting for the back ends that need the extra heat and then reduce the temperature for the front.  If you have any experience with curling wands or irons, this one will take you no time at all to attain the kind of curl you want.  The cone shaped barrel gives me tighter curl close to the crown and larger ringlet like curl near the bottom.  This is exactly what I have been looking for my whole life!  The only cons, which don&#x27;t effect the way it curls are:  The cord could be just a little bit longer, the base that&#x27;s sits on the vanity could be a little bit larger because it does tend to roll around a bit.  But I would recommend this wand to anyone who has been disappointed keeping curl.  The price is fabulous, too.  I could have spent much more money on a more expensive product, but it wouldn&#x27;t have come close to everything I get from this one.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It arrived in 2-3 business days as it said it would and I brought it to my sister&#x27;s wedding and I got compliments on my hair from everyone during all the rehearsals. The fact it can heat up to 400 degrees made doing my hair go very quickly and I have a lot of hair and I am very meticulous with my hair. I didn&#x27;t turn it up to 400, maybe 350 and it still did the trick. I even put my hair up in a bun to sleep (messy bun not trying to save the curl at all) and when I took my hair out in the morning it still looked good. I would have left it with minor touch ups if it wasn&#x27;t the day of my sister&#x27;s wedding...she had other ideas for my hair. I almost wish I bought the larger barrel for looser curls. That was more what I was looking for but I still love the results this product gives. If you are debating between the two sizes I would google search for what size curls each barrell will give.</li>
    <li> First, the delivery time was amazing! I got the Curling Wand© two days after placing my order when it said four. I used to have one and let a friend borrow it, and in turn had to replace it. I know this wand will get the job done. I&#x27;m excited to finally curl my hair! I love you Amazon and Remington.</li>
    <li> I love it! I am still getting the hang in using it. I wear extensions so I&#x27;m learning how to use it on that. But I over all love this product.</li>
    <li> So great curler!!! I always have a hard time curling my hair because it&#x27;s so straight and limp but it needs some volume. For a long time I gave up on curling irons because nothing works. Until I found this product.  The day I got it, i curled my hair using this and my hair stayed curled until the next day even after sleeping on it. Wow!!!! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> For how inexpensive this is, it heats up quickly, has a wide range of temperatures, and has lasted a long time!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a wand. The first time I used it my hair looked so wonky I was about to return it but I decided to try one more time. Ever since then I&#x27;ve been addicted to this thing. I only buy hot tools that can get the job done in 10 minutes or less and this passes that test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this wand unique is that if I use the highest heat setting and a spritz of hairspray my hair looks perfect ALL DAY. With all of my other hot tools my curls normally look a bit tired by the middle of the day but not with this wand. I spent the day running errands today and just looked in the mirror and my curls are just as fresh and springy as they were this morning. That is amazing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the smaller wand and I like that it looks like I naturally have a full head of loose spiral curls. I&#x27;m thinking about getting the larger one for that modern loose curls look. I really recommend this wand!</li>
    <li> I was recently introduced to the &amp;#34;curling wand&amp;#34; by my friend who has a Sultra Bombshell curling wand.  I loved how it worked since I don&#x27;t know how to use a regular curling iron without getting the kinks from the clamp, but wasn&#x27;t really willing to pay $130 for it.  I have naturally wavy-curly hair and like to make my waves more uniform and smooth by using a straightening iron to create waves, BUT this product works amazing and I achieved the same affect in less than 10 minutes (it usually takes 20-30 mins with the straightener).  I couldn&#x27;t believe it was only $20 and works just as well as my friends more expensive version.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really curl my hair too often but when I do this makes it super easy, and wasn&#x27;t expensive at all. Just don&#x27;t lose the glove! :)</li>
    <li> The curling wand is great, it&#x27;s packaged so nothing will get damaged and it even comes with a glove. The package came pretty fast so overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied !!</li>
    <li> I love this wand. It creates great curls and I like that I can lower the temperature to protect my hair.</li>
    <li> It seems to get pretty hot however it really does not work that well on long hair. It barely gives even a little wave. It may work better on shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this wand! I bought it because I saw it was number one and I def know why! It got here the day it said it was and I plugged it up to play with it and not but 5 SECONDS and it was up to the temperature! This tool is a perfect on the go or running late tool because it got hot really fast and is very reliable! My hair is short-medium and it makes me look like I am natural! #naturalgirlsrock anyways if you are hesitant I say buy! Also the shipping was very protective and kept me informed of the product whereabouts! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice wand, just not for curls. I have long fine hair and it only creates waves for me. They look super cute and last all day, which is great, just not the big bouncy curls I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied, but still on the lookout for a good curler.</li>
    <li> ok so even though I haven&#x27;t actually gotten a chance to fully use it, I did find a piece of track in my drawer and did a few curls with it and I loved it! I am going to curl my wig later tonight and give an update soon after but I was told that the Remington brand was the best. You cant beat the price either. Fast shipping and packaged just like it came from the store. I doubt if I will use the glove because it would seem impossible to do my hair with it on. So look out for my update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so heres my update on this product. I absolutely love it. The curls lasts for weeks unless it rains and I get my hair wet but it works wonderfully. Just wrap the hair around for a few seconds and its tightly curled. I don&#x27;t use the glove that came with it because I don&#x27;t need it. I burned my hand maybe once but who cares. I would purchase this again if something happened to this one</li>
    <li> I really like this curler. I have never used a wand curler before, but it was quite easy to master. I suggest watching some YouTube videos on wand curlers. :)</li>
    <li> I am not someone who is good with hair &amp; make-up (like at all!) and I manage to use this tool with ease.  I don&#x27;t even have to use the glove anymore, although it was very helpful with the first few uses.  This tool gets SUPER hot &amp; I think that&#x27;s the difference between this &amp; other curlers.  Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Heats up nicely, very easy to handle, easy storage, best curls I could create on my own without having to go to a stylist.  I own a flatiron by the same brand and I am very happy with both items.</li>
    <li> Need a lot of practice to use this I personally prefer the other type...watch the video on you tube ..</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product, so easy to use and the curls come out the way you want! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> The Remington Salon Pearl Digital Ceramic Curing iron works well, but is a bit awkward for me to use.  I have used the &amp;#34;open and close&amp;#34; style hair tools for decades and this is different.  I may take a while to get used to.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to &amp;#34;user awkwardness&amp;#34;!  I wanted it to produce fuller, rounded curls (I have thin hair) and I think it does a good job at that.</li>
    <li> worked just like i thought it would! very happy with it! plus its pink ;) no complaints here. buy it</li>
    <li> -Instantly makes awesome curls (tight or loose, depending on how you want them to look)&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up unbelievably fast&lt;br /&gt;-I barely used any holding product in my hair and the curls still lasted until the next day</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time and DIDN&#x27;T burn myself! Which is shocking because anyone who knows me knows i&#x27;m a klutz.  I have medium length hair that&#x27;s pretty thick, the curls turned out beautiful and it didn&#x27;t take much time at all, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this wand. You can do waves, loose curls, or tight curls. It has settings so you can adjust the amount of heat that you put on your hair. Comes with a glove which I feel is pretty useless but whatever</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to but a hair curler as I&#x27;m known for my stubbornly straight hair and love for curls. I&#x27;ve tried heated curlers before but they were a big disappointment.  I decided to give this curler a try since it was fairly priced and reviews raved about the quality. Well, I&#x27;m one of those who fell inlove! I get gorgeous baby curls that last throughout the day with the aid of some hair spray. I apply heat for about 30 seconds and viola! This was a big plus for me because my hair is very fine and is on the dry side and the last thing I wanted to do is damage it. A neat feature is the cone shape that let&#x27;s you control the size of the curls you want to get. Make sure to refrain from touching the iron as the protective glove is not insulated and you will get burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the curler for several months now and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied. I love remington products and also own their hair straightener .</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughters and they love it! Works perfectly and easily. Quality is good and the digital readout is easy to understand. The price is just right.</li>
    <li> I love mine. I&#x27;ve had it for almost 6 months. I got the product gently used, it seemed brand new. I have very curly crazy hair. I use this when I have straightened my hair and I want a clean long curly look. I love how hot it gets. Which is extremely hot! Supervise someone young.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my curling wand this things works miracles when it comes to perfect curls it&#x27;s very quick and easy and the curls last a week or more... High recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have never had success curling my hair in the past. I thought it was just a mix of my hair type and bad luck so I almost ruled it out. Because if it takes 2 hours and a bunch of hairspray (which I abhor) AND it falls flat after a few minutes I&#x27;m gonna rule it out as an option. It&#x27;s just not worth it! But this? I was so excited to try it after a friend recommended it since she claimed it held all day. On the first try, I curled my entire head of shoulder length hair in less than 30 minutes. I didn&#x27;t time it but it was more like 20, 25 maximum. They were springy from the start, amazing from root to tip and after wearing it all day, sleeping on it, AND wearing my hair up the next day at work, that following evening they were STILL there. 36 hours of springy curly goodness! And noooooo hairsprayyyyy!!!!! That was the best part. My only advice is not only use the glove but be very careful, maybe wear long sleeves. I did burn myself once on my forearm and this thing is hot hot hot. But that&#x27;s a given with any curler. I would give this one million stars if I could.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl well but with this, the curls really lasted. I do need to do some practice however to make the curls fall the way they should around my face. Overall pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is my curl life saver. I will never use another curler again..this totally makes the perfect spiral curls, beach waves every kinda girl wants.!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 year-old daughter for Christmas. She likes it and says that it works fine but she has burnt herself even while wearing the included glove. I suppose that&#x27;s just the price of beauty...glad I&#x27;m a man!&lt;br /&gt;A good product overall, I suppose. It arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
    <li> The wand works great without burning your hair like the old curling irons used to.  Hair can be as tight or curly as you want.</li>
    <li> Great Seller!!! Everything went perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I am very accustom to using curling wands. I borrow my friend&#x27;s all the time, and she&#x27;s a wand hoarder. I decided to finally buy my own, and I&#x27;ve tried so many makes/models I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. After reading the reviews here, it looked like this Remington wand was a shoe-in. So I bought it. I don&#x27;t normally leave bad reviews, but this was absolutely, positively the WORST curling wand I have ever used. I couldn&#x27;t believe it after all the praise it received here! The barrel on this particular wand was SO slick, my hair would constantly slide off the barrel—WITHOUT curling!!!! I even tried using hairspray to give the barrel (and my hair) extra stick/grip. Nothing worked! It was beyond frustrating. (My hair is very fine, but I have a lot of it.) I took it on a trip with me to curl my hair for our maternity shoot, and the wand didn&#x27;t make the plane ride home with me! It was such a useless piece of junk that I threw it away in the hotel bathroom! I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> great product, nice quality, came quickly, also cute! took two tries to use it properly but it heats up perfectly and once you get the hang of it gives you beauty queen hair! very impressed!! and such a great price</li>
    <li> The product works great! good thing it came with a glove because I would have burned myself several times. the only issue with it is it doesn&#x27;t give pretty curls like i want. The regular curling irons with the attached clip to hold the hair gives a better curl. These curls are tight and look almost crimp like. Great Purchase if that is what your looking for, unfortunately Im looking for a nicer curl.</li>
    <li> This Wand is magical. I first broke an old curling iron and had my home made wand but i kept burrning my self as well as my bathroom countertop. It works pretty well. I later got the bed head reverse Wand and i love it. the surls last for 3-4 days without having to retouch daily.</li>
    <li> I now see what all the hype is about!! One of the wisest purchases I&#x27;ve made! Every time I use the wand my hair comes out bouncey and flawless. The longer you keep your hair wrapped around the wand the more defined your curl. I Wanded (I made that word up) my hair I fingered through them and it was lovely. My curls lasted 3 days without needing to be touched up. My husband loves my hair curly now I receive nothing but compliments on my hair. I never set the temperature higher than 325 for two reasons my hair curls perfectly at that temperature and cause I&#x27;m terrified that my hair will burn and fall off like that girl from YouTube (I know you seen it). The curling wand also locks at a certain temperature if you hold the + button for 3 seconds which is convenient. A heat protectant glove is also included in the box. I love this wand.</li>
    <li> If you have thick and really straight hair( why else would you need a curler!) this is not the device for you. My hair are really straight and thick and this product is not working. At best I can get some side or front flicks. Even they don&#x27;t hold! I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love it no problems easy to use very cute and there an temperature setting higher or down I love it I recommend this product 💜💜💜</li>
    <li> With this want, my hair stays curly until I wash again and I have long thick heavy hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hair stylist, so maybe I don&#x27;t know all the tricks, but even with the heat resistant glove, it is very difficult to use this curling iron.  I&#x27;m pretty good with things requiring dexterity, but I just cannot seem to make this thing work!  I can&#x27;t give enough hair in it in equal amounts to look right.  I end up with curls that look a bit . . unfinished?  Something this hard to use is NOT was I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I did not  realize it didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; to hold hair, don&#x27;t like using the Glove.  would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love you, Remington wand. My hair never holds a curl and I struggle with the clips on most irons, but you deliver very tight curls that are easy to brush out and last all night. As someone who is used to having expensive hair tools (I&#x27;m looking at you, GHD straightener), I was pleasantly surprised how much I loved this!</li>
    <li> I PRAISE this wand. I have VERY straight hair. When i curl it with a wand, my curls never stay intact for more than 3 hours with or without hairspray. With the Remington wand my curls could stay on for the whole day even WITHOUT hairspray!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the $25 I was alittle scared it would be a cheap curler but I was wrong this thing is magic.very good for price n shipping was super fast</li>
    <li> During chemotherapy I lost all my hair and when it grew back it was curly but with some areas less curly. I have had the hardest time learning to control it so I&#x27;ve been trying new methods. Buying this was an effort to control the curls and make them a little more consistent. I have had a very hard time getting the hang of this tool but I am getting better at it. BUT the glove that comes with the curling wand does NOT work. I&#x27;ve already burned myself. I will be buying another glove that hopefully is higher quality and is truly heat protective.</li>
    <li> I almost NEVER say I LOVE a product nor give it a perfect rating, but this is it! I ADORE this curling wand! I have bought countless curling irons and wands. None...NONE have ever been able to make my hair curl...until now!!!! I curl my hair on monday for work, do a touch up each day, and they stay fairly well until I wash. I adore this! If you&#x27;ve never used a wand before, it&#x27;ll take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy! I love it, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i love this product! i been wanting to get this for a long time. i would suggest getting the bigger one if you have thick hair</li>
    <li> easy to use. i love the curling wand makes me feel like a princess.  i do not have super long hair and it still works :)</li>
    <li> I did a LOT of research before buying and with as much positive feedback as it has, I expected better. Its lightweight which is nice but that does cause it to move around a lot on the counter when you put it down. At one point, it moved over so much it wasn&#x27;t where I expected it to be when I went to pick it up again without looking and burned my finger.  I also can&#x27;t get my hair to stay at the wide end of the barrel. No matter how I position it, it slides down, making all my curls very tight, which I haven&#x27;t experienced with other wands. It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive so it&#x27;s worth the purchase and I like that it gets super hot and the curls hold well, I guess I just have to spend some more time getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for someone. Came in and excellent condition exactly as described.</li>
    <li> this product is BOMB. one of the best curls I&#x27;ve ever seen. the product is easy to use and great results for a dressy event or something laid back and simple. i would recommend thew product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I am not even exaggerating when I say that my hair has NEVER been able to hold curl!  I have tried countless hair products and curling products and withing an hour my hair is always completely flat again!  A couple of my volleyball players recommended this product so I gave it a shot.  Simply amazing!  Not only is is easy to use, my hair holds the curl all day, and I don&#x27;t even need to put any product in it.  That is probably my favorite part!  I don&#x27;t like the smell or feel of hair spray, so this product is great because my hair still has a soft feel all day while looking beautifully curly!</li>
    <li> I have naturally blond but thick hair - like straight afroamerican thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;This model is not strong enough to curl my hair :/</li>
    <li> I would have to say this is the easiest iron I have ever used! Very easy to work with and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Use it every am for perfect boho waves. I have shoulder length hair so this barrel size workd ok. If my hair were any longer I would want the next size up.</li>
    <li> Curls Curls! I liked this product. Good value.</li>
    <li> This iron gets very hot. I can curly my thick straight hair within ten minutes. I do think it is imperative to use the glove with it though. That&#x27;s what makes the process so fast.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is my hair or the curling iron, buy I cannot wrap my hair up tightly in this thing. It seems like my hair is too silky and slides around, loosening. I used it once and have been trying to give it away and nobody wants it.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PURCHASE...!!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and shipping</li>
    <li> Curls came out beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I had great expectations for this curling iron. I&#x27;ve own many hair tools but this one just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I love the pink pearl but that&#x27;s about it. It might work well for shorter hair. But if you have long hair, do not buy! The wand is too skinny to fit all of your hair. Even if you spit it into two parts, top and bottom, the wand is tapered and it wouldn&#x27;t look right. So my longer hair gals out there, I recommend a larger curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have tried every type of spray, gel, and mousse out there to try to get my thin, straight hair to curl. This curling wand is the only thing that has ever worked on my thin hair. Easy to use with a little practice. Curls last throughout the day with minimal touch ups. Even turn into nice waves the next day after sleeping on them. The rubber tip is nice to protect your ears/neck from the hot wand.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron that heats up immediately -- I just wish there were more sizes :/</li>
    <li> Met all my expectatives when it comes to an curling wand. Heats quickly, hair doesnt get tangled on the wand and you are done with curling your hair before you even know it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling wand on account that my 3rd one was broken AGAIN! I found this one online and fell in love with the price but I didn&#x27;t think it would be as good as my brand name one. I got it and found out it works even better and has lasted a lot longer than my others. It heats up quickly which is great on those busy mornings. I use it everyday and love the way it makes my hair look. I have never used the glove that it came with because it would a) make it harder to curl my hair, and b) if you&#x27;re experienced with one enough you shouldn&#x27;t burn yourself. Even for beginners this is a great product. I HIGHLY recomend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> Well I read all the good and bad reviews on this product and i nearly never bought it!!! Well i have to say....it is the bomb! i love the curls and it gives me different type of curls and waves</li>
    <li> My fault- but this thing doesn&#x27;t have a clamp, so literally you have to use your hand to hold your hair to the rod. Not ideal.</li>
    <li> I burned myself really bad with this product--and it barely touched me. A year later, I still have a scar that looks like a hickey on my neck.</li>
    <li> my 11 year old loved it!  She curls her straight hair when she wants to change hair style. No burns. No complaints.</li>
    <li> When my daughter and I want to spruce our hair up this is the tool we use.  Not hard to use at all, even my youngest daughter can use it.  Just follow the directions and you won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WAND! Not only is it affordable but you get the cutest curls/waves! The wand itself as a adorable pink ceramic coating and you get nice bouncy shiny curls! I highly recommend this wand! I also curled my two nieces hair (in the picture) and they love their curls/waves!</li>
    <li> This product came in right on time. I just love this curling wand! Right when you plug it in it was already heated up! Plus you can change the temperature to fit your liking. Over all it is a great product and leaves you with pretty bouncy curls that last for two days without hairspray! I highly recommend!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this wand very much. Except for a few burns here and there, it works well. The curls look sleek and tight. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Curls that LAST! (Without any additional holding products, in HOT North Carolina weather!) My hair is long, almost to the waist, and this tool handles it all!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome styling wand. I love that you can choose the heat setting based on temperature and it heats up amazingly fast. I get beautiful beachy waves that last. Although I will say, a good heat styling protectant spray before and a spritz of hairspray after definitely help to make the curls last longer. I also love the pink color. It stands out in the mess of black and silver curling irons I already have. I already have a straight wand and didn&#x27;t know if I would like the taper but it just gives the wave a different look. Considering buying the larger size too!</li>
    <li> Really like it so far</li>
    <li> This curling wand is awesome I get so many compliments on my hair!!</li>
    <li> Love love love it. Best styling tool I have. Gives u beautiful curls in the matter and minutes. Best thing that happen to my clients hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM. ONLY ONE I EVER HAD AND IT DOES WONDERS FOR MY HAIR. THE GLOVE GETS IN THE WAY SO I TOSSED IT IN THE TRASH.</li>
    <li> I bought this an as amateur trying to curl my hair. I think it is tough so I instead got some curlers from the same Remington brand. Basically if you can blow dry your own hair then this product would be easy to use. It comes with a burn resistant glove which is great however still be aware. I would recommend this to anyone who knows how to style hair but not a beginner.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my 15 year old niece last year, and she loves it! It took a little practice to use it well, but once she got the hang of it- she was curling her hair all the time, then mine! I loved the results so much I ordered one for myself- and it is great! It gives you an awesome, long lasting, curl that cannot be replicated with a standard curling iron. My hair is super straight, and the curls from this rod last for 2 days! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this wand. i had actually bought it for my one sister, but really, i bought it for myself to use. :-D i adore doing hair, so being able to get my hands on an affordable wand that works wonderfully was a done deal.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, very nice curls with long or short hair , but be careful it&#x27;s hot and burns bad !</li>
    <li> This product makes hair curling so much easier. It is good for sleek straight hair long hair like mine. It takes getting used to and it easier to do on other people than your own hair. The downfall to this is the tapered barrel (big to skinny). Instead of getting beautiful waves I got more curly shirly temple locks. I would opts for a barrel that is thick and the same size all around. Glad it came with a glove but the glove can be annoying at times too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand, one of my friends has a Chi Curling wand ($100) and she prefers my curling wand over hers. At first i thought it was terrible but then as soon as i got the hang of it i loved it. The curls come out perfect and hold to there shape really well, and i have super long hair. Definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She&#x27;s always wanting nice curls in her hair and a regular curling iron just doesn&#x27;t cut it. This wand is wonderful! Very easy to use and after hours of wear, she still has curls! No need for hairspray either. The glove is essential and I&#x27;m very glad it was included. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> We had been looking at wands for some time but your price was just to good for us to pass up!</li>
    <li> very great price it is so worth it. its comparable to the much more expensive ones. work very fast and leaves hair looking good. very hot so curls last all day with out hair spray</li>
    <li> Its taking me awhile to learn how to use it but so far i like it. I wish the glove was a little more protection though</li>
    <li> This thing makes crazy curls!  I only use for a few seconds and my hair holds the tight curls all day with virtually no product.  Works well with the handy heat glove and I will probably even buy the other size as well.</li>
    <li> Works really well, gets super hot &amp; make very Nice curls fast. I have very long hair so this makes the curls really really tight and small with the 1&amp;#34;. I wish I had gotten the 1 1/2 Inch to make the curls more wavy and bigger.</li>
    <li> I have super straight hair and have always had bad luck getting curls to stay for mire than 1 hour in the past, but this works great! I curled my hair yesterday, slept on it all night, and when I woke up I still had some waves. I was reluctant to order, but this is great!</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever. So easy and fast!</li>
    <li> I love this tool…. it is something to must have it!! You can create a very long of thin curls, up to you! Works very well..!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for some nice curls this is the perfect curling iron.  I am not too good at curling my hair and find this easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hard to hold a curl hair this wand did the trick not only did i get nice curls i got all day curls i love it</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this for close to a month now and she really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes rather small curls and it really works well. She looks so pretty, so I am posting a photo of what it can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Makes very nice curls&lt;br /&gt;  It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It gets very hot and if you aren&#x27;t careful you can burn yourself</li>
    <li> This curling wand is absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s quick and super easy.&lt;br /&gt;I get so many compliments on my hair and I love the fact that the curls last all day without any hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs WAY up!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well. It curls the hair with a lot of power and it seems it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> recieved this wand as a gift for an order mistake. but it heats up fast and makes the cutest curls!</li>
    <li> Having fine hair it is very hard for my hair to hold curls. This product creates perfect curls in no time!  No need for a ton of damaging hair spray or product. It takes about 20 minutes to do my whole head and not even on the highest setting. With just a spritz of finishing spray I&#x27;ve got gorgeous soft curls all day. Be very careful with this product for it is much hotter than a normal curling iron. Thanks to a clumsy cat I have a second degree burn on my hand. Not the products fault, I still love and use it, just use caution.</li>
    <li> the only reason I gave it three is because there was no glove like it said there was.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is by far the best wand ive ever used heats up really fast and gives perfect curls</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking a little while to get used to but feel a bit better every time I use it.. ALWAYS wear glove because the curling iron gets very hot. My rating would go up after I get more used to using it.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. Good quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;More difficult to use on shoulder length hair. If you have shorter hair i would recommend a smaller wand.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the wand as it left my hair in uneven curls. I would recommend this brand but in the regular wand tool.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair is super difficult to curl and will not hold a curl at all even with lots of product in it. This curling wand does the trick. Curls all day long in her hair without added product. The wand does get very hot so I highly recommend using the included glove. I thought I would need to spend a lot more on a wand that works but this does the trick!</li>
    <li> Big burn on my neck. No security it all. Comes with a glove, and I use it, but should come with a scarf and a MASK! I hate it.</li>
    <li> This iron gave me great curls, but at great expense! The glove is great for when I use my straightener, but pretty ineffective for when your fingers accidentally brush this curling iron. This iron gets SUPER hot, VERY fast (which is good and bad, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this curling iron, but I also recommend using a high-quality moisturizer (or oil) to re-hydrate your hair later and buying industrial gloves at your nearest hardware store.</li>
    <li> I charm my hair is hard to curl and I did not last long. but with this iron to me makes life easier.</li>
    <li> Very good for making smaller curls! If you want wavier curls then get the bigger wand.</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;ve had this for almost 2 years now and it still works good so I decided to finally write a review about it . This curling wand is everything , it&#x27;s easy to use and the curls are beautiful  and it&#x27;s fast . No more going to the salon and paying $50 and up for some curls that&#x27;s only going to last for a day . But with my curling wand I saved money</li>
    <li> Give beautiful curls I love it and it heats up really quickly I also love how it came with a glove even though it felt more like a winter glove than a heat resistant glove</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my wand. I&#x27;ve had it for sometime now and would not survive without it. It makes my life so much easier. This is an incredible product. It heats up quickly, allows for different types of curls and is such a reasonable price. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works very well! Better than I could have expected.</li>
    <li> It can heat even faster than I thought! Nice looking with great quality. Btw, the glove is not good at heat-protection.</li>
    <li> me super mega encatoooooo!!!</li>
    <li> I thought my curls would be too tight with the 1&amp;#34;-1 1/2&amp;#34; but once I combed my hair out it was the perfect loose curl I was looking for. I have medium to thick hair and it retains my curls up to the next day! I&#x27;ve never had a successful curling experience until I used the Remington Wand- It&#x27;s so easy to use now I curl my hair every (other) day.</li>
    <li> The reviews I read made it seem like this would work for EVERYONE.  Unfortunately, I tried and tried and did not get the results I hoped for.</li>
    <li> This is No so good like i believed!&lt;br /&gt;buy other one!</li>
    <li> Works great, gives even long thick hair really nice curls that last.</li>
    <li> This works really great for waves, and they last a long time. I wore the glove when I was starting off, and then stopped once I got comfortable using the product. I wish there was a way to get the ringlet curls from this though.</li>
    <li> curls did not hold at all ....</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair and I&#x27;ve never been able to get curls to hold.  This holds for days without even using hairspray.  If you haven&#x27;t used a curling wand, there is definitely a learning curve.  Just watch some YouTube videos and be patient.  It&#x27;s nice that they include a glove, but I found it to get in the way.</li>
    <li> Got the 1 1/2 works great heats up in seconds perfect curls if u want tight curls less hair and for loose curls bigger section i got curls in less then 12 secound but i do have thin hair. i never write reviews but i was very satisfied with my purchase i wanted to share my pros n cons looks exactly as in the photo heats up too 410° the cords moves 360 degrees so u dont have too deal with those annoying cords getting in the way came with the heat protective glove i have very tinny hands the glove fit but the glove is thin u can burn ur self if u leave ur fingers on the wand for too long but other than that its pretty great !fast shipping too!😊</li>
    <li> Let me first stop off by saying that I have very thin fine long hair. I never curled my hair because in less than an hour the curls will fall out and look so dead. I just got my hair colored and my stylist tried to put it in rollers and then use curling iron so that the curls stay in. Of course...the curls fell out soon enough. Just received this iron today and tried it out. MOST AMAZING THING EVER. I WAS LITERALLY IN AWE AND I&#x27;M in SHOCK!! my curls are nice and wavy and its staying put so well. I&#x27;m so happy with my first curling iron ever and highly highly recommend it to anyone with very fine hair. I&#x27;m just too happy right now :)</li>
    <li> Really nice. Heats fast and shuts off when you&#x27;re not using it for a while so this is good (for me atleast) because I often forget to unplug or turn off my curling irons.</li>
    <li> Excellent. My daughter is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Product works exactly as described. Great value for the money. I would buy this iron again. I like the long length of the cord.</li>
    <li> It ended up being smaller than I wanted. I thought it was bigger. But it&#x27;s pretty consistent and works really well. The only flaw is its really slippery, my hair slides off of it all the time.</li>
    <li> This wand heats up so fast and works quickly. I have the straightest hair in the world, and my curls are usually flat in a matter of hours, but with this wand my curls will last 2 days if I let them. Great purchase... especially for the price! Very affordable, quality curling wand!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that usue to take forever to curl and the curls would fall within the first hour so it was never worth it. This thing takes two seconds and I have a perfect curl that lasts longer than all day. Officially obsessed with it. My new main tool!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron for my fianc&amp;eacute; and she loves it. It easily puts nice curls that last all day long in her hair. This curling iron makes her hair look great.  :0</li>
    <li> Impossible to use! Practice may make perfect but who has time for that?!</li>
    <li> The best hair styler I have ever used! It took me awhile to figure it out and realize that the glove wasn&#x27;t best for me because it made my hair frizzy but the iron is perfect! Just have to be careful when using it! Love the curls that it creates.</li>
    <li> its great! easy to use..gets hot really fast and the curls last..Great value</li>
    <li> The Glove provided does not protect your hand. I used two gloves(on the same hand) and it still burned my fingers.  My hair is only shoulder length and I think this would work, on longer hair, hence the three star rating and not one.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a curling wand and to be quite honest with you, I prefer the wand over the curling iron any given day. It heats up very quickly and makes very cute curls. Make sure to grab thin or thick sections of hair, depending on what kind of curls you&#x27;d like! For any first timer out there with curling wands, for the price of this one you really, really have to get it :)</li>
    <li> This iron heats up quickly and holds the curl all day.  Also works well to add volume.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> My curls had to survive 8 hours of class before a wedding. I was shocked at how well they held. I only spent 15 min on my lunch break touching them up. The most I would ever get out of a regular curling iron would be a few hours. These curls held from 5am-10pm without any hair spray. I also have very long hair.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this item.  I have a little trouble curling my own hair but it gives me time to spend with my preteen daughter.</li>
    <li> Great buy. I haven&#x27;t been able to get beautiful curls with this size but i absolutely love my smaller one.</li>
    <li> I have never used this kind of curler before (I&#x27;m use to the clamp on it to hold my hair as I curl). I can tell you it only takes seconds to heat up which is good and it comes with a glove to hold your hair and wrap it around the curler. It makes pretty curls, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I got jealous of my friends&#x27; curly hair (typical) and wanted some curls of my own. Tried it out once, and I&#x27;m not very good at it... but the curler is really good. It did what it&#x27;s supposed to, and I know just by using it that I can control the appearance of the curls very easily by adjusting the temperature and what part of the curler I use.</li>
    <li> This product came to me on the exact date and also I had tracked this product which came in handy because I wasn&#x27;t at the house and they sent me a text letting me know my product arrived. All in all this product curls hair really nice and amazing I would recommend anyone to get it</li>
    <li> I love it. It gets hot quickly and curls really well. The only thing is the smell of when it gets hot.</li>
    <li> They get the job done with no problems</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. Ordered one for my sister &amp; bestfriend.</li>
    <li> i love this curling iron. its exactly what i wanted &amp; im glad you guys had it. thank you! now im just waiting on my shoes.. excited!</li>
    <li> Only tried a little bit, but I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of this. My hair looked  awful and I can usually use styling devices just fine. I think I&#x27;m going to use a curling iron instead.</li>
    <li> The product arrived timely; and performed as expected, according to the person for whom I purchased the product.  She is extremely excited to have the product.</li>
    <li> This product is good, definitely for the price. It heats up pretty fast. I like the heat adjustment options, allows you to set it as high or low as you need it. The glove definitely comes in handy.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron a lot... I use it for when I&#x27;m going out on the weekends... it does get super hot tho...</li>
    <li> i jus got my curling iron an i just curled my hair an the curls are to die for dis curling iron heats up so fast and it give u the perfect curl i love it i thibk it was a great purchase i recommend it for any person</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter knew exactly which one she wanted.  Her hair is quite long and with this curling wand she does her hair and it looks beautiful!  She picked it out, she&#x27;s happy with the results!!! That&#x27;s definitely good for me:)</li>
    <li> This is the perfect curling iron for my hair. I love it and use it whenever I need long lasting curls</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and unpacked it.However I used it after two months and the first time I plugged this in, the curler heated up extremely and then stopped working.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, it makes curls, but you really need patience and time. With practice, I&#x27;m sure I could get it down, but I just don&#x27;t have that kind of time. My hair is about 1.5-2 in past my shoulders, and it&#x27;s fine and somewhat thin, yet this didn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it does just as it promises, best easiest, long lasting locks. Now I know why is a bestseller in many internet places.</li>
    <li> All of the rave reviews about this product are true! I&#x27;ve had this wand for about six months and I&#x27;m so glad I was able to get a styling tool that works so well for such a good price! I could never work a curling iron, but it is so easy with the Remington wand... I&#x27;ve finally found the right tool to get my hair exactly the way I&#x27;ve always wanted! Right now I own the 1/2 inch wand, which is great for springy spirals with lots of volume, and I&#x27;m seriously considering getting the larger version for big, loose waves. You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this wand!! :)</li>
    <li> Worked great but I had difficulty with my short hair.  Ended up giving it to my daughter who has longer hair.  Works fine for her.</li>
    <li> I love this wand! It&#x27;s great for the price and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I have heard so many great things about this curling wand and decided to give it a try myself. It was my first time ever using a curling wand, but after I finished half of my hair I got the hang of it. Having naturally curly hair I was unsure if this was actually going to come out the way I wanted to, but it worked perfectly. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> It heats up and cools down quickly. It works perfectly on my daughter&#x27;s hair and the curl actually holds for a while. It was worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love it! The curls last a very long time about 3 days and they stay in place , u dont have to put hair spray or anything&lt;br /&gt;And the less hair u grab to curl to finer the curl is. I would deff buy again</li>
    <li> This comes with the glove so you don&#x27;t burn yourself. I did anyways. It was very awkward to use until I watched YouTube videos on how to use it. Now I curl like a pro. It takes a very long time to cool after you use it, about 3 hours. But it works great.</li>
    <li> This is a good curler for tight curls. Better than using the old school clamps one. This one is easier for me to use and makes pretty curls. I wish there was a way to hold the hair in place. If there was I would give it 5 stars. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this curler. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> It is just what I want! If you dont know how to use it there are many videos in youtube teaching how does it work</li>
    <li> have 3 teen daughters - and this thing is getting  a workout - they all have very thick and very curly hair - which tends to frizz - they used to have to straighten, then curl to get a less frizzy look - now just use this right on their curly hair - creates gorgeous spiral curls - as soon as they used it, asked for 2nd one!  we all really wish we had bought one a long time ago</li>
    <li> I already returned this item. First off, the box was opened and looked as if it was used. I have a larger heating wand and this specific wand took an extra long time to heat up. I was so disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> Its a good wand. Used in my hair &amp; curls lasted all day... haven&#x27;t burned myself yet and I dont use the glove so I guess thats a plus</li>
    <li> my daughter had to have this magic wand... this thing makes beautiful locks the price was very reasonable and i am glad that i purchased it for her</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever after being a prime member for over 3 years. This curling wand is that good! I have extremely thick and long hair that would only hold curl for a maximum of 15 minutes. I curled my hair with this wand last night at 4pm and slept on it and it still looks perfect this morning. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> ....but I do not like how my hair always slips from the bigger width to the smallest. I have really long hair and find it frustrating to wrap my hair around this short wand. Other than that it is awesome and gets very hot.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! Cheap but great! Very easy to use comes with a glove. You will love this product. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, very sturdy product... Worked great with my hair and my hair is difficult to curl and even harder to keep curls locked in. It was so easy to use especially with the included glove.</li>
    <li> I got this curling wand for my sister who&#x27;s in college. She loves it!!! And the price was better online (including the shipping).</li>
    <li> I had a curling iron similar to the Remington a few years ago that I had received as a gift. I loved the curls that it produced, but it broke only after a few months. I never replaced it because it was too expensive and I didn&#x27;t trust that it would last a long time. Throughout the next few years I used different curling irons that I had around the house, which did the job. I finally decided to invest in a new curler and discovered the Remington. At first I was skeptical because of how cheap it was, but was immediately impressed after my first try. The curls last the whole day (I have long thick hair) and turn into nice waves the next day. It&#x27;s pretty easy to use too, but the glove they supply helps protects your hand from burns. I am very happy with my product and finally found what I have been looking for!</li>
    <li> Clap clap clap clap clap! This stays true to its name. Who would have thunk that it actually curls my big, thick, crazy hair within seconds. No lie, it curled every lock of hair in seconds. I&#x27;m probably one of the biggest skeptics out there in the world, so for me to say that something actually works and is a great buy must mean that I&#x27;m absolutely telling the truth. Don&#x27;t buy it from whatever website. Buy it on amazon. It&#x27;s cheaper and is reliable. Have fun with it ladies! (And guys with long hair I suppose...)</li>
    <li> I really like this curler! It gets really hot so you have to be careful, but it&#x27;s easy to use and works like a charm :)</li>
    <li> it was ok, Just don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I just love my remington, it works well, and it came to me fast.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is awesome.  After watching a few youtube videos, it took me one practice session to get the hang of it.  It produces beautiful, tight curls that get you the classic Shirley Temple look. Each curl takes about 8-10 seconds on the wand.  Anything less, and the curl does not come out as well, so if you are looking for beach waves, I would get a larger size wand.  Even though this wand is cheap, the metal part is well built.  The plastic handle gets the job done, and it is easy to change the temperature and determine whether it was hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand comes with a heat-proof glove, which is essential.  It makes learning how to use the wand effortless and painless because if you accidentally touch the wand, you will get burned (it&#x27;s at 400 degrees!). With the glove, your hand is protected so you can figure out which angles work for you to get access to your entire head.  The glove also allows you to wrap your hair around the wand completely so that you aren&#x27;t leaving the tips of your hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great wand for a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this wand. Its super cheap for the results you get. I can go curly or wavy with this. Even though this is my first wand it was easy to get the hang of and produce the most perfect curls. And since it is my first wand i can&#x27;t really compare it to anything and i will never have a need to because i don&#x27;t know what a more expensive wand would do.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it!!</li>
    <li> I love my Remington !</li>
    <li> Takes a little to getting use to but once you get a hang of it ~ works miracles specially if you have stubborn straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it cuz I wanted to do a Beach Wave kind of look &amp; it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;without burning my hair - that is the best part.</li>
    <li> My hair is very straight and I can usually not get a curl to last at all, even with hairspray.  This iron works really well - it gives me a soft, bouncy curl - and it actually lasts for a while, or at least turns into waves.</li>
    <li> I have straight, heavy, flat, fine hair. For years and years, I always believed my hair could never hold a curl for more than an hour (and only if my hairdresser curled my hair and used a million products to make it stay). This curling wand completely changed that! I don&#x27;t know what it is....if it&#x27;s the iron itself or perhaps the combination of that and using hair product (I use a mousse on wet hair and spray a sea salt spray on dry hair after curling)....but my beach waves stay all day AND last the following day. I actually love the way it looks the second day. The curls are a little looser and softer looking and my hair has great body. The first time I ever used it was difficult. It definitely takes some getting used to (how in the world I get my arms to bend like that, I have no idea). The trick is to hold the barrel downward, and while using the safety glove, wrap the hair around for a few seconds. I like to leave the ends of my hair out so it looks more like a tousled beach wave rather than a ringlet. The best part is you can adjust the temperature. That is a must for me with any heat styling appliance. My hair is really fine so I hate to do more damage to it than I already do (highlights, blow dryer, etc). I leave mine on the 356 degree setting and it works perfectly.  After 2 or 3 uses, you get used to using it and I now curl my hair several times a week. I have a long bob cut just above my shoulders and I can do my whole head in under 30 min. I recommend this product to anyone who struggles to curl their hair or who wouldn&#x27;t consider themselves &amp;#34;good at styling hair.&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> Daughters use it every day.</li>
    <li> This iron is very difficult to use/handle and would take quite a bit of practice.  It gets hot and makes very spiral terrific curls - if you have good skills it is for you.  It comes with a glove to keep your hands from getting burnt, this just got in my way, I am unable to master this iron.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product for the price, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but it does come with a limited warranty. Its really easy and it comes with a heat resistant glove. It also came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Best curler ever! My 4-year-old daughter has shoulder-length hair and this was the first wand I have used (always irons before). It takes about half as much time and the curls stay even through a night of sleeping! No touch-ups needed even 4 hours later. This changes everything!</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these, one for my niece and kept one for myself. The want heats up quickly and the adjustable thermometer is really helpful.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great!  I am a beginner with the wand and have no problems using this at all.</li>
    <li> I had to send it back since it burned off my hair ... luckily only a small section, but enough for me to realize that even on the lowest setting it is not the right product for my fine hair... too bad! I would have loved it to work!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Very beginner friendly and affordable.</li>
    <li> My friend had this exact rod and I would borrow it all the time so when I found it on here I had to get it. It was exactly the one she had. It&#x27;s comes in great packaging and didn&#x27;t take long to ship to canada. It comes with glove so you don&#x27;t burn your hand while curling your hair which is reall useful because it can get up to really high heat. Definitely recommended if you are buying a rod.</li>
    <li> wonderful tool works great i am happy i bought it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get the hang of it. When I actually do manage to curl my hair it ends up being super tight curls that look... wrong... It heats up fast? It looks cool? It curls hair? I&#x27;m worried about burning a chunk of my hair off every time I plug it in, so that&#x27;s not so great.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is great!  It heats up very quickly and I can wrap my hair around it and create curls in 2-3 seconds (at 356 degrees) I appreciate the inclusion of the glove, but I stopped using it right away, just out of preference.  You can learn how to avoid burning your fingers pretty easily.  I would absolutely recommend!!</li>
    <li> This product gets too hot. Need thicker glove when I&#x27;m doing my hair.</li>
    <li> Gets very hot and curls my hair very fast. I get little curls with this one but they stay all day. I have naturally long straight hair that never holds a curl normally.</li>
    <li> This thing does wonders on my naturally thin, straight hair! I&#x27;m still practicing with the technique behind it but I would definitely suggest to other beginners like myself!</li>
    <li> My 17 yr old daughter loves this. It comes with a glove but she found that to be difficult to use, so she just got real good at not burning herself and doesn&#x27;t use the glove at all. Her sister got a different wand and uses the glove.</li>
    <li> Works well but makes extra tight curls because it&#x27;s so narrow</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair, and this wand worked fast and efficient. So happy about the results! Careful though, I burnt myself twice already.</li>
    <li> I love this product! it works well and was a great price. Perfect for beachy waves or tighter curls. I have very straight hair and when I use this product the curls stay all day.</li>
    <li> I have only used once but was very pleased with how easy it was and the beautiful curls that were created</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, but when it is short it goes a little crazy! I just got it cut short after a few years of growing it out and needed something to help me manage my hair so I didn&#x27;t look like a country singer from the 80&#x27;s. This does the trick! It takes 10-20 minutes to touch up my hair now. It did take me a few times to get it right, so you&#x27;ll want to practice before using it for anything important. The heat proof glove is great. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use one of these without one. This item is lighter than I expected it to be, but it doesn&#x27;t seem cheap. The ceramic coating is great.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; uses it often and it works well!</li>
    <li> This product work very well, the wand really heats up fast. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the wand was a little to big for me, but it is a good product (-:</li>
    <li> purchased for gift to niece she likes it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Good value for price;&lt;br /&gt; amazon assistance was great on this purchase and follow up!!!!!</li>
    <li> This wand is great! I have waist length hair, and this curls my hair so well that I can wear the curls for up to 3 days (just having to retouch a few of course). It&#x27;s nice that it has the little bit of plastic of the tip, so I you can grab it which you can&#x27;t do with a lot of the other wands. It feels so light and cheap and you would think it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it does!</li>
    <li> the wand its okay and easy to use I have a very thick hair and it curled my hair quick so far I like it, but the glove I think its a very poor quality the one I got its not the same one it shown..</li>
    <li> Love this! My curls are bouncy and it gives a great curl pattern. My curls last almost all day, but when they do drop, its still very graceful. I recommend :)</li>
    <li> I am thinking about returning this.  First, it feels cheap because it is so light.  I bought it because of the reviews and thought it was funny how someone wrote they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it.  Well after I put my foot in my mouth I found myself thinking &amp;#34;is that even considered a curl or is it a twist?&amp;#34;  I know how to use a curling iron like this but not sure why my hair looks like hell after.  I will give it another try before returning.&lt;br /&gt;And of course I will update.</li>
    <li> I have bought other Remington products before. I have a red curling wand, but it is shaped flatly. I did not like that. So I decided to come on Amazon to check out other products, I stumbled upon this. I did some research around the internet, and it had very high reviews so I listened to my gut and I bought it. Once it was received, it was perfect, the curls are perfect and there are presets for temperatures, highest being a little bit over 400 degrees.</li>
    <li> I was looking for item to use with an add-on. I asked my wife if she needed anything and she said a new curling iron. I made a major blunder by ordering this iron without showing it to her first. She hates it primarily because of the glove part. She prefers the clamp type. I told her that over 1100 reviews gave it 5 stars. She said she would try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short. She burned her finger and made a suggestion as to what I could do with this curling iron that she now hates with a purple passion. Being a good Samaritan can have its downfalls at times.</li>
    <li> I do not like this curling iron at all.  The inconvenience of having to glove the hand to keep from burning oneself is not something I care to do with each use.  If I had read the information before purchasing this, I would have left it on your shelf.</li>
    <li> The wands heats up really fast and is super simple to use. The glove also comes in handy when I want to get the curl all the way to the bottom of my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair does not hold a curl ever, but the reviews for this item were really promising. I got it a few days ago and the reviews were very accurate. It gets hot very fast, it curls my hair really fast, and my hair is holding the curl for a few days. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but my teenage daughter insisted this was something she wanted. It&#x27;s a curling iron without the clip? How amazing can this be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has stick straight, silky and fine hair that will not hold a curl. Period. There isn&#x27;t a curling iron made from tight to large barrel, spiral or otherwise that would put a lasting curl in her hair - until this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how or why but this allows her to have nice bouncy curls and waves that last all day. I highly recommend for creating tousled, wavy looks and anyone with curl-challenged hair.</li>
    <li> I wish I got the bigger size but it&#x27;s the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever have! It heats up fast and curls fast.</li>
    <li> I like that I&#x27;m able to change the temperature setting, but I can&#x27;t seem to get my hair or my weave to hold a curl on a setting lower than 400. I don&#x27;t like to put heat on my hair at such high temps. Also, no matter how neat and slow I did my hair, I could never get that clean wand curl look. It could be my technique, but this was something that I noticed. Also, they may as well leave that little hand glove out bc it does nothing to protect your fingers from the heat. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again bc I don&#x27;t like the effect of the tapered shape, but it served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. At first I was a little but skeptical about it but then when I got it and tried it out, I immediately loved it. I am African American and I always thought that my hair could never curl, but with this wand it can and I&#x27;m so glad that I bought it! It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> i love it! fastest way to curl your weave! it works well and i have had no issues whatsoever! i def advice you all to get this product!</li>
    <li> This is a really good curling item, heats up really fast and works really well, and the heat resistant glove is wonderful and works really well</li>
    <li> I love this wand. I had been using my friend&#x27;s wand for a while, and finally I decided to get one of my own. This is so cute, and it heats up really quickly! No problems with mine, and it comes with a warranty. Gives really nice curls. I used this to help do my hair for prom and it looked really nice :)</li>
    <li> Amazing! First and foremost, I have semi-fine hair. It&#x27;s naturally wavy/curly, but pretty unruly and lifeless. I can curl my head, starting at one side with a typical curling iron of various girth, and by the time I finish, the first side has gone flat, whether I use product or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this wand is life changing! I started today on my hair at 2pm with its natural texture (and a tiny bit of mousse), curled all of my hair into tight spiral curls (about forty minutes to do my entire head on the highest setting, and I have considerably long hair). I got to work an hour later, sprayed on some aqua net, and at 4am, my curls are STILL here! Albeit they aren&#x27;t prefect. But they&#x27;ve never held this long before. I would highly recommend this wand.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. You can curl your hair in about twenty minutes and I have really long hair. My curls stayed in for four days. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Is the 1/2&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34; just as good as the 1&amp;#34;-1 1/2&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> No problems with this wand yet! It curls so easily, just be sure not to burn yourself (or burn your hair off...[...] you don&#x27;t need to use the highest setting and definitely do not use on wet hair!)</li>
    <li> omg!!! I love this curling wand. makes my curls very bouncy. has multiple heat settings to match your wanted desire. Curls last very long.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! It includes a glove that is helpful but doesn&#x27;t grip the hair very well. I prefer using it without the glove, but the product itself is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this wand and the bonus glove is a nice touch. The temperature control allows me control the settings and my curls are beautiful.</li>
    <li> My daughters use this wand at least twice a week. They love it and the curls will last all day even with their straight hair</li>
    <li> The T Studio Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling by Remington is very good. Work perfectly for my hair, even in my short hair</li>
    <li> a must buy!!! very cheap and gives you 100%satisfaction!!variety ,quick and easy are the terms i can use for this product ...fastest shipping !!!</li>
    <li> Very in expensive !!! Easy to grip and control. The best curling iron(wand) I ever had. This is defiantly the go wand when your on a budget for hair maintenance.</li>
    <li> I have long natural wavy to curly hair. This little tool helps the waves that did not quite make it to a curl :P, The curls they make are beautiful and really hold.  I have several different size curling irons and hot rollers that will never be used again!  This is so easy and fast to use.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in love with this product.  It is easy to use and produces awesome results. Her hair is down to her rear end and her curls look beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m not really good with hair but this wand makes it so easy! And you don&#x27;t get that weird straight end you get when you use a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have both sizes of this curling wand and I LOVE them. The smaller size is best for shoulder length hair or shorter. It creates spirals that comb out into loose curls. The larger size works best on longer hair and creates very loose, beachy waves. Both wands heat up in 30 seconds and are very fast and easy to use - I don&#x27;t even need the heat glove. My hair is naturally wavy/curly but it also has some stubborn straight sections, so I often use these wands to touch up the straight areas and make everything more uniform. My hair holds curl really well, so I generally set the wand to a cooler temperature to reduce damage. (The photo I&#x27;m posting is my hair using the large barrel wand.)</li>
    <li> Pretty good in my opinion. It heats up quick and gets pretty hot. This wand is for tighter curls. The Bad: It moves around a lot when i try to set it down and I think it has to do with the swivel cord. The wand also pulled my hair - gets caught at the top.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up very quickly and creates amazing curls in my long thick hair. I use it on the lowest setting and I am happy with the immediate results and the staying power of the curl. When I first purchased it, I used the provided glove to protect my fingers from burns. I found the glove hindered my ability to feel when I reached the end of my hair, and it would slip and unravel before it was set. After I was comfortable with the iron, I took the glove off and found that if I was very carful and attentive, I could get a great curl, all the way to the end without burning my fingers. As a child of the 80&#x27;s I was very used to using the old style of curling iron that pinches your hair with a clip, and curls it flat. It took some trial and error to master this iron, but I have found that the curls it creates are more dynamic and 3 dimensional than the old style curling iron. If your good with new things and want the newer kind of curls, this iron will give them to you for a great price. If you cannot master new things, this iron may frustrate you, as you have to learn how to use it.  I got the 1/2 inch to 1 inch barrel and it is the perfect size for perfect curls.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this!! I had been looking for a good curling wand but didn&#x27;t know which to get. Many people told me to purchase this one and I&#x27;m so glad I did!! This has worked perfectly for me and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This curling wand does not get your hair to be super curly as I thought it would. I think it does not go hot enough....Probaly good if your hair would be a bit longer I would say maybe the curls would be better.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and love this curling wand. Was awkward at first getting used to the wand but you catch on quickly. I LOVE the fact that it has a temp control, especially since my hair is fine. It was a great price too!! My daughter has thick hair and wants one now too!!</li>
    <li> this curling wand is amazing! the way in goes smaller at the end bigger at the top gives you such a beautiful curl, and the price is awesome. no need for a $200 curling wand that does the same thing!!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I don&#x27;t need the glove it comes with, it&#x27;s thin and silly and just gets in the way. But the iron heats up super fast with a digital reader of the temp. Easy on/off and adjustments.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it is suppose to do, not for shoulder length hair though</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with my order. You shouldn&#x27;t be able to sell electrical items to countries that do not support the american electrical system!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to curling wands. The wand is exactly like the picture. It comes with a cotton glove to protect you from burning your hand...but make sure you read! It&#x27;s not meant to protect it from holding the wand directly for a long time. As far as my hair goes, it works well with longer sections in my hair than shorter sections. I recommend this product if you have long hair, and would like to experiment curling wands!</li>
    <li> It is very hot and it curls instantly. Very good. I like it so far. I burned my arms but other than that it works. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Price, GREAT! my daughter paid $80 for one but this one is not even $20. It work perfectly and the curls, they are great! great buy I made.</li>
    <li> I really like this curl wand... I use to think it was not for my hair (4a/4b)  But it proved me wrong.  I loved my curls.  Perfect curls every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift.  It&#x27;s unique, and functional, and I like it.  However, I was very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t include ANY sort of styling instructions.  A few styling options/illustrations/suggestions would have been welcome, especially as this is truly different from any other curling iron that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> i have thick naturally curly hair i use this one day 2 and day 3 curls to touch them up. very easy to use!!! gets hot fast.</li>
    <li> My first reaction when I saw this product was \\&quot;WTF is this?!\\&quot;. It looked ridiculous. The barrel isn&#x27;t even, and you need a put on a glove to style your hair. I came across this while looking for a new curling iron. I have very stubbornly straight hair, and it&#x27;s pretty long so I usually get hair caught in the clamp. The price of this was pretty cheap so I thought I&#x27;d try something new.    I purchased this one because it came with the glove, unlike the one from conair. What I love about this tool is that it is soooo fast! It has about a 30 second heat up, and then you&#x27;re good to go. Just grab some hair, wrap it around, and wait for 5 seconds and let go.     I have a lot, A LOT, of hair. When I curl my hair with a standard curling iron, it will take about 1 1/2 hours. When I go get my hair cut, it takes the stylist about 2 hours for a trim/layer. When I&#x27;m going out, sometimes I think about curling my hair but I usually end up not doing it just because I think of how much time and effort is takes. So, literally this is a game changer for me. I can be done curling my hair in about 5-10 minutes. I saved so much time! Doing my hair is no longer a hassle for me.</li>
    <li> When I use this, my curls be so flawless.... !! its honestly amazing it comes with a glove also which makes it even better.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great quality.</li>
    <li> Warms quickly, easy to use, and makes beautiful loose curls. A staple tool for gorgeous hair!</li>
    <li> I have a coarse hair that the clairsonic is take too much time to curl. The Remington is the best by far!! Its fast and super hot ( of course carefully)but finished quickly. The results I love it.</li>
    <li> WOW !!! It was my first time using the Curling Wand, I have long &amp; very very straight hair and this Curling Wand makes magic with my hair... It took me only 10-15 minutes to curl my hair!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product is good. The glove that comes with it is not heat resistant enough so i ended up not being able to use it properly.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling wand for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she was so happy when she opened up her present! She tried it out right away and was excited that it worked so well!! She has medium-longish straight hair and it only takes her about 10 minutes to do her curls and the curls come out great!! Even when she runs her hands through the curls, it doesn&#x27;t get ruined like her old curling iron does. This heats up so quickly, more quickly than her iron. She loves how it comes with a heat proof glove and that you get to pick what temperature you want it at! I highly recommend this curling wand!!!</li>
    <li> Works so fast and gives me great curls. Can&#x27;t beat this deal! I love this item so much I purchased another one in a different size.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for the wife. Her review &amp;#34;it was ok&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this and it didn&#x27;t work with my hair style... or it was operator error. Either way, after I tried using it my hair looked crazier than it did before. I ended up giving it to my sister, who loved it. She&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I love this wand. It is so great and easy to work with. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! No matter how long or type of hair you have the curls look flawless and does not take up that much time either. I have gone through a lot of curling iron wands and tubes and this one is by far the best I have used yet.</li>
    <li> i have waving hair but hard to curl. this is the first curling wand that has worked in my hair. i have long, pretty thick hair and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl without enough heat. this one works great in my hair and the curls lasted all day w this. its s great price too!</li>
    <li> works very well.... i honestly didnt think it will work so well for that price. i am happy with it</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, it makes more of waves vs full curls, but it works amazing. Heats quick and great results.</li>
    <li> Great wand if you&#x27;re looking for one that makes super tight curls. This will not give you loose beach waves due to the wand size.</li>
    <li> It is really easy to use and I love the curl!!</li>
    <li> Wands hair nicely. I&#x27;m a AA woman and my hair is fine to medium. So I decided to use it on my daughters hair that is more course. It came out beautifully. Make sure to use a heat protectant because you don&#x27;t want to smell like burnt hair. I wanded my daughters hair on the highest temperature, but next time I will use less heat. The glove does it&#x27;s job, it&#x27;s not meant for you to hold the barrel of the wand in your hand. It&#x27;s there to keep you from burning the tips of your fingers and maybe a portion of your hand</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and simply loved it! It heated up quickly, cooled quickly and was easy to use (read directions to use product appropriately!).  Unfortunately the wand just stopped working one day, I suppose to burned out? Not sure why, but was so disappointed when it happened! Hopefully I just received a lemon.  I am debating purchasing another.</li>
    <li> Everything about this curling iron is perfect. It was hard to learn how to use it at first and I did burn myself. I don&#x27;t anymore because I&#x27;ve gotten a lot better at it. I watched YouTube videos to learn how to use it. I could never find anything that curled my hair. My curls are always still in the next day. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> I have long, straight, silky hair that will not hold a curling.  When I curled my hair with this curling wand I had amazing hair for three days!  The first day it was crazy curly, the second day the curls were more loose, and the third day I had beautiful waves.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my hair in the mirror, it was so bouncy and full!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did have a bit of trouble with the tapered aspect of this wand.  I just couldn&#x27;t keep the hair from falling to the thinner part of the wand.  For that reason I returned this wand and bought one that is not tapered.  But that was operator error.  If you can master using this wand, you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/9/2014 Edit: I ended up purchasing this wand again.  I made a mistake returning it, the non-tapered wand I got created waves that barely lasted a few hours.  Not only that, but I had to hold each section of hair on the wand for longer, and the wand just never felt as hot.  And that wand was twice as expensive!  I quickly realized my mistake, sent that other wand back and purchased this one.  I just got it again, curled my hair last night, and I&#x27;m currently enjoying super bouncy, wonderful curls.  The taper will take a bit of time to master, but I&#x27;m already better and this is only my second time using it.</li>
    <li> The barrel on this product was too small and slick for me and my fine hair.  Just didn&#x27;t work out very well.  Then I cut my hair shorter and didn&#x27;t need it.  Gave it to my girlfriend and she thought it was great, but she has thick hair and the hair stayed on the iron.  So for me it made a difference on what type of hair you have.</li>
    <li> This is a badass curler!  My first curling wand...  I was deciding between this one and a 100 dollar one from Folica.  I decided to try this one through my prime account.  Works way better than I thought!  I&#x27;m still getting the hang of the technique but it will be perfect for a wedding I&#x27;m in this weekend.  I wish the heat protectant glove was a little thicker but other than that it&#x27;s awesome and the curls stay for days!!  Even in louisiana summer humidity!</li>
    <li> This curling wand is AMAZING! I have fine hair that never holds a curl. I got the 1&amp;#34;-1/2&amp;#34; and my hair was beautifully curled, held all day, it did loosen a little but was still curly by the end of the day, and after sleeping on it was still loosely curly the next day even after brushing! It does take a little getting used to, wrapping your hair while holding the end (and not letting it slip through your fingers and having to start over) but not hard enough that I would complain about it!! I would recommend this to everyone! And for the price, I&#x27;ll take it!!</li>
    <li> It curls and I guess that&#x27;s the object, however… Where the buttons are positioned, not so thrilled. I keep hitting the buttons while curling my hair. Either turning them up or down, and even off. The cord feels cheap and flimsy. But it does get HOT! I have the burns to prove that. So yes… use the glove it comes with. And if you scorch your hand or fingers… it is your fault. Don’t sue. Really, it gets SUPER HOT. For curling hard to curl hair that is a good thing, but you have been warned.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY WAND! It&#x27;s gives me beautiful tight curls or deep wavy curls. I am most DEFINYELY a HAPPY CUSTOMER!</li>
    <li> Too small maybe .5&amp;#34; bigger would be better but I didn&#x27;t like the curls created with this wand. Dissappointed :(</li>
    <li> Was sent to me with American plug that can&#x27;t be used in Ireland would have to buy plug now costing thirty euro not good service</li>
    <li> It takes a bit of practice to get used to using this iron, but once you do the curls come out really nice.</li>
    <li> This is very great! I&#x27;ll curl my hair and it looks voluminous! It heats up fast and it comes with a heat protecting glove that is very helpful. Also it curls my hair which is very hard to curl and they stay in for about a whole day!</li>
    <li> My hair has never held a curl before. On occasion, steam rollers have given my hair a little body for a few hours. This curl wand, heats up quickly, sets a curl quickly, and gives me a head full of beautiful curls in under 15 minutes. The curls not only last all day, but stay intact through sleeping, and give me perfect wavy body for second day styles. Completely in love with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It gives me super cute curls and is easy to use. I do struggle with the right side of my head a bit, but that&#x27;s just my uncoordinatedness. I do use the glove for parts I know I struggle with, but most of the time I&#x27;m fine without it. It heats up really fast and keeps the temperature.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and it gets very frustrating, tiresome &amp; slightly inconvenient to &#x27;have&#x27; to prep my hair every night before bedtime in hopes of a decent style for the next day without the risk or fear of struggling with my hair to get it to look right in case I don&#x27;t prep/twist it up at night for curls... this way I can be lazy and the curling wand achieves beautiful last minute curls and looks as though I just stepped straight out of a salon. I&#x27;m VERY happy I made this purchase &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kalesha B</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! I have very fine hair which is really hard to curl and this wand curled it like a dream. And it even stays overnight! Great product and arrived in 3 days!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that is does curl my hair very well, only thing is.... that glove does not help! its way thin and this product gets VERY hot... i just cant find a way to hold this correctly without feeling the heat and or burning myself...</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present for all four of my girls to share. I even used it a few times. It came in the original packaging. Perfect condition. I dont believe there&#x27;s a morning one of them isn&#x27;t using it. And the price! I got it cheaper then in the stores:) Definitely a great gift for teen girls.</li>
    <li> I should have used better judgement and common sense before purchasing this product. The positive reviewers suggestions to watch videos and practice using the iron to avoid burning fingers are terribly misleading. An incredibly thin knitted glove is included, but it is a complete failure in protecting your fingers from the extremely hot barrel. All the times I have tried using this iron, I burnt my fingers repeatedly and thought that I would need to have on thick oven mitts for adequate protection. I have given up on this product and returned to the clamp style curling iron I have used for several years.The pain is simply not worth the few sloppy curls that result from it&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> This is my first curler. I like to straighten or curl my lonnng hair now and then (like once a month!) so I&#x27;m not a big fan of these utensils but I have to say it&#x27;s very easy to use (even for beginners like me) and makes perfect &amp;#34;Taylor Swift&amp;#34; curls :)</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this gift!</li>
    <li> It does make your hair stay curled longer and it make the hair curled nicely the con is that the hair tends to slide off a little on the wand</li>
    <li> Works great. Came with glove to help not burn yourself, which is helpful. Speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Great wand easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for over a year now and it still works perfectly! I get tons of compliments at school and people even ask me which wand I have. I have thick hair and use it once a week usually, I would reccomend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter-in-law and she LOVES it!  She has very thick waist-length hair and uses this with ease to make her hair just gorgeous when going out.  She says it heats up fast and is so easy to use...finishes styling her hair in no time!</li>
    <li> Great! Took a little getting used to since I was used to my old curling iron, but now I love it!!!</li>
    <li> My teen ordered this and let me know she loves it.  The review is that the curls are smooth and easy, quick heatup and maneuvering with the end cord swivel..</li>
    <li> It is so good for me right now am enjoying every bit of it.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Heats up quickly and seems very sturdy</li>
    <li> light weight and gives really nice curls</li>
    <li> I really like this curling wand, especially for the value. It does the job, and gets very hot.</li>
    <li> Best hair curling product I&#x27;ve ever bought! I was a little skeptical at first because I can&#x27;t get curls to stay in my hair but I tried it and the curls stayed! I live in the south where it&#x27;s hot and humid and I spent ample amounts of time outside and my hair did not fall. This product is just amazing!!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. The curls stay for days (No lie. Holds for two days). The learning curve was easy, only a few burns. The glove that comes with the wand just seems awkward for me. I would buy this again. I&#x27;ve even had requests to borrow it. I feel like I got lucky finding this as my first curling wand.</li>
    <li> Love LOVE. Makes very nice curls!</li>
    <li> It gets hot really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the glove, though. It didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything, and just got in the way.&lt;br /&gt;The wand is pretty light compared to other ceramic wands.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice curling wand. It gets hot enough to curl my hard to curl hair. My daughter loves it too.</li>
    <li> What can i say,  It  was my first  time using  a  curing  wand  it  was great my curls  stay  how i wanted time  ;money well spent  got  great  proudct ,</li>
    <li> After owning this over a year, maybe even two, i still love it. Even tho it has like burn looking marks on it now still works wonders. And on all kinds of hairs. Especially extensions.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair. Ridiculously straight hair. The first time I got a perm (smallest rollers they made) my hair came out still perfectly straight. Curling irons, rollers, wraps, you name it, would temporarily curl my hair only to have it straight again in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I found a product that my hair will keep a curl with. A beautiful curl at that. At first I didn&#x27;t like it, actually gave it away to a friend, but that&#x27;s only because I didn&#x27;t know how to properly use it. After watching some YouTube videos I decided to buy another and give it a second try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I can now curl my hair as quickly as any other style. The curls even last until the next day, with a more relaxed look.</li>
    <li> Great curling wand! Heats up really fast. Wish they made a thicker one.</li>
    <li> Makes really nice curls</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this one</li>
    <li> I returned this item because it was useless to me.  I read the reviews that said it took some getting used to, but once you did, it worked great.  Maybe I couldn&#x27;t get a handle on it, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get used to it and it caused more frustration than anything.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She said she wanted one after trying it out a friends house. Found it on here for a good price. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this for our oldest daughter, who has been using this nearly every day, and her thick, long, healthy hair really has held a very nice curl where it wouldn&#x27;t before using regular clamp-style curling irons and hot rollers. A marcel-style iron does hold a curl in her often stubbornly straight hair pretty well, but she was not comfortable using those, so this has been a great alternative/addition to her hair styling collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The learning curve takes some practice, but after a few tries, she achieved beautiful, consistent results, curling her hair section by section. The included heat glove is an essential component to using this wand, in my opinion, and the cool tip helps aid in maneuvering the wand through the hair safely. The glove itself (and hand) will get hot if it is in contact with the wand for more than a very few seconds, but with proper use of the wand and glove, prolonged contact between the two is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tapered wand gets quite hot (heat adjustable from 270 degrees to 410 degrees) quickly and evenly with a wonderfully sleek surface that makes her curls look smooth and finished. The tapered end feature lends a \\&quot;naturally curly\\&quot; look to her normally straight hair, and what she and I love most about this is how very long her curls last--ALL DAY! Normally, within an hour or two, her curls from regular irons/hot rollers would droop and disappear, but not with this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the digital controls are easy to read/use and well-placed. The temperature lock feature is wonderful, which keeps one from accidentally turning it down or up during use. I have been extremely impressed with this curling wand/glove set, and will probably end up getting one of my own so I won&#x27;t have to borrow my daughter&#x27;s. I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s been the answer to helping our daughter put beautiful curls in her straight hair that LAST ALL DAY LONG!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. works great. The glove could be a little thicker but overall this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and gets very hot! Makes perfect curls although my 13 year old daughter lacks some coordination and has burned herself a couple of times. Better luck with the 16 year old. They love it.</li>
    <li> This Remington Hair Product was coming to Australia so why did it come with a USA style plug? I now have to pay an electrician to change the plug!</li>
    <li> super fast shipping, awesome product and i am very happy with it, i think everyone should buy a curling wand, makes it easy to curl hair.</li>
    <li> I have semi-thick VERY hard to curl hair and I was really questioning this product but it&#x27;s great !! My hair stays all day and I hardly ever use hair spray depending on the weather . It takes about 3 hours to curl my hair with a regular curling iron but with this one it takes about 45 minutes tops . It takes some practice but once you keep using it, you&#x27;ll get better at it and it will hardly take any time at all to curl your hair :) I highly recommend this product !!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter she loves it!!!  Easy to use, heats up quickly and the curls last all day long.</li>
    <li> great! it makes wonderful and natural waves in a really short time, perfect for my needs! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice wand get super hot. curls last for days, kinda dries out the hair a bit but I love the curls it gives you</li>
    <li> I got this looking for big nice curls. this thing has a learning curve to get the curls right without burning yourself. it makes my daughters hair night and bouncy.</li>
    <li> This is not something I use consistently.&lt;br /&gt;I normally go for no heat curls since I already use heat to keep my hair stretched, but I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not use to using a wand it will feel really weird at first. You have to figure out how to hold your hands and get the curls wrapped around, but once you get passed that part it is super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made beautiful curls. The lower you are you get small bouncy curls, and the higher you are you get bigger softer curls. It&#x27;s like a 2 in 1!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah..I also like that I can adjust the heat settings!</li>
    <li> fer très facile à utiliser.Les mouvements créés dans les cheveux tiennent très longtemps, même pour des cheveux très raides. A recommander.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 1/2 Inch - 1 Inch size, but my hair keeps slipping to the end when I wrap it around, which gives me poodle curls... I was looking for the bigger waves rather than to look like Shirley Temple (RIP). I ordered the larger size to be safe. Not the product&#x27;s fault, but buyer be ware and get the right size.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a 14 year old girl. She loves it and uses it daily. Works as described. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Okay product. It came with all three, the blow dryer does not dry your hair fast but it is okay.  I like the straightener but there is not a special to me.</li>
    <li> I like how I can control the heat,plus it curls my hair how I want it....Am glad I got this.</li>
    <li> This product came super fast and I am so happy with it! The price for the wand and the bonus glove is an excellent deal too. I have other remington brand heat tools so I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed; I love the heat level option so I don&#x27;t burn off my hair...my hair is slightly &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; by my scalp, with some natural loose curls and some waves and is thick but not coarse... but no one really needs to use the highest heat setting anyway because I use the second LOWEST setting and it actually holds all day and night - and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel scorching hot after removing it off the wand!; your hair won&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s being dried out and damaged and it gives a nice shine to the curls. You don&#x27;t even need hairspray because I made the mistake of using hairspray one day and it weighed it down...so don&#x27;t use hairspray - or at least don&#x27;t use it all over.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed. fast and easy</li>
    <li> My hair holds the curls nicely!</li>
    <li> easy to use, gets hot super fast so be carefull it burns pretty bad if it touches the skin.</li>
    <li> not good.. the power souce was not compatible with australian power outlets and the curler was flimsy and cheap !</li>
    <li> This curling iron is AWESOME.  I have silky, baby fine hair and never has anything put a curl in it CLOSE to what this iron does.  I use it on the lowest heat setting with no hairspray.  I can curl my entire head in less than 10 minutes.  After practicing a little, curling feels as easy and natural as twirling your hair around your fingers.  It creates natural looking, spiral curls that stay for DAYS -- yes, days! -- until I wash my hair!  It must be coated in some kind of unicorn dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware these curls are not like the regular curling iron curls, where you expect them to loosen through the day.  The way you wrap them on the barrel is the exact diameter they will stay until you wash your hair.  I bought the 1&amp;#34;-1/2&amp;#34;, imagining the curls would loosen.  They don&#x27;t.  The small barrel produces very tight spiral curls.  They would be good for certain vintage looks (if you brush through) or a very &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; look (maybe prom?) or if you just want very, very tight curls.  I&#x27;m keeping this ... but I&#x27;m also ordering the 1.5&amp;#34; - 1&amp;#34;, which I imagine will get 95% of my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate!!  This is one of the best hair purchases I&#x27;ve ever made!  My $200 flat iron now sits lonely in my closet because I can&#x27;t .. stop ... curling my hair for the first time in my life.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my granddaughter, she thinks it was a great gift.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron.  I decided to order one that doesn&#x27;t have a tapered barrell to add more body to the crown of my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand. My hair hardly ever holds a curl but with this wand I get beautiful curls/waves that last all day!</li>
    <li> This curling wand is awesome. I recently got a bad haircut that makes me look like a 1950&#x27;s housewife and I&#x27;m so happy I bought this because now i can make my hair look rock and roll awesome.</li>
    <li> My daughter swears this is the only curler that will curl her hard-to-curl hair.  Not only does it curl beautifully, but it stays in for hours. She highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love it. Heats up fast and curls last all day.</li>
    <li> This is a magical tool. I had never used a curling wand before I bought this but it was easy to use, the glove keeps me from burning myself when I accidentally graze the heating element. Gives me all day (even two day) curls in no time at all.</li>
    <li> I came to this website to review this product because I feel its my duty to tell you IT IS AMAZING! Just buy it already!</li>
    <li> I love it very easy to use. I actually bought my sister this for her birthday and, I loved it so much I had to have it for myself!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use the glove the first time and of course I kept burning myself!!  Then I used the glove the second time and it definitely protected my hand.  USE THE GLOVE.  This product seems to work well (heats quickly and efficiently) and the curl stayed all day when normally my hair falls flat but I believe my technique is the issue.  The curls just weren&#x27;t pretty...they were like tight and weird...not sure how to explain it but just not what I had expected or hoped for.  I noticed that because the barrel tapers my hair kept slipping to the smaller part of the barrel even though I was wrapping it around the larger part.  Again, this is probably because of my technique and overall the product is great.  I&#x27;ve since cut my hair short so I won&#x27;t be able to experiment with this for awhile.</li>
    <li> This curling iron gets really hot.  I don&#x27;t use it at its fullest heat.  I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to buy it. Now only time will tell if it last long enough!</li>
    <li> This is a good wand, one of the best I used and I was skeptical about ordering this because the price wasn&#x27;t very high, but I got this QUICK and it was very user friendly and even came with the glove which was nice, wand gets really hot. and has adjustable heat settings. I gave this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this wand! I plan on ordering the bigger wand soon, but this wand is wonderful especially for its price. My curls lasted more then 3 days when using this wand. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My girls wanted this iron :) It works great :) It does everything they wanted it to do :) Well Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I have thick straight  hair and my curls do not stay in my hair but with this wand it&#x27;s nice quick and easy I love it</li>
    <li> So cheap and just as great as the more expensive curling wands I&#x27;ve seen. The glove doesn&#x27;t provide 100% protection from heat, but you shouldn&#x27;t be holding your hair on the wand long enough to burn your hand anyway. If your hand is burning... um, your hair is probably suffering damage as well. My hair is thick and almost as long as my waist and I was still able to achieve waves up to the scalp. They look even better the next day. AND THE NEXT. Three days of curls! Huzzah!</li>
    <li> Great Wand Only Suggest Buying If You Know How To Wand Properly Though ,</li>
    <li> I was shopping around for a wand and I found this one at a super good deal. I love it, it doesnt burn my hair and both my friend and I use it. We have different hair and its a &amp;#34;magic wand&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> it made my hair the curliest its ever been!</li>
    <li> Works great, thanks!!</li>
    <li> Came with glovd and everything else works great I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a styling tool</li>
    <li> To do my curls never was so easy, and wjth the gloves I never get burned.  Easy, fast, gets hot super fast... it def get u out of trouble and give u a totally different looks in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> it is perfect. i love it. very easy to use and i strongly recommend any one to have it and enjoy</li>
    <li> I have fine Asian hair that doesn&#x27;t curl without a whole bunch of hairspray, and my hair still doesn&#x27;t stay that way.  I used this iron, and my hair has stayed curled for over 13+ hours without hairspray.  Absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> Really does the work and protects the hair from the heat. It is very easy to use although I am a beginner.</li>
    <li> Also if you have frizzy hair dont get this wont press your hair so you can get that nice even curl.  I find this iron very hard to use and for that it should be labeled as a professional curling iron.</li>
    <li> (Not using the Remington Iron) --&gt;  My hair is not thin, but not thick.. However it has never held curls. I&#x27;d used a curling iron for years and the only thing I used to get to stay were curled under short bangs with a lot of hairspray.  (Told ya I been using irons for years lol) A few weeks ago, I wanted to try curling my hair (its been such a job to do, that I don&#x27;t do it very often) to go out that night. I spent 2 hours trying to get my hair to curl, using product on each strand and then curling it and then spraying again, my hands were a big sticky mess with product from a high end salon that states its Not Sticky. (I&#x27;ve tried sprays, mousses, etc) Holding each strand I curled on the iron for 60 seconds at least! By the time I got all the way around my head, the other sides curls have come completely undone. I&#x27;ve been searching for something since, to try to get the long luscious curls that I&#x27;ve been wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Using the Remington Iron) --&gt; I got on youtube and started looking at how girls get the curls I been wanting. People seemed successful with this style of iron. So I went ahead and bought one from Target cause I didn&#x27;t want to wait to have it shipped, although, amazon and target  had the same price. It was evening time and I thought I&#x27;d just try to curl it to see how it did before I went to bed, and I started curling my hair (my hair is about 3 inches past my shoulders), without ANY product other than some Tressemee Heat Protectant spray, I started to wind my hair around the iron. I held it for 7 seconds, and let go. I had a bouncy tight curl!  This iron states that if you use a larger section you will have a looser curl, and smaller section will produce a tighter curl.  I&#x27;d never used a iron before without a clip. And let me just say that I find it WAY easier to hold the iron and wind my hair around it, rather than putting an iron around my hair, making sure the clamp holds my hair right so the end isn&#x27;t all jacked up, and then winding it up, etc. This thing, you just hold the iron, spin your hair around, hold a FEW seconds, let go, all is done!!! It&#x27;s so much quicker, it&#x27;s hotter than most other irons, no fussing with clamps, and it actually works. I continued going around in sections around the lower half of my hair, and the curls I made were still holding up, I really couldn&#x27;t believe it. I finished my entire head of hair, in about 30 minutes (my first time!) and all the curls held up, Even those small sections I did with tight curls, still tight. You can loosen them some if you run your hands thru it but they&#x27;re still holding the curl. When I finished I had this moment, remembering the girl spending hours doing my hair for my wedding day trying to get it to hold curl, and telling me, \\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s just not staying.\\&quot; (I ended up with VERY loose hardly noticeable waves at my wedding) I wasn&#x27;t surprised then, but now I&#x27;m thinking, where was this iron then!! Lol. So please know, that on the hardest to curl hair, this iron really does its job. The next morning, I got up to look in the mirror, and my hair was still very very curly. Just amazing. I know I will never go back to any other iron they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also those of you concerned with burning (as I was) this iron comes with a heat protectant glove. It&#x27;s not like a thick oven glove or anything, its like a satin type finish (so its not going to pull your hair with it on, you can run your fingers thru your hair with it). I thought it was nice the iron came with a protectant, especially for those who are so worried about TRYING this style of iron (as I was). But once I got going, I got quicker and I forgot I even had a glove to try. So I didn&#x27;t end up using it, so I can&#x27;t tell you how well it serves it purpose, but it does have a note with it in the box stating that you can&#x27;t hold the iron with it for a long time, as you will probably get burned. But if you just had it on there so if you bumped the iron it should save you from that burn.. This thing, you just hold the iron, spin your hair around, hold a FEW seconds, let go, all is done!!! It&#x27;s so much quicker, it&#x27;s hotter than most other irons, no fussing with clamps, and it actually works.

    <li> I just got this nd I love it...My hair is thick and is very hard to curl ,let alone keep a curl more than a few minutes..I have straight thick hair..Any ways I tried other curling irons over the years all well as rollers etc.And nothing ever worked :( ..I&#x27;ve always wanted to curl my hair.Especially since its waist length ..Well thanks to this Remington CI95AC/2 I can now do so..As soon as it arrived I tried it and my hair curled beautifully and keep the girls in for hours..When i woke this next morning my hair still had a little curl. :) This is the Best curler i ever used and love it...Remington has great heating tools ..I recommend them to everyone..Im very happy that i decided to purchase this..best decision i ever made as far as hair curlers ...Also dont let the low price fool u this is a great buy..you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once, but am already in love. This wand curls my hair fast and effectively even on the lowest temperature setting! I would definitely recommend to friends. Perfect hair tool for all seasons and events!</li>
    <li> I love my pretty pink wand and how beautiful it curls my hair but be careful it get&#x27;s really hot.</li>
    <li> Well it took me forever to figure out which one to buy, reading different reviews. I love this thing soooo much. I completely suck at curling hair SUCK and cannot for the life of me do a single curl with a curling iron without it looking terrible...and with this thing I can actually do my own hair and it looks amazing. I get so many compliments on my curls and holy attention from guys! Get this thing now.</li>
    <li> I initially ordered this fearing that I wouldn&#x27;t have much luck. I have thin, fine, shortish-medium hair. It is layered, and the longest layer is just brushing my shoulders, and the shortest layers are a little past my ears. I watched all the YouTube videos I could find on this wand (AskSash88 has the best one \\&quot;How to Get Taylor Swift curls\\&quot;) and prayed it would work with my short hair, otherwise I was just going to pack it away until my hair grows longer like I want. I have never been able to successfully curl my hair with a curling iron without clamp marks and it generally looking kinda crappy and taking forever. My hair regime for the past 10 years has been wash &amp; blow dry because I always screw up the simplest hair styles.     I got this wand today and practiced a bit. I did get a tiny bit burned a couple times because I found the glove hard to use when seperating my hair - since it is so fine, the strands get all stringy and it&#x27;s hair to section off -- someone with course hair would probably have better luck with the glove. However, the wand worked so well and my hair looks great! I had to wet it and start over after my initial experiment, but the second time I did it, it turned out so well.     You DO NOT need long hair to use this successfully. You just need to be more careful with shorter hair and go a little slower. It took me about 45 minutes to curl my whole head but it was my first time trying it and I&#x27;m not used to curling my own hair. I&#x27;m sure once my hair gets a little longer, and I get more practice, it will take no time at all. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I just received mine today, and I am IN LOVE. I just plugged it in, waited 45 secs, curled my hair around the barrel and... voila, a springy, bouncy, flawless curl appeared. However, I suggest checking out YouTube reviews to understand how to use this item; it gets REALLY hot, and it would be really easy to get burned. It is definitely different than a curling iron, because it has no clamp; please check out videos, and make an informed purchase.</li>
    <li> I love it can curl my hair nicely ...............................................  Love it love it love it love itttt I give it 5start</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. The iron gets extremely hot.it definitely takes a lot of practice to use this product correctly. Hair slides around on barrel a bit.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this for herself and she can&#x27;t stop using it. I even use it to make curls. They make the perfect curls</li>
    <li> I love it! Got the 1to 1/2 inch one and its fantastic!!!! It creates the perfect curls ever! And easy to use!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make tight curls; but it&#x27;s great for waves.  The heat setting is adjustable,&lt;br /&gt;which I like! Use the heat glove.</li>
    <li> This was brand new and worked very well..heats up very hot and long lasting curls to last an entire night.</li>
    <li> I love my Remington curling rod!!!!!! Hots quickly! Curls quickly! Curls lasts all day! Its my favourite curling iron, however, you have to be careful because it can burn you really bad. Wear the gloves, you got it for a reason!!! Item arrived on time and in good condition!</li>
    <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s so easy to use and the curls last a while. And at a great price!! Yay</li>
    <li> Its amazing curler as everyone said.. But u have to use it with a small group of hair or it will not curl perfectly</li>
    <li> Alright, so I am totally in love with my Remington curling wand. I learned about it from one of my favorite beauty bloggers and decided to order it. With my wand, I can easily achieve the amazing bombshell curls that are ALL THE RAGE right now. I also ordered one for my cousin and sent it to her for her b-day. Yes, it&#x27;s that serious. lol. Loving it :)</li>
    <li> Warms up quickly. Works great. It takes 15 minutes to have a full head if curls! The price is right too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect just what I needed thanks 👌👏 , shipping was fast 👌😁 and great communication :)</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE JUST LOVES IT. SHE HAS VERY VERY LONG HAIR. SHE IS VERY HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had boring straight black hair for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;For a while, I was seriously considering getting a crazy ombre or a balayage to compensate for all the years of having hair so average. I was planning to get one of those expensive NuMe wands but decided against it. I&#x27;m not exactly sure where I&#x27;ve got the recommendation for this curling wand from, but I saw all the rave reviews on Amazon and the price was amazing, so I decided to try it out! It changed my life...Okay, maybe that was a little bit dramatic but seriously though, this product made me feel so confident stepping out of my house every morning. I get tons of compliment on my hair all the time. People have asked me how long I spend curling my hair every morning and are always so surprised when I tell them it takes me just a little bit under 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it&#x27;s that easy to use. Sure, it does take a little bit getting used to at first (I even burned myself one, but it was my fault for not wearing the heat protecting glove) but eventually I think everyone will become a pro at this. I don&#x27;t curl my hair every morning since the curls does last for several days (yes...I&#x27;ve tested it out, and gross, I know). The wand is also very light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to a friend, and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I purchased my Remi wand from Walmart with some hesitation, as I am an AA female with course hair.  This product heats up extremely fast and is simple to use.  The highest temp can be turned to 450.  When I went to my hair salon to get a wash and style, my stylist said \\&quot;your curls look good\\&quot;!  I told her about the product and she was very impressed (and a little pissed since she paid $200.00 for her wand and the highest temp her wand can be turned to is 350).  I am a bargain shopper and this is definitely a great product and a steal at the price.  I love the this wand and will be trying some of their other products as a result.</li>
    <li> My hair has never ever been able to curl before. I have tried curling irons, straighteners and wanted to try this as well. It is super easy and super fast. and you get beautiful curls. even after I had slept on these curls, I still had beautiful waves. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Does a salon job for me. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought mine today and it is great. heats up in seconds and curls wonderfully. can not go wrong with this. the curls hold like nobody&#x27;s business. a must have in your home salon. i love it. i didnt want to put on the gloves and burnt my thumb with it. the heat distribution is so controlled that it didnt even scar my finger. amazing piece of technology. it did burn my sheet though, lol.</li>
    <li> I knew about it when i was checking a video about how to make the hair like Taylor Swift. That girl said this one is easy to use it and it can make you becoming wonderful. I found it in Target but i think in Amazon can be cheaper, so i bought it!!</li>
    <li> Initially, after you curl your entire hair, it appears super bouncy and curled, much like red head Annie&#x27;s. I think my curls look a whole lot better after it relaxes and for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> Got the 1/2 in-1 in barrel at a lower price on Ulta when there was a deal for $20! Reason I&#x27;m writing a review on Amazon is because I want people to know how amazing this curling wand is. I&#x27;ve never owned a curling iron or wand. This is very easy to use, and it comes with a glove which I found very helpful. It heats up very fast and the wand is very light. My curls stayed in tact without hairspray which is a miracle because I&#x27;ve never been able to get my hair to stay (I have very slippery, thick asian hair, so even hairstylists have a hard time styling it and curling it and making it stay). The curls lasted 24 hours with sleep! You can make very tight curls with this wand or loose waves depending on how you wrap your hair around the barrel. If the curls are too tight, you can always loosen it by running your fingers through your hair for a little bit. Or just get the bigger barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is great because there is no weird crimp at the end of your hair like you get from a standard curler (from the clamp). This product gets hot super fast so its perfect for those of you who are in a rush to do things. Besides getting hot fast, it gets extremely hot which give you a great curl. You can curl a lot of hair at once to get beachy waves or very little hair to get really tight curls. This curler will be the last kind I ever buy. I have no complaints with it what so ever!</li>
    <li> I got this from using a gift card gor x-mas an now thinking i might have wasted my money on it... it&#x27;s good quality but gets Very hot i have fine wavy shoulder length hair and it fried my hair on the lowest setting and i burt my ear :( My hair has alot of layers starting only about 3 inches long going down and i found it extreamly hard to curl with this... my hair looks horrible now i tried for about 20 minutes and gave up and put my hair up cuz didn&#x27;t wanna c it anymore i only got one good curl and i am Extreamly disappointed with how my hair looks now..Maybe i&#x27;ll try agen another time....Maybe  P.S. i suggest to be Very Very carefull it gets Hotter than u&#x27;d think and quick...my fingers hurt from barely holding my hair on the wand (through the glove)</li>
    <li> Before I bought this wand, I used my 1 inch curling iron (w/the clamp) to try and get the perfect waves, but they wouldn&#x27;t last long. The first time I used the wand, my curls lasted for two days, but they were too tight.    Pros:    - Heats quickly   - Protective glove  Cons:   - Wand circumference: I would have preferred the wand to be entirely 1 inch. Instead, it decreases in size, which makes way tighter curls than I wanted. I thought they would relax throughout the day, but they didn&#x27;t.    - Wand surface:  The pink wand part is also very smooth, which makes it hard to try and hold hair in the 1 inch portion. I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to not slide down to the smaller part of the barrel.   If you want loose beachlike waves, I suggest getting a wand that is entirely at least 1 inch circumference instead of this one. I ended up reverting back to my old 1.5 inch curling iron and just wrapping my hair around it&#x27;s barrel to get the look I desired.</li>
    <li> Great product. On time shipping. Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked. My daughter has long thick hair and is really hard to curl. We used this product to curl her hair for a special occasion. It curled really well and the curls did not fall right out like with other curling irons. There is a bit of a learning curve but once we got the hang of it, it worked great. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the glove, which you really do need, does not protect against the hot rod very well. I will be looking for a better glove. It was well worth the price I paid and we will be using it alot in the future.</li>
    <li> I have long and thick Asian hair. I always had a perception that my hair couldn&#x27;t be curled due to an unpleasant experience in the past. But after using this curling wand, I proved myself wrong! Yes, if you are looking for a curling wand at such a budgeted price which gives excellent results then this is it for you! I read many reviews saying this wand is too slippery for hair or it burnt their hair.. Well as a beginner I kept the temperature constant at 350 because I didn&#x27;t want to take the risk of using it at the highest temp. and it made perfect bouncy curls! I am extremely happy with this product. Another + is that it has dual voltage so all you travelers don&#x27;t have to worry about the voltage conversion. Over all I am truly impressed by its performance and I highly encourage you to purchase this. :))</li>
    <li> This curling wand is wonderful! My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin and straight and never takes a curl with other hot tools we have tried... I had her long hair curled in a few minutes, and the waves stayed in her hair for two days! I am still learning how to use it most effectively, but I was able to get her hair done nicely on the first try. The adjustable temp is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. It works with all textures of hair and the multiple heat settings are great depending on on you hair texture. The four is 360 degrees so you can hold or curl at any side of your head with less restriction that a &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; wire curler. One thing about this set that can be improved on is the glove, its simply thin and expect to burn your hand when using it. If you careful and make sure to place your hand at the black knob at the end of the wand when curling, then you wont have an issue.  I am also going to order the larger sized wand for larger &amp;#34;kim k&amp;#34; curls. This is a must have staple in your hair styling kit!!!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand it very good i just put it up to 410 degrees wrap my hair around and hold it for a good 10 seconds and it gives me a beautiful curl. It worth 21.99</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it often but it does work wonders for my hair since it is thicker and the curls last forever, I usually have to use my straightener to get them out!</li>
    <li> My hair is flat and thin, curls never stay in, BUT now with this curler  it stays in 2 days, AMAZING, I have tried hundreds of curling products and none work as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and quick! Takes a second to get the hang of but so worth the $ &#x3D;] loooooove it</li>
    <li> It works great for smaller curls. If you want a large curl or going for a wavy look this is not the right iron.</li>
    <li> Hard to get the hair to wrap around this without the clip to hold hair in. And ouch, even with the glove my fingers were getting burned trying to wrap to wrap the hair around the wand.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I always have a difficult time curling my hair, but this culling wand is AMAZING. I bought it because I saw all the great reviews, and I&#x27;ve tried different curling irons but i didn&#x27;t like them. However, this product is different I wished I had bought it before. It is easy to use and I love the way it curls my hair. The first time I curled my hair it took me 10-15 minutes, and it&#x27;s pretty long hair. I didn&#x27;t know how to use it at first but I saw a tutorial on YouTube and that was enough; it is actually really easy.</li>
    <li> Hard to get the hair to wrap around this without the clip to hold hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve curled my hair for years. I was hesitant to buy this product because it was so cheap, but there were so many good reviews so I gave it a try. While it heats up well, the style of the barrel is awful for variation of curl. It curls hair super tight making you look like Shirley Temple and due to the slipperiness of the barrel and design, that&#x27;s your only option of curl. I like curling my hair into loose beach waves, but it&#x27;s impossible with this curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning this and buying a a different curling rod.</li>
    <li> A glove comes with this item, but it&#x27;s very hard to hold your hair on the rod. I ended up burning myself.</li>
    <li> my curling iron came so fast, and I love it so much. it curls so good and it also comes with a heat protectant glove</li>
    <li> AFTER BUYING THIS FOR MY WIFE I CAN SAY THAT SHE LOVES IT. SHE WOULD ALWAYS BE SAD BECAUSE SHE COULD NEVER GET CURLS BUT AFTER THIS PRODUCT HER HAIR IS CURL CITY.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, because I&#x27;ve only had it a few months, but it seems like a very good styling tool. It takes some getting used to, I&#x27;m stubborn and won&#x27;t wear the glove that comes with it so I&#x27;ve suffered from minor burns several times already. My recommendation for someone looking to buy a tool like this is to buy one that is skinny on the bottom and fat on the end. My hairdresser uses a wand like that and it is much easier to use because the hair doesn&#x27;t slip off as easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this wand almost 4 years ago, use it at least 3 times a week, and it still works perfectly every time. I can&#x27;t believe how much use I&#x27;ve gotten out of this product. I&#x27;m thinking of buying one just as a backup, in case anything ever happens to mine. It is super easy to use and I recommend it to anyone who compliments my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that i can make a curly que or waves. But it is hard especially with short hair. Overall, It keeps the curls in for hours, and usually my hair can&#x27;t hold em&#x27; for more than twenty mintues before going flat! Recommend it over the you-curl</li>
    <li> Want the perfect curls/waves? Look no further!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;- Curling my hair with the straightener &amp;#62; FAIL I, sadly lack my hairdresser&#x27;s ability :(&lt;br /&gt;- Inifiniti pro&#x27;s useless, slow and expensive curling machine &amp;#62; TRIPLE FAIL&lt;br /&gt;- And finally this curling stick &amp;#62; SUCCESS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think it twice, this is a great product; it&#x27;s inexpensive, it allows you to comb your hair pretty quick, you can do tiny curls and/or lose waves, you can put thick or thin hair strands on the stick (up to you!), you can manipulate the temperature just as you want, it&#x27;s perfect for long, short, thick, thin, ANY hair!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this hair curling stick and would repurchase. I get compliments on my hair after using it and actually 2 of my friends bought it after checking out the wonders you can do with it</li>
    <li> This is one great curler. I bought one for my friend and she loved it! Thanks:)</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago,  but have only used it three times since.  By the second time,  it already wasn&#x27;t working,  and I had to play around and twist the connection cord at the base before the wand would turn on for a second (indicated by the ON light).  By the third time I tried using it (right before a wedding) ,  it wouldn&#x27;t turn on altogether... Completely wasted the money.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful, even thought I felth rather cheap when I held it, it got the job done and gave me amazing curls that lasted!</li>
    <li> Came in great condition and arrived very quickly. Within seconds it was too hot for me to touch so it heats up VERY quickly. Great purchase</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s 110V and the heat protective glove it&#x27;s fake. But, I love this product it&#x27;s really amazing. Thanks a lot. Absolutely, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I rarely write product reviews but I felt I had to for this curling wand.  I used it for the first time yesterday.  I&#x27;ve used curling irons in the past with less then stellar results.  I&#x27;m so impressed with this curling wand!  I was skeptical it would work as well as it does.  It&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to use although it does take a little getting used to.  I used it on the lowest setting &amp; it quickly made nice flowy waves in my mid-length hair.  The waves stayed all day but not only that they were still in my hair when I woke up this morning.  That never happened with any curling iron I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I&#x27;m so happy I decided to purchase this particular wand.  Well done Remington!</li>
    <li> Great curls but very hot! I have had to remind my girls over and over again to use the glove it came with, rod is very hot.</li>
    <li> Love my Curling Rod!  Works great - easy to use.  Watched a you tube video for a tutorial, and after that, was simple to use for the results I wanted.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time now. If you&#x27;ve never used a clipless curling iron, I&#x27;d recommend watching a tutorial on youtube or something like that as the technique is a little different. I use the heat protecting glove and haven&#x27;t  burned myself yet. My hair has never held curls, and these hold all day and night with very minimal product.</li>
    <li> Love it, it is so easy to use and curls hair very fast. Highly recommend it. The seller shipped very fast AA++</li>
    <li> It does the job but it has the appearance and feel of a cheap product. It made me wonder if it was a fake Remington.</li>
    <li> it is very good it makes our hair curly and it is very hot you can shape it any shape you want</li>
    <li> It needs a clamp to hold the hair as you curl it!  I was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t notice this.</li>
    <li> EVERY salon should have this. It&#x27;s a professional&#x27;s tool made affordable for people to tangle with their tangles, something good to use as they start making their hair prettier.</li>
    <li> this works like a charm! you don&#x27;t even have to leave it in your hari for 10 secs &amp; the curls come out perfect! I really love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> ...It&#x27;s amazing! This was my very first time curling my hair (with any product) and it was simple and easier than I ever thought curling hair would be. This thing heats up in a matter of seconds and does the job so quickly. I don&#x27;t think it even took me 15 minutes to curl all of my hair. I have fine hair but the Remington Curling Wand did a perfect job! I got the perfect cute curls I wanted in seconds and it also gave my hair the bounce and volume I&#x27;ve always dreamed about. This was such a great buy!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS THING , DOES ITS MAJIC AS A WAND IT IS!</li>
    <li> This is a great curling wand. It&#x27;s light weight but curls hair effortlessly. I would recommend this want. Remington is a solid brand.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than i thought it would! I cant wait to try it out! Looks great and was a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product, heats up fast and love that it comes with heat glove to wear.  Will definitely recommend to anyone who is debating in purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift. Can&#x27;t really review but no complaints at this time.</li>
    <li> This worked better than I expected. I like it for how quick i can get my hair done if I don&#x27;t have the time for a roller or curling iron set. An the curl last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this wand it heats up quickly and curls my hair really well</li>
    <li> The curling iron works pretty well for getting curls to hold and it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.  There&#x27;s one major flaw though:  the curls are way too tight.  I looked like Shirley Temple, and not in a good way.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to curl a young girl&#x27;s hair then this would be perfect.  For adults it probably won&#x27;t give you the look you&#x27;re going for.  I&#x27;d go for a bigger barrel next time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It works so great and it&#x27;s totally worth it. No matter if you have short hair or long hair, it works great.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT ..BEST CURLING IRON EVER SECOND TIME I BUY MY LAST ONE LASTED ALMOST 3 YEARS BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> This thang get hot lol , but is a great product heats up fast and easy to use i recommend it</li>
    <li> it is the best!i use it just about every day it works so good and it was worth the price</li>
    <li> i love it does what it says and nice curls if you dont know how to use it or want an idea of how it curls watch the youtube videos thats what i did before purchasing i just love love love it highly recommend ...</li>
    <li> I loved my wand. Its perfect. I use it for many occasions &amp; events. it wands my hair great &amp; it gets really hot. It came in great conditions and brand new for a really good price.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Have had over a year and no issues at all. Didn&#x27;t cone with the glove though.  I would not have used it anyway. I know how to wand without. Keeps my hair looking amazing.</li>
    <li> So hard to use on short hair.</li>
    <li> Received a product pretty quickly. I do not have much experience with that sort of products but so far I am enjoying this one. Handy, safe (glove provided) and certainly does the job!</li>
    <li> Great product, heats up very quickly and I am able to curl my hair pretty quickly. Very good product for this price.</li>
    <li> Nice curls.  Heats up fast.  Have to be careful where you place the wand.  Might damage some surfaces.  Please protect your surfaces.</li>
    <li> I took me a while to learn how to use it, but once you do learn, you love it.</li>
    <li> I am by no means a beauty expert or professional stylist. I&#x27;m almost 30 and have never been able to do my hair or get curls to stay and I looooove this thing. I watched a couple YouTube videos on how to use a wand and went to work. Every time you use it you get better at it and eventually you find what works best for you. I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it has made. I recommend testing out some heat sprays and other products to see what works best for your hair. I also love that it&#x27;s pink but I&#x27;m a girly girl. I highly reccomend it!</li>
    <li> (It has my husband&#x27;s name, but he doesn&#x27;t use it! ;-) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my all time favorite heat tool. It is very fast to heat up, it only takes a few seconds to get great waves, and a few extra for great curls. I use this several times a week! I have pretty long hair with some short layers and I never have issues with any of the lengths. It&#x27;s a great, wonderful tool! I think I used the heating glove once and have never needed it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Heats up quick, power button locks so you have to hold it down to turn it off (No accidental shut off), long cord, great results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the buttons are in an awkward place, so occasionally I hit the temp buttons when I&#x27;m in a hurry, as with most curling devices, the end of the plastic where the barrel starts has a teen crack that my hair sometimes catches in, but it is mostly remedied by a small learning curve</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever been able to curl my hair and not need hairspray for the curls to stay! The curls will even last for days! Its so quick to do too!</li>
    <li> This worked really well on both mine and my daughters straight fine hair that doesnt like to take curls very well. I love the wavy flow of the spirals. Heats up fast and stays hot! Do wear that glove and be careful though!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about buying this wand because it was inexpensive and in most cases you get what you pay for. In this case this is a great affordable product. I curled one side of my hair last night and woke up this morning and the curls looked even better. If you are unsure of how to use it go on you tube and there are several tutorials. I&#x27;m about to purchase the larger barrel so when I put my weave in I can get bigger curls!! This is a must buy ladies</li>
    <li> this si great for my medium length, thick hair. I curl it and with a little hair spray my curls stay in all day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t bother checking out YouTube videos or even read the instructions.  Its use is rather intuitive and damn it works fast!  Pretty curls than my curling iron--so much so that I donated that old thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. Her hair looks like she just came from the salon when she curls her hair with this iron.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is great - it allows you to make loose curls, tight curls, beachy waves, you name it. It really allows you to play with and experiment with different styles and is incredibly easy to use because of it&#x27;s clamp-less design. Definitely a recommended product for anyone looking for an &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; curling iron.  UPDATE: I ended up purchasing the larger sized barrel curling wand as well - so happy with both of these purchases!</li>
    <li> yes yes and yes! give you beautiful curl for your natural hair and for your weaves! kinda like a spiral  beach wave curl or something. hands down this little wand is amazing!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve used a hair wand and I&#x27;m happy I chose this product because it was so easy to use and portable. I would recommend watching Youtube tutorials on curling your hair before you try it so you will be more familiar, other than that this is a great deal for a great price!</li>
    <li> This tool is amazing to make cute curls. Despite it&#x27;s hard to use at first because you have to use the glove, it works amazingly. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand.  I have very long thick hair and this only takes me about 20 minutes to do my whole head. It comes with a glove which I don&#x27;t use (it makes my hair frizzy) So I just hold the very end of my hair towards the bottom and you can&#x27;t even tell.  I sray it a little after it&#x27;s all done and can even do it the night before and sleep on it.  It still looks great when I wake up, I just run my fingers through it! It was a great price and shipped fast. I&#x27;ve reccommended this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a neat tool, although I have to get used to using it so as to not burn my fingers. But the curls were very nice. I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair with a Tresemme heat protection product.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I have been doing my research for a long time before buying any curling wand, because if I&#x27;m gonna buy one, it has to keep the curl all day! This thing is a miracle. It heats and curls instantly (10 seconds), is easy to use, the perfect barrel size for accentuating my already naturally curly hair, and it lasts! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WAND CURL I USE IT EVERY DAY IT GETS HOT AND DOES MY CURLS NICELY.  / /</li>
    <li> Product works fine, it just came without a glove which we were expecting.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about this product working for me because I have very fine hair which usually doesn&#x27;t hold curl very much at all. After debating for a while I order it and I have used this several times and have been happy with it every time!  The curl stays all day with very little spray.  It was very easy to get the hang of, but the back of your head is really tricky and it took some time to complete my entire head.  I will say that in learning to use it, I did burn myself a few times, one good one for each time I used it.  I found the glove to be too bulky to use so just moved quickly with my fingers.  It has a quick heat up time and digital display.  It is somewhat easy to leave on, the button is hard to push and you have to hold it down to turn it off.  It is oddly very easy for you to turn it up just while curling your hair so watch out.  Overall I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice wand at a reasonable price.  Just watch out for some minor burns. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews and trusted them!! I&#x27;ve seen the works of top of the line curling wands and I must say, this one is right up there with them! It heats up fast, and gets the job done fast as well. I absolutely love it. The glove was an added bonus, and I recommend to use it until you get your own routine going b/c I did burn my fingertips the first couple of times I used it. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered my Remington Curling Wand with a few doubts because of all of the bad reviews I was reading. But I decided to listen to the good reviews and go ahead and buy it. It arrived in three days and I immediately tried it out. I LOVED it. The first time I used it, I burned my ear really badly and it actually started to peel and the skin was raw. So that wasn&#x27;t good. But that was only the first time I used it. Since then, I have used it probably twenty times and I haven&#x27;t burned myself since. I never use the glove anymore (I recommend using it for the first few times to see if you&#x27;ll need it) because I really don&#x27;t need it. But the curls are amazing. You can get perfect bouncy curls or waves depending on the way you hold it. I have medium thickness hair that is about to my chest and it is wavy and frizzy and mostly unmanageable. And whenever I curl my hair with anything else, the curls DO NOT stay. I used to curl my hair with those leave in curlers and wake up the next morning with magnificent curls. By the time lunch rolled around, the curls would be GONE. The same thing would happen if I used a regular curling wand. I bought the top of the line curling irons and nothing stuck in my hair or gave me such great curls. I honestly don&#x27;t know what it is with the Remington wand. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m sixteen, so I&#x27;m young, but I love it. I would recommend it to EVERYONE. Seriously. I adore it. I use it all the time and I haven&#x27;t burned myself since the first time and the curls are awesome. And the time is great. It takes me about 45 minutes to an hour straightening or curling my hair with curling irons, but it took me probably 20 to 25 minutes total curling my hair with this. I set it up to 410 degrees (the highest setting) and I wrap my hair around and hold it for about ten seconds and I have a curl that is beautiful and stays. DEFINITELY BUY THIS! It is AMAZING! I love it.</li>
    <li> It may very well be that I just don&#x27;t know how to use this type of curling iron, but I couldn&#x27;t do it. I bought this curling iron around Christmas time because I wanted to curl my hair for a holiday party - no luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several times to use it and either the curler doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair or (if I turn the heat up) it burns my hand right through the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also can&#x27;t figure out how to wrap my hair around the darn thing and have it stay tight enough, long enough to do anything. Maybe its because my hair is cut in layers? Or maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing (although I read the instructions and I understand the basics...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I will be sticking to my regular barrel curling iron unless someone can show me how to make this thing do what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about two weeks ago and it arrived within 3 days. I was very axcited to open it and as soon as I did I went straight to bathroom and tried it out. AMAZINGGG!!!! Is all I have to say. I have used the clip curling irons my whole life and as soon as I was finished with my hair using the wand I literally threw out all my old ones! The curls always came out so natural looking and stay in place all day with a very little amount of touching up, it did come with a glove to protect your fingers or hand from burning but it was very cheap and it&#x27;s not really needed if you take your time and not try to rush yourself. Also if you have never used one of these &#x27;wands&#x27; before, the first few times can be quite akward holding while using but you wont even realize next time. Goodluck!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying this product because I had never used a curling wand before (but I use a regular curling iron almost every day). However, the good reviews pushed me to buy the product. I wish I didn&#x27;t. While it does heat up very quickly, it leaves my hair totally fried, even on the lowest heat setting. On top of that, the curls never look natural or even decent looking. Instead, I look like a clown who&#x27;s gone through a car wash, disaster. I&#x27;ve also burned myself quite a few times using it, the glove doesn&#x27;t really help much and makes it harder to grip your hair. Like I said, I had never used a curling wand before, so I can chalk up a lot of my bad experience to that. This is just a warning to other people like me out there: if you&#x27;ve never used a curling wand, STAY AWAY.</li>
    <li> I love this. Works much better than I expected.</li>
    <li> love the curling wand. this would be my first curling wand. I would always have problem with curling my hair with other curling instruments, but this curling wand curls my hair easily and perfectly! must buy.</li>
    <li> my hair has never looked better</li>
    <li> This curling Wand is absolutley amazing! it is very light it weight and is soo very amazing!&lt;br /&gt;its pretty! everything you need in a curling wand, has different heat settings, becareful not to hold it too long it will tear your hair up!! lol i Have frizzy hair and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this curl wand.  I have extremely hard to curl hair.  It&#x27;s blonde and quite fine.  Either I find curling irons curl my hair but then falls out about an hour later or doesn&#x27;t curl at all.  I bought the hot tools one first, that wouldn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.  Then decided to try this one, and wow does it work!  I take the time to separate my hair, doing it in layers.  I also never curl first day washed hair, always wait until the second, it seems to work better.  The glove is great and I can even use a low heat setting and it STILL WORKS.  Nice feature is the heat-setting lock so that if your doing your hair and push buttons by accident it doesn&#x27;t change your heat setting.  I would recommend this one for ear length to medium length hair.  My SIL tried this and her hair is quite long (waist) and she said it would take her hours to do it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Excellent curls!</li>
    <li> This curling wand if fabulous. Works as well as the one selling in the mall for $175. Comes with a glove but I would recommend buying a second glove so you can easily work with both of your hands while holding the tips of your hair against the wand.</li>
    <li> I had a really hard time figuring out how to get nice curls with my wand when I first got it.  I was really sad because I was so excited about this curling wand and had heard great things about it, but I couldn&#x27;t get nice curls, just odd looking krinkles and my hair flipping out in every direction.  I looked up some videos on line of how to use curling wands on short hair and once I figured out the trick I LOVE this curling wand.  The trick I found that helped me was to hold the wand upside down (mean that the black handle part is above your head) and twist hair that way.  It created really nice waves and it heats up so fast that I did my whole head in like 10 minutes.  I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews that some people were frustrated with the frizzes that they got after wards and while I am battling my own frizz issues, I didn&#x27;t use any styling product so I&#x27;m thinkin that using a product will help me with that!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m reviewing this based on my girlfriend&#x27;s experience and using it since I can&#x27;t get her to sit down and write it. What I&#x27;m telling you is based on her experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device gets used about once a week usually whenever we go out to dinner or a party or any occasion where she wants to look a little nicer than normal. She is really beautiful and I love her straight hair but occasionally she wants that little style and this thing really does the trick. It only takes her a few seconds to use this thing. She heats about twirls around quickly and she has some curls or waves in herb typically straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times she used it she burned her hand. But after she got used to it she almost never does that anymore. There&#x27;s not a lot to say as it&#x27;s a very simple functioning device but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It heats up fast, it cools off fast and allows her to make quick changes whenever she wants to.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not really expecting anything but now I simply love my curling wand. It is easy to use and the heat resistance glove was an added bonus. When it would have normally taken me hours to get the curly look now it only takes me half the time and my curls can stay fresh looking for days. I&#x27;ve recommended this to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> The curling wand does absolutely everything the sellers claimed it would do. It does heat up in 30 seconds which is extremely helpful in the morning, the hottest temp is 410 degrees coolest temp is 265. I have fine hair damaged by hair dye in certain parts and it treats both my dyed and natural hair the same way. I have tried clamp curling irons which always fry up the ends of my hair causing more damage than what its worth. I have also used a flat iron to curl my hair, though it works better than the clamp curling iron it leaves my hair a frizzy mess. The curling wand not only keeps my hair smooth and shiny but the only damage it causes is to my hands. The wand does get very hot so its easy to burn fingers. The glove that comes with it fits like a winter mitten. My hands are unusually large so the fingers dont fit as well as i wanted but I&#x27;m used to that. The glove fits snugly around the hand, enough so that it doesnt fall off if your hand is hanging but its not sung enough to make it uncomfortable. There is a tag inside the glove that states \\&quot;Not heat resistant. Do not touch the barrel.\\&quot; The picture on the box the wand comes in has a woman holding her hair onto the the iron with the glove, I tried that and of course got burned. Using it defiantly takes practice but its well worth it. If you want a curing iron get this one. If you turn away from this item thinking that it&#x27;s too cheep and will break quickly then your&#x27;e going to miss out on a really good deal. Its so perfect for what i want. I love it! Get it!</li>
    <li> My curls turn out perfect each time. Curls comes out tight, no hair spray needed for me. I would definitely choose the bigger size over this for looser and larger curls, if you like tight curls this is for you. This curler heats up quick, no wait time, this item arrived fast, I also purchased two.</li>
    <li> My daughter does her hair every night before school the next morning and she says never had she had a Curl -er that did her hair so fast. She has a lot of hair. From 2 hours to thirty mins</li>
    <li> The iron is ok to use. It does get pretty hot but the thermal glove is not very effective at the highest temps.</li>
    <li> Curls good, just have a hard time curling it because it is very slippery on the hair.</li>
    <li> Great size curls for my mid length hair. Although it does not turn off when you hit the power button, you have to unplug it!</li>
    <li> Great product, quick mailing</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teenage daughter with super thick hair and she loves it. Gets really hot and comes with a glove and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to use this on my short hair as it is hard to curl when there is no clip to catch the hair and hold it in place. I haven&#x27;t given up yet and am still working on it. Probably need more practice!</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars because I&#x27;m a righty and the heat protecting gloves is for lefty&#x27;s but other then that its perfect</li>
    <li> I love it! Works great for the price !</li>
    <li> HAVE THIS FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS NOW AND STILL IN GREAT CONDITION</li>
    <li> this is the best to get your curls done.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my hair curling world. It was a very small learning curve, I burnt my finger the first time but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s like magic. I could not go back to a regular curler. The wand comes with a a glove but I find that counter productive. I can&#x27;t feel the hair I&#x27;m grabbing and it takes longer. All in all I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand and it is my very first one. The regular curling irons with clips never made sense to me and always left dents in my hair. With this one all you have to do it literally wrap your hair around the wand, hold it for ten seconds, and release. So easy! I definitely recommend the 1/2 to 1 inch wand. So happy with this product. It also arrived only 3 days after ordering it--certainly a plus!</li>
    <li> This size makes way too small of curls for my liking.</li>
    <li> Works Fabulous. Love this iron</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate the actual performance of this item because I didn&#x27;t get that far! My hair is sufficient in number, but baby-fine in texture and shoulder length. Maybe the fineness of my hair made it more difficult to use, I don&#x27;t know. I could not get my hair to wrap around this thing and stay. I do have experience curling my hair, because I use curling irons, regularly. I will definitely stick to the regular version and I returned this product. It is easy to return items with Amazon. I knew when I ordered this iron, the outcome was \\&quot;iffy\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It curls like a dream.Heats up fast and it&#x27;s easy to use..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a love/hate (mostly hate) relationship with my super thick, coarse, frizz-prone hair my entire life. It&#x27;s like wire! I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to curl my hair without the help of a professional stylist. I always end up with those ugly clamp marks and tons of frizz. I bought this iron on sale at target a few months ago - I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I had very long waist-length hair at the time and the reviews said it worked best on long hair. Well, I stuck this iron in a drawer and forgot about it until last week. I recently cut my hair to shoulder length and thought no way this iron would style my new short, layered hair. Surprise! My hair looked great and it took only about 25 min to curl all of my hair! Amazing! First time in my life I&#x27;ve been able to curl my hair myself and I&#x27;ve already used it 2 more times! The curls also lasted through the next day and on day three they turned into pretty, beachy waves. I&#x27;ll admit I do understand what the other reviewers mean when they say this iron is awkward to use. The first time I used it I had a hard time getting the hair wrapped all the way around the slippery barrel without burning myself. Even with the glove on this thing is HOT - I use it on the maximum heat setting because of my coarse hair. I also burned my scalp a bit while trying to curl some pieces in the back. Do not attempt to use this iron without the glove! Despite the minor oopsies with the first couple uses and the fact that the glove offers only some protection from burns, I am going to give this product five stars. I am beyond thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to make an appointment with a stylist every time I want curls! Also happy with how long the curls last and how easy this product is to use once you get the hang of it. If regular curling irons with the clamp work well for you then you should probably stick with what you know but if your hair is a thick nightmare like mine then give this one a try. At this price it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> So i ordered this two days ago and it came today in the morning and im extremely happy with the shipping it was standard shipping. The price was great. I have remingtons pearl ceramic straightners 2inch and 1inch and now i&#x27;ve finished the collection with there matching curling wand. I used it just to try it out, and my hair went from frizzy curly hair, to beautiful taylor swift curls ! My mom loves it and so do my sister. I was so happy it brought the glove, because with my bestfriends curler which has the clamp it burned my hand alot, and it snagged out her hair alot, this curler did not pull out any hair even though its pretty much impossible to pull your hair out with this curler. It heats up fast which im not suprised about because the straightners do the same. Amazing product, dont listen to any bad reviews i swear to god this is my holy grail , well one of them. Im 15, so this is coming from a teenager in highschool ! :) love it, and i love remington, better than CHI or any other expensive brand. pshh &lt;3 !</li>
    <li> The thing wasn&#x27;t as easy as I thought it would be. My hair kept slipping off. The gloves barely provided protection from the heat. The curls did turn out pretty though.</li>
    <li> Works very well but easy to burn you.</li>
    <li> My only issue with this iron is the difficulty in getting my hair to actually stay on the wand. It heats up super fast and takes no time to curl except that my long thick hair won&#x27;t stay on the wand and I cannot seem to get a consistent curl throughout. It&#x27;s really disappointing because I was looking forward to using a clamp less iron. Maybe it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m inexperienced in  using it so I will give it a few more tries, but I may have to go back to the original curling iron. The glove is handy, however, when using it to grab strands of hair it created static. Other than that I have no complaints. I just hope I can learn to use this. It&#x27;s definitely not as easy as it appears to be.</li>
    <li> I love this iron! Firstly, it is extremely light weight. I love the fact that you can lock the temp set temp so there are no accidents while using no more accidently turning it off or even worse burning you hair. If it is your first wand take your time but once you get the hang of I dont think you will want a traditional iron again.</li>
    <li> This item heats up extremely well and does the job super fast. I have recommended this to many other women.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent buy! I have been using this wand for a while now and it has been lovely. I like the digital screen that lets you see the exact temperature. The size of the rod is definitely ideal because you can create multiple styles depending on what part of the wand you wrap your hair around. My only complaint is that its really easy to accidentally shut it off while you&#x27;re using it considering the placement of the power button. Sometimes in the middle of curling, I start to wonder why the curls are coming out flat and realize the wand was not hot. Just be careful also because its so much easier to burn yourself with this than a flat iron.  Overall great purchase, would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This wand is the bomb! My hair is long and this wand took control and curled my hair better than a salon ;). Your curls are going to last all night even if you sweat. The next day or so it will give you this wavy look. The best way to learn how to use the wand is to go to Youtube.</li>
    <li> I love my curling wand it works perfectly and was brand new and would recommend you buying works really good</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and actually works. Not only curls the hair, but the curls stay in place, and doesn&#x27;t fall in 5 minutes like with other curling irons. Temperature gets super hot, so don&#x27;t burn your fingers!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product after watching tons of how-to videos on YouTube, and reading through tons of reviews. However, I could not have been more disappointed. I have fairly thick, easy to curl hair that falls just below my shoulders. For this wand to have any effect on my hair at all though I had to turn it to the hottest setting, which is 410 DEGREES Fahrenheit...that alone should have scared me away from trying to use it. I found out the hard way how dangerous something that hot is. Within minutes of trying to awkwardly maneuver my hair around the wand, I burned myself worse than I ever have before. The burn immediately bubbled into an extremely painful blister that hurt for weeks. Sure, on the hottest setting, it gave my hair a very pretty spiral curl, but at what cost? A small barrel regular curling iron is a much safer option that will yield the desired spiral curled effect without the ridiculous danger involved.</li>
    <li> Great product it is something you have to get use to but works great and it heats up instantly once turned on</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick and corse hair and usually I&#x27;m pretty hesitant about buying hairstyling tools as they have to be very hot for it to work in my hair.  What I usually do is straighten my hair and on day two I will use this curler on the highest heat setting.  I cannot tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve got on the look!  If you are unsure I suggest watching the tutorials on YouTube.  There are a lot of them out there and they helped me acheive the look I was going for.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I find it too difficult to grab my hair with the glove on, so I get burns from time to time.  But the more I use it the better I get at it.  Anyway, I can&#x27;t stress how great this curler is.  I also have the bigger version for looser curls and I love that one too!</li>
    <li> Thank you - thank you - thank you! I have never been able to use curling/flat irons. This product was the answer to my prayer. I can curl my hair (braids), not burn myself (I use the glove included) and the look is AWESOME!! I received the item as promised and will never regret my decision to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> i bought this product because people said it was  easier to use than a regular hair curler and yes it is i have the hair type that curls dont stay in for more than and hour but with this they stayed all day and just to curl my hair in the moring it only took 10-20 min instead of two hours i absolutly love this prouduct</li>
    <li> My hair has never liked to stay curled. When I would curl it by the time I was done all of the curls were falling out and was flat again within an hour. When I used the curling wand I was SO surprised! I curled my hair in like 30 minutes and it normally takes well over an hour because my hair is really thick. Not only does it take less than half the time but the curls stayed the whole day, through the night being slept on, and when I brushed them out the next day my hair was still curly just more loosely and wavy and that was without any product, I don&#x27;t use styling products. I have already recommended it to my future mother-in-law and would recommend it to anyone wanting to curl their hair.</li>
    <li> this was an amazing curler the best one ive used.. its extremely hot.. and that&#x27;s the best part.. the glove absolutely helped a lot</li>
    <li> This create the most beautiful curls or waves depend on how you use it. I love this curling wand and i love remington....</li>
    <li> I have looong hair and thin so it never holds curls! so annoying until I met this wonderful contraption. I received it today went into the bathroom at my work and curled my entire head in 10 mins!! Will take some skill and getting used to but hands down THE BEST CURLING IRON I HAVE EVER TRIED love love love this product Remington is wonderful god bless u for making such a wonderful thing! &#x3D;) I can not stop touching my hair and looking at it</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great curling wand.  Nice smooth surface, lots of temperature options, decent \\&quot;stand\\&quot; built in to the body.  I like that the tip of this doesn&#x27;t get hot so you can hold both ends of the wand.  I have super fine hair and it curls like a dream with this wand.  Curls stay for days, instead of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove is a joke, it&#x27;s just a cotton glove with zero thermal protection.  If you want to be able to touch the barrel (or if you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t help but touch it), invest in a pair of leather gloves or you&#x27;ll get some serious burns.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I would recommending to anyone, unless I want them to have ugly hair. Couldn&#x27;t ask for an easier way to curl my hair and make it look natural.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use, although, it does take a little practice to not burn yourself.  I did burn my finger tip, but it was not badly hurt.  The glove that it comes with is a little difficult to work with as it is hard to gather hair while wearing the glove.  I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This curling wand is amazing! I love it. It makes my hair silky smooth and gives me wonderful, long lasting curls. I curled my hair with this wand in the afternoon, went out, went to sleep with my hair down and when I woke up the curls were still intact. Of course they dropped a bit but it was still beautiful soft curls.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works really well. However, watch your fingers the tool gets very hot. It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a good curler. My daughters hair is fine and has never been able to hold curl before. With this it will hold curl all day! Someone told me to try this style iron. I bought this one. It is great for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She wanted it because she was growing out a keratin treatment.  Consequently, some of her curly hair had patches of straight hair.  She says it was easy to use and gave her great results.</li>
    <li> Overall, Remington makes decent, afforable (just not here) beauty products. This particular curling wand is actually very nice, so the one-star I&#x27;m giving it is for &amp;#34;rhymes with Schamazon&amp;#34;. :-)</li>
    <li> It was a little tricky at first to use, as I am used to the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; curling irons lol. It took a few tries, but now that I&#x27;ve got the hang of it, I get perfect curls everytime that last all day!</li>
    <li> This runs on 120V. But it gives me amazing natural curls. best purchase ever.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to, but I think it will be a great product once I master the technique. Remington makes a great product. I have used their flat iron for several years now with no complaints.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get use to using but it certainly does the job. Make sure to be careful when adjusting the heat settings as it gets very hot. Start low and see how much your hair can take.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing. I love it. Gives me the perfect curls!</li>
    <li> Works great, I am good at burning myself with it though.</li>
    <li> Works great and curls stay in long .</li>
    <li> It worked so well i love it !</li>
    <li> This wand is easy to use and once you get the hang of it it makes beautiful waves!! I like the fact that it comes with a glove so you don&#x27;t burn your hands!!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know how to use this product, you can always watch it on youtube. They have a lot of clips for different types of hair and different levels of curls. I always use the glove to protect my hand/fingers but it is not well made. The material it&#x27;s made from is very thin  so you can still feel the heat. Other than that, I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> My hair will not curl for nothin&#x27; ! But I got&lt;br /&gt;to admit that this inexpensive wand works!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I take extra steps because I have super straight&lt;br /&gt;asian hair. After I make curls, I set them in dry curlers&lt;br /&gt;to keep them in place while I get ready.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time my hair keeps a bit a volume&lt;br /&gt;and bounce even until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really suggest that you buy this&lt;br /&gt;wand if you have trouble using curling irons in&lt;br /&gt;the past.</li>
    <li> Love this wand, makes beaautiful curls I&#x27;m addicted, gets very hot so be careful especially with kids around. Love it</li>
    <li> I love the curls that I obtain with this curling iron. It heats up very fast. I love the glove. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I had my very fine hair curled at a salon with a similar product amd the curls lasted for hours and hours. My hair normally falls as soon as I step outside. Unfortunately I could never even get my entire head curled. The glove made it very slippery and hard to feel the hair. And without the glove it obviously burns so I was left with having to twist my hair around the barrel and that just left a very strange twirl in my hair. Very sad about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! I like that you can control the heat and lock it. I the think this is the perfect size curler too. My hair lasted 3 days and was still going strong when I washed it (its still slightly curled even after washing it)</li>
    <li> These things can really hold a curl. They are mucho mas caliente. I have thickalicious hair, that is very course and long. I have no problem holding a curl even if i was in Florida where it is very humid these things would still be useful, if you have very limp hair these would work wonders.</li>
    <li> The size I ordered gives me smaller curls. A little tricky to use but once you get the hang of it you can create beautiful curls!&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting the big size so you can experiment with the size of your curls.</li>
    <li> It does exactly whats its supposed to do, and the curls definitely last longer than a regular curling iron. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received my wand in about 4 days, the delivery was amazing and the product it even more amazing. It heats up really quickly and it&#x27;s a very smart product, and I would recommend to everyone thinking about buying a wand. Oh, and this is my very first wand, will not use another one.</li>
    <li> This wand is good. I use it to put like a million curls or like use it put a few curls and comb it and make it look like waves. Plus it gets really hot. its great and cheap. Buy it.</li>
    <li> this is the best curling iron/wand i have ever owned. it gives you a hug range of heat options. i have long medium hair and i put on 320, it works great and hold on all day!! i love it! my friends love it, my coworker kept borrowing it that i ended up selling it to her, for Christmas i gifted one and now i have two friends begging me for one !! you will adore this curling wand it truly is amazing.</li>
    <li> Whenever I am done curling my hair with this thing, I always get lots of compliments. Someone once has asked me if I got my hair done at the salon!</li>
    <li> if your hair is long and it doesn&#x27;t curl, this is def the curling iron for you! It does wonders and even when the curls fall out, it looks stunning!</li>
    <li> This is very awesome curling wand. I have naturally curly hair, but I straighten, and then curl, to get neater bouncier curls. It&#x27;s not super heavy and the glove keeps your hand from getting burned.</li>
    <li> For me, this curling wand was way too difficult to use.  My hair is medium length and layered, and maybe it&#x27;s easier to use with longer hair.  You have to wind your hair around the wand with your hand, and then you have to hold it in place for a few seconds with your hand.  But the barrel is so hot that you can&#x27;t do that with your bare hands, so the wand comes with a heat-resistant glove to use on the hand you&#x27;re using to hold your hair on the barrel.  I found the glove very cumbersome, and my hair slipped and slid on the barrel no matter what I did, so it was difficult to get a curl.  It seemed like a strange curling system to me.  If it had a clamp like other curling wands to hold the hair in place, I would have liked it better.  I had to return it because I found it so difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Exelent product. You must to buy it</li>
    <li> This wand isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s slippery so it can be be hard keeping hair on it. I don&#x27;t care too much for the the declining width of the wand in-conjunction with it being slippery but when it does curl the curls are cute and tight. I warn you that it overheats a little and gets super hot. So you must be careful with it, especially if you&#x27;ve got fine hair like mines. If you&#x27;re AA with natural hair like me this wand may be worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite curling iron ever. I have about 20 and this is right at number one!!! My curls stay in for 2 days at the least:))))</li>
    <li> Gave it as a present to my cousin and she loves it. Does the job beautifully and does not break her hair. Got it fast with no problems</li>
    <li> Bought this for my friend. She wishes it has the clamp like the traditional irons do.</li>
    <li> It works great the price it right and it came faster then they said they would ship i recommend it</li>
    <li> I have long and thick hair, if you want loose curls I would get the smaller width as the tighter curls will loosen and relax into that loose curl look, in my case, the bigger curls fall out almost completley. Also, with the smaller wand if you want looser bigger curls just don&#x27;t have your hair wrapped for very long and it will create bigger looser curls, I just reccommend the smaller width because you can do more with it versus the bigger wand, you can&#x27;t make that produce small curls for you.</li>
    <li> The concept is nice, the attractive pink color even better, the picture of the sexy model wearing the black glove is enticing, but in reality, this thing is a pain. The glove is worthless, thin and not at all protective. The iron itself is nice and slick, but unless your hair is caked with product, all one length, and thick, forget about it. I spent several hours trying to use this, and the results are not consistent nor do they really last-- to get a nice curl you&#x27;d have to literally grip the barrel with your hand and wrap your fingers around it.... and unless you want severe burns, that&#x27;s just not possible.     It&#x27;s easier to use on other people and it gets plenty hot... but I still don&#x27;t like it, and would recommend you not waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  Element needs more time than allotted to produce results.  Delivery was super.  Wish the quality was a bit higher.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I have flat boring hair, that won&#x27;t hold curl. I use this wand along with a heat protectant &amp; it last until I wash it out. Just watch out for your fingers!</li>
    <li> Finally after 23 years of not knowing what to do with my hair, I have figured it out!  The curling wand is AMAZING!  I get so many compliments on my hair every time I use it.  I have VERY thick hair but it worked perfectly and only takes me about 15 minutes to do.  I did watch a few tutorials on YouTube before purchasing it to make sure it was easy to use because I never had any luck with curling irons.  This product is great and I highly recommend it.  It gives me awesome wavy hair and it stays like that for about 2 days without even spraying anything in it afterwords.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had good experience using a curling iron when it comes to getting the right look for natural waves. I bought this since it was inexpensive and had a lot of good reviews, and surely it definitely does not disappoint. You can curl your hair from the 1/2 tip to the 1 &amp; 1/2 bottom area. If you are no stranger to heating products, I feel that the way you use this product won&#x27;t be difficult after using it the first try and getting the hang of it. The heating control is a big plus and it shows you if you are in a low, medium, or high range of heat which I find useful because I get cautious on how much damage I put on my hair.       How long you keep your hair wrapped around the wand is dependent on how you want your hair to look. I was testing it out and if you keep your hair wrapped for a short period of time (10 seconds~) then you get a nice, loose wave. If you decide to go for a more formal or spring-curled look then leaving it wrapped for about 20 seconds will do the trick. Unlike original curling irons, you have options! :) I LOVE IT!! My waves are no longer frizzy and lion like but silky smooth ^^</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy this product but it works perfectly! The glove is very helpful also. Just make sure you have it on as you are curling your hair. I burned myself the one time I didn&#x27;t have it on! For the value, this curling wand is a great product!</li>
    <li> This product delivers as it says, I&#x27;m African American and I have long, thick coarse hair. I recieved this product today and tired it out, I have to say I was very pleased. It heated up very quickly and curled my hair awesomely, I&#x27;m totally sold on this product I will be purchasing the bigger barrel one soon. I would definately recommed this product because of the ease of use. As for the other negative reviews, I have no idea what they are talking about they must be totally incapable of styling their on hair or they have fairly short hair, my hair is about 16 inches long and this product works great for me, so If your hair is short don&#x27;t order this get a curler with a clamp. As for the glove I didn&#x27;t even need to use it, If you take you time and wrap your hair right you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with burning yourself. Hope this is helful!</li>
    <li> For once something that actually does what it says it will. These curls last more than a day too, so I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and the price. I wanted waves, not curls, and this is the tool to actually make that happen. After using it for a week, I had a friend ask me how I got the pretty \\&quot;mermaid\\&quot; hair, so I&#x27;ll take that as a compliment. I recommend watching a basic tutorial on youtube on how to use any \\&quot;curling wand\\&quot; to achieve your desired effect. The glove is helpful (but I honestly rarely use it)so be warned, the wand gets super hot! Be sure to use a product that protects your hair from heat and follow the directions so you don&#x27;t burn yourself or your hair.</li>
    <li> the speed of shipping was fast and the product is also very nice i have used a lot of curling wands but pearl is really differs from all other products i used .so thank you very much :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really terrible at curling hair, I don&#x27;t know why but I literally can&#x27;t do it. So I got this, and it makes things so much easier! It gets very hot which is good for it to curl very quickly in case you&#x27;re in a hurry to do something. I&#x27;m still playing around with how to do it, but so far I LOVE the results. It&#x27;s a great product. But it is easy to burn your hand, but that&#x27;s why you use the glove for the first few times you try it out!</li>
    <li> I have never been good at using clamp type iron and rollers. I purchased 4 clamp types in the past, all were highly recommended from costumer reviews, but I just can&#x27;t get nice curls out of them, and all I got from them were burns.  After reading many reviews, I decided to give curling wand a try, and I picked Remington. I have to say, this is the best, the easiest, the fastes curling device I&#x27;ve ever had, and fall in love with it right away! It gets hot very fast, and makes very pretty curls. I have long hair, but it only takes me 10-15 minutes to curl it, and the curls last whole day.   It is very easy for me to use, and I am glad I gave it a try regardless all those negative commons/reviews online. Some people think it&#x27;s tricky to use; however, you will never know how it works for you until you try it yourself.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for the money, real affordable and it gets really hot! so be very careful. it make my curls look I just step out of the salon. very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with the curl this iron makes. Very 90&#x27;s prom tight curls. My fault though, I should have gotten the larger barrel. Don&#x27;t buy this if you like big loose curls!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely wear the gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I burned myself wicked bad too and the burn on my fingers had to be Photoshopped out of my wedding portraits. Fail.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot, you have to be careful not to burn your hands. The glove doesn&#x27;t hold the heat it is too light. It doesn&#x27;t take long for curls to form. i would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fast to heat up. love the temp controls. Need little hair product to maintain curls, even for all day.  Ive even curled my hair the night before to save time in the morning, and it still looks great when i wake up.  highly recommend to those who are patient and careful because it gets really hot and is tricky to use at first if not used to the clampless irons (use a glove, it helps!)</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to... But it&#x27;s so worth it!!! I love how easy and carefree my curls look. They look so much more natural than with a traditional curling iron. Love love love love!</li>
    <li> Love. I don&#x27;t know why this works so much better than just wrapping your hair around the barrel of the curling iron, but it does. Super fast to curl my whole head of super thick boob length hair. I think I will get the larger size for bigger waves, too.</li>
    <li> I like this, but it takes some getting used to.  I like bigger curls, so I think I&#x27;ll buy the larger one.  It does curl QUICKLY and holds the curl for a LONG time.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. It leaves my hair shiny and perfectly curly. There is a little bit of a learning curve but once you get it, you&#x27;re good. I personally can&#x27;t do it using the glove because it is hard to grip my hair with it but I recommend you use it unless you are REALLY careful and have mastered the tool. I have burned myself a few times, but that is my own fault. I can do it now with no problem. This is a great product, I strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used to spend two to two and a half hours curling my hair with a regular 3/4inch curling iron but seriously, this took me about half an hour. It makes things a million times easier. No pain, easy, quick heat up and cool down. I love this product. The best xmas gift i have EVER recieved!</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I got this for $19.99. My wife has long thin hair. I would recommend the larger one for most girls.</li>
    <li> i bought this wan for myself and i love it it leaves my hair really curled. i use it almost everyday</li>
    <li> I am a singer and songwriter, and have to perform professionally, and usually opt to keep my hair straight... I wanted to add some versatility to my looks, so for $25 bucks this was right up my ally.  I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews on my purchases, because honestly, I never have the time, but I am actually about to purchase another curling wand by Remington, (because my sister has hijacked my own)... :-|... The glove honestly complicates the whole curling process(at least for me), I curl much faster without it, and through trial and error, I have become somewhat of  Remington Pearl Digital Curling Wand Pro-HahA-, and I have become a bit resistant to the heat, haha, so I usually curl without the glove, --actually I lost the glove, lol... but I just added a few pics so you can see the pretty curls and waves I have done with my OWN hair, as well as 26\\&quot; Brazilian hair extensions, i am the Afro Carribean girl in the \\&quot;Hollister\\&quot; sweater... please feel free to contact me on twitter if you have any questions @AllisonKandii ! :-)  oh and listen to my music on YouTube  by typing Allison Kandii in the search field...</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled with this hair appliance.  Did not find it that easy to use.  However, my hair is very thin and too fine.  Might be good for someone with a different hair texture.</li>
    <li> I love this curl wand it&#x27;s super easy to use it warms up fast, it has great temperture settings, it&#x27;s a pretty pink,it gives great curl definition and lastly it is really affordable! Can&#x27;t believe I lasted so long without one...hands down a really great investment</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I am not the best with curling with a flat iron so I purchases the wand. One of the best decision I&#x27;ve made ! I got it at a great price as well :)</li>
    <li> This thing does work really well once you get the hang of it. My only complaints are that it takes forever depending on how tightly you want your heir curled and like other reviewers I found that its a little more difficult to curl hair that is just shoulder length because it tends to slide off of the slippery pearl barrel. Personally i found the results to be worth it and once I actually got it all curled it stayed that way even after sleeping on it! It&#x27;s a great wand for the price too.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my hair is really straight and my curls always fall, yet with this product they hold thoughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and needed something to &#x27;tame&#x27; the front curls to look presentable instead of wild and crazy.  I normally use a flat iron or curling iron but that takes a lot of time to do so I was looking for something less time consuming in my morning routine and this is perfect! The curls that the wand creates blend in nicely with the rest of my curls and I have received a lot of compliments on my &#x27;new look&#x27;. I&#x27;m able to make my wild and crazy curl look stylish polished and put together while still looking natural. I love it! It did take me a few tries to figure out how to achieve the best look, how to hold the wand and wrap the hair, and I did burn myself a few times... so be careful! I haven&#x27;t used the glove at all. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It shipped super quickly and after seeing all the great reviews on youtube I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I love the digital heat setting so I can lower it for my natural hair and increase it for my extensions and know the exact heat I&#x27;m using not &amp;#34;20&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;30&amp;#34;. I can create large waves or tight curls I love it. The only downside is I lost my heat glove and You definitely need it when using this curling wand.</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure how this curling iron would work but after a few attempts, I got the hang of it and I really like it. I used the glove at first but had a hard time holding onto my hair so I finally tried it, very carefully, without the glove and it worked very well. Once finished, the curls do seem to last a long time. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My 12 year-old daughter inherited my stick straight hair. We&#x27;ve spent a lot of time curling it with everything from hot rollers and sticks to traditional curling irons. Most of the time we ended up with uneven results or loose, messy waves. When we did achieve nice curls, they rarely lasted more than an hour. So, I wasn&#x27;t too hopeful when I purchased this product for my daugher as a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a break in the Christmas festivities, my daughter disappeared into her room for about 30 minutes. When she returned, her head was covered with gorgeous spiral curls! She found the wand to be easy to use and had no trouble mastering the new technique. The glove protected her hand from burns. The only learning curve was that she had to learn to wrap as much of the ends around the wand at possible. She had stick straight ends poking out at first, but was able to touch them up with no trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we like:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly (about 30 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;- Auto shut off. This is a great feature, but it doesn&#x27;t kick in until after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;- Curls even hard-to-curl hair, and the curls last!&lt;br /&gt;- Great price!&lt;br /&gt;- Protective glove is included. We found that not all wands of this type come with a glove, and some come with a partial glove that only covers a few fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we love this styling tool and would definitely purchase it all over again.</li>
    <li> This works very well and creates spiral curls or waves depending on how you wrap the hair around the wand.  It&#x27;s not easy to do the back of my hair by myself, but then again nothing is easy for me to do to the back of my hair. &#x3D;)  The glove doesn&#x27;t protect as much as I would like as it&#x27;s just a cotton like glove, and this wand does get HOT!  All in all I am happy with this product and would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was worried because I haven&#x27;t heard anything about this brand. My daughter is IN LOVE with it!!! it works!!!</li>
    <li> This curler is pretty good! Heats up quickly and produces waves/curls depending on how tight you roll the hair. One criticism would be that, even though a glove is provided to shield your hand from the heat, it doesn&#x27;t work very well and the heat goes through it.</li>
    <li> bought it for my wife and she really love it.. she can do whatever she want to do her hair, she is very happy with it..</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t use it as much as I should for how much I spent on it but I do use it and it works great in my hair. Also came in time for whatever I needed too because I don&#x27;t remember having trouble with it.</li>
    <li> I tried this out and let me tell you, it takes a lot of time and patients, you wrap it around with your own hand. there is no clip, it takes a lot of time and patience.Leaves pretty curls if you can get it to work!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister as a Christmas gift and she loved it! It&#x27;s so great that I decided to buy myself one as well. It makes cute, neat spiral curls. However, I like a more natural look so I comb out the tight curls and the result is a bunch of lose, full, natural looking curls. The curls stay in better on two or even three day old hair.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If your thinking about buying this curling wand, BUY THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> Works beautifully on my teenage daughters&#x27; hair. They are enjoying being able to curl their hair and the curls are bouncy. Great buy and they love it.</li>
    <li> This product works so good ! My daughter has thick long hair. She wanted to make spiral curls. This heats fast, you wind the hair around it and then pull the wand out or unwind the hair and it is curled. It works so fast. My daughter is 12 and can do it herself. The glove helps so she doesn&#x27;t burn herself because it does get hot. And the curls held all day. I would completely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this curling wand. It is easy to use and it does beautiful curls. I would say choose this curling wand.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister for christmas and she loves it.  She says it works really well and fast. she uses it nearly every day because it is so easy and looks like she worked harder than she did</li>
    <li> The wand works good and doesn’t damage my hair. I&#x27;m not a pro when it comes to hot tool but the overall experience has been good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas. It works great! As many reviewers have commented, it takes a little getting used to. She has burnt her head &amp; hands once or twice, but she still loves it.</li>
    <li> I have long and very thick hair . This wand make&#x27;s my hair lovely. Easy to use and very affordable . Shipping is fast . I absolutely recommend this for everyone you&#x27;re not gonna regret it.</li>
    <li> i love it. it makes the best curl pattern,  plus it ws cheaper here than at walmart &amp; target.  highly recommend</li>
    <li> I  have not had a chance to use this product yet but I have heard alot of great things about it.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. It works really well on weaves and extensions and gets hot enough to curl all types of hair. The curls stayed all day and never frizzed up. I used the glove that came with it the first few times.  Once I got the hang of it, I didn&#x27;t need the glove anymore.</li>
    <li> I was considering a chi when I decided to try a hair wand. However I began looking at reviews and this one was recommended by many. I can now add my name to the list of supporters. Not only do you save almost $100, it works amazingly well. My hair which normally holds a curl for about an hour, held curls for TWO days with the Remington.</li>
    <li> I love this. Nice product, works good and would recommend this brand to anyone. Remington always works good and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This makes BEAUTIFUL curls, just used it this morning on my little sisters hair and she looks adorable. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on myself.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems curling my hair...not sure if its because of my hair type...naturally wavy...but with this iron...its like a professional hair tool...omg it gets so hot...you really do need to use the glove that comes with it....when i get a chance I will post a picture of my hair when I use it...the way i get the best results is to straighten my hair first and then curl it...I know that sounds crazy but again...it may be because my hair is naturally wavy....this iron is totally worth the money and if you have trouble curling your hair...this is the iron for you...and if your hair is easy to curl..well it just got easier!!! Great Buy!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. Can&#x27;t tell you how many people asked me how I get my hair curled. It takes a little bit of practice at first, but so worth it. And $25 it&#x27;s the best deal you will find. Had mine for almost 2 yrs and still works perfectly fine. Definitely my fav hair tool..</li>
    <li> I can curl my thick hair ay 5:30 in the morning and it still looks great after work.  This is the best curling iron I ever used BUT I had to watch a quick 30 sec YOU tube video to show me how.  YOu curl it kind of upside down</li>
    <li> For Halloween, my friend curled my hair using a curling wand and I knew right then I just had to get one. I choose this one mainly for the price and the other reviews and I chose right. This little wand allows me to curl my hair in the same amount of time it takes to straighten it. Its fairly easy to learn how to use but do be careful because it gets extremely hot. I did not use the glove because I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to move fluidly with my hair. If you are considering a new curling tool then you need to buy this curling wand. My hair never curled before and now it curls in less then 45 minutes with very little hairspray. The curls hold as well. I curled my hair at about 10am and it lasted until the next day. I am obesssed with this wand and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is the best... A friend recommended this wand, and I have to admit the low price had me skeptical. I used these irons a lot when I am wearing extensions, and can I say this is the best invention ever!!!! A head full of curls in minutes (once you learn how to use them really well of course). This does come with a protective glove, but I found after I learned to use them really well, I didn&#x27;t need the glove anymore. It has a digital heat guage, so you can actually see the temperature.... No complaints. I love this.</li>
    <li> Wow. Just wow. It&#x27;s just awesome. I&#x27;ve never used a curling iron wand thingy like this before, and it&#x27;s super cool. I would recommend this product to anyone. Be careful with it! It&#x27;s really really really hot. Your hair is gonna look hot too, honey.</li>
    <li> Works well with my thick coarse frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Works great! My first curling wand and I would recommend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> First off, I have had this wand for 4 months and I am so in love with it! Whenever I use curling irons, my hair is wavy at the top still and the curls always fall flat. But, with this wand, my hair is perfectly curled. I am obsessed with the pink and black combo, and the digital temp. control is an amazing feature that helps styling your hair be hassle free, and so you know the temperature precisely. I also and thrilled it has a glove, so you don&#x27;t bun yourself. I love how you can create many variations with this wand from ringlets, to tights curls, to spiral curls, to waves, and so much more,( depending on how you wrap it and how long you leave it on the barrel) Overaall this wand makes curling my hair stress and hassle free, and in turn I get beautiful bouncy curls and so many compliments . (:</li>
    <li> Works well for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter is Black with shoulder-length hair. She does not have a relaxer. I have used the curling wand on her straight and natural hair.  It works great on both! She has received lots of compliments.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have fine hair and before this product a curl would never last longer than an hour. With this product, my curls are intact the following day. Amaze-balls!</li>
    <li> I looooove this wand..it has gotten me through ally of bad hair days lol.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier with my wand! makes the most cutest curls!! &amp;#60;3 just  be careful because if are a begginner like me  you will get burned a couple of times &#x3D;/ but it is great wand for the price!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter.  I ask her how it&#x27;s working out for her and she loves it.  She said she uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> Works like charm, be careful though it get super hot, but definitely gets the job done :)</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and the curls last forever! I use it on my weave and it doesn&#x27;t burn or damage the hair. The glove is great at preventing burning fingertips.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this was going to work.  I watched several YouTube videos.  Basically, you need to practice, and practice using the glove.  The glove helps, but you can still get burned.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying a better glove.  My hair tends to slip on the ceramic wand, which can be a little frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the wand works, and it works very well.  I didn&#x27;t think I could ever get curl back into my hair.  I&#x27;m older, and I dye my hair because it&#x27;s practically grey.  You know how unmanageable grey hair can be.  I was surprised when I was able to curl my hair using the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it can curl unmanageable grey hair, imagine what it can do to healthy manageable hair!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not very coordinated, but it took me a few tries to master this clipless curling iron technique without burning myself.  That said, I LOVE this curling wand and how it makes my hair look.  The barrel is the perfect size for my medium length hair and it curls quite easy.  My hair holds curl quite well, so this is now my favorite way to fix my hair!</li>
    <li> Takes 15 minutes tops to curl my hair and I have never had such beautiful curls! I like the temperature settings. Very easy to use with the glove. DONOT USE WITHOUT THE GLOVE! I recommend using Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Heat Protection and Shine Spray, after you wash your hair. And then use the curler after the hair is dry. That makes hair shine a lot more!</li>
    <li> This produxt is awesome u have to learn to use it but remington brands are the beat . Price is amazing too!</li>
    <li> I thought this might be difficult for me to use effectively, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with the results.  I am achieving the look I want easily, and was thrilled that I could even use it to mask a bad haircut!  I really like that I can vary the curl and avoid the crimp from old style curlers.  The glove is a must, and I actually would like to have one for both hands.</li>
    <li> It was something i expected and I&#x27;m so happy I got it. This really curls my hair very well and I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s in my hands ;)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; Gurl....I like your hair&amp;#34;.... That is all she hear from the paparazzi ( lol) ok - she exaggerating a little but seriously this curling wand gives you the &amp;#34; str8t out the salon look&amp;#34; in the privacy of your own home!!!</li>
    <li> I have short hair so this was not a wise purchase for me. I wanted a regular curling iron. I gave this item to a friend.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is AMAZING! Hands down, this is the best curling product I&#x27;ve ever used in my 31 years on this planet. I was a little skeptical about how well is would work without any kind of hair product whatsoever--you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to see that it performed just like all the other Amazon reviewers said it would. Definitely worth the measly 20-spot I spent on it--it has literally outperformed my &amp;#34;salon brand&amp;#34; curling iron a hundred times over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m a newbie to curling wands, but it only took me about 30 minutes (and one gnarly burn on my thumb!) to get the hang of it without the glove. :)</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS WAND TODAY AND IT CAME IN A CRUMPLED ENVELOPE NO GLOVES EXTREMELY DUSTY MY SINUSES CAME ON AND IT WAS JUS IN THE BAG NO BOX OR ANYTHIN BUT IT WORKED THANK GOD</li>
    <li> I feel like it gives me Shirley temple curls. My hair always looks better the day after I curl it. The wand has to be upside down so when useing the wand the tip faces the floor. Hard to handle, I always burn my hand at least once when using. The gloves suck. Can&#x27;t do my hair with those on. But it gets super hot and definatly curls!!</li>
    <li> I bought one last Christmas (2012) for a daughter and one this Christmas (2013) for a granddaughter because it has held up so well the last year and curls great!!</li>
    <li> I would like to share my first time experience with this wand (in the 1/2 inch to 1 inch), as a warning for future customers, before I explain my rating...&lt;br /&gt;I got this product yesterday, 12/28/13, and of course, I had to test it out right away. I was, unfortunately, too confident in using this curling wand at maximum heat (410 degrees), and, halfway through my hair, I slipped up, and now have 2nd degree burns all over my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when I was halfway through my hair, and upon switching the hand that held the wand, I grabbed the scalding hot barrel instead of the handle. I suppose I must of went into shock because all I was thinking was how it felt like my hand was melting like butter and I couldn&#x27;t pull myself together and put the wand down fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;I spent the remainder of the day in massively agonizing pain which felt like I was still holding the burning hot wand. I now have ten blisters all over my palm. Although this mishap occurred (and it was pretty much my fault, of course), this product still deserves the rating that I gave it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the reason behind my rating. I give it 5 stars because it gave me perfectly beautiful, flirty curls! I have extremely thick and very long hair (25-30 inches); and even doing 2 inch to 3 inch sections, I still got tight, bouncy, ringlet curls. It is a great product! Heats up practically instantly, and curls hair in as little as ten seconds per section. The real deal maker for me was that I slept on the couch with my curly hair, woke up with still curly hair, spent over an hour playing with my hair, and now I&#x27;m writing this review and I&#x27;ve still got awesome curls with minimal curl falling flat!</li>
    <li> This is super awesome curling wand I have ever used  !! people looking out for curl iron this is an superb product in the market and happy with amazon delivery too got this product with in two days of my order Amazon keep it up and yes curls came out too gud and stayed for 2 days.</li>
    <li> Great product and works wonderfully. I love it. The product came fast and on time as well. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> It works sooo well!!! I love it! It gives me spiral curls like Taylor Swift and stays for days. I got this cuz it came with an actual WHOLE GLOVE and not some finger one. You will burn yourself without the glove definitely! Also you can set the temperature pretty high because if you are like me and have very thick hair, it&#x27;s a must! It&#x27;s pink also!</li>
    <li> This curling wand is highly talked about on Youtube among hair gurus. It works great on extensions. I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work on natural hair. It heats up quick. The cord could be a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift, and I think it blew the others out of the water.  I researched a lot of these prior to this purchase, and I&#x27;m glad I went with the Remington.  My daughter loves it, and uses it daily.  The curls are soft, not frizzy, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  She is 15, and had no problem using it immediately.  The glove works well too, and we were so glad it was included.  Over all, this was very nice and we highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the curls that this wand produces. They are gorgeous and they stay in all day and even overnight. Look up an instructional video first before trying it on your own hair, as the wand is different from a regular curling iron. I use it all the time!</li>
    <li> I got this curling wand and glove last week.  You will need to use the glove because I almost accidentally burned myself several times until I got used to using this.  I have very long, thick, frizzy brown hair.  This product makes the most spiral, pretty curls.  It looked like I had gotten a perm in my hair.  I got compliments everywhere I went the night I used this.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling wand. It is one of the best I have ever tried! I like how it is clampless so there isn&#x27;t a crimp at the end and it&#x27;s also way easier. The glove makes it harder though and doesn&#x27;t protect very well. It has never burned my hair or made it dry out. I really love this curling iron and I would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. I love the glove! Don&#x27;t feel anything at all with it on. Allows me to hold on to the tiny strand of hair at the end of the curl. Gets extremely hot. I suggest not using the highest temperature on natural hair. I use that setting on my weave. Still working on my curl technique. You don&#x27;t need to hold your hair on the rod for very long! It curls immediately! Love it. So amazing especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair is long enough to use this without someone&#x27;s help. My hair is shoulder length. I attempted one curl and managed to burn myself twice. I know for a fact that curl wands give my hair a nice curl, but I don&#x27;t see me attempting to use this on my own again. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> I love this wand. If I want to make my weave wavy with out spending the extra money on the wavy hair I can use this and get the same look. I love this thing and recommend it to others</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;hot glove&amp;#34; this came with is a must. It can be challenging to use on yourself, but it takes practice. Works great.</li>
    <li> my friend has this exact curl wand. i didnt expect this to work because it was sooooo cheap but its awesome and i love it</li>
    <li> You need to have this if you love curly hair, if you love to curl your hair and only have a short time in the morning this works great!! It curls in minutes and stays. Heats up very quickly and does the job. You can make small curls or larger curls depending how you use it. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will order the 1 1/2</li>
    <li> After watching a couple tutorials on how to best use this particular curling rod, I practiced on a few sections of hair before plugging it in and turning it on. I am very pleased with the ease of use (especially for someone with severe Rheumatoid arthritis in her hands) and the results of bouncy, smooth curls.</li>
    <li> Took me some time to master it because I was beginner but now I&#x27;ve mastered it. I like the different curls it gives you. It&#x27;s something different and very pretty! Heats up super quick as well.</li>
    <li> dont buy, this product has a cheap price for a reason. my wife tried using it once and returned it</li>
    <li> I adore this thing. I have naturally curly hair but my curls get out of control a lot or if I brush my hair when it&#x27;s dry frizz nation! A bird could build a nest in my hair, lol. I&#x27;ve never like the crease traditional curling irons leave which is why I didn&#x27;t use them so much. But I saw this and I figured, why not? It has a digital temperature control so you aren&#x27;t guessing whether you have it set at 300 or 410 (the highest setting) and the little glove that comes with it works pretty well. I mean you can&#x27;t grab the iron with it because it will burn you but it does protect you enough to keep you from burning yourself. You&#x27;ll feel the heat before it gets to the too hot period where it&#x27;s too late. You can do tiny sections of hair on the very end to make tight spiral curls or use the entire thing to make big, beachy waves. I even semi straightened my hair once when I couldn&#x27;t find my straightener. I mean semi straightened because it wasn&#x27;t really straight but it wasn&#x27;t out of control frizz either. And also the pearly pink on the wand is adorable. I don&#x27;t know what the more expensive wands have that this one doesn&#x27;t but this works for me and I&#x27;d repurchase it in an New York Minute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptic with curling irons and they never seem to work for me. But this one works perfectly!! You can make tight curls or loose waves and it always comes out looking nice. Some people say you have to get used to using it but i did pretty good using it my first time. I would definitely recommend getting this!!</li>
    <li> I am trying to grow out my hair and am currently in the stage where mullet avoidance is a must. I figured one way to to stop an innocent comment resulting in a visit to the salon would be to curl it. This curling iron does the trick well. I get really nice curls and have yet to make a hair appointment because of mullet accusations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if one were to record my faces in the morning as I use this thing, it would be kind of like the people that take pictures of visitors to a haunted house. My hair isn&#x27;t super long and I am not very good at dealing with super hot things right next to my ears right away in the morning. I am getting better with it (I say nursing a burnt ear) but it&#x27;s tough to get used to, especially if you&#x27;re used to the kinds of curling irons that clamp your hair for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not blaming the iron for this, rather my own pride. \\&quot;I am a smart person, I can handle this curling iron\\&quot; is what I told myself when I ordered it. But, buyer: take a moment, inquire within and think. Are you going to need this to prepare for a night out when you&#x27;ve already done some pre-gaming? Do you need a cup of coffee to feel like a fully functioning human being, and will you be using this perhaps before that cup has hit your system? Then maybe reconsider and buy a curling iron with a clamp. Or don&#x27;t, but order some aloe vera too. Your ears and neck will thank you.</li>
    <li> I could not create one curl with this product, only some waves - and in the process, burned my fingertips. Definitely not worth trying.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair.  I got both sized wands.  The larger wand tends to give that large beach wave curls, while the smaller wand gives tighter curls.  BOTH wands work FABULOUS, and the curls held for over two days.  For this price, you will not go wrong!  Amazed at such a cheap price, but great quality.  FABULOUS!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, naturally curly/frizzy hair, have used a flat iron for years (and regular curling irons before that), so got this to make waves and long curls.  This was so difficult to use, I gave up and returned it.  I read all the reviews, watched YouTube videos, and like many others I just could not get my hair to stay wrapped around the slippery barrel, it was too much hassle and aggravation.  The only positive thing I can say is that it is probably less damaging that a regular curling iron with a built in clamp, but is a waste of time if you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have had at least 10 other curlers in my life and always thought my hair was just impossible to curl or maybe I didn&#x27;t have skills. Received this today and OMG!!!!! My curls are perfect! Too curly for my round face so I might have to get the 1-1/2. I currently have the 1/2-1. My hair got too curly so I just stretched my curls and ran the barrel over it.  I have THICK, stubborn straight asian hair and if you hair like me, you know hard it is to keep curls! GET THIS!</li>
    <li> The wand works fine, but personally I don&#x27;t like the way it curls your hair. I have a lot of different length layers in my hair and it just looks messy when I curl it with the wand. It was really easy to use, but I&#x27;m gonna stick with my regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> Never tried this before because I always had a curling iron around.&lt;br /&gt;My curling iron rusted away, so decided to try a curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!  Takes a little getting used to - a learning curve is involved but still love it.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me the curls I always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this Remington product and I found it $10 cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart!&lt;br /&gt;I about fell over when I saw it for $25 at Walmart!  I only paid $15 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I have to write a review just because I love this thing so much. I am curly but I usually wear straight hairs, I found this iron just typing curling iron on amazon and even if I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it I bought it. I watched some video on youtube about how to use it. It didn&#x27;t seem as easy as it actually is. I love it because it&#x27;s just the right temperature and it gets hot SO FAST. I use it every morning, it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair as much as I expected (even because I protect them right before) and it takes less then 10 minutes to let it get hot and use it. The glove they give you to protect your hands it&#x27;s not really necessary but helps to get confident with the wand. It&#x27;s just $19. Fast. Easy. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and the price made it even better. I am very satisfied with how it works on my hair.</li>
    <li> This item is great for fine/thick or fine/thin hair. It&#x27;s also a great product when you&#x27;re looking for tighter smaller curls. I prefer big loose curls myself, but this does what it is intended to do. I love the digital display. It also heats up very quickly. You don&#x27;t have to give it 20 minutes to heat up like most traditional curling irons. Make sure you use a heat protector spray prior to use. 410 degrees (this irons highest setting) has potential to damage hair, so spray it up first!</li>
    <li> This is my first curling wand so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other but it&#x27;s great. I was able to make many different kind if curls of different sizes that lasted for a whole. The glove just gets in the way so I don&#x27;t use it but this item does gets really hot fast, so be careful.</li>
    <li> Greta iron BUT becareful this thing will burn the crap out of your hand! Yes it does come with a glove but I cant seem to use the glove and still hold the tios of my hair. maybe after ipractive for awhile! but love the ability to do toght or loose curls with one iron!</li>
    <li> I sent a $120 Amika back because It just didn&#x27;t work as I expected. I saw the reviews for this one and decided to try it, not expecting  it to work any better. I am very impressed with it - great waves or curls, easy to use and for a great price.</li>
    <li> I was not able to use this easily. i returned it and got a different one with a bigger barrel that gets hotter.</li>
    <li> Pros -&lt;br /&gt;+ Gets Hot Quickly&lt;br /&gt;+ Smooth Wand;&lt;br /&gt;+ allows more natural looking curls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its amazing i liked it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it now for years and still works like it just came out of the package</li>
    <li> I am in love with my new curling wand from Remington . Let me tell you doing hair is not my forte , but this wand is so easy to use. I could never get the hang of using a curling iron so I decided to try a wand and I am so glad I did . This does not take long at all to do , I curl my hair in under 10mins which is a plus because I am always in a rush in the morning.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is amazing! It heats up pretty fast and the curls hold for a long time since the temperature gets really high. I love the shape that it gives and not to mention the color of the wand!</li>
    <li> I have very very thick hair and this works great! If you want larger curls instead of tighter, I would go with a bigger barrel. But every time I use this, people notice and comment on my waves!</li>
    <li> the product was beautiful i loved the included glove... product looked better than the picture.... very satisfied and will be using company in the future</li>
    <li> its exactly what i wanted!&lt;br /&gt;got it on time!&lt;br /&gt;it heats up fast!&lt;br /&gt;the curls are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;they last for like ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better wands before , but this one still gets the job done</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and it gave some beautiful curls to my straight hair. It heated up very fast too and made the curls nice and silky. The only bad thing i would have to say about it is When you take a shower and blow dry your hair it doesn&#x27;t work at all i think it is because the hair is too dry. So you have to wait a day after taking a shower to use it. But it works perfectly and i highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I am sooooo in love with this curl wand. I use it on a biweekly basis because I don&#x27;t want to continue to put heat on my hair but this curl wand curls my hair perfectly. I receive lots of compliments and it looks as thought I&#x27;ve gone to the beauty salon to get my hair done. The curls lasts for a few days and it keeps ur hair looking fresh. I recommend this curl wand to anyone. It was one of the best purchases I made and the price was great also. Other places I&#x27;ve gone locally where a lot more than what I paid through amazon. Purchase this ladies and I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have no issues with this product.  It came on time, works well and heats up relatively fast, even came with a glove and I definitely enjoy that.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Got here in less than a week.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling tool. It creates beautiful curls and waves. My hair has never looked so great. The glove that is included keeps my fingers safe from burns which is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Great item!  Works perfect!</li>
    <li> The ceramic is very slippery and it&#x27;s hard to get the hair to stay in place while I curl my hair around the barrel. It&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>
    <li> A longtime make-up nerd, I&#x27;ve just now started getting into styling my hair. This works wonderfully on my shaggy, asymmetrical lob. I can get everything from Nicole Kidman-esque ringlets to loose, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley-style waves.</li>
    <li> This product it pretty good, but it&#x27;s really hard for first time curlers! I recommend just getting a regular curing iron with a clamp if you&#x27;re a first time user.</li>
    <li> My daughter does like her new curling wand.  The quality is fairly good for the price though.  If looking for a higher quality, you should probably spend more money.</li>
    <li> HEATS UP FAST....GREAT GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER....HER FRIENDS LOVE HOW HER HAIR COMES OUT...WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN..  WISH THE GLOVE WAS THICKER</li>
    <li> I have big, thick, Heavy hair and curls never hold. This product holds awesome! Best thing ive ever bought (: I am very very very happy with this Magic wand!!</li>
    <li> I am convinced I have the thinnest hair on planet earth. I have never been able to curl my hair successfully. Typically, my hair loses the curl in moments, regardless of how much product I prepare my hair with. This curling iron is an answer to all my prayers for fantastic hair!!! I still wake up the following morning with curls for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I purchased the smallest curling iron and the curls it makes are way too small for my taste. I am keeping it for ringlets in my daughter&#x27;s hair, but will be purchasing the larger one for my hair. Thank you SO much Remington for this AMAZING product.</li>
    <li> Just tried this for the first time this morning and I am super pleased. I have shoulder length hair that tends to be pretty wavy on its own, but this thing whipped my messy frizz into elegant, natural looking wave/curls. It only took five minutes! I set it on pretty low heat (280) because I have thin, fine hair and would just wrap a section of hair around the wand and hold for maybe 10-15 seconds and that was all it needed. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t​ work on my Bob cut. My advice is to invest a bit more money in a high-quality curler with which you will certainly be more satisfied than this one.</li>
    <li> This wand works great it gets very hot very fast and curls your hair faster it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m new at this, but it takes  A LOT of practice to get the job done, I do not like that close to the roots, hair looks &amp;#34;not styled&amp;#34;,rather would like the one that has the clip. It heats up quick and the controls give you flexibility in choosing a thick strand of hair, vs a small strand of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the erog size one ( I wanted the 1 1/4) but still, it&#x27;s AMAZING!! I have long thick hair and no curls hold, but After a night sleep they are still here! Super light weight, to the point that it might even look cheesy, but on the contrary, it&#x27;s not weight for you to carry unnecessarily</li>
    <li> I am challenged when it comes to my hair, I can straighten it and put it up and that&#x27;s about all. When I decided to order this curling wand I was nervous and was positive I would not get my desired results. I mean I&#x27;ve tried curling irons in the past with horrible if not comical results. I watched about 10-15 different YouTube videos before jumping in. I could not be happier with the outcome. This wand heats quickly enough. Use the provided glove to protect your fingers trust me. The process requires practice and patience but with both you&#x27;ll achieve the look you want for sure. Excellent product, excellent price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. I was hoping it was as good as my deep waver, but unfortunately, it was a bit difficult to curl my shoulder-length hair using a curling wand. I curled my hair last night and the curls didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This want is better if you&#x27;re curling longer hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once bur it seems like a good curling wand for the price. It has multiple heat settings, and it heats up quick. I have fairly thick hair that&#x27;s pretty frizzy and it did a good job at curling my hair, even without me straightening my hair before hand. The glove that came with it wasn&#x27;t the exact glove pictured, but who cares?  At least it came with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that my hair keeps slipping down the barrel to the smaller end when I try to wrap my hair around it. But that has nothing to do with the product and everything to do with my lack of skills.</li>
    <li> Ok it&#x27;s not pearl ceramic like it says in the picture , and it definitely doesn&#x27;t bring a heat protective glove. It&#x27;s a regular black glove I can buy anywhere for about a dollar</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! No more ugly creases in my hair from the clip curling irons! Also it makes curls that hold throughout the day!</li>
    <li> The Remington Curling wand is perfect for curling hair. It curls your hair so much faster than a curling iron and all types of hair hold the curls extremely well. My sister, who finds it impossible to keep curls in her hair even with hair spray, was able to keep these curls in her hair for a couple days without any hairspray. It makes perfect curls and waves. I am extremely happy with mine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because I think it would work great for the right person. I have pretty long hair so I definitely should have got the bigger barrel, but that it not a product flaw it was just my mistake. It does give nice curls but I like looser ones and all my hair wouldn&#x27;t fit on the barrel. I think it would be great for shorter hair though!</li>
    <li> It got here really quick! At first I had a hard time using it and my curls came out crappy, but after a bit of practice, I can now quickly make cuteee curls. I like how it comes with a glove,  that has really been helpful when doing my hair, cause nuh uh I do not want to get burned. I thought it was going to be a bit bigger, but it does a great job despite not being that big. I think it&#x27;s uber cute too, it&#x27;s so pretty and pink.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> If u don&#x27;t own one u need to ！</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my Remington Pearl Pro Curling Wand!!</li>
    <li> Love this little wand. I had to youtube how to actually use this to keep curls, but once you watch a video you will quickly learn. I sucked at using actual curling irons but this is almost idiot proof! I saw a couple of bad youtube videos as well so I cant say its completely idiot proof lol.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand. It heats up pretty quickly and makes lasting curls. The ceramic leaves your hair shiny. I&#x27;m surprised this wand was so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the best at using hair products of any kind, so I am still learning how to get the most out of this product, but so far I think it&#x27;s really great! I used to hate how my hair would crimp at the ends whenever I used a regular curler with the clamp, and my hair is very straight and &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; so it literally used to fall out of any curl within 20 minutes, even with hairspray. After half an hour of fidgeting with this product and curling all of my hair (with hairspray), my curls lasted me well into the next day! (They didn&#x27;t look as great after sleeping on them, though). Price is great, and I prefer to not even use the glove it comes with (makes my hair static-y when I use a gloved hand to grab sections). Now I am just trying to figure out how to get my hair into loose waves rather than the tighter curls I got when I first used this. Overall great product for a great price! Just takes some time to get used to if you&#x27;re not used to doing anything other than a ponytail in your hair.</li>
    <li> This works AMAZING! Wish I had known about it a long time ago! Curls in about 2 seconds!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it.  Now her older sisiter likes to use it. She loves the curls she gets with it. It was a worth while purchase</li>
    <li> Works great, got here on time!</li>
    <li> An iron to cook you&#x27;re hair.  Holy moly, this thing heats up to 375 degrees.  Which I curled my hair with.  Kinda cooked it.  But the curl was nice.  But now I have to grow all the hair out to get my healthy locks back.  So, FYI, for your sake and your hairs sake, curl at lowest temp.</li>
    <li> I love how this heats-up quickly. It is very lightweight and gives an awesome lasting curls all day. I can finish my long thick hair in less than 10minutes! whether you like to have tight curls or nice polished waves, this one for you!</li>
    <li> LLLOOOOVVVEEEEE this thing. Seriously, nothing else has even made my hair hold a curl the way this does. I don&#x27;t really use the glove it came with because the little black tip isn&#x27;t too hot to touch when using a medium heat level. I love the different temperature options. Great product!</li>
    <li> It curls nicely and i like how it gives different size curls for a more natural look. Did not burn my hair. Heated up fast. Only problem is that This is not usable without the glove and you might need 2 gloves. I burned my fingers on it a few times :(</li>
    <li> When it comes to something I use frequently, I usually buy the best.  I have learned in my life that you usually get what you pay for and it&#x27;s worth it to spend the extra money to get quality.  So, I was leary about buying this because it didn&#x27;t cost much.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  It does everything the more expensive models do, so this is one time it would not have been worth it to spend more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, it makes beautiful curls!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I was done with my entire head in 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it!! The barrel is so smooth your hair literally just glides off and it gives the perfect structured curls!! Also the shipping was so quick and came when expected!!</li>
    <li> I love my Remington Curling Wand!  This wand is a little different than other curling wands I have used in that it tappers towards the end, however this makes your curls more natural looking.  It took a little bit of practice to get used to using it without my hair falling off, but once I got it down it is pretty easy to use now.  It has an adjustable temperature that goes as high at 400 degrees F, but it comes with a heat protecting glove to ensure you do not burn your hand.  Overall, I really like the results I get from this wand and feel it does a really good job of curling my long, thick hair.  It also leaves it looking shiny and healthy versus dry and burnt.  I highly recommend this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note:  I purchased this wand over a year ago and it is still in perfect condition and working just as well as it did the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I feel like I need to review this being that I purchased it for its rave reviews. It does a good job curling the hair (pretty quickly.) However, each time I use it, it leaves my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have long hair (almost to my hips) and this wand works amazingly! I get curls and they last! I doesn&#x27;t take very long... And I always get so many compliments.highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I agree with a reviewer who said it&#x27;s too slippery. I have really straight and shiny hair, it slipped each time I tried to curl it. Maybe, I&#x27;m just too inexperienced with this but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Great little curler - we use it often for my tween&#x27;s hair and it gives her cute little locks. Great price.</li>
    <li> I love this so much! Regular curlers don&#x27;t work and this does!! With a temperature of 410 degrees it can get really thick hair too! It makes beautiful curls and fast too! And the heating glove is wonderful because with out it I would have burnt myself a lot. I love this curler and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a wonderful curler at such a low price!</li>
    <li> I love my curl want. Make sure you wear the glove to protect your hand! There&#x27;s a small learning curve but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll have beautiful curls every time!</li>
    <li> Great wand I love it! Gets hot but thats what I wanted, and you can lock it so if you accidentally push off button which I do so often it no longer matters! Would buy again and as a gift!</li>
    <li> My friend got this wand for Christmas, so naturally I had to test it out with her! My hair is in between my elbow and shoulder, and medium-thick. I have a lot of layers, and all in all, it&#x27;s near impossible to curl. With my old curling iron, it&#x27;ll stay curled for about 2 hours before flopping out, and that&#x27;s with hairspray. When my friend used this wand on my hair, the curls were perfect sized and just the right amount of volume and bounciness, and the best part is, they stayed all day while we ran errands throughout town, and then into the next day AFTER I slept on the curls.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want long lasting, shiny, voluminous curls for a great price and not a lot of time, I&#x27;d highly recommend this! I can&#x27;t borrow my friend&#x27;s forever, so I need to get this ASAP!</li>
    <li> I love this wand! Curls are perfect, a lot of different options, many different heat settings. Glove isn&#x27;t really  necessary if you are smart about it. I have long hair that takes a curl fairly well. I can do my hair myself very easily after a few times of practice. Very good, especially for the price (on sale!)</li>
    <li> shipping was fast. Product works really great. Gives good bouncy curls. I love that it comes with gloves and use them because I burnt myself.</li>
    <li> Feel this iron is very difficult to use.  There is no clamp.  You must curl hair around wand with your fingers.  Very awkward.  I am a cosmetologist and am not happy with this.  I prefer an iron with a clamp to hold hair.  Will be returning and buying a different one.</li>
    <li> I really, really love this wand and suggest that anyone who is hesitant about getting one...well just get it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, the first time I used it I didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing. I made the curls way too high on my head and looked like a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;I went on youtube and looked up a video on how to use it...basically, you use your right arm OVER your head to make the curls on the left side of your head. I suggest looking up the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, use the glove. It doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t feel the heat at all but it is essential you use the it, unless you want burnt finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love the wand. It took a couple of times of practice but I eventually got it right and love it. Use it often and often get compliments.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and at such a low price. It is ceramic and curls hair wonderfully. It gets very very hot and comes with a glove. This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> this curling wand is very nice but it takes time to get used to it.  My hair is short so there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair to wrap around the wand.  I do enjoy that fact that I can do a few touch up curls before I rush off to work.  Really perks up my bedhead.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered on time. This curling wand heats up quickly and does the job well. I am very happy with my Remington CI95AC/2 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand, 1 Inch... Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great curling wand, the curls come out gorgeous and they last all day or longer.would definitely recommend. Great buy for your money. Amazon had it for a great price as well.</li>
    <li> I always wanted a curling wand and I love this one alot. Its definitely great quality and leaves curls wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have the one inch curling wand and I love it! I have very fine hair that would never curl, but one of my roommates had a curling wand styled curling iron(not this brand) and I was so shocked that it actually worked! I&#x27;m not sure what about this type of curling iron that allows my hair to curl while the classic clamp style never worked.&lt;br /&gt;I eventually bought this Remington Curling wand at target because it was one of the cheapest ones they had. I was worried going cheap would ruin the amazing effect the original had, but this one works just as great. I love the pink barrel, the fact that it tapers, and the temperature controls are the best I have seen on any other hair tool.&lt;br /&gt;I do have a problem with burning myself. I don&#x27;t like using the glove because I feel like I can&#x27;t grab my hair as well(which may be due to my very fine hair type) and so have suffered many burns. Luckily I heal quickly and do not have any lasting marks.&lt;br /&gt;I love how you can grab small sections of hair to create a tighter bouncier curl, or grab very large sections and get a nice loose curl.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with this curling iron that I am seriously considering getting the thicker 1 1/2 inch one as well, I would like to be able to experiment with that one to see if it is better or would give more natural curls, or maybe even alternate using both to have more randomized curl sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get so many compliments on my hair when I curl it with this wand that I try to curl my hair as often as I can!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use nothing but the curling wand  to curl my hair. It does not fry the ends of my hair,i I LOVE IT CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITH OUR !!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy and quite thick. For some reason my hair is very hard to curl and I end up spending over 2 hours trying to curl it and the results last no longer then a few hours. I&#x27;ve tried multiple curling irons and have even tried curling it with a few flat irons but nothing has worked. I ordered my Remington Curling Wand after reading many good reviews on it and watching a few tutorials via youtube. I just got it yesterday and tried it out last night. After leaving my hair on the iron for only 5 seconds I got a perfect curl that lasted over night! I even brushed the curls this morning and they didnt fall flat at all! I&#x27;m amazed with this curling wand and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied! For only about $25, why not try it! Trust me it&#x27;s definitly worth it!I personally think it works much better then conairs curling wand after trying both and reccommend it to anyone who has a hard time curling there hair or wants a perfect curl without spending too much money or too much time!Thank you Remington! You&#x27;ve mastered the art of curling! Oh, and the glove comes in handy too for those of us who are a bit clumsy and have a tendency to burn our fingers!LOL</li>
    <li> While this makes makes really cute spiral curls and holds better than a regular curling iron... if you have short hair it is very hard to use without burning yourself. Tried it on my daughters hair which is above shoulder length... I oould only wrap it around twice. It is very difficult to wrap the hair without burning her. And by the way it is extremely hot!! Much hotter than a curling iron. Make sure you hold it far away from your head!</li>
    <li> If you know how to use a curling wand, you&#x27;re good to go with this one! I was able to create flawless (and sexy) curls in under a half hour (my hair comes down to the middle of my back and is relaxed). The wand does get hot so I use it at 320 degrees along with a heat protectant. I like to count to 25 after having each strand wrapped around the lower end of the barrel so that I can get looser curls. If you want tighter, I suggest wrapping your hair closer to the top end of the wand. After brushing out the curls a bit and running my fingers through them, the look is perfect! No Shirley Temple curls over here! The wand does come with a glove which I haven&#x27;t used because I like to feel the heat through my hair as an estimate of when it&#x27;s done or if I need to go a little over the 25 seconds. Also, it&#x27;s easier to maneuver the wand without the glove. While curling my sister&#x27;s hair (at the 320 degree heat), the wand did touch my finger and it was red for the rest of the day but there were no serious injuries or blisters. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use my wand a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how it makes the curls.&lt;br /&gt;leaves my hair with a lot of volume</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT MY CURLS LASTED ALL WEEKEND, THIS CURLING WAND WAS EASY ON MY HAIR AND IT REALLY HEATS UP FAST.</li>
    <li> Love this wand curler takes me 10 mins to wand my hair</li>
    <li> I just purchased this wand after a long hunt! I have been unable to find it in stores and when I finally tracked one down, I immediately picked it up! The curls are wonderful and long lasting. Its very easy to use and beginner friendly. I have not used the glove, but I do see where it comes in handy since I burned my finger. I would have given five stars but the temp and power buttons are pretty easy to press while styling. Other than that, I love this wand and the Remington pearl line!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! She asked for this for her birthday and was not disappointed. Whenever she has curled her hair in the past it has usually flattened out within a few hours. Now it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love this tool it&#x27;s so quick and easy to get beautiful curls. It came quickly packaging was good. Everything about the purchase was great and I can definitely recommend this tool. Please watch my review on my YouTube channel @1sydoney for more details http://youtu.be/9ZJxHM2y4QQ</li>
    <li> theses are the best curlers i have ever had, they work better than any other curling iron, and the curl comes out perfect each time</li>
    <li> IT IS VERY EASY TO USE. LEAVES CURLS PERFECT. I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;THE GLOVE IS SO HELPFUL. I BOUGHT A WAND BEFORE AND THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST</li>
    <li> I usually prefer bigger curls so the bigger wand would be perfect for me, but i bought the smaller curling wand for my 13 yr old daughter. She loves it, it makes smaller curls.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It really holds my curls for such a long time (they last 3 days/2 nights). What I normally do is curl my hair at around 11pm (it takes 30 minutes to curl all my hair), and then I go to sleep without adding any hairspray. When I wake up, the curls are still there and a BIT looser, but still tight.</li>
    <li> This item works fabulous, appears just like it is in the picture and description . Its so convinent and makes my hair look the best its ever looked.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can curl my whole head of hair in under 15 minutes and I&#x27;ve definitely gotten compliments on how cute my hair looks! (And it was SO easy!) This curling wand makes perfect spiral curls!</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised! Love it! Easy and simple to use and I get the salon look! Great product, a must have.</li>
    <li> I been having this curling wand for a year and half now and I still love it just like new. Just be careful when using it, it gets hot really quick.</li>
    <li> My first go at a styling wand and it works fantastic. My hair hardly holds curl from a curling iron, it&#x27;s flat by the end of the day. With this wand, the curls are still intact the next day!</li>
    <li> I love these!! Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> love this wand.. makes perfect curls</li>
    <li> My first curling wand and I loooove it. My hair is thin and mid-back length,  but there&#x27;s a lot of it and for some reason it could never hold the curls. Even spiral curls end up like waves towards the end of the day, regardless of the sprays and products I used. This thing gets super hot, up to 410 degrees and I didn&#x27;t even have to use it up that high yet. It took many tutorials on YouTube and practice to use this thing correctly,  but it was definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve done those nice beachy curls, like the Victoria&#x27;s Secret models&#x27; hair, and also more tighter curls and each time they lasted til the morning after a night out.  Amazing!  It takes a while to get the hang of it,  but these curls come out way better than with the ordinary curling irons. No crimps whatsoever. Also, the pearl ceramic makes my hair look nice and shiny. I&#x27;m very happy I got this curling wand!</li>
    <li> Its not bad it is lightweight you do have adjustable heat setting an it does not take a long time to heat up. I have been using it for the last 4 days and I love it I have no problems with it an there is a 4 year manufacturer warranty!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I was freaking out because I burned two of my fingers (decided not to use the glove because my hair was slipping everywhere), and I didn&#x27;t have any clips to separate my hair. I just randomly curled whatever pieces of hair looked straight. As a result, the curls looked amazing (with some straight pieces still mixed in) but took soooo much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting clips for the sections and getting used to how this curling iron feels, I can now curl my hair so much faster and it always looks absolutely perfect! Make SURE you use a lower heat setting until you find what works for you because I saw a video where a girl was using this and burned a huge section of hair off. That would be horrifying!</li>
    <li> I have had this wand for about 2 years now and it is a miracle! I have very long and thick hair. I have never had any luck curling my hair. But this wand works wonders!!! You don&#x27;t even need to use the glove. I find that the glove just gets in the way. The trick is to point the wand down and wrap your hair around that way. This wand is so great I&#x27;m buying one for my best friend for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Works OK, but more difficult to use than the traditional curling irons.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing or using a curling wand and I am in love with it...I will never use a curling iron again.  This wand gives you the perfect curls that lasts all day and sometimes longer</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since this item was only $22 but I was very surprised at the results. First, it does get very hot. I thought that I would be OK and didn&#x27;t wear the glove it came with. Well, I had a few burns! Needless to say, I do use the glove now. And secondly, my curls were perfect! And because the rod has an increased barrel size, you can make big curls or small curls. It&#x27;s easy to adjust to the size you want. I think that this rod gives you the quality that you would expect from a more expensive brand. Because the rod gets pretty hot, the curls set and last longer. I slept on mine and the next day the curls were gone but I did have long loose waves. Almost California beach waves. I would recommend this product to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record: I have thick,curly hair. I first blow dryed my hair straight then curled with the rod. It took me 20 minutes to curl my whole head and I have A LOT of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems curling my hair. I leave the setting near 400 and it works perfectly! I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when I curl my hair!</li>
    <li> I live in the United States so anyone would assume that this product should fit into a regular sized American socket. I read all the directions thoroughly when I received this item. It did mention that if the socket would not take the plug, to flip the plug to the opposite side and try it that way. I understand that the plug is made bigger on one side for safety reasons, however, no matter which way I turned the plug, the socket would not take it. Such a disappointment considering the RAVE reviews this item got. I am also very skilled with hair and make up, the whole cosmetics thing, and I was really excited to try this out. Total bummer that the socket didn&#x27;t even take it. All the directions stated were that if the plug did not fit the socket to &#x27;call your electrician&#x27;? There is no way I am going to call my electrician and spend money on my house which is working perfectly fine. The sockets take every other plug I put into the wall. I would in no way spend money on an electrician for a problem with a curling iron. I returned the item for a refund.I just cannot express the disappointment, considering I had an event that weekend which I would have loved to curl my hair for..I wonder if this has happened to anyone else. I am really curious because I have not read any other reviews like this.</li>
    <li> Instead of spending hundreds to have someone curl my hair for my wedding, I bought this curler and literally got the same results in 20 minutes. It curled my hair perfectly and the curls did stay (with no hair spray!) I would highly recommend this product for your big day---or any day!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE ! I love curls sooo much and this is the correct tool ! I had to get used to the wand because I&#x27;m so used to the clip on curling irons but the glove it comes with helps a lot !</li>
    <li> Came quick! Work Fantastic! No problems. Worth the buy. Came to my door faster than I originally thought....I was surprised when it came. Curled my hair one day and it lasted for the next four.</li>
    <li> I kept hearing about how great curling wands are and wanted to see what all the fuss was about without spending a small fortune. My friend has this same brand and loves hers so I ordered it. It came in the time predicted and I love it. Works great and you don&#x27;t even need to use its hottest setting. I love it. :)</li>
    <li> Really liked this item, makes profesional looking curls. I am currently obsessed with curling my hair because of this!  I just wished i had bought a thicker wand.</li>
    <li> This deffinately takes a little getting used to.  I&#x27;m glad the glove is sent with it.  I&#x27;m sure I would have burned myself otherwise.  It is worth the time and effort because it does a beautiful job once you learn how it hold it.</li>
    <li> Curls to perfection this wand is awesome and it comes with a four year warranty I think I love it</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for this product. It arrived on time and she loves it.  She said its the best curling wand she has used.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought this would work for me but my hair is way too short.  I think I thought it would be easy to curl my hair but my hair is not even shoulder length.  It does get very hot and I can see when my hair gets longer I will be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I get my hair curled in half the time! I love it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 13 year old daughter. It arrived on the date stated. Very pleased with this product the only problem is that you can still feel the heat with the glove on. Other than that my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> This product comes exactly as it is described and works well too. However, it requires a lot of practice to learn how to curl your hair with a wand. If you are used to the clip style irons, you probably will not like this one. This is my first curling iron and am still trying to learn to use it. I have thick hair which gives out hard curls, I however want to have soft nice bangs. Any suggestions on how to achieve that would be greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature setting works fine and the pearl finish on the wand is excellent.</li>
    <li> Love it! It gets really hot so if you have thin hair watch out you will burn your hair up. I have thick coarse hair about down to my waist so it works great curls excellent and the curls actually last</li>
    <li> Love it. Very different style then with a reg curl iron. Gives &#x27;beachy&#x27; waves. Would definitely recommend this product. Yes</li>
    <li> Very happy,  imgot it before the date expected. Thanks u very much. I willmorder a other one soon for a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very straight, very fine (but lots of it) hair.  Traditional curling irons have never really curled very well and the curls would fall out in less than an hour.  She gets very tight curls with this that last until the next shampoo.  Highly recommend to those with hard to curl hair.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever! And I have tried many, many different ones! The curls stay forever. Kinda hard to learn how to use it properly, but after you get a hang of it, it&#x27;s the best thing ever!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter wanted a ceramic curling iron for christmas  Love getting on Amazon.com and finding everything I need for myself and gifts</li>
    <li> I used this on some virgin hair that I had, it curled like a dream. The curls lasted for literally days and days and all I did was out the hair in two buns at night. If I ever straighten my own hair again, I may use this to add a curl in there.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter.  She loves it.  no complaints.  Her hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well but with this curling wand it seems to hold all day long.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and Im black so its kinda nappy but managable. I always straightened my hair (AMIKA flat iron is the only thing that really works) but for some reason I hate the look of straight hair. However I dont know why but I cannot use a regular curling iron if my life depended on it (I actually burned my hair of like that girl on youtube did). Also I stopped going to the salon to save money. So I needed a way to curl my hair because I also couldnt figure out to do it with my amika flat iron. Point is this is the easiest way. My sister doesnt like the curls that come out but it is so easy it is worth it. It gets really how within 5 sec and the ceramic pink area stays clean. Ive seen people use other curlings wands but I like this one the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I say is beware youll burn yourself and not even know it until you see the mark a couple days later so make sure to keep it awaaaaay from your skin and scalp. Overall for $20-$25-$30 this is def worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this wand for 5 years 👌👌👌 favorite &amp; i have very long hair I curl the whole thing u look like a celebrity.  Take a strand wrap the whole thing around to ur scalp hold for 7 seconds . I have it on 280° -3 3OO°</li>
    <li> My daughter got this curling wand and she loves it. She has gone to her cousins house and they curled each others hair and they were both very impressed. She has used it on her own hair and freinds, relatives, etc. She LOVES it!</li>
    <li> I was hesitated to purchase this but I really like the outcome when curling my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t make this curling wand a replacement for my curling iron because I also really like the outcome of the curling iron. I recommend using this size curling wand if you want smaller and tighter curls.</li>
    <li> This was easy to use, got very hot, and resulted in some very pretty looking curls. Definitely recommend wearing the glove during use - it gets very hot and you have to hold your fingers very close the iron while curling. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Lovw it works the best my hair has never held curl before this. It is perfect for curls and waves and anything in between it is absolutely amazing.!!</li>
    <li> I bought this thing in October after much study and research as I had never used a curling iron.  I needed it for a heat friendly synthetic wig.  I still don&#x27;t know if it works as neither I nor friends with lots of \\&quot;iron experience\\&quot; could ever figure out how to use it.  The wig manufacturer stressed the need for a \\&quot;synthetic setting\\&quot; and a \\&quot;temperature lock.\\&quot;  How was I to know I needed a clamp to hold the hair?  The friends couldn&#x27;t make it work on the wig, on their hair, or on a test dummy&#x27;s hair.  One can start rolling the hair around the barrel but it all starts slipping off immediately.  Glove or not, burns are frequent as you&#x27;re clutching frantically trying to keep the hair wrapped on.  I boxed the thing up and it&#x27;s now another item collecting dust on a shelf and I&#x27;m back searching curling irons again.  As before, the cyber sales world seems to eschew complete listings of a product&#x27;s features so I&#x27;m sure it will be doubly hard to find one with the aforementioned qualities plus a clamp. If I ever manage to make a strand of hair roll around this thing and stay on it, I&#x27;ll let you know if it curled or not.  I supposed it could be recommended to those blessed with 8 asbestos and extremely dexterous hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wand for my daughter for christmas. She loves it! It is prefect and her hair is adorable. The wand was shipped very fast and in great condition! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The iron comes re packaged and the &amp;#34;heat glove&amp;#34; that came with my iron was not the glove shown  it was a cheaper non heat resistance glove that is not useable, the iron itself works fine but it certainly looks used as it has a few chips in the plastic around the heat element.</li>
    <li> I bought this wand and I must say the curls it makes are awesome. No spray needed and they stay for days. I recommended this product and my three sisters are getting one too ; )..</li>
    <li> I use this product when I go out and so far it has been a blessing.  I have learned to straighten my hair first and then use the wand for better curl results that look more like the models and actresses we see on TV.  I have naturally curly hair, actually great curls but it is nice to do something different once in a while and this wand does the trick, love that it heats up so quickly I don&#x27;t have to sit around and wait.  the glove is a blessing, I&#x27;m clumsy so it helps me not to burn myself too much, still got my wrist though.  May have to adjust temperature based on your hair, I use the hottest 410 degrees because I want quick results, that may not be the best for my hair though, I do not have thick course hair but actually thin manageable curls.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter.  She loves it.  It was as pictured - works great and was a great price. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the new ceramic wand.  It is easy to use and it works good on all hair types.</li>
    <li> I was able to use this iron twice before it died.  Even if it hadn&#x27;t it was difficult to keep the hair on the wand because the barrel was so slick and shiny.  After many burns and still needing to pull out my traditional iron I put it into my drawer.  The other day I pulled it out to try it again, plugged it in and nothing!  Dead!  I checked the plug and it was fine.  The irons digital thing would not turn on and nothing I did could fix it.  Since it had been sitting in a drawer the time had lapsed to get a refund.  There is no one in my home, children or otherwise that has touched this iron other than myself.  Its a terrible inferior product!  Save your money!  I will never by anything Remington again.  :(</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have super fine silky hair and often my hair doesn&#x27;t take curl very well or it falls out soon after.  This curling iron (though I use it on the low setting) seems to be hot enough to really set my hair.  And now it even keeps a lovely curl even on a slushy rainy day like today (usually on a rainy day my hair would just fall flat!  I wish there was a size between the two sizes they offer, I would prefer it to be slightly larger but not as large as the bigger one.  Also, my glove does not look like the glove in the image, the glove that came with my curling iron is a simple cotton glove.  I do think they could give a glove with some sort of heat retardant on it or something slightly more sophisticated.  But all in all I&#x27;m super happy with this curling iron!  And it is much cheaper then the $130 one I was looking at in Sephora but does the same job (the sales lady did a test on my hair)!</li>
    <li> SHIPPING WAS FAST ALTHOUGH WAS ALITTLE DISSAPOINTED WITH THE PACKAGING, I WISH IT CAME IN ITS ORIGINAL PACKAGE. ITS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT OPENING THE PRODUCT YOUR SELF TO REALLY BELIEVE ITS NEW, BUT OTHER THAN THAT PRODUCT WORKS FINE, NO ISSUES.</li>
    <li> I have to say it was a success! Much easier than using a regular curling iron (I can now curl my hair in half the time) however it was a little difficult to hold because my hair kept slipping down the barrel. Not sure if this is normal but I might go a little slower next time to make sure my hair is wrapping properly. I got the 1/2-1inch wand which made pretty tight curls, but I feel that if I went a size up the curls wouldn&#x27;t have held. Hmm hmm so I am going to try it again this weekend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great curler, but it&#x27;s not very easy to use. The product arrived in good condition and has been working well so far. It heats up well, but because you are handling it directly, it can burn you pretty badly regardless of the gloves, and it takes patience to coordinate and figure out how to get the curling effect you desire.</li>
    <li> I have thin, straight hair that never holds curl or stays how I want it to. All other curling irons I have tried leave me looking like a 5 year old, and then after a few hours later, the curls are all gone. This one is amazing! Because it gets thinner towards the end and you don&#x27;t have to clamp your hair down, the curls end up looking more sexy and natural. And they stay forever! I curled my hair in the morning, went to work all day, went out that night, went to bed and woke up the next morning and my hair was still curly. Also, even if you only have a few minutes, you can quickly do larger chunks of hair, and you get a nice beachy wave. It heats up in less than a minute. That being said, it gets SUPER hot, so wear the glove. I made the mistake of not wearing the glove, and I got a nasty burn. Other than that though, I could not be happier with this purchase and recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my girlfriends Christmas present and she absolutely loves it. I guess it&#x27;s time to get her the straightener now.</li>
    <li> My girls researched this wand and decided to purchase it themselves. They both love their purchase and use it daily!</li>
    <li> the quality of remington it is great i love it. great curl quickly and during last longer that anyone that i know</li>
    <li> It heats up quite fast.  Nice curls when you curl in the right direction.  Kind of wish it came with two gloves, but the glove definitely comes in handly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that I wish it were a little easier to handle...I burned my wrist pretty badly one day...but I guess that&#x27;s a user error. :-)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amaising really and in 10 day less . i&#x27;m very like it and i&#x27;m get ready for summer !</li>
    <li> Only curling iron that holds curls in my hair all day! Gets hot fast and only takes 20 minutes to curl hair. Would definitely buy again! Great price!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product and likes it very much.  She says that it curls her hair without burning it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite curling tool. I get really nice curls that easily hold all day long. After curling my whole head once I was a pro at using this.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly easy to use; heats up fast and curls really well</li>
    <li> Works great. Gave it as a gift to my friend and she adored it.</li>
    <li> This wand is amazing. I have never used a wand before, but figured it would be pretty easy. I like both large and small curls and it&#x27;s easy to get a medium curl and ringlets with this wand. It heats up super fast and stays hot. Some people have said the buttons are easy to accidentally push? You can lock the buttons by holding the &amp;#34;-&amp;#34; button and unlock the same way. A little padlock shows up on the digital screen. Remember that the glove is Not supposed to be used to Hold the wand, it&#x27;s a protection against grazes and accidental touches. This wand is worth the buy. It&#x27;s super cheap and easy to use. Just remember to experiment with heats. People&#x27;s hair reacts differently to different heat. 400 is almost certainly too hot for your hair. I comfortably use around 330, sometimes less if I have more time in the morning. Oh! And remember to experiment with the time your hair is around the wand. Some times will work better than others but you don&#x27;t want your hair on a high-heat object for longer than it needs to be. Just be patient because this wand is super versatile with hair types. I think wands are BEST suited for someone who wants something to redefine their natural curls BUT it works amazing for my plain wavy hair. Don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I have straight fine hair very soft and I can&#x27;t even wear a ponytail without it coming undone in half an hour and with this curling wand my hair stays curl for so long (+24hrs) without any styling product! Love it. Don&#x27;t know you guys but it works great for me (:</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. My hair.... has never EVER stayed when I curl my hair. THIS made my hair stay alll day and even the next day. It works like magic.</li>
    <li> This makes the best curls ever!!! But it damages your hair massively. I have thick middle eastern hair and this worked great.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Easy to use with glove</li>
    <li> My background with curling irons is...not impressive, to say the least. I love the way my hair looks when curled and I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with giving up on curling irons, in general. So, I tried the Remington TStudio Pearl. I absolutely love it! The curls were easy to achieve (especially after watching just ONE youtube video). You&#x27;d have to be a complete fool to mess this one up. My hair is fine and thin, so it only took me about 5-7 minutes to complete my entire head. I know with more use I&#x27;ll knock the time down quite a bit. I&#x27;ve already received several compliments on my hair!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for....not worth it!</li>
    <li> I curled my hair and got done in 20 mins compared to when i have done my hair before with a diffrent product took me 2 hours. Love this wand it is absolute amazing</li>
    <li> I got this curling wand for a good price and it works fantastic. The shipping was also a day earlier than what I expected which was great. Prob took them two days tops to get it to me. Anyway I am very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick, long and curly hair, before I curl my hair I always have to straighten it first. When I curled it before it would fall limp after 3 hours or so. With this curling wand I curled my hair on wen and it stayed until saturday!!! BEST WAND EVER!!</li>
    <li> I ordered it because my friend and I wanted to curl our hair differently. the curls come out amazing and very easy if you do it right</li>
    <li> I love this wand, it has tempuratures for all types of hair. Even after a full day the curls are still there they look better when they drop.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I used my friend&#x27;s for the first time and i loved it! Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WAND IT WORKS GREAT WITH MY WEAVE OUTRE PURPLE PACK! AND IT DOESNT TAKE LONG TO CURL AND THEY LAST</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling wand because the reviews were great and the price was low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need a high heat to set the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes seconds to set a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thickness, virgin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also watched many videos on youtube to get the appropriate technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF!</li>
    <li> The curls are nice and bouncy. Last a long time and I didn&#x27;t have to roll my hair and sit under the dryer to get them. Great product.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas Gift and love it. I did just recently buy a new one bc my hair has got longer. No complaints about it tho. It&#x27;s a great hair tool!</li>
    <li> Very good curer! I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand!</li>
    <li> My friend recently used one of these on my hair. She paid over $100 for hers. I got this one and it works just as well as hers did!! Granted Im not as skilled as she is with it so I need to practice getting the right kind of curl for me (kept making them too tight when I just wanted beach type waves) but it still looks cute! Its idiot proof!! With a little practice I&#x27;ll have it perfected! I burned myself a few times but I do that with my straightener too so it&#x27;s to be expected until you perfect your craft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been about a year and I still use this on a regular basis! I have learned how to make all different types of curls with it, whether tight or loose, and it still works as perfectly as it did the first day I bought it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy girl right here!! :)</li>
    <li> Did not come in a Remington box. Some off brand version that had no name brand. The wand itself says Remington but the packaging makes me nervous it&#x27;s a knock off or grey market.</li>
    <li> Great product quality. We must be careful not to burn however use it without the safety glove brings. The curls are very good and can be of different styles.</li>
    <li> Love this curler! Be sure to use the gloves included as wand gets really hot and can burn. Makes nice tight curls that lasts 2 days (and my hair is usually very hard to curl, it&#x27;s dead straight)! Heats up very quickly. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome curler. I have thicker,longer hair and this curls my hair super fast (about 5 seconds per section) and it looks great! Definitely gives you those Taylor Swift curls. Mine did come with a glove, although I didn&#x27;t use it. You can choose the temperature setting, which I like a lot but I just put it on the highest temperature possible. If you aren&#x27;t used to wrapping your hair around a cone curler, I would use the glove first and go slower because it is very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a heat mat because I tend to curl and then just set my tools down on my counter top. Overall I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My  girl is very happy and look like an actress</li>
    <li> This wand is truly remarkable!  This was my first time purchasing a wand &amp; i am very happy with the item. I have thick straight hair that has never really been able to maintain a curl for a day but with this wand i was able to keep curls for 2 days before i washed them away. Yes there is a learning curve but isn&#x27;t it like that with most beauty related skills. Its not going too be a work of art on your first try, but this wand gives you the tools necessary to get beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> Small barrel fast shipping</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, a little flimsy, not high quality but does the job I guess .</li>
    <li> Its what i expected. Have to use hairspray to keep the curls in. Makes nice waves. It doesn&#x27;t take very long to do, but i would&#x27;nt try to make spirals.</li>
    <li> My hair usually only holds curls when its dirty.. but i washed my hair the night before and a friend tried this wand on it, the curls held for 3 days before I washed them out! That never happens on clean hair for me! I was really impressed with the product, it made beautiful ringlets. Just ordered mine and can&#x27;t wait to get it! I have not used it on myself yet so not sure abou how awkward it is to use but I&#x27;m sure practice makes perfect! I have layers and my friend had no trouble using it on my hair (sectioning it horizonally). It was beautiful!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand. Aside from being very pretty, it is super easy to use. I practically never do much to my hair because it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well and this made my hair shiny and it actually held. I used this on easter for my daughtwrs hair that is thick and heavy, it looked beautiful and only takes about ten seconds each section</li>
    <li> Although it takes some time to learn to use without burning yourself (yes a glove is included but its annoying) I LOVE LOVE LOVE my hair wand, and it was delivered earlier than expected time:)</li>
    <li> This hair wand meet my expectations and more heats up very quickly and the curls come out great I couldn&#x27;t believe how long the curls last they can last for days this is a great hair wand and I will be recommend to friends</li>
    <li> It was hard for me to work with this tool.  It heats up well.  Most of the issue is me not the tool.</li>
    <li> Let me start with how I am awful with hair. I cannot style it to save my life. However, this is so easy to use and it makes my hair look awesome! My friends comment and I feel accomplished!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome features? It can &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; in the temperature so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off. It goes up to 410 degrees Fahrenheit and the curls hold all day! Normally, my hair loses it&#x27;s spring quickly but with this it holds, even when I&#x27;m outside sweating for 6+ hours for colorguard (band).&lt;br /&gt;Learn from my mistake though, don&#x27;t sneeze while using this around your forehead. I did, lurched forward, and burned myself! It left a mark for a few days like Harry Potter&#x27;s though so everything ended well.</li>
    <li> My sister and I both have very fine straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls. I got this for her as a birthday present last november and just had to buy one for myself after using hers. I don&#x27;t know why, but for some reason when I use this wand instead of a normal curling iron, my super-straight past shoulder-length hair actually stays curly with minimal hair spray involved! I don&#x27;t really use the glove that comes with the wand. I&#x27;ve used my sister&#x27;s iron a few times and havent burned myself yet.</li>
    <li> I use this item everytime I go somewhere fancy. It is true it can be vicious a burn you badly but you have to be very careful and wear the glove that is provided at least until you get your technique down. It makes curling your hair much faster and the curls stay in a lot longer than typical curling irons.</li>
    <li> Works really well! Gives you great smooth curls! You can make tight spiral curls or loose way curls. I have long hair so I don&#x27;t know how easy it is to use on shorter hair but the barrel goes from wide to narrow and the glove helps keep you from burning you hands so I bet it would work well on medium length hair as well.</li>
    <li> This wand works great. Gets very hot so glove that comes with it comes in handy.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is absolutely amazing. I have never been able to curl my own hair and now I get perfect curls everytime with the Remington Curling Wand!! Also my hair never held a curl but now I get all day curls which is mind blowing. Truly amazed at how well this wand works. The only thing that bothers me is the glove that comes with it. Bulky and makes my hair have static, I have very fine hair. So I never use the glove.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended a curling wand like this to me so that my curls will last for days. This definitely does that! However, it is tricky to learn to use. Also, the temp control (which I like that it is adjustable) does not lock, and it is located right where my hand is while curling, so I am always accidentally changing the temp when I don&#x27;t want or intend to. Additionally, the wand is &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; for my long hair. I believe this is standard, but I have long hair, and it is difficult to keep my hair from sliding down the tapered wand and can leave my hair frizzy or not with even curls. I am debating if I want to keep this wand (and practice more) or if I will return it for a larger wand where the temp is not as easy to change....</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too thin and it gets smaller the only curls you can do is the tswizzle ones and those ain&#x27;t too nice</li>
    <li> I learned of this curling wand watching you tube tutorials. i must say this curling wand does wander to straight hair, the curls last for days with proper care.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this and she loves it. Uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I got this curling iron for my 15 year old daughter and she absolutely loved it! She gets compliments every time she uses it, I definitely recommend this to anyone :)</li>
    <li> This curling iron is excellent - it creates both natural waves and curls. AND the curls stay in my hair longer than with a regular iron.</li>
    <li> My hair NEVER curls with any other curling iron. I&#x27;ve tried multiple hair products, mousse, hairspray, you name it. Nothing would help the curl stay. With this, all I need is a little heat protectant and the curls seriously last all day. I assume it&#x27;s because the heat gets distributed evenly which is why the curls stay so long. Love it!</li>
    <li> Sooooo good! The curls stay in for as many days as you need them to. I have very thick, wavy hair and I used to take an hour to curl my hair and now it takes about 30 minutes!</li>
    <li> Okay so first of all this curling wand is AMazing . I oWN 9 HEAT products and i have to say this is my favorite IT HEATS  up so fast. super light and makes beautiful curls. I recommend this product i mean come on for this price itS a MUST</li>
    <li> I was a bit sceptical bying this because i bought one before (different brand) and it was a deffected. but to my surprise this one is awesome. it gets very hot very quickly... i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I finally decided to get this curling wand for myself after many of my friends got one.  It works better than any curling product I&#x27;ve ever owned and its what your l</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I was running late today and was able to get my hair curled in less than 15 minutes. It takes some time to get use to using a wand, but you won&#x27;t regret this product. I&#x27;m the girl who&#x27;s worn her hair board straight since I was a kid. I have at least 6 curling irons sitting in my cabinet that made me think my hair just won&#x27;t curl. This wand is amazing! :)</li>
    <li> Made beautiful curls that lasted days, beautiful hairstyle even when slept on and messed up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it and recommend it to everyone for the price.</li>
    <li> this is winderful, you can curl your hair in 10 mins or less and i am no pro, it heats up very very fast, the glove was a plus as well and the shi[[ing was fast and for the price i am really surprised......i think anyone who buys this will love it :-)</li>
    <li> After reading alot of reviews and watching a video on YouTube I decided to get this wand!! And boy am I glad that I did :)))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just arrived today so I decided to try it out tonight and see how it worked! It literally is so easy, wrap your hair around the wand hold for like 10 seconds and you have gorgeous curls!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly fine , flimsy, static hair but it worked a treat! Personally I used the highest temp and didn&#x27;t use too thick of sections at a time, it only took 15 minutes to do and for first go worked great!! You definetly need the glove to avoid burning the tip of your finger! I would also recommend using heat protection spray on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all would highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps you!!</li>
    <li> This styler is amazing. If you are looking for ringlet cities, this is the product for you. A little strange to get use to using being as there is no handle by design but it doesn&#x27;t take long to master the craft. Totally love this iron! Well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She loves it!  It gives her curls that last and last.  A regular curling iron cannot make the curls that this one does.  Regular curling irons can make puny curls that fall out in less than an hour.  This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> This curling iron works very well - the curls hold up for at least a day if not two.  However, if you curl the hair around the top, the curls are extremely small.  I wish I would have gone up a size.  With that being said, it still works well if you try and wrap most your hair around the wider part at the bottom.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick and it does great job with curls which stay on all day. I did not even use any spray to hold the look. Very light and slik design.</li>
    <li> This works great. it keeps my hair curled upto 3 days. And its alot cheaper then other curlers:) :) !!</li>
    <li> This wand is the best one you&#x27;ll get. You can have small to large curls that will last forever. It takes like 30 seconds to heat up and 10 minutes to curl. I have naturally straight hair that reaches my belly button and my curls have never fallen flat. You don&#x27;t need to use any product with this! And the way to use the wand is pretty self explanatory, it&#x27;s a bit ridiculous that some need to watch YouTube videos. Buy it! It&#x27;s cute and amazing!</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. I was looking for a good quality curling wand that caused be use to curl my thick hair fast and I got it! I totally recommend this product to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Advice to new users, there are many good instructional videos on you tube.  Gets very hot, burnt fingers the first few times until I got the hang of it.  I have shoulder length hair.  My daughters hair is much longer.  It worked great on both lengths.  The curls last all day without hairspray.  My hair is somewhat fine, this is the first thing that has given me curls that last.  I have not noticed any damage to my hair, but dont use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how many curling irons I&#x27;ve purchased and had to throw away, or return. I think this one cost me $35 in store, so on amazon it&#x27;s definitely a great deal. This is the best drugstore curling iron I&#x27;ve ever tried. And it&#x27;s cute too (: If you&#x27;re considering it, purchase it!</li>
    <li> A great wand for a great price. A soon as you plug in the wand you can feel it heating up.</li>
    <li> very easy to use. lightweight. Fast curls. Yet i  feel like curls do not last long. I tried it when my hair is clean, not that clean, with some extra hair product. Unfortunately at the end of the day, i kind of lose the curls. It is not like i lose them all together but it does not look like i have even used curler! And i have wavy-curly hair!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely am in love with this curling wand, it works amazing, I definitely would recommend this item to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> This gave me great looking curls . Practice makes perfect. I would definitely recommend this . If you are having trouble look on youtube for tutorials.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. I have never been good at using curling iron and even though I don&#x27;t wear my hair out or curled much; I tried this wand on my transistioning hair at the temp set when it arrived and it got hot immediately.  I didn&#x27;t have to comb or brush out my hair.  I just unbraided it, finger detangled through once and wrapped around the wand and my thick type 4 transistioning hair had a straight, shiny , beautiful, bouncy curl.  I love this wand!!! This is probably the best heating tool I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  And at $19.99, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Even if it&#x27;s more don&#x27;t let that stop you.  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  It is super easy cause even a fumble fingers like me can use it. But just for safety, it comes with a handy dandy glove.  I think I&#x27;ll even order the bigger one.  As if you couldn&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend this wand.</li>
    <li> I love Remington products. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed by their product yet. It&#x27;s a great price &amp; you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I love love love it.  Easy to use.  Inexpensive.  Worth it. I&#x27;m no stylist but, this thing is the best. ..</li>
    <li> looks fab, does a great job on my tresses! Watch the heat though it can get really hot if not set correctly.</li>
    <li> works wonderful and a lot better than my curling iron, and it works and keeps my curls together and for longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Easy to use, looks great, heats up quickly. I highly recommend buying this item! Creates high volume curls</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t curl/straighten my hair that often because it dries out my already damaged hair from coloring. When I style my hair though, I make sure to use tools that get to the right temp (~400 F degree) fast. This curling wand def. gets to the right temp pretty fast and can be very versatile as it can create both loose and tight curls. One thing I&#x27;d like to add is better instructions. I watched a bunch of Youtube multiple times before I can use this wand properly. It may look simple but def. need lots of practices to get it right.</li>
    <li> I have waist length (heavy!), poker straight hair and this will make curls that last all day. Just use the glove.  Really, it&#x27;s hot!</li>
    <li> I was wary of curling irons for a long time after getting burned by one when I was young. It had been about 15 years since anyone curled my hair, and I had never done it myself. I would also consider myself a fairly klutzy person, so if anyone would burn themselves, it would be me. I chose this curling iron because I like the ceramic finish and I didn&#x27;t want to fuss with the clamp kind. As a curling novice, the tapered barrel seemed like a useful feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I burned myself once the first time I used it, but since then have not, and I don&#x27;t use the glove. I take my time and go slow. I would not use this if I have less than 20 minutes to curl all of my hair. If I have less time, I just curl the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly like the tapered barrel. I have long hair and my hair slides down a bit as I am winding it around. There are ways around it but that requires more effort so I usually just let it happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use some anti-frizz cream after curling to keep my curls smooth, but I am fairly satisfied with the finish of the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers who suggest that you give yourself some time to get used to the curling iron, be patient, watch tutorials, etc. If you do all of this, there you should be able to get a good result, even as a novice like me.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is awesome! It heats up very quickly, has a convenient prop built in that keeps it from laying directly on the counter, has a long power chord (meaning I have room to move around while I curl my hair), a cute modern look, and leaves beautiful curls that stay all day, with or without hairspray. It is worth paying a little extra to get such an awesome curling wand. I would recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter - this is a hit!!!!  She uses this almost daily and the curls are great.  Highly recommend this product, however watch a tutorial on how to use - she burned her fingers (not seriously) before she got the hang of it.  Yes, it comes with a glove - but it&#x27;s awkward.</li>
    <li> tbh one of the best cheapest curling irons I ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;Curls your hair perfectly, although u gotta be very careful not to burn yourself (like I did ) with the wand it helps to use the glove..</li>
    <li> i had cancelled this product to order the thinner wand but it had already been request to ship signs i had the 2 day free shipping it came exactly in 2 days when i got it i liked it but didnt work to good (2 weeks ago) then Yesterday i watched videos on Youtube and the Tutorial came up. my boyfriend was coming to visit for Valentines day i wanted to give it a second chance so i can do something different. so from watching videos i finally got a hold of it. i loved the curls i got and my boyfriend loved it  :) . so if you cant get a hold of it watch YouTube tutorials theres plenty and practice</li>
    <li> I got this after seeing my niece use one. She used it to curled my hair for a wedding with it. It does a good job, but you have to be careful if you are doing it yourself....very easy to burn  yourself. I wouldn&#x27;t even bother with the glove that comes with it. I have one of the oven proof gloves that I use. It fits well enough that I can still manipulate the iron. Heats up very quickly. You also have to be careful not to hold it in one spot for too  long or the curl will be very tight.</li>
    <li> This is cheap and does the trick, curls my hair in seconds and lasts for days, when no other curling iron could as my hair is very thick, be careful the iron goes up to 410 degrees and I have a scar on my hand from only touching my skin for a moment, use gloves!!</li>
    <li> in this wekend used and the curling is perfect, delinead and brillant, its complete whit a hand protector is perfecft</li>
    <li> After all the great reviews, I was super excited to receive this product!  I have very fine, smooth, &amp; slightly wavy hair.  I have to admit, when styling my hair, I look for the least time consuming methods.  The majority of the time, I just allow it to air dry and I&#x27;m good to go.  The greatest extent I&#x27;ll go is to quickly straighten it.  Fortunately, I was blessed with a hair type that allows me to do this otherwise I&#x27;d be in trouble!  I&#x27;m extremely inept when it comes to styling it.  I&#x27;ll watch tutorial videos and such, but my hair just winds up a mess or will completely fall flat within the hour due to it&#x27;s fineness!  I always envied others who could style their hair with what seemed like such little effort.  In these past 20 some years I have not come close to even slightly mastering the use of a curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add that I have had no prior experience with curling wands.  Immediately after this product was delivered, I was way too excited so I quickly opened the box and plugged it in.  It warmed up within a few minutes and I was ready to go!  I begin sectioning off my previously unstyled, air dried hair, held each section for no more than a few seconds on the wand, and had my entire head done in less than 10 minutes.  I now have the gorgeous, healthy looking beachy waves, that I&#x27;ve so long desired, rather than my boring, flat hair...this is absolutely phenomenal to me!  The curls have held up extremely well and I did not even have to use any products!  I&#x27;m looking forward to creating other styles with this wand.  Amazing product, especially for it&#x27;s low cost!  I will definitely be recommending to others!</li>
    <li> Love it...i recommend this product. All my orders came in less than a week. The tracking details thru my cellphone was the best!</li>
    <li> She loved it over the one I had to return for her that was $99.00. She liked this one soooooo much better.</li>
    <li> Just like I expected... took me some time to get the hang of it but now I figured it out.</li>
    <li> Out of my whole entire life, I finally found the the wand that could really curl my hair. And stay curl for 2weeks(max) I have very fine hair and its straight. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this wand... Recommended to buyers!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this curling iron won&#x27;t be of much use to me at the moment. Am in the process of letting my hair grow from very short and it is still not quite long enough to put this item to much use.  The price was good and am sure I am going to love using it when my hair has the time to grow a bit longer.</li>
    <li> this is a great curling wand. its heats up fast and is a great value for the price.  You can also make your curls loose or tight.</li>
    <li> i love it, works prefect, you can make your hair so fast. this is the best curling hair that i buy.</li>
    <li> When I first received the wand it did not come with a glove. But I contacted the seller and they fixed the problem, so I should be receiving a glove today! I like the wand but I kept burning myself without the glove, but it should be alright once I have the glove.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly, and it works perfectly. its better than i thought it would be to be completely honest. so happy with it.</li>
    <li> Its actually really easy, gives tighter curls that I wanted but for my shorted hairs its great.....what I have been doing is curling it really quick and combing it out and it looks like beach hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really hot.....I was very stupid and didn&#x27;t check the plug as im in Australia - but purchased an adaptor for 99c on ebay</li>
    <li> I love how this curling iron is so easy to use!! It always makes beautiful curls and is so simple.</li>
    <li> Yes this is my first wand and I absolutely love it. It works great I love it my little sister loves it and so does my cousin :)</li>
    <li> I love it!!! so easy to use...</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it but after playing around with it I got just the curls/waves I was looking for. Heats up fast and can leave you with a curl that actually holds. My mom got a hold of it and has since asked for one too; so for the great price it is a must buy.</li>
    <li> HELL NO are u serious !!! That is a joke no thank you...</li>
    <li> I liked the curls i got when i did it correctly but it was hard to do correctly. my hair is thick and very hard to curl. the curls actually did stay in relatively well, but they were hard to do and only looked ok. i loved the high heat and pearl ceramics though</li>
    <li> Works excellent! Gets hot very fast, I&#x27;d say within a minute, holds heat really well, and makes perfect curls. Very satisfied. What I especially love is not having to &amp;#34;clamp&amp;#34; down on the hair like the cheap metal ones from like the 19th &#x27; s. Also has a temperature reading and electronic power on/off. Very reasonable price for something that seems salon quality.</li>
    <li> a good curling wand, make sure to wear the gloves so you don&#x27;t burn yourself</li>
    <li> Great I love this product</li>
    <li> I love this wand so much it&#x27;s been almost two years and it works perfectly</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME! i lovee it.. at first its kind of dificult to use, but i just got used to it. and it works on all types of hair.. im african american and it worked perfect on my real hair (which is relaxed) and worked perfect on my extensions! Just be sure not to put the temp too high so it doesnt melt your hair. And the curls last for about a week and 1/2 with much product in your hair, and longer with product! it was actually harder to use with the glove so i barely use the glove now. but the iron is worth it! i recommend!</li>
    <li> This works great!  The glove is unraveling some after 2 months only, but is still functional.</li>
    <li> I adore this tool with all my heart. My hair has always been pin straight and super thin, but this wand works magic. Lightweight and easy to maneuver, I can create curls of multiple sizes on my barely shoulder length hair that really stay. No creases, no fuss.</li>
    <li> Love this iron! So easy to use</li>
    <li> i really love this wand I have 20 inch hair extensions and nauturally short hear. i curl my extensions while doing each section and clip em in while i do another section if that makes any sence lol well I have the wider one and only takes 30 minutes as to a regular curling iron that takes 2 hours that will not hold a curl but this wand holds a curl and I love it I love this wand!!</li>
    <li> Great wand! Heats up quickly and creates beautiful curls</li>
    <li> Received just as described. I haven&#x27;t used it yet- can&#x27;t wait to!</li>
    <li> I love this iron, my waves stays for a week, it&#x27;s amazing. And doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
    <li> It works. I just didn&#x27;t like the way the curls looked. I watched a bunch of youtube videos on it- but still wasn&#x27;t happy with how the curls seemed to always have awkward angles to them. I ended up having a lot better success with just wrapping my hair around a closed curling iron.</li>
    <li> Amazing, my sister liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> I get tight curls. Easy to use. I like the glove it comes with which helps a lot and prevents me from burning my finger. You can control the temperature.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a total amateur so i&#x27;ve burned myself a few times. it does get very hot and the glove is kind of hard to use. i could be doing it wrong. but the curls are quite nice. small curls.</li>
    <li> My sister got this as a gift and her step sister said that she loves it. It came within a good time and apparently it does what it needs to. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a curling wand.</li>
    <li> Best wand I&#x27;ve ever tried! The cord is very long,  it comes with a heat glove which takes some time getting used to but serves its purpose excellently, it has has multiple temperature levels for different hair textures and the best part is how the barrel goes from large to small giving excellent curling variations</li>
    <li> all went well would purchase from this seller again</li>
    <li> My Wife loves this. She has very straight hair and she told me this is the only thing that can curl her hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a day late and a dollar short when it comes to finding out about things.  I know this product had a huge following on youtube the last few years...when I happened to be googling products that work for curly hairstyles.  My hair is thick, with frizzy and not well defined curls. I am mixed race, so I have that in-between hair, however unlike my luckier counterparts with perfect little corkscrew sprials, mine has different curl patterns through out, straight on the very top, big  loose curls on the top layer with kinkier \\&quot;healthier\\&quot; curls below ....coupled with the fact a hairdresser snuck in a lye relaxer a few years ago. My hair needs help. I can&#x27;t be a wash and go type of girl....I needed something to \\&quot;finish\\&quot; my look and also tame and define.  I read all reviews I could find on this product here at Amazon as well as other sites. I&#x27;m glad that I took the chance! I&#x27;m really excited about my hair today, and today was a bad hair day for me untill delivery showed up.  My hair was frizzy and in a bun due to the humidity and I brushed it out before use... but if I could snap a picture of the after I&#x27;m ready to go out and show it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- does what it claims to! Heats up super fast. a great product for girls with curls that need to finish the look of thier hair OR want a different curl look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-the stand that holds it up,  sometimes gets tangled in my hair when I&#x27;m creating curls. This was my first time using it and hopefully I will learn to avoid that every time. It should be able to be pushed in and away from the barrel when in curl mode. Also I dropped it twice, I&#x27;m a klutz but it could use a grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning Curve- I&#x27;m a pro when it comes to my own hair but I&#x27;m not a great hair styler, I do not blow my own hair out,as I am impatient and my arm gets tired.  I figured this out in less than 5 mintues and only one burn to prove it:) It does get reallly hot so the glove is a must.  If your adept at using a clamp curler this will be no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suggestions: Once I got into the groove of using it, I realized that instead of forcing my hair around the slippery barrel,I would very gently curl it around, while at the same time twisting the way I would use a clamp iron and then let the hair slide on it&#x27;s own down the barrel naturally while keeping hold of the tiny end of my hair. the curl came out perfect and it was much easier. sounds complicated but it was easy.be no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suggestions: Once I got into the groove of using it, I realized that instead of forcing my hair around the slippery barrel,I would very gently curl it around, while at the same time twisting the way I would use a clamp iron and then let the hair slide on it&#x27;s own down the barrel naturally while keeping hold of the tiny end of my hair. the curl came out perfect and it was much easier. sounds complicated but it was easy.</li>
    <li> I never used curling iron before. I went yo my salon and had my hair curled it looked great! My MIL gave me curling iron but I think the barrel is too big and heat settings not so great. I recently went to wedding when someone mentioned the Remington Curling Wand. So I decided to buy one. It works great. I have shoulder length thin hair and I now have perfect curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SOOOOOO LOVE this product</li>
    <li> Love the way it works if can hold it w/out burning my fingers hands . Dont try touching even w/heat glive (no help at all for heat better off using winter gloce if any</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this iron helps me to tame my frizz and add definition! I recommend this iron!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this thing! I love the type of curls I get from it! It reminds me of the wave you get after having your hair French braided. Super cute. Beware, I have several burns on my hand and arms for not using the glove that comes with it...I will be using it from now on! ha!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a stylist...for a June wedding</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way my hair curled with this wand. I got so many compliments. This is the only curling iron that&#x27;s worked on my coarse hair. I was skeptical at buying it at first because of how cheap it was but boy am I glad I didn&#x27;t spend $50 or more on expensive brand wands this one works just like a salon product believe me I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I&#x27;m picky with tools. This charming tool is a def. keeper. Ty amazon!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great tool.  Just be careful of your fingers.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a product that would give my hair big waves (I&#x27;d seen someone else do a demonstration video using this particular iron), but it did not. It works great for my 7 year old daughter who has very straight and long hair - she gets quite the adorable Taylor Swift-ish curls look going. For me, the curls are way too tight and give me more of a Shirley Temple times 10 look... Not what I had in mind, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it for the little one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a great product works miracles. ....</li>
    <li> My friend had this iron and I fell in love after using this one time. The curls are very natural and look great. Be careful as this iron gets hot!</li>
    <li> HOLY MOLY!  I had just about given up on curling my hair, because my hair refuses to hold a curl for more than 10 minutes, hairsprays don&#x27;t agree with my skin, and I am totally incompetent with curling irons.  This has been a godsend.  I have very fine straight oily hair and before this the only way for me to have curls that last would be to get a perm.  With some upcoming special events, I decided to give curling irons one more try, so I did a bunch of research and decided on this baby for it&#x27;s affordable price and steller reviews.  I was not disappointed.  All I do is spray on some heat protectant, brush my hair, and curl away.  I&#x27;m still a bit clumsy using this, but it is soooo much easier than the regular curling irons w/ a clamp.  It only takes me about 15 mins, so if I can use it, anyone can!  The curls last until I wash my hair (which is everyday, but I think it can probably last longer) even without hairspray or mousse.  I&#x27;m so happy with this that I am finally writing my first ever Amazon review &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I always used to use a straightener to curl my hair, but the curls would fall apart in a few hours, even with hairspray. With this, they stay for 2 days, no product necessary. It&#x27;s really fast and easy to do. Just make sure you don&#x27;t straighten your hair first because that might make them fall apart.</li>
    <li> I would like to return it. It doesn&#x27;t heat up as it should. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied. I would not recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is perfect - can deliver tight curls or beachy waves in minutes, even with my unruly and fine hair. The styles stay in place all day, even without hairspray. And it couldn&#x27;t be easier to use. I&#x27;m not at all fashion-literate and even I figured it out with minimal effort. Anyone who likes curling her hair should check this out.</li>
    <li> This came quickly and works amazing! Heats up really fast and curls my hair perfectly! Took me a couple of tries to master the &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; but after I figured it out curls came out amazing. For the price I paid I definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> makes my curls in seconds. light and quick</li>
    <li> This curling wand is amazing! I have never used a wand before, but when I saw the reviews on this one and my old regular curler wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore I decided to try it! I am so glad I did! True the first time getting used to curling my hair with this was a little ruff. However the curls always come out looking amazing! Once you wrap it around it only takes 5 sec for each strand to be perfectly curled.This one definitely will give you fairly tight curls. But if you want a looser curl go the size up. The great thing about this is that my hair stays curled for 3 days! I have never had such good results! The glove that this comes with means well but I find it too hard to grab and wrap my hair around the wand so I don&#x27;t use it at all. You don&#x27;t really need the glove once you get used to how to hold it and everything. Definitely will be recommending this and I have gotten so many compliments!</li>
    <li> The curling wand is pretty, heats fast and gets super hot. I however cannot figure out how to use it properly. My hair just slips down the barrel no matter what- not the products fault. If your clumsy and not beauty tool gifted may not be for you but I will practice more 😊 it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to get my hair to hold a curl. This beautiful thing does it in no time and it stays curled all day.</li>
    <li> The wand is so slick that my hair kept sliding down to the narrowest part of the cone, which was frustrating. It took me an hour to curl all of my hair because of that. I have hair that is almost at my waist, so I need the full length of the barrel in order to curl my hair. This doesn&#x27;t work well for me. I have naturally curly hair but thought I would give his a try to see if I could get larger curls. I might try one that is not a cone shape and has a wider barrel.</li>
    <li> This is the first curling iron/wand that has ever worked well enough for my hair to hold the curl. The curls stay in all day!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t believe any of the one star reviews, this is an amazing product. First of all, the glove is not meant for you to be able to touch the hot barrel with. It is simply to provide SOME protection while your hand is in close proximity to it. Second, yes, the barrel is slick but it&#x27;s not as slick as people make it seem. I have thick long and curly hair that is extremely resistant to hold curls and this curling wand is the first tool I&#x27;ve found that actually makes my hair stay curly for longer than 20 minutes. And it&#x27;s so quick and easy. For the price of this product, I am EXTREMELY happy with what it is capable of. Best $20 I ever spent. I will definitely buy a new one if mine ever breaks.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  It makes the best spirals for any length of hair.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected it to be. I just wish it was a little thicker but if you don&#x27;t keep your hair wrapped for too long, literally only a couple seconds it will give you soft flowing curls and I have very thick very frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> work excellent heats super quick</li>
    <li> My hair looks fabulous!!! The curls looked amazing!</li>
    <li> it stop working after one use and it just seem like i wasted my money on nothing it worked great but it just stop working</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle gets hot.&lt;br /&gt;The gloves is very thin and doesn&#x27;t prevent your hands from getting burnt.&lt;br /&gt;There is no clip to hold the hair in place around the barrel. Hence, your fingers gets burnt wrapping your hair around.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use by yourself would be better if you had someone to help you and glove that came with it did not protect me from getting my hand burned</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT... WILL RECOMEND..</li>
    <li> Product is just too darned hot!!  Daughter burnt her arm severely the first time she used it and never used it again.  Although it comes with a glove to hold the end, it is difficult to use.  If you have long hair, beware!!!</li>
    <li> I love this. It made my hair so curly! I am not very fond of the glove because it is a little hard to grip the hair, but I burned myself a few times trying to use it without. It is a learning process. But overall I love it!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I got this curling wand for christmas and it has work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;It takes me a little longer because I have thick hair, but other than that it is a really good buy!&lt;br /&gt;And make sure you wear the glove because I&#x27;ve gotten burned lots of times on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;But over all a REALLY good product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Remington Salon Collection Pearl Straightener also.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great idea, this just takes practice if you&#x27;ve never used one before - which I haven&#x27;t. It comes with a glove to protect your hand. The wand heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> This iron was everything I expected it to be.. except for the fact that after using it only TWO TIMES, it would not turn on anymore. I had already thrown out the box since I ordered it in December, and I used it for the first time in December, then again late January. How it broke I have no idea, but I didn&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of trying to exchange it, so I trashed it. Good thing is that it only cost me $20. Good price but I guess you get what you pay for :(</li>
    <li> I love this curler wand. I had never bought one before, but it was very easy to use and it works great.</li>
    <li> My daughter has stick straight hair that never curls.  This changed that.  It&#x27;s amazing! She&#x27;s 10 and she figured out how to use it as well (just being careful because it does get VERY hot).  We curl her hair at night, she sleeps on them and they are still perfect in the morning.  She is so happy with this iron because we have never been able to curl her hair successfully. Now we can!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on previous reviews which is the way I buy most things because I don&#x27;t like to waste my money. It worked as promised and I am satisfied with the product. I was just surprised that it didn&#x27;t come with the glove that it mentions on the box.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WAND! The curls that this wand makes are AMAZING and I have hair that doesn&#x27;t like to hold curls in and my hair held these curls all day! One thing is this is not for everyone, if you have short hair or lots of layers it is going to be harder to use this but for people with long hair with less or even no layers its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use this it takes a little bit of trail and error to figure it out (or you can just watch youtube tutorials). For my I just sat down and played with it for like an hour. At first I was getting frustrated because the hair kept sliding off the end of the wand but after trying some more i found you can not wrap your hair tight around the wand you have to loosely wrap it (but not too loose that its not touching the wand or heating your hair), after i started wrapping looser it became easier and faster to curl my hair. I now use this almost everyday and I love it sooo much! Worth every single penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tried this and it didn&#x27;t work for you, please try again and be a little more patience because once you learn how to use it you&#x27;ll never stop!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, she loves it and bought several others for her sisters, she likes the pearl feel.</li>
    <li> I have the sexy beach waves I&#x27;ve always wanted, a look it seemed i could never achieve with other curling tools. I have medium length hair with average thickness and it literally takes me less than 20 minutes to do. I watched a couple YouTube tutorials that made it look super easy to use and to my surprise.. it was!! No more boring straight hair for me! :)</li>
    <li> I got my curling wand a few weeks ago and am still getting the hang of it. I&#x27;ve got a certain look that I&#x27;m going for and need to keep working on it to get the curls more uniform in size. There is some technique involved in using this wand and it seems to work best when held upside down. This can be a bit tricky to navigate as the wand gets wicked hot, so holding it upside down and wrapping the hair around it at the same time can lead to a burned hand if not careful. I have burned my hand a couple of times but have also used it a bunch without any burns, so it just takes some getting used to. It heats up quickly, which I like and over all gives me those beachy waves I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the curls last for days and get more mellow and nice with each day. I have fairly thick and long hair, so the the one down side is that the wand is pretty slim. I could use a wider barrel. I sometimes curl the really long strands in two sections (top and bottom), because the wand is too thin and there&#x27;s more hair than wand to wrap it around, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part and for the price, this wand gets the job done and I&#x27;m pleased with it. It&#x27;s just sort of a practice-makes-perfect kinda thing. And be careful because it burns skin super fast and hard, so wear the glove that comes with it!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m out of the loop when it comes to styling products, but since when do curling irons not have clamps?  A glove is not an adequate substitution for a clamp to hold the ends of your hair on the iron.  Also, this does not work with short hair  It&#x27;s frustrating and awkward and will be returned.</li>
    <li> This works like any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used. Nothing spectacular except the price.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the build quality. Small gaps in the seams and it feels like it will fall apart if it falls to the floor.</li>
    <li> Love everything about it, heats fast, curls quickly and the stay with little product! I just wish the glove was bigger</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good or bad thing, but the first product I received didn&#x27;t work (it didn&#x27;t heat up at all). That&#x27;s bad, right? But I called the company and they sent me a prepaid shipping label, so that I could return that one and get a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s sort of a bummer, because it was a hassle, and I&#x27;d have preferred that it work properly the first time, but Remington was very easy to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product takes some getting used to, but the results are good. My teen daughter had been looking for something like this, and we&#x27;re pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriends mom is a hair dresser and i have the worst time ever curling my hair even she does so we finally tried a hair wand and needless to say i gave up my straight hair and now i stunt beautiful curly hair. The wand leaves your hair soft and bouncy you don&#x27;t even need hairspray with how well this locks the curls in. If yo every had trouble with curling your hair i highly recommend buying this !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my curling wand it heats up fast its easy 2 use I would recommend this product 2 haiku</li>
    <li> This product is great. I use it on my brazillian hair and the settings are great! Ive never had a wand but saw everyone using it online and now i have one AND CANT PUT IT DOWN! The seller was quick and so accurate! I love everything about it!</li>
    <li> I definitely love this product. It gets really hot as it said and it also definitely curls your hair but I need to learn how to use it better. Other than that you will love it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for cosmetology school to use on my clients and I LOVE IT. It&#x27;s gets hot fast, it produces nice uniform curls that last longer than If i was to use the flat iron or traditional curling iron. The glove is a great necessary addition to prevent burns. The price i paid was amazing, I highly recommend this curling wand</li>
    <li> For some one who has a hard time doing her own hair, this is perfect! I&#x27;ve been wearing a weave ever since I started using this, and it works so well! Once my friend taught me how to use it (she had one which encouraged me to buy it), I was sold. It&#x27;s easy and quick! I only spend 15-20 seconds on each strand depending on how long I want a curl to hold. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This curling wand is very easy to use.  I have VERY thin blonde color treated hair and I always find that either my hair becomes charged with static after styling or it just falls limp within an hour or two (even after a substantial amount of hair spray!).  I used this wand the day I got it on my hair when it was dry without any product and the curls stayed all day long and where even there in the morning after I slept on it!!! I didn&#x27;t even use hairspray! The only cons of this wand was the tapered bottom a (I find it to be a little awkward when styling because my hair tends to slip down the barrel) and the heat resistant glove (it resembles a winter glove and isn&#x27;t really great for heat resistance).  I would still highly recommend this for anyone who has the sample fine-hair troubles as me. I am going to the buy the bigger size barrel as well. :-)</li>
    <li> I love this curler!! Its so easy and makes your hair look amazing!! Its my favorite! &amp;#60;3 I RECOMMEND :)</li>
    <li> One of the best tools for your hair if you want pretty curls. Doesn&#x27;t take long to figure out how to use it, and once you do - it will be your best friend. You can get curls from roots to ends or just waves, depending on how you use it. Just be careful not to burn yourself (I don&#x27;t wear the glove, because I cant feel my hair in it). My friend actually told me about this iron and I went ahead and ordered it - so glad I did!! I have long straight hair and when I used my other curling irons my hair wouldn&#x27;t hold the curls whatsoever.. With this Remington they look great even on a second day. I would definitely recommend this curling iron!</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever this works perfectly on my brazilian hair I don&#x27;t need to go to the hair dresser and more</li>
    <li> I absolutely looooveeee my wand!!!! Its so fast, fun &amp; easy to use! Enjoy def worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Simply put: this is one of those cases where you pay little to get a lot! There&#x27;s soooo many curlers that claim miracles to your hair and you end up with some mess. This particular curler makes curls in 10 seconds time, I suppose does not damage it as bad. Only precaution is watch out for burning your fingers occasionally.</li>
    <li> the glove doesnt really protect you to much and the setting it turns on at is hot enough for your hair to curl. it does a great job in less than 3 secs of holding a curl.</li>
    <li> it made my hair really curly and not frizzy curly it worked amazing my hair is hard to keep its curl and it gave such ringlets it lasted a long time i love mine. The glove is really helpful too</li>
    <li> Never owned a curling iron and never have curled my own hair before and i bought this for my self and wow wow wow wow wow!! its so easy and i love it come with the glove so i can easily wrap my hair around the curling iron and not burn my fingers!!</li>
    <li> I like the cute curls it makes. My hair is thick and it makes a nice curl and stays in for the day when I curl my hair at the highest setting (around 410 degrees I think). The only reason I took off one star is that it gives off a burning smell when I turn it off (when it&#x27;s cooling down).</li>
    <li> Was a gift, but feedback said it was exactly as described, and the individual loves it.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a ceramic curling iron.</li>
    <li> both my daughers love these (bought one for each).  It&#x27;s AMAZING how well it curls, and how the curls hold.  Just watch for burns!</li>
    <li> Love this wand. Will recommend to buy. Produces great curls and very easy to use even for people not familiar with styling their own hair.</li>
    <li> Usally my hair never holds a curl and this wand really does the job and it&#x27;s super hard to curl with my hair which Is super curly ( but I straighten it), frizzy, thick, and damaged and many more but needless to say I love it</li>
    <li> Gets really hot. I have short hair so the width and length of the wand gives me beautiful curls with not super long hair. It made it look full and gorgeous! I really like it. I could even make loose wavy styles.</li>
    <li> I first saw this iron on a you tube video and decided to give it a try. My fine hair, which is a few inches past my shoulders (and ALMOST all one length finally) never holds a curl. It would look great when I first did it and in a couple of hours it was sticking out in a frizzy mess. Hair spray just made it hard and frizzier. THIS iron, however, curls in a flash and holds all day!!! I first wash and dry but don&#x27;t put any product in my hair to way it down - just spray some heat protect. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of it. I used the glove a time or two but after you get the swing of it I took it off and it was much easier and no burning fingers. It does much better if you curl in small sections and start with the bottom layer of hair with the top clipped up. Then blow it with the cool setting of your hair dryer (or just stand over the air conditioning vent like I did) to set it. Then I gently divide the curls with my fingers to get just the right look. I even had lovely waves the next day!!</li>
    <li> My friend suggested that I buy this item because its the same as the Royale curling wand but cheaper. I tried it and love it. It gets really hot and u can manage the temp settings. Also gives you very shiny nice curls. I am African American and I have virgin brazilin hair and this wand works really good. I just ordered the Remington flat irons and I hope they work just as good.&lt;br /&gt;ps. I would compare this curling wand to any other expensive curling iron ..also u can look at reviews on youtube about this product to see how well others like it</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t think the one I have gets as hot as it should. I purchased this iron when it was $29.00. I think if you buy this iron now it would be best to buy it while its at the low price of $17.00. I still prefer my Herstyler Wand over this one as the curls don&#x27;t hold very well with my Remington. I like the iron for the beachy curls although they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> For the price, I tried not to set my expectations too high but this curler is amazing!! It gets so hot and curls my hair fast! On the 3rd or 2nd highest heat settings, my hair curls fast and stays curled for THREE DAYS with NO product at all! It&#x27;s amazing! I am still learning the best way to use it as it can be frustrating and a little dangerous due to the high heat and the shape, which tends to make the wrapped hair squeeze up towards the tip rather than making larger curls around the wider base. When I wrap it right however, it makes a very pleasing curl shape, so I am sure with the proper technique this shape is perfect for this look. Let me just mention again - I curl my hair on the 2nd highest heat and the curls stay in for 2 or even 3 days with NO product in it at all. THAT IS AMAZING. I love this thing!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair tool. I love the loose curls that it produces, almost a more natural look. Good temperature control and haven&#x27;t burned myself yet!!</li>
    <li> I love this wand, it&#x27;s so easy to use and I am extremely satisfied of how my hair looks after using it.</li>
    <li> I opted for the larger-sized barrel, but that&#x27;s mainly because I have very long hair. It works well! It heats up quickly, and you can lock the temperature so that you are not accidentally pressing buttons when you are curling your hair. And the wand is actually very easy to use (and I am not an expert at styling hair)! My hair is normally super straight, without even doing anything to it. So to get curls to stay I used a curl-activating mousse before hand and hairspray afterward. Also, this comes with a glove, which is great. Without it I don&#x27;t think I would be able to use this as I find my glove coming in contact with the hot barrel all the time. But anyway, it&#x27; a great product. The bigger barrel is good for really long hair, like mine, or also just more natural, looser, bigger curls.</li>
    <li> Much better than a curling barrel because it&#x27;s easier to use and you have more control over how you want to style. I used the styling glove the first few times just to get used to the iron and now I barely use it. I got the thinner wand (1/2&amp;#34; to 1&amp;#34;) because it creates semi-tight curls that loosen as the day progresses, but that&#x27;s just how I want my look. You can also get loose curls with the thin wand if you use a low heat setting (275 degrees) and just curl fist chunks of hair. If you think your hair is impossible to curl then I definitely recommend this because it gets the job done and you will be amazed. I&#x27;d also recommend watching YouTube tutorials on how to use this if you&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before because they really help. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product!!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but after using this curling iron, I felt like the lion in The Wizard of Oz. The curls were way too defined and my hair still had a lot of frizz. Curling with a flat iron gives me nice, smooth curls- that I just couldn&#x27;t get with this curling iron. Again though, it could just be my hair type--very thick and frizzy. I&#x27;ll stick with my flat iron in the future.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is awesome!  I love that it has a very wide range of heat options from very low to very hot!  The glove is a MUST have...I&#x27;ve tried using it a couple of times without the glove they send you, and I&#x27;ve definitely burned my hand in the process.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> These are pretty good...I can wear big waves or small curls.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product. My teen aged daughter finds it very easy to use. Heats quickly and performs as advertised. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Waves come out pretty and they last the whole night</li>
    <li> Makes the most perfect curls if used correctly. I love it. The curls last ALL day! The glove definitely comes in handy for the wand gets really hot. I LOVE my curl wand</li>
    <li> For being so cheap, it works amazing! The curls are great and last almost all day long.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter....she and I both loved it. Once she got the hang of it, she taught me and now we are glam girls...I&#x27;m ordering one for myself.</li>
    <li> My hair would never stay curled until i tried this curler!!!</li>
    <li> When I first saw the price on this curling wand I thought it would be some cheap thing that doesn&#x27;t work. That&#x27;s when I received it in the mail and tried it out and it did an amazing job! I have thick wavy hair so I&#x27;m used to curling irons not working on my hair, but this actually looked as if I had beautiful natural curls. I think this would work on any hair type, it truly was the greatest purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughte asked me to curl her hair with this beings I am the WORSE at hair I had to face it and give the iron a try after all that is why I bought it. Guess what it worked GREAT!!! My daughter was happy and I was so proud of myself.&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I would make would be to offer two gloves! That sucker gets hot and a second glove would of come in handy!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is just amazing! The best part is that it&#x27;s really fast on making my hair curling and having it last for at least 3 days.</li>
    <li> I have to say, curling irons were not like this in my day.  There I was.  13.  Woefully fine, limp hair.  It was the 80&#x27;s, you know, and this was NOT the time for such lifeless locks.  Do you think I didn&#x27;t try?  Of course I did.  I diligently used my little spring clamp 1986 conair trying to force my hair into beautiful springy 1986 curls every morning, only to walk outside into the terrarium of 40% humidity known as Houston,TX, and have it all fall flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I discovered the perm and I thought I&#x27;d died and gone to heaven.  At some point, though, I had to break the cycle of perms and let my hair grow out.  I&#x27;ve come to terms w/ buns and ponytails as my everyday style.  I am 41 and married so who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My viable supermodelling years are behind me now, but even so, I like to keep abreast of the latest in beauty and hair.  I came across these wands on such a forum and they piqued my interest.  I tried to ignore them, recalling the ineffective iron of yesteryear and all of the time it frittered away.  Eventually though, my weakness and vanity overcame me and I ordered this pretty pink wand, hopeful, excited and confused about the lack of clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She came to me on an otherwise bleak Tuesday, in the typical speedy manner (thank you Amazon).  I snatched her up and stole away to the lavatory for some private time.  And.... it was pretty good.  The curls I managed LASTED, and that was a miracle!  I slept on it and touched them up the next morning - fabulous!  But my technique needed some work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand has simple intuitive controls.  You&#x27;ll press the power button and press the plus or minus button to adjust to the temperature you want.  It will display graduated bars that blink until it reaches the selected temp.  You hold the wand horizontally or vertically (you&#x27;ll find different positions work better on different parts of the head) and wind about an 1\\&quot; section of hair around it, starting at the wider base, holding the end as close as comfortable to the tip of the iron.  Leave for about 5 seconds, more or less as needed (but not TOO long, to avoid scorching) and then release.  Some people pin the curl in place to cool, some let the curl fall into their palm to let cool w/o stretching and some just let it go.  I separate my fine hair into 4 to 6 sections and pin them out of the way, and release and work one section at a time.  Ambidexterity is a plus, but not required.  To turn the wand off, hold the power button down for several seconds.  This design prevents accidental shutoff which is a problem w/ some irons.  The only real difficulty I have is w/ the conical shape, as the hair tends to all slide up toward the tip and decreases the curling space.  I have since ordered the \\&quot;elliptical\\&quot; version of the Pearl series and don&#x27;t have this issue w/ it.  I now use both in one session, as I like the pointy end of the conical for doing the underneath hair close to my neck and the stuff and my temples, and use the elliptical for the back and most of the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, these new fancy wands get HOT.  This one goes up in increments to 410 I believe, which is one hot mother.  Also, the aforementioned lack of clamp means plenty of up close and personal time w/ the hot iron.  It does come w/ the heat glove and of course you are encouraged to use that.  I find it a bit cumbersome and find myself curling w/o it most of the time.  As my technique improves I find myself burning fingers and neck much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used this type of iron before, I recommend watching several of the slew of the videos out there on the subject.  I also purchased a neck protector, which I imagine one could easily make at home if one weren&#x27;t so darn lazy. The one I purchased is made of heat resistant materials, though, which is a bonus.  I hope w/ practice to reduce the iron-to-skin contact incidents, but the last burn on my neck was of such severity that I purchased the protector.  HOT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the heat obviously can damage hair w/ repeated use, and if you&#x27;re like me, you are going to want to use this thing ALL THE TIME.  This will require a good heat protectant, something w/ silicones and oils rather than water, regular use of a good moisturizing treatment and frequent trims.  Use it on the lowest effective setting possible and never use on damp hair.  I understand that ceramic irons are less damaging than the others (chrome?) but heat is damaging regardless, so take the necessary precautions and care and try to not use it in conjunction w/ other damaging treatments and not daily.  I am trying to dial back my usage but it works so beautifully it&#x27;s difficult!</li>
    <li> The Wand was delivered within a week and I love it! I consider myself pretty savvy with hot combs, curling irons and flat irons and this one took me a couple of tries to figure out the best way to hold it. I have thick coarse hair that hangs between my shoulders and it takes me about 30-45 to curl my hair and my curls lasted about 2 days then look wavy by the end of the week.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair tool. Easy to use and the glove helps to keep from getting burned, which I did without it. I think I might get the next size up as well for a thicker curl.</li>
    <li> A good curling iron it gets very hot. I like it but it takes time to learn how to use it and get that beautiful curl.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I wanted to be able to have the beautiful curls that are so popular right now and I thought that this product was the way to achieve them.  There is a learning curve to using this wand, and I don&#x27;t have to time or patience to master it.  The glove is too big for my hand. I have to take it off each time I need to section off a piece of hair and then hold the hair with my left hand, put on the glove, transfer it to the gloved right hand then wrap the hair around the wand.  Because there is no clip you have to hold your hair on the wand the entire time you curl it.  My arms got tired very quickly! Even with the glove I could still feel the heat from the wand on the higher heat settings, but on the lower ones it didn&#x27;t curl my hair well. My hair would curl beautifully in the middle but the ends sometimes were still straight or bent at an angle so I would have to re-do sections multiple times.  The back of my hair was almost impossible to curl and I burned my neck more than once.  I felt nervous every time I used it.  I have seen other people use a similar wand with ease and had beautiful curls.  If you are a pro at curling your hair, don&#x27;t have tiny hands so that the glove would fit, and don&#x27;t mind practicing and practicing and potentially curling each section of hair multiple times to achieve the look you want, then you may love this product.  I opted for a regular 3/4 curling iron and I got spiral curls all over my head in about 15 minutes from start to finish.</li>
    <li> As I man I know nothing about these things, but I bought it as a gift for my 28 year old sister and she says she loves it. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas and she loved it, she love to do her hair curly after get tired of having it straight, its great for change style within days</li>
    <li> This cheap little guy works like a charm! I gave it to my sister who has long, fine hair and her hair is very hard to style with because it&#x27;s so fine, but it works perfectly for her!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter was thrilled to receive this for Christmas. The glove comes in very handy when doing one of her friend&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I think this is so handy, you can make any design you want with this. Glove doesn&#x27;t really help any with the burning situation but you soon lear the placement of where to put your hand and everything.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I recommend checking out a few YouTube videos to learn how to use this curling iron since it is clip-less.  Produces nice curls that last - even on my daughter&#x27;s super-fine, super-straight hair.</li>
    <li> Quick, easy, and makes beautiful curls. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair by using this! The first time using it was difficult, but I was used to it by the second time!</li>
    <li> Very good deal! The curling wand works just as I expected, once you learn the right technique, you&#x27;ll use it everyday</li>
    <li> I have only tried to use it once and i find it a little difficult to use. But i think once i get the hang of it, it will be a good investment</li>
    <li> 1. I am AWFUL at curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;To the point where, I&#x27;ve given up on even trying to curl my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This culer is A M A Z I N G!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw someone on youtube curling their hair with this type of curler and they made it look super easy. So, I thought that I&#x27;d give it a shot and looked for one on amazon. This one had great ratings so I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler is easy to use and quick to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the glove because I had this fear of burning my fingertips, but the gloves just don&#x27;t allow for the tactile feel and grip that you need when you get to the end of your hair. So, I now use this without the glove, but with extreme caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I curl my hair in 15/20 minutes where it used to take me an hour! :)</li>
    <li> I love this. I used it to curl my 3/4 wig i made and it fits perfectly on my hair. I made a YouTube video please check it out youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;-efDR5dBics  you will see how the wig looks like.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas present. Very happy.  Good quality, my daughters love it and my wife wants me to buy one for her.</li>
    <li> Great curling wand! Gets very hot. My curls stay in all day long. My hair never stays curled with a curling iron, but does with this curling wand :D</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item it was wrong voltage for Australia and I felt you should have let me know when you knew it was going to be delivered to Australia so I had to send it back and it cost me $24.00 to send it back and I only got about $7.00 back for postage so I cannot rate the product because I never used it. So yes disappointed.</li>
    <li> The iron burns very hot</li>
    <li> Works great.  It gets super hot so be careful with your fingertips!</li>
    <li> You needed a a anti heat mitt to use,and it was not stated that it is required.</li>
    <li> It was for my granddaughter&#x27;s Christmas present.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m old and bald!&lt;br /&gt;She liked it, so I liked it!&lt;br /&gt;She said it works great!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I just ordered this curling iron after my best friend brought hers over so that I can use it after leaving my very expensive name brand curling wand at my boyfriends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is SUPER LONG(almost up to my waist) and this gives me the curls that I want! You can make your hair wavy or curly with this wand. I prefer the wavy side of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) curl your hair as you normally would&lt;br /&gt;2) run your fingers through the ENDS of your hair, but don&#x27;t overdo it as this will lead to frizziness!&lt;br /&gt;3) your result? Beautiful waves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I wish I discovered this curling wand back in 2009 when I purchased my other $120 curling wand. I&#x27;m usually very iffy when spending under $90 for a curling wand since I&#x27;ve had a few that were 100% junk but overall, it&#x27;s an effective wand for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a magic wand that will make all your problems disappear this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.&lt;br /&gt; The Wand is an amazing curling iron. There are about four different sizes you can choose from. Some you can even switch out to straighten or crimp your hair!&lt;br /&gt; One of my favorite parts about The Wand is how it heats up in about two minutes. Another thing that is really convenient is it curls really fast. I curl my hair most mornings and it takes me ten to fifteen minutes only! That probably isn&#x27;t the same for everybody, but it takes me half the time of my old curling iron.&lt;br /&gt; Something that is very unique is you can buy different colors. Most curling irons only come in boring old silver and gold but The Wand comes in pink and purple.&lt;br /&gt; Just because it is this great doesn&#x27;t mean it has no flaws. The only thing I can complain about is it burns you a lot easier than other curling irons. It heats up to about 400 degrees so when it burns you, you could guess it hurts a ton.&lt;br /&gt; A couple of weeks ago I had my friend curl my hair (bad decision). When she was about half way done she dropped The Wand! It went straight onto her wrist and there was a huge burn for about three weeks. Lesson learned don&#x27;t have her near my head with a hot object. I have never got any bad burns while using The Wand although other people have.&lt;br /&gt; I love The Wand and would recommend it to anyone over 10. Be careful not to let children around it though.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I like to straighten then curl it to make perfect curls. This styling wand makes curls that hold longer than any other traditional curling iron would on straightened hair.</li>
    <li> I want to start off by mentioning that my mom is a hair stylist; therefore, I am able to get all those fancy salon tools including a salon hair wand but I chose not too. I wanted to see if an inexpensive one could do the trick. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS WAND. It gets super hot and my hair will actually stay curly for a while, which is weird because I have naturally straight, course hair. I curled my hair for a rock concert and it still was wavy/curly by the end of the night.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing in my experience is that my hair is too long to fit on the wand but then again my hair is super long, so that&#x27;s my fault. But even when I have to double layer it on the wand, it still works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;If you need an inexpensive curling miracle, I suggest this.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and works great. I use it all the time and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
    <li> I have tried to curl my hair with the typical curler numerous times, with no avail. Despite some of the reviews that said the Remington curling wand was too hot, or not easy to use, I decided to purchase it anyways. This is the easiest device I have used to curl my hair! I have shoulder-length hair, so I use the glove when curling the back, since I can&#x27;t see what I am doing. It&#x27;s definitely easier to curl hair without using the glove, but I am glad the glove was included to prevent burns. This is a quality product, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This wand does the job, it heats up fast and very hot. I bought it for me but my sist uses it too cuz its that good. Very good product and soon i will purchase the bigger one.</li>
    <li> I love this iron! Takes me 5 minutes to do my hair.</li>
    <li> I love it. really good quality and service was the best. I received per a week in my country.</li>
    <li> I do not use the glove it come with only because it do not hold the heat from your skin. You can get burned real quick using it. I use it just as it because I have to trust myself. When you want beautiful curls in a rush this curling wand get the job done. I waited until the last minute to get my hair done so when I had to do it myself it took me no lie, 20 minutes and my curls was in and I was out the door that includes a shower and 20 minutes to get out the door without being left. My friends couldn&#x27;t believe it. My curls stayed in all night.</li>
    <li> This iron has changed my life....before I got this I could never curl my hair.  Not with a flat iron ( even the ghd that I spent 200 dollars on cant curl my hair :[ ) not even with a curling iron....but a co worker of mine told me she could curl my hair and it would stay.  Believe me I was hesistant but eventually I gave in and it was the best decision ever...I went and bought this the same day.  You should use the glove that comes with it because this gets super hot!  Ive already burned myself twice.  And what&#x27;s great is that Remington gives you a 4 year guarantee with this and if anything is wrong they&#x27;ll replace it.  Best hair tool for the price..you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My favorite wand curling iron. I use it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it. She showed me her hair after using it, she has very long hair, lots of long curls. She could have done a commercial with these results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used curlers and rollers and everything but this has to be the best curling tool ever! I have straight hair that does not wave at all and easily falls out of curls. The Remington Curling Wand heats extremely quickly and to 410 degrees. With this high temperature my hair curls within seconds instead of minutes holding a typical curler. Your hair also does NOT get tangled  or snagged! Beware though of the very high temperature and wear the heat resistant glove it comes with, at least until you get use to the wand. I expect to get burned once in a while due to rushing through the curling process, but I normally shrug it off... boy did this curling wand give a blister to remember from just a slight tap on the hand. Just be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand has become a part of my routine and I have yet to burn myself again and am still extremely satisfied with the curls that are quickly formed!</li>
    <li> Seriously people? How do you curl your hair when the root of the curler is thicker than the top and the hair keeps on sliding to the front, you have to push the hair back all the time while burning your hand, even through the glove. It&#x27;s going back!</li>
    <li> GOOD ITME! My mother says it is fine.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hard to hold a curl hair! I get so many compliments (: also I curl all my hair in like 12 minutes!!!</li>
    <li> I first heard about the Remington Pearl when one of my girlfriends did my hair for my birthday.  The outcome was gorgeous!  I had never seen such light and bouncy curls before.  The descending size from the base to the tip creates a more natural curl than the average curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this curling wand is extremely challenging to use on yourself.  I have always curled my hair and never had problems with doing it myself, but the slick barrel and lack of clamp posed a challenge.  I have since gotten better, but it&#x27;s definitely not something one can master in one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my best results when I didn&#x27;t use the protective glove because I was able to hold onto my hair better and get a better sense of how hot the iron was before I moved on to the next curl.</li>
    <li> This curling iron definitely does the job!  Just a quick tip: USE THE GLOVE!  Unless you are a professional using this curling wand, you will get seriously burned.</li>
    <li> It gets REALLY hot!! Works great, but make sure you are wearing your glove!!! And please watch your children around it.</li>
    <li> OMG THIS THING IS THE SH*T!!!!! MY CURLS WERE SUPER BOUNCY, DEFINED, AND LASTED ALL DAY DESPITE THE PETTY WEAVE I HAD IN. I&#x27;D BUY THIS THING 100x</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CURLING WAND!! I soooo wish I knew about this earlier. I used to curl my hair in the morning and spray it with tons of hairspray just to have the curls fall out a few hours later..... But with this curling wand I curl it in the morning, use no hairspray,  and the curls stay for days! I sleep with it curly wake up and all I have to do is retouching a little bit.  It is so easy and so fast and I get so many compliments on my hair with it. I 100% recommend this to anybody it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of thick hair and only this curler can quickly curl all my hair beautifully! Just be careful, it gets really hot and I accidentally burned my finger and it peeled my skin off!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and heavy hair.  No other curling iron has kept the curls intact ALL day like this one does!  I don&#x27;t even need to use hair spray.  The curls are nice and spiral and they STAY in!!!!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this curling wand. I read a great review on a blog and had to get one for myself, it definitely lived up to the hype! It heats up quickly, is easy to use, and the curls stay in your hair well into the next day. I recently cut my hair (shoulder length) so that&#x27;s why I went for the 1/2-1 inch model, but will probably also purchase the bigger size once my hair is longer because I like it so much! All my roommates come to me to use it on the daily. Also, the automatic power-off feature is GREAT (and SAFE!), as we are a forgetful bunch! Highly recommend for anyone who wants easy, professionally-styled curls in their hair.</li>
    <li> I have bought several curling irons and NONE of them worked. My curls would fall out before leaving the house. With the wand I can go TWO days with curls in my hair. Yes, TWO days without any curls falling out. It comes with a glove and I used it the first time and I didn&#x27;t like it. It took me a couple of times before I got the hang of it. I get compliments every time and they want to know what I used. If your on the fence, give it a try!!!</li>
    <li> a little tough to use, but that&#x27;s something I can figure out I guess. My BF likes it when I curl my hair with this.</li>
    <li> This wand really holds the curl in my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. It has been easy to use for her learning to do her own hair. I highly recommend and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand!  Gave me perfect curls and the curls held the next day.  Easy to use. Priced well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of this...but so far, so good.  And easier on your hair than using a curling iron that pulls and burns the ends.  I got major compliments on the curls in my hair when I used this.  And it only took me 15 mins to get the results.  I will continue to practice to get better.  Side note:  I envy those that can use this without the gloves.  I still burn the tips of my fingers, even with the gloves.  I guess I need more practice.</li>
    <li> I love the beachy waves I get with this curling wand! Great value!</li>
    <li> I need to know the volts for this pls. is it 110V or 220V? Or both? I would appreciate if someone helps me out .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> It does exactly as described. Great price indeed.  The only thing and it has nothing to do with Amazon is the heat glove tht comes with it....... is not as good as it should be.  Even cutting it down the the lowest heat setting it immediatly gets to hot though the glove.</li>
    <li> I have had a bunch (probably around 7) of curling irons, some wands, some with clips. This is the absolute best one I have ever used. My hair is very stubborn and unwilling to curl. This curls it and keeps it curled. I love the barrel size and varying temperatures, it makes nice waves if not left for very long, then ringlet curls if left on heat for longer. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Works great, just have to get used to using a wand</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I was needing a clamp-less curling iron for a while, and did some research and thought this would be perfect for a great price. I use it all the time and gives me easy fast wavy/curly hair. :) Def recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great! Too bad it doesnt come with both gloves..</li>
    <li> awesome, love the adjustable temperature settings. great quality</li>
    <li> Hold my curl all day long, heat up fast and don&#x27;t mess my hair up and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is so great love it i recommend  it is one of the best i had.:)</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this wand works PERFECTLY for touching up stray frizzy curls. I get compliments on my hair even more than I used to! And, as a bonus, the curls held for 2 full days before they started to get frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand heats and cools quickly, and there are buttons to adjust temperature. If you&#x27;re careful, you won&#x27;t burn your fingers or need the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who complained that this was difficult to use, I currently have my dominant arm in a full-arm cast and have never used a curling wand before purchasing this....and it was very, very, hilariously easy to use. The only thing you have to know ahead of time is that you hold the wand upside down when using it (makes sense, right? You don&#x27;t want your curls small near the roots and large at the ends). If you have difficulty, watch a 1 minute tutorial on YouTube.</li>
    <li> This curling wand has made it possible for me to actually curl my very stubborn hair! It&#x27;s simple to use and to me it&#x27;s easier than a normal curling iron. I would recommend this product to anyone that is interested in buying a curling wand. My only complaint is I wish I would&#x27;ve bought a bigger size wand since my hair is so long therefore my curls are tighter than I would like.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have super thin hair and i have been through a ton of curling wands in the past month &amp; this one is the best. Size is perfect! Curls look awesome</li>
    <li> I bought one of these as I have long, thick hair and I found that this product didn&#x27;t hold onto my hair and it kept falling off. An \\&quot;inverted\\&quot; wand will hold your hair better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I had a black tie event to attend this past weekend and did not feel like getting my hair done. I planned on doing a rollerset b/c I wanted curls (think Traci Ellis Ross). I did a search on Amazon for hair rollers b/c I guess I&#x27;m too lazy to actually go to a local BSS and buy some and I came across this styling tool. I remember a popular natural hair youtuber making a video about it, I never actually saw the video, but I saw the after pictures and her hair was banging. It took me 10 tries to finally get the technique down and man, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier. I&#x27;ve had these curls since Saturday afternoon, its Tuesday morning. I just pineapple my hair at night (do a youtube search to understand the reference). The older my hair gets, the looser the curls and I freaking love it. I don&#x27;t really use heat, only when I go to the salon to get my hair washed and ends trimmed, I&#x27;ll let my stylist press my hair out. But I think I may be using this once monthly. Its definitely gonna be my goto for any kind of event, night on the town or date night... Hell, I have a job interview tomorrow and I&#x27;m just gonna touch up the curls in the back. You should definitely get this. And wear the glove, this thing get hot!</li>
    <li> It a great curling iron!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need to buy it and use it then you will know how great it is</li>
    <li> This is the best curler in the word!!!!!!! I really love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!best results from straight to curly hair, i  used one a week and thats it!</li>
    <li> I bought this wand because of the reviews and I absolutely love it!!!! I had never used a wand to curl my hair before and it was super easy!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair usually won&#x27;t hold a curl and can be very temperamental, but it was super easy with this wand. It even held until the next day!</li>
    <li> My friend and I were getting ready for a wedding the other weekend and she had this curling iron that she used on my hair. I loved it! Before I had been using my straightner for little curls, but this worked so much better. The product is easy to use as you just wrap your hair around it and hold it for about 10 seconds-and BAM you have perfect curls. I really like this product and have used it a lot already for formal functions and casual usages.</li>
    <li> great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> .I ordered this to curl my hair for my dance show and it worked great! It was very fast to curl all my hair. Very easy and safe to use. I have done a tutorial on this product and unboxing and first impressions check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;3w9T0HVKEZ4</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I am not a person who is very skilled in the hair department. I straighten my hair and it looks nice, but I never dreamed of having curls like this curling wand made. It&#x27;s easy to use, and the curls stay for a long time even without hairspray. The previous methods I&#x27;ve used to curl my hair didn&#x27;t work very well, and after awhile my hair would be back to normal. I highly recommend this curling wand. It&#x27;s cheap and great quality. I&#x27;ve used this wand for a few months now and I absolutely love it. I use it on my friends and mom also and they love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Even on bleached hair.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday, and I was so pleased with it. I started to do my hair as soon as I finished opening the package. I am new to this, but I saw a lot of videos on how to get that wavy beach look on YouTube, and I can&#x27;t believe that I did it on my first try. It comes with a glove because the wand is very hot, but I didn&#x27;t use it. I almost burned my shoulder though, but it was cause I was pulling a strand of hair while holding the wand. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results I got when I finished. Many on YouTube got theirs done in 20 minutes the most. Since I am a beginner it took me more than that. But I know that once I get used to it I will get it done in that amount of time. I have long hair past my waist so that&#x27;s one of the reasons it took me long also. And maybe because I was afraid to get burned. I definitely recommend this to those that want that beach wave look without having to pay so much at a beauty salon. I am going to put up a pic of my results. 5 stars</li>
    <li> This is my first curling wand but I&#x27;ve used clamped curlers and flat irons forever. I&#x27;m never going back. Since I&#x27;m experienced, I don&#x27;t need the glove. I highly suggest watching YouTube videos on how to use a curling wand. This particular wand makes gorgeous shiny waves and curls. Love, love, love my hair after using this. Heats up really fast too.</li>
    <li> GREAT WAND!!! IT DEFINETLY TAKE PRACTICE USING THE WAND IF YOURE NOT A PRO HOWEVER FOR THE PRICE IT WORKS GREAT NO COMPLAINTS</li>
    <li> I have never had much luck with traditional curling irons and I have found this to be easy to learn how to use and master.  I am getting the hang of the various sizes of curls that can be made with this iron.</li>
    <li> Works great. I just love it. It is Worth to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;It does your curls perfectly, in a legit second!</li>
    <li> It seems like a really cheap curling iron but it is by far the best iron i&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> its fast , its easy , didnt burn myself so far , i didnt use the glove tho , overall nice product .</li>
    <li> Good product, curls really fast, it&#x27;s very well made, it&#x27;s light weight and the glove helps to not burn one self, it&#x27;s difficult to use due to hazard of burning your skin, but with practice and patience it USA good tool</li>
    <li> I love this wand! I bought this because one of my firends at school had they prettiest curls and she said it was a wand and gave me the link to where she got it and this also had a coupon on amzon so even more of a reason to buy it. I woulood absolutly would recommend this! but the first time i used it I i got so hot! so make sure you consider that because it was so hot i had to get another glove besides the one they sent in the box.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling wand for the price. I generally like the Remington brand. The wand is easy to use and I like the included glove. I tend to burn my fingers when using the wands as opposed to traditionally curling irons so the glove gives me a little added confidence. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for their first curling wand or if they want a quality iron for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> This wand is awesome! I fell in love with my curls.you really to be careful on using it our you&#x27;ll burn your fingers...even with the protective glove on.thts the price to pay for beautiful,bouncing, professional looking curls!</li>
    <li> This product is really good. My daughter and I love this product and its fast and easy. It does get really hot but other than that is awesome. Now we ordered a second one because were always wanting to use it, so we had to order another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this item when it was NOT on sale and honestly, I wish I could return it. I had high hopes for this yoga mat and I ignored the negative reviews because it&#x27;s so beautiful and matches my room, but when I got it, I was very disappointed. It is very thin, half as thin compared to a free yoga mat I received. It is also  not sticky at all and I lose my grip when I am doing different moves so it hurts my wrists. So now it just serves as a place to sit for my friends in my room. Don&#x27;t get this mat, buy a better one for a little more money.</li>
    <li> I liked the curls that they made. The only reason I took off a star is that it did not come with a manual, it would&#x27;ve been helpful if it did.</li>
    <li> This is way to skinny for barrel curls. You end up with little curly q&#x27;s like a pigs tail with this skinny wand!!</li>
    <li> This thing is genius.  My hair takes the curl, holds the curl, EVEN IF I SLEEP ON IT!  I adore the beach waves.  And I&#x27;ve learned that you can adjust the look by wrapping thinner or thicker locks of hair around the wand.  Best purchas ever for my hair.  I am SO happy I read the reviews and didn&#x27;t drop $$$ on one of the salon models.  I may even go back and get the thicker wand.  My hair is down to my bra strap.  I think the thicker wand will be even more versatile.  I haven&#x27;t gotten this many hair compliments in years.  &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love this product! The wand makes my lifeless, straight hair become vibrant and beautiful. I can add big waves or tight curls. Would recommend this product to any woman!</li>
    <li> Seriously wish I had bought this years ago. It&#x27;s awesome, heats sooo quickly doen&#x27;t pull my hair at all. It&#x27;s way better than my hot tools!</li>
    <li> I found this hard to use. It&#x27;s very light so it feels a little flimsy in your hand. I think I prefer curling wands with the clip to it. I may just need practice with it but it&#x27;s not the best if you&#x27;ve never used it before so you&#x27;ll have trouble achieving the curl you want.</li>
    <li> If u need something simple to work with, that gives u good results&lt;br /&gt;and also affordable, that is your guy!</li>
    <li> I always thought that I had to wear my long hair straight because curling irons and hot rollers never seemed to produce a curl that would hold. But on a whim, I saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I am SO glad that I did!! I am NOT someone who normally styles her hair (I&#x27;m really bad at it), but this hair wand has given me a whole new look to play with. It&#x27;s GREAT for someone with long hair and the curls hold all day without any added product. I&#x27;ve even gone two straight days with beautiful curls/waves. I highly recommend this, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Best curling wand ever. It&#x27;s very affordable and curls my hair just like I want it . Would def order again.</li>
    <li> This is not the best curling iron to use for a child.  I purchased this to use on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  Even on the lowest temperature setting, it burns her hair, and I can barely hold it long enough to curl her hair before it burns my hand through the provided glove.  I had to use my husband&#x27;s grilling glove so it wouldn&#x27;t burn my hand while I used it!  I wish I had used it before the return window had expired.</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY THE BEST BUY I EVER DO ONLINE.&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS PERFECT FOR MY HAIR TYPE AND THE COLORS ARE GREAT</li>
    <li> This is such a great curling wand for the price. It makes it so easy to get natural waves or defined curls. I bought this one because after purchasing a different brand, I noticed there were awkwardly placed screws that ripped my hair out. I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all with this one. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> My iron is set to 356 degrees. It&#x27;s quick and convenient to use. Be careful around the ears, you don&#x27;t want to burn them. It&#x27;s lightweight, comes with a stand so it doesn&#x27;t slide off surface you place it on. I have coarse hair and it gets it straight and curly.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair to my shoulders and wasn&#x27;t able to use a larger barrel (same brand). I decided to stick with the same company, and I use this frequently. I recommend looking on YouTube on the way to use this, by the 2nd time I had it down.</li>
    <li> I love this iron! Packaging was perfect and the glove does come with it like the description says. Good quality with a long cord which is nice.</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt at using a wand curling iron and it takes a bit of getting used to, but I think its a great tool in the hair styling arsenal.  Has a nice digital readout of temperature and indicates when it is warmed up.  Gives a lot of body and curl and for me the curls even lasted a couple of days.  You get more curl high up on the strand, but its a more natural syle.  I got the smaller barrel and liked it, but for every day I&#x27;d get a larger barrel.</li>
    <li> Love it. Love how it makes my hair look fuller. Nice bouncy curls. It&#x27;s a must have. But becareful it can get very hot and you have to use the glove that comes with it .</li>
    <li> I bought this for me niece for her birthday and she loves it! The price is very reasonable. I also like that it came with a heat-resistant glove because the curling wand I have does not have that and my fingers are basically immune to pain now, hahaha :) A++ on this product!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, I bought it for the good reviews, not knowing what shed think, but she uses it every day.</li>
    <li> I got this and it is used it should have been new I would not get this again this was not a good buy</li>
    <li> Love it, works better than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve had. Gets very hot though so you must be careful, look up &amp;#34;girl burning her hair off&amp;#34; on youtube, perfect example haha.</li>
    <li> This is a very good curling wand.</li>
    <li> My daughter found this to be too difficult to use on her own hair but thinks that it is much easier to use on another person&#x27;s hair.  That could be in part to her skill level or hair type.  When I used it on her hair, it worked as it was supposed to.  I did use the glove that came with it and didn&#x27;t find the glove to be cumbersome at all.</li>
    <li> Burned the hell out of me couple times but umm yea it works..</li>
    <li> I normally have wavy blah hair that I&#x27;d always straighten or do some big curls... I decided to get a wand for an even newer look... Works great and just as good as some of these other more expensive wands... LOVE IT and LOVE THE NEW LOOK! Gotten many compliments.</li>
    <li> Love the iron and curls it makes. My hair is shoulder length and fine. Does have a bit of a learning curve to master not getting burnt, once you do great iron.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling wand I have ever tried! I have used high end ones, but this one is just so perfect. It curls your hair beautifully and in seconds. A must try!</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!  It does get really hot though.</li>
    <li> Really great and suprizing price my girl just loves it so much</li>
    <li> this item is to hard to hold on to with the glove that came with. I could not get a good grip with the curling iron. Could not make a curl with the glove on and to try to hold the iron. There is nothing in place to keep the hair from sliding down the curling iron. Would not recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> I have never used a curling wand. My experience has always been with the clamped curling irons and sleeping in curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of reviews that state this is hard to use. Nnnnnot so. You wrap your hair around the wand, at whatever diameter you&#x27;d like (fat end for loose curls, skinny end for tight curls), then hold the hair until your fingers start getting warm. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be tempted to use the heat at its highest setting--it&#x27;s just excessive. I have thick, fine hair, and managed to get layers and layers of beautiful curls by using this at a low-to-medium temperature. I&#x27;d recommend that you use a heat-protective oil prior to styling, and be sure to follow up with some hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love curly bobs. My hair is nearly to my shoulders, and when I use this iron, I get the fun, bouncy bobbed look that I adore. This is a great product at a great price, and it even comes with a warranty. What are you waiting for?</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and I could not really get this to curl it even with very small sections.</li>
    <li> POOR QUALITY BROKE FOR NO REASON. I do not recommend this product. Although inexpensive, expected it to work for more than just a few months.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this but be warned, it gets very hot and she dropped it on her bare leg and got burned.  Her hair is very straight and long, she says this iron curls it in only a few seconds  and the curls have staying power.</li>
    <li> The glove that comes with the curling wand works well to prevent burns. The wand has multiple heat settings and stays how once the temperature is set. It also is very gentle on hair and, even on the hottest setting, does not damage my hair.</li>
    <li> Was really amazed it came in a really good packaging with good quality ;))))&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this to anyone !!</li>
    <li> My hair has always been difficult to curl, but this curler made it so easy! My hair curls in 20 minutes and I have long hair, but most important they stayed all day! Even until the next day. Best $20 ever spent.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good but is very hard to use!!  I rarely ever use mine as it is difficult.  I bought I high quality curling iron instead</li>
    <li> This product is really good. The only thing that bugs me is that my hair struggles sometimes to keep a really tight curl... but maybe that&#x27;s because my hair has always been a tough one when it came to curling, or maybe it&#x27;s the hairspray that I&#x27;m using. I&#x27;ll figure it out, but it&#x27;s really great still</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  My fiance uses it every time she want that curly look.  She does complain about how long she has to hold it though to get the full effect.  It may heat up fast, but it is not a quick process to get the look I&#x27;m sure your going for.</li>
    <li> I really really love this. I love how my shorter hair can look with a loose curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing is the glove that comes with barely protects against heat from my hand, but I&#x27;ve still been using it until I can find a better option</li>
    <li> This is my first curling wand, and I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed. I much prefer this wand to curling irons or curlers! It isn&#x27;t too difficult to get used to, although it can be awkward to use in your non-dominant for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great product although I should have gotten a larger size... I have hair that goes down to about the bottom of my breasts and this and really isn&#x27;t large enough, but I manage! I still really like it though, and I would recommend it to someone with shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Great for making big or small spiral curls. I love it and comes with a glove to protect yourself from the heat.</li>
    <li> Product received on time and without problems.</li>
    <li> Works great and gives many variations in curls. It doesnt take long to use at all and is very easy giving desirable results</li>
    <li> I love this wand! I had been wanting one for quite a while and finally decided to just buy one. Glad I did....if you have wanted one I suggest just going for it! They curl your hair GREAT!</li>
    <li> I love it.Works great.It gets very hot and make pretty voluptuous curls.My hair is always beautiful when I use these</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was thrilled to get this item!</li>
    <li> Heats hot and fast. Easy to use. Small and compact, better and easier to use than conventional curling irons. My hair is difficult to curl, and the first time I used this it curled too much which was a good problem to have!</li>
    <li> very good product, I recommend ... In addition to being very responsible people when making shipments. I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> Worked as expected. and would recommend to any of my friends and family members. Great idea for Christmas Gift or B&#x27; Day</li>
    <li> Works nicely even my fine hair curls beautifully!</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever made. it heats up quick, consistent curls, and it&#x27;s easy to use. I love this thing</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have to admit that you have to get used to using it, but once you learn how to use it correctly, you will get beautiful curls. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This wand is not so good.  It is very very slippery and the hair just slips off also this iron gets SUPER HOT! topping out a 450 degrees Fahrenheit.....the glove is loose and it is just a cotton glove, not a heat glove like you need... the glove slips off and around and it doesn&#x27;t protect from the heat.... the glove shown looks like it is the proper glove but the one that comes with it is a simple cheap cotton one with no stretch in it at all.... I used it and it makes lovely curls IF you use a tiny tiny bit of hair and BEWARE because again it get&#x27;s super hot super fast and the glove is not adequate protection against the heat.  I would&#x27;ve returned it if I hadn&#x27;t ripped the box trying to get it out and then used it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has really straight and hard to hold a curl hair.  she has used this and her hair is still curled nicely after a full day of school or lasts for the whole evening without having to use a lot of hairspray and other products.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this type of curling tool and I was very impressed, the curls came out beautiful I received so many compliments. Glad I purchased it, the curling wand gets very hot, so be careful.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t curl!! But it does with the magic wand. Unbelievable stuff! Best $22 dollars spent!!!  Brought one for my bestie too!</li>
    <li> works quick and holds really well. I&#x27;ve only just started using so I don&#x27;t know about to durability but it grives a great look in no time. MUch different than using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> my daughter and I love this curling wand!!!! It works great and you dont need hairspray at all!! It holds the curls all day long. even after sleeping on it the curls are still there and look great in the morning!! I highly recommend this product!! and it was very affordable.</li>
    <li> Bought for 17 year old daughter with fine straight hair. fEasy to use, works quickly curls hold with regular hairspray.. Does get very hot, i don&#x27;t use the glove so be careful not to burn your face.</li>
    <li> I like this hair styling wand a lot. It works really well, but the heat is pretty intense. I only use it on certain special occasions, but using it too often I can imagine would do a lot of damage to my hair. Overall it makes my hair super shiny and is easy to use! I would actually probably go a size up if I were to buy another one for bigger waves.</li>
    <li> Excelent product 100% true! Excelent product 100% true Excelent product 100% true Excelent product 100% true Excelent product 100% true Excelent product 100% true!. good</li>
    <li> It really works great.</li>
    <li> My twelve year old daughter loved this curling wand.  It was her favorite Christmas gift and her hair looks fabulous!</li>
    <li> Not sure what I was thinking ordering this product for a trial review.  I&#x27;ve not got the mane for this, but a friend with long glorious hair who does found it the very thing for long, lucious curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised by what I great deal I received by purchasing this item... My curls turn out so beautiful and I always get so many compliments.. I recommend this wand to everyone I know.. It should be more expensive it&#x27;s worth way more than 20 dollars for sure</li>
    <li> works really well. easy to use and glove is a must have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: gets really hot and the glove isn&#x27;t that thick. so i burned myself a few times</li>
    <li> I bought my Remington Pearl wand product on a whim. Let me say: it&#x27;s AMAZING! I have hard to curl hair; normally, w/my clip curler, I use a TON of hairspray to make my curls last. All I need with the wand is a little heat protectant, and I have long-lasting, beautiful curls. I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments  every time I curl my hair with the wand. My co-workers can&#x27;t believe my curls last all day long. It took me 3-4 times to master my technique. But once you get the hang of it, the curling process goes quickly. On a side note: my hair even looks great on day two! I like big hair, so on the second day, I restyle a bit (w/Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Spray and a little curl activating mousse) and tease/brush my hair out.</li>
    <li> I love this wand. It makes great curls that last all day and through the week. Great starter.</li>
    <li> This curling wand works perfectly. I have long thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to do much with. This curling wand worked easily, quickly, and produced perfect curls. I have used it for cheerleading competitions on my all my team mates hair and it worked on everyone and more importantly the curls lasted all day through the performances. I recommend this wand to any female who is looking for something to give them quick, bouncy, and beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! it takes some getting used to, and some things people should know is the glove doesn&#x27;t allow you to grab the wand - it doesn&#x27;t work like that. it&#x27;s simply a means of protection from severe burns. This gives my hair great curls</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a great product. It&#x27;s taking me a while to get used to using a clip-less curling tool but this operates well. Only complaint is that the power button turns it on, but not off. I have to unplug the tool to turn it off.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually curl my hair because it takes too long.  This curling wand, however, makes the job quick and easy.  Once my 11 year old showed me how to use this, curling my very straight hair went fast.</li>
    <li> My hair stays curled the whole day even without spraying hair products!</li>
    <li> I have used this item a couple times. I like it. Was a good buy but it is somewhat cheap in appearance and it really is not an easy product for me personally to use. I am thankful for the product. Thanks for the transaction.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while but it got old using it... If you have a lot of hair it takes forever!</li>
    <li> I like the remington curling iron very much as it produces great curls! It is a little tricky to learn how to use on yourself at first. I was able to curl my hair within 15 minutes and I have long thick hair. It usually takes me 1 hour to curl my hair with a regular curling iron. I would reccomend this product to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> Works good and get hot fast.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to use at first but once you get use to it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This was my very first curling wand. I was initially afraid of getting it because it has no clamp and I was scared of burning myself, but after reading all the good reviews (and of course, being desperate for some type of curling wand or iron), I told myself to suck it up and order the wand. To this day, I have no regrets in purchasing this wand! It definitely gave me a wonderful first time experience with curling wands! So here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Heats up amazingly fast&lt;br /&gt;+ Digital temperature display so you know the heat you&#x27;re exposing your hair to&lt;br /&gt;+ Power button and temperature adjustment buttons are in a safe, easy to reach area&lt;br /&gt;+ So smooth. It makes me want to touch it every time I&#x27;m not using it. Maybe it&#x27;s a pearl technology?&lt;br /&gt;+ So pretty! I love the shade of pink it&#x27;s in and the look really makes me believe it contains pearl technology&lt;br /&gt;+ Creates lasting curls. I had such amazing 2nd day curls that I decided to skip washing my hair for a day and see how it would turn out the next day. On the 3rd day, I had beautiful waves. Definitely love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- No auto shut off, so always remember to turn it off when you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;- You can easily burn yourself, especially if it&#x27;s your first time. Try to use the gloves if you can.&lt;br /&gt;- Harder to use for some. It&#x27;s a lot different than curling irons and straighteners because you have to actually wrap your hair around the barrel with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful curling wand. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well, but my curls lasted for 2 days with this wand before turning into waves. I highly recommend this wand for everyone, especially girls who have a difficult time finding something that will help their hair hold curls. However, remember to take caution as it heats up very quickly and gets very hot.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and works perfectly, I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Never been able to curl my hair and have it stay...now I can! Love this product so so much. H</li>
    <li> I also fell victim to believing all the great reviews of this wand. I don&#x27;t want to just repeat what all the other 1-star reviewers said, but let me just say this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the barrel. See the shape? It&#x27;s a cone. It&#x27;s a SLICK cone. Your hair does not stay on the wand. It constantly slips down to the narrowest end and then when you lose your grip on the end of your hair, you have to start over. It&#x27;s ridiculously frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also chime in that the glove is bulky and does nothing to protect from heat. It&#x27;s a joke.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this wand and it&#x27;s perfect for her to try the styles she loves on Pinterest. It was a reasonable price and a good purchase for her.</li>
    <li> Had this for years, still going strong and making beautiful curls!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do curls every day, but I do like to have a curling product around for the occasional need, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on an curling wand, but I had heard great reviews on the &amp;#34;curling wands&amp;#34; in general.  This wand got rave reviews and was so affordable that I just had to buy it.  I am so happy with my purchase!  It does take a few times getting used to wrapping your hair around the wand instead of using the clip like a traditional curling iron, but experiment a few times and you&#x27;ll get used to it (or watch a YouTube tutorial like a previous reviewer mentioned).  I&#x27;ve used this on both my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair (3 yrs old).  The curl holds like no curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had - I do loose curls on my daughter....like 6 total curls in her hair and it will hold for 2 days, just getting a little looser on the 2nd day!!</li>
    <li> Now it&#x27;s true that this is my first wand experience but OMG, amazing curls and they stay in tact all day and all night long.  Wake up in the morning and they are still there!  Never have I experienced this with any curling product.</li>
    <li> All I can say about this Ceramic Curling wand is that it&#x27;s sooo great. I love it ! My curls look amazing.</li>
    <li> i was really impressed by this product, it heats up really fast and has 3 different heats available to use. the glove is also good to use so you don&#x27;t burn yourself. The only bad thing about this product is that it didn&#x27;t state that the output couldn&#x27;t be used in Australia, so i had to buy a converter , from american to australian output. but apart from that, very happy!</li>
    <li> I usually flat-iron my hair, but I love playing with curls and this iron is great. It does get SUPER hot, so be extra careful.  I don&#x27;t use the glove anymore, but I&#x27;ve managed to skim my wrist/forearm while using it (clumsy).  It took me 3 times to get the hang of it - I watched many You Tube videos. Once I gave up trying to get &#x27;perfect&#x27; curls, my hair turned out great! Having non-uniform girls makes for a really natural looking style. I get so many compliments after using this iron!</li>
    <li> I am really bad at doing my own hair.  I watch youtube tutorials but I never really get it.  I&#x27;ve owned a curling iron before--I did a poor job with it.  I had a straightener--didn&#x27;t know how to use it to create gentle curls.  This little device is the first time that I learned how to make beachy waves!  Though I did burn my arm with it with my lack of experience....i like the product.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair and played with this wand for the first time yesterday.  At the lowest heat setting, with about 10 seconds hold for each curl, it created beautiful, bouncy spiral curls.  It took about the same amount of time as a flat iron.  The glove is a nice addition, but I did not use it, fearing that it would be harder to manipulate my hair.  I simply held the ends between thumb and forefinger and never touched the wand.  Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> The product came a littler long than expected, but still in efficient time. Works really well and i use it almost on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> The hardware of this is well manufactured. Heats up extremely fast, long cord, displays digital temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes some practice to get the style you want, not your typical curls. I like the results.</li>
    <li> Used this a few times. I&#x27;m a fan. Easy to use but takes a while to learn how to use without burning yourself or your hands. Packaging was a little different than what I expected though.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and she wrote this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand reaches its operational temperature very quick, which allows curling the hair in just minutes and the lack of “clip” also help to get great looking finish. Pearl Ceramic coating really feels safe for the hair and makes the wand work very smooth. Glove prevents burning on the hands.</li>
    <li> The seller was absolutely fine, I just didn&#x27;t care for the product itself</li>
    <li> It works. It&#x27;s worth the price but I was slightly disappointed with it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as difficult to use as it was. When curling my hair, I could not get the strands to stay on the biggest curl part of the wand and they would slide down as I was adding hair which resulted in lack of space for the full strand of hair I was attempting to curl. I&#x27;m thankful for the glove included. I would probably prefer the old curling irons overall.</li>
    <li> This curling wand creates lasting curls, and has several other good features. First, it has an on/off button, so if the plug at your vanity is hard to reach, you can leave it plugged it and power it up and down with the button. The temp control allows you to set the heat accordingly for your type  hair. My hair is baby fine, so I definitely don&#x27;t want a curler that only uses very high temps; it would fry my hair. Once you&#x27;ve set your temp, you can make it the default temp for the future by pressing the &amp;#34;-&amp;#34; button for three seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I will say the wand itself is very slick due to the pearl coating, and the wand can slip quickly. Use with caution.&lt;br /&gt;A glove is provided for the hand that does the wrapping.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! I can curl my hair in 5 minutes!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it she has been using on herself as well as her friends.  Easy to use many cute styles!</li>
    <li> My girls love it! Best price that I found them for on Amazon and with the Prime shipping, it made my day a whole lot easier.</li>
    <li> I have thick, straight, difficult-to-curl hair.  I have been trying since I was in high school to find a styling tool that could give me lasting curls.  Well, I finally found it!  Using the 1 in to 1/2 in wand at 410 degree heat (with ample heat protectant, of course!), I get gorgeous tight curls that last all day!  Curling my hair usually takes hours, because it&#x27;s thick and hates to curl, but with this want, I get curls that last all day in about 25 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the slim wand, you will get curls closer to classic Taylor Swift hair than to loose waves, so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind when deciding which wand to buy.  I love this wand so much that I decided to treat myself to the elliptical wand and the 1 in to 1 1/2 in wand, and I am so excited for the variety of lasting curls and waves I&#x27;ll be able to create!  This wand is a miracle product!</li>
    <li> It a good wand it get hot fast.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! It heats up really fast and it is very easy to use</li>
    <li> exclente element as reported consistent</li>
    <li> Awesome curler it works great and heats up FAST. it is perfect for shorter hair I suck at curling hair but this is easy to use and that is why I love mine!</li>
    <li> First time using a curling wand and I&#x27;m still getting used to it. But actually it wasn&#x27;t too difficult to figure it out. I liked this product. I would recommend it. It curls very quickly.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, however I am making an exception for this product because I love it. I am a black female with long hair who has struggled to curl my hair with curling irons. I will never go back to a curling iron again. It not only curls your hair quickly, but the curls will literally last you all day. I get several compliments when I use this curling wand. I bought the bigger barrel but I plan on buying the smaller one as well to see how my hair will look with tighter curls. You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> My hair won&#x27;t hold a curl for anything... But with this - it held for hours at an outdoor concert on a muggy day. You can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great - and is cheaper than Target/Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to use on yourself until you get the hang of it - but that&#x27;s with almost any style product.</li>
    <li> The box looks nothing like the box in the description.  The items in the box are: branded Remington curling iron, heat glove, and manual all in a sealed bag.  The box doesn&#x27;t even say Remington on it. I&#x27;m confused, will test it this weekend.</li>
    <li> only thing that could make this better, would be if they could figure out a way accident prone people like myself, didn&#x27;t burn the crap out of themselves using it.</li>
    <li> Okay, this thing comes with a glove for a reason, and you should absolutely use it. I was an idiot the first couple of times I used it and wound up with a humongous burn blister on my thumb. Your fingers will wind up touching it somehow, I don&#x27;t care how good you think you are. It heats up SO FAST, though, and I love it. Makes wonderful curls.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend bought when she wanted a good curling iron. For the price she thought it was good, but ended up spending the money on a higher end one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a year i still use it, it works fast and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> My daughter use it all weekends</li>
    <li> I am so glad I finally went out of my comfort zone and purchased my first curling wand. I have long thick wavy hair that goes more than halfway down my back. Was a little unsure of which barrel size I should have gotten. I ended up with the smaller size and now realized the biggest one would have been more ideal for the look I wanted. Since my hair is so long this barrel size gives me a bunch of smaller curls where I would have wanted something bigger. But none the less, this wand works amazing. Heats up very quick, came with a heat protectant glove and was very easy to use. I only had to wrap my hair on it for about five seconds and bam! I got beautiful tight, long lasting curls that would look perfect even after I slept on them! I am very happy with my purchase would absolutely recommend this to anyone! :)</li>
    <li> Love this thing!! Great for curling short hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly as i expected and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I just have to say that I LOVE this curling wand!  I have had so many curling irons and this is by far my favorite, curls your hair so quick, it&#x27;s idiot proof, the curls last a long time and I get so many compliments!  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this thing is AMAZING</li>
    <li> I was looking for a curling iron that is easy to use. This one had really good comments. Although I bought it a while ago, I haven&#x27;t used ot until recently. I was amazed how easy it was to use and how nice my curls came even for a first timer. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Perfect packaging works wonderfully. Need a better glove though. More like an ovglove. But the w wand is well worth it</li>
    <li> Love this wand. I literally can do my entire head in 15 minutes and I have long and thick hair. I hold it for less time (5 seconds) for looser curls.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it even after is turned off you can still curl it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love it! Despite the holiday, my package did not take long to arrive. I was so excited to use the curling wand do I took it out immediately and started curling me hair. The wand heats up fasts and you can expect beautiful spiral curls. I recommend getting this product with the head glove because I had some difficulties in getting use to using the wand and I can see where that may lead to numerous burns. Overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> I personally have naturally very curly hair, which I straighten as it is very frizzy if I wear it curly.  I had a hard time putting a couple of curls in my hair and them staying on days when I might want to do a little more with my hair.  I bought this and use it all of the time now.  I can get many different looks of curls, (small, big, tight or loose) and they all stay with no hair spray.  Any other curling irons I have ever used, I could put tons of hair spray on on they would still fall within an hour after putting the curls in my hair.  I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these for my daughters and they love it. This item saves them time in getting ready for school..</li>
    <li> Its cheap so dont expect something all high end cause u wont get it. I love the look, but the first time i used it the pink began commin off the barrel and it doesnt curl my hair weellll at all. i would never buy from this carrier again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for a curling iron that creates loose, natural looking curls.  I finally found it.  My hair is slightly below my shoulders and has medium thickness.  I can curl my entire head in 5-8 minutes and it looks fantastic.  Best of all it will stay for a few days between washes and the curls will loosen up and look even more natural. You will quickly learn how to create different looking waves based on how you wrap your hair on the barrel and how thick of a section you wrap. I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet and even if the ends aren&#x27;t all the way wrapped on the barrel the result is still an amazing natural looking curl and not a hot roller look.  It heats up instantly and I use it at 375 degrees and get great results. It is also small and light so it is easy to store and pack.  I strongly recommend if you are in the market for a styling tool that produces natural looking loose curls.</li>
    <li> the product gets very hot; it is difficult to keep the hair around the wand but i will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this product is just as nice as the name brand very expensive Irons. It curls my hair no problem and the curls stay.  Also with the diffrent circumfrence barrel its easy to get diffrent size curls. I&#x27;m very happy I bought this one.</li>
    <li> Love!!! Love!!! Love!!!</li>
    <li> I am actually surprised at how wonderful the curls came out (I have thick almost hip length hair) and they lasted about two days even without hairspray. Great quality. The glove is very helpful. FIVE STARS &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Very easy to use my 14 year old daughter loves this</li>
    <li> this is a great wand- i have used this several times and everytime i end up with pretty, full curls. i am so happy with this purchase and i plan to buy another with a larger diameter.</li>
    <li> I liked this product to the max, one very, very minor thing is that I am used to the handle that helps stabilize the hair somewhat so that it does not overlap or glide off the wand BUT it is great for several reasons!!! &#x3D;) I have been curling my hair for several years and got good comments from strangers and friends from my regular curling iron but on the first day of using the wand for all of my hair I got many, many great compliments about how great my curls were. I recommended Remington to them! Very happy!!!</li>
    <li> At first I had difficulty using this wand, I actually burned myself couple of times, lol. But once I got a hang of it, its super easy to use and fast, took me 15 minutes to curl the whole head.</li>
    <li> For someone who has never used a curling wand, this is an amazing product. I have medium length, coarse and thin hair. This wand beautifully curled my hair within minutes and was so easy to use even for an amateur.&lt;br /&gt;I straighten my hair every alternate day, but guess now I will have a full head of beautiful curls in less than half the time.</li>
    <li> Great curl. It takes some getting used too since I&#x27;ve only used the barrel rods with the lever. But once I did its faster and better I think. I only gave it four because the glove that it came with I thought would hold back the heat. But it can burn if left too long. Just like any other glove.</li>
    <li> This is my very first curling wand, I had no idea what I was doing or how to use it at first but after a while I got the hang of it, and now I&#x27;m curling every piece of hair I got with it wigs weave you name it. My only con is I wish I&#x27;d of ordered this thing sooner! Oh yea and the shipping was super fast too! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Hello everyone! I&#x27;m from Spain and this product isn&#x27;t avaiable here, so I decided to buy throught amazon.com and now I absolutlely recommend it to everyone who wants a perfect hairstyle!!! It&#x27;s a very proffessional tool and it&#x27;s so cheap! I only have to say (to Spanish or European people) that it hasn&#x27;t the 230 V plug, but you can buy an electric converter in an ordinary shop and it would be OK.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a curling wand, found this one. My hair is super straight naturally and I always had a hard time keeping it curled. For the price, you can&#x27;t get better than this. The curls come out great, last long, and the heat protection glove was super nice at first. You just have to be very careful and pay attention so you don&#x27;t burn yourself! Absolutely love it and it has held up well.</li>
    <li> This wand gave me the best results I have ever gotten for curling my hair and I just love how easy it was to use this wand I just love it!</li>
    <li> this might work if you had really &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; hair, just not mine. it makes your hair look dry and in some places frizzy. just hoping I have time to send it back ....</li>
    <li> It was a little getting use to.  I was use to the traditional curling irons.  I used the glove the first time and that was the last time I used it.  The glove will make your hair frizzy.  You will get burned a couple of times until you get use to how to use it.  I watched a lot of you tube videos to get some techniques.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It&#x27;s very easy to use. It does take a little bit of practice, but in no time at all you&#x27;ll get the trick of it down. It is worth the money for sure. It works quickly and efficiently. The only downside of this particular one, is the length of the wand and that&#x27;s only because I have really long hair (almost to my waist) and therefore, it&#x27;s a lil bit more difficult to wrap all my hair around it and it takes a bit more time to curl all of my hair. I would like to get the same brand but a longer wand and will be looking to see if they indeed do have one. Also, I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant damage to my hair using this product... but I take exceptional care of my hair and use good products on it so perhaps that has been a factor in not seeing any damage.</li>
    <li> Yes this product really does work and it gets hot ! I bought this like a few months ago maybe 8 and it still works and it gets how got you want it</li>
    <li> this wand works like a charm. my curls last for days and they are smooth, not frizzy. definitely worth it</li>
    <li> GREAT AND LOYAL&lt;br /&gt;the most best curling wand there is,&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;A MUST ITEM!&lt;br /&gt;for every girl who likes soft cute curly hair.</li>
    <li> Damn AMAZING!!! Let me just say this is my first purchase of this type online. . It acceded my expectations FAR AND BEYOND! Heats well and fast! Ready to use 30seconds after you turn it on! It curls my hair so well! Perfect pearl glossy finish and my hair looks so healthy and shiny afterwards  !!! I&#x27;m a mom of an 8 and 5 year old... Thanks to this curling iron, for me, it now takes me ZERO effort to get my hair done and ready to go and I mean that !!! I am beyond serious ok. I really REALLY LOVE THIS WAND !!! Purchase it because any review could NEVER DO IT JUSTICE! You have to experience it for yourself ! I WHOLE HEARTEDLY MEAN THAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never curled my hair before this product.  While it takes a little patience, it definitely is extremely easy to use.  My hair is pretty straight and never really holds curls, but with this it lasts a day or two.  Another reviewer mentioned that it was not good for beginners but I disagree!  I found it much more straight forward than hot rollers and a traditional curling iron.  I checked out a few youtube tutorials about how to use it and I was set!  I also have shoulder length hair, if that helps.</li>
    <li> Glove that comes with the wand isn&#x27;t thick enough to protect hand while wrapping hair. It made it very awkward to style because I kept burning my fingertips and then I burned my ear when I dropped the wand when it was burning my hand.</li>
    <li> At any setting this curling iron is not healthy for your hair. Runs hot. Dries out hair. Not fior thick hair. U can only effectively use on smaller strands which takes forever if your hair is thick. Very disappointing. Attractive design w protective glove and instructions, I believe this curling iron would work best on shorter, thinner hair. Start w low setting.</li>
    <li> I would watch a video online first for how to properly use this. I really like it, found it very easy to use, and got lots of compliments on my hair at work. I have very thick hair that is pretty long, and I was able to do my hair in under 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Curls really well, it makes me happy!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this curler, based on my sister&#x27;s recommendation. She has the same one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curl-incompetent. I&#x27;ve owned a variety of curling irons, and I&#x27;ve had varying success with those curling irons. My curls regularly fell out, or laid strangely on my head. Generally, I am not good at curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my wedding last year, I asked my curl-genius sister to curl my hair for me. This is what she used. After giving me a full head of curls, I put in all kinds of braids and pinned it up all fancy. Got tons of compliments. Not only that, but when I got around to taking my hair down the next morning, my braids fell out... into perfect curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These curls look great, they really last, and if I can do it, so can you. I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this curling iron is.</li>
    <li> This curling wand worked better than I expected. The curls stayed all day without the use of hair spray. Also, I still had curls the next day. The glove is really helpful. Didn&#x27;t burn my hand the first time I used the curling wand. I am Ethiopian so my hair is naturally curly and has to be straightened first, but the curling process took 15-20 minutes tops and I have a lot of hair. It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I totally suck at curling my hair but with this thing the tightest curls I have ever had. This rod is easy to use, heats up quick and totally worth getting.</li>
    <li> El producto es excelente, de muy buena calidad, Entregado en perfectas condiciones. Envio rapido y oportuno.  Recomenendado 100 % .</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and super easy to use &amp; I love that the curls lasted all day with very little hairspray I used.</li>
    <li> Would be great for thick hair shoulder length or longer. It created more waves than curls for me.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my sister she loves it and now im ready to buy one for me&lt;br /&gt;im loving this all the way</li>
    <li> I bought this in preparation for my wedding to see if I liked the curls better.  I not only like the results better, I feel that it is much faster than using a regular curling iron.  The temperature can be adjusted to accommodate different types of hair and comes in 2 different sizes.  There is a locking feature after it has heated to your preferred temperature so that it cannot be changed if you accidentally push buttons while styling your hair.  I do like that a protective glove came with it, as even the lowest setting will burn you if your skin comes in contact with it.  The burns are pretty painful too, so make sure that you keep it out of reach of children.  I have melted makeup bottles just by having it too close, so I would make sure you have a large space to let it rest to avoid damage to possessions.</li>
    <li> I am by no means an experienced curling wand user.  I probably haven&#x27;t even used a traditional curling iron in 20 years.  I have fine, thin hair that is just a bit longer than shoulder length.  My hair is super straight and has never held a curl.  I typically just wash and blow dry it and hope for the best.  I&#x27;ve been home on maternity leave for the past several weeks and haven&#x27;t even blow dried my hair and I was frustrated by how terrible it looked so I thought I&#x27;d try curling it for a change.  Anyway, picked this curling wand because it was rated well and the price was  right.  I picked the smaller wand because it seemed more versatile and was cheaper.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my selection!  I watched some you tube videos and found the wand to be very easy to use.  I&#x27;m glad it came with the glove, and that I heeded the warnings to use it because otherwise I would for sure have burnt my hand many times.  The first time I used this I got acceptable results and the second time I tried it I got great looking curls that looked natural and cute!  They also stayed in!  All I used was heat protecting spray.  I was surprised at how good they looked!  I would recommend this to anyone.  with a little practice and care anyone can get the look they want.  Just check out some you tube videos first.  I&#x27;m so happy I gave this a try.</li>
    <li> I am pretty good at doing hair but this is hard to learn to use on yourself. Once you get the hang of it, it makes beautiful curls or glamourous waves and they stay for 2 days. I did burn myself a couple times trying to get used to it. Its a great wand for the price as this is the first time I buy one thats not salon quality ( under $100) that acutually works and gets really really hot.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results! I&#x27;m not very coordinated so it look me a little to get the hang of getting the&lt;br /&gt;results I wanted. Happy now!</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well, but I&#x27;m not very proficient with hair styling in general, so I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it</li>
    <li> I have always been greatly satisfied with Remington hair products. I also have their large flat iron, large curling wand and hot rollers in this pink/brown pearl style. Gets super hot so your style stays, without damaging your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty technical chick, and I have a wide variety of gadgets.  you would think I&#x27;d be able to figure out this contraption.  No, not so much.  even after watching youtube tutorials on it, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me at ALL.  and that heat resistant glove?  HAHA.  No.</li>
    <li> This was my first curling iron and I really like it. The adjustable heat setting is really helpful and the curls stay all day (sometimes even two days!). The only thing I would say is that my hair is pretty long, and since it has the tapered wand, my hair slides to the bottom and I run out of space to wrap my hair. Maybe that could be fixed with practice, but I would love if it had some sort of attachment that could be slipped on the bottom so the piece of hair wouldn&#x27;t fall off... Overall, a worthwhile buy.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product almost everyday, but it is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve had my curling wand from this buyer for a year now and It&#x27;s still just as amazing as the first time I plugged it in.</li>
    <li> Honest to goodness this gets the job done! At first it may be hard to use, specially if you are not accustomed to wands like I was, be EXTREMELY careful when handling this, the burns are pretty bad. The glove is A OK for me, no complains. Really fair for the price ;)</li>
    <li> Got it for a gift and she loves it! I hear that the girls in the family fight over who gets to use it first LoL.</li>
    <li> This curling wand gives perfect curls every time. If you are someone who has experience with hair tools then this product is easy to use and handle. I makes sense that it comes with a glove which I don&#x27;t use because it can get very hot when at the highest setting.</li>
    <li> I read a review on here that said, &amp;#34;Curls that will make you want to slap your Momma!&amp;#34; Well I walked around saying that all day after I curled my hair with this wand! I would have paid $100 for this!! It really is amazing and easy to use! I used it at a wedding this weekend and fixed 4 girls&#x27; hair and it stayed hot and worked perfect! I also fixed my hair on Friday morning and was able to rock it until Sunday!! The curls were amazing! I got compliments left and right!!</li>
    <li> This curling iron heats quickly to a super high temperature.  It&#x27;s easy to use, but you really need to use the enclosed protective glove.</li>
    <li> the end result of curling was so good.. it doesn&#x27;t heat instantly. the curl lasts depending on the time we used to make a curl..it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.. i loved it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked. What happened to the $14.97 price last week, when I added this to my cart &amp; now I&#x27;m ready to purchase? Unbelievable. I did notice there&#x27;s a $4 off coupon but that still doesn&#x27;t get me to the original $14.97 price or the $17.99 I could have purchased this \\&quot;locally\\&quot;, which is how I found this online but decided to wait until I could decide what else to order to get $25 free ship. My ... how things change.</li>
    <li> What more can I say than that? The only thing that is totally silly is the glove. It may protect you from searing flesh, but not from heat, so don&#x27;t be fooled. But honestly, I never use it and don&#x27;t know anyone who does.</li>
    <li> USe this almost 3-4 times a week, easy and quick came in a fast manner and it was packaged correctly.</li>
    <li> This gave me much smaller curls than I expected. I was hoping for beachy waves. Nope.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works great on my natural hair.</li>
    <li> its switching off atfer only using it 15minutes</li>
    <li> Warms up super fast; easy to dial in settings and seems indestructible when traveling (and I pack really poorly!). Very well constructed too - don&#x27;t anticipate having any problems!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my daugther ans so far everything is great . She uses it alomost everyday</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she says it works great .</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in great condition although the original product packaging was a luttle beat up bt nothing major. As for the product itself was in great. Worked amazingly well .. I didnt find much of a need for the glove .. over it was great</li>
    <li> took 2 days to ship. took just about 3 seconds after I turned it on to heat up. I&#x27;m not even exaggerating. this is by far the best purchase I have made.</li>
    <li> Love it, amazing. A steal in price!!!!!!! Great product, worth every penny. The curls last for days with this product!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and so worth the money.  I&#x27;d even buy a second one, especially at this price. I&#x27;m always lending this out and getting compliments on the result.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 11 and does her hair differently Daily!  She loves it and get compliments all the time.  It&#x27;s easy to use and safe.  Also, the curls last all day!!!  Great item :)</li>
    <li> Functions great!  Does exactly what it says, easy enough for my 12 year old daughter to do on her own now.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awesome! It is so much easier to use than the kind that clamps down your hair. The glove really does help protect from heat I&#x27;ve gotten burned when I didn&#x27;t use it. My hair is past my shoulders and the smaller 1/2 inch to an 1inch  was a great size for making any kind of curls even big loose ones. I never spend more than 15 minutes curling my hair with this product.</li>
    <li> Just so everyone will know.&lt;br /&gt;Because i was looking for this information and didn&#x27;t find it.&lt;br /&gt;so now everyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;good day all.</li>
    <li> After watching a million youtube videos I decided to give the wand a try. Its perfect! My first time wasn&#x27;t that great though, I couldn&#x27;t develop a technique for it. After my second try it was a piece of cake. I get salon curls in 30 mins. It also heats up quickly.............I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone under 13, you can very easily burn yourself.</li>
    <li> I love the wand but although it said new on amazon it seemed like it was used once and the package was open and taped up. And the glove they show you on the package that was supposed to be inside was also missing.</li>
    <li> it was okay.  I liked the way my hair looked after I brushed the curls out a little with water on the brush.  It was VERY hot and I know that you have to be careful with this type of curling iron, but I could feel the heat coming off of the wand.  It does its job and curled my hard to curl hair but I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY straight hair that is impossible to curl, I&#x27;ve had it curled by the salon and it didn&#x27;t stay up. I have stuck to straightening my hair my whole life until I heard everyone raving about curling wands. I decided to give it a try, and I think its great. Works without hair spray ;)</li>
    <li> This is a great product  my hair has never looked better.  2 day curls gotta love that. Does take a bit of practice but once you learned how to use it . You can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> First, let me say this thing is hard to use. But it&#x27;s not specifically this wand, it&#x27;s all of these curling wands. The first time I used it, it took FOREVER! Almost an hour, and I had to turn my fingers into little acrobats to be able to hold the hair flat and twirl it around at the same time. Luckily, I hadn&#x27;t put my makeup on yet, because I was actually SWEATING by the time I was done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve used this about 15 times since, and I&#x27;m much quicker, it&#x27;s easier, and I sweat about 100% less than I did the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling wand is wonderful. It has different temperatures that you can adjust to, based on your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick, straight hair that never held a curl,  no matter what I did. I don&#x27;t even need to use this wand on the highest temp, it works so well! I also don&#x27;t use any product in my hair beforehand, and barely spritz with hairspray when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t wash my hair, the curls stay in for days! I actually really like how the curls look if I do my hair before bed, sleep on it, and wear it the next day. They loosen up a little bit and look more natural.</li>
    <li> Love this wand. I would defiantly recommend this to everyone. Works very well.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid for my wand , I really cannot complain on the wand itself.. Once I received my item I initially used it on one of my friend&#x27;s hair, it came out wonderful, however the wand itself felt kind of cheap, but then again I only paid about 20 bucks. Another con with this item, is the glove. When trying the glove on, it was loose and made for a wide persons hand. I have to use a hair tie when using the glove to keep it on my wrist and hand. But besides those two things, this curler gets the job done and makes beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is great! It heats up fast and really gives my hair a nice curl! Unfortunately its hard to use but thats not this products fault, it just takes a while to get used to</li>
    <li> Great iron. I&#x27;m new at the wand and can get great looks for my daughter who has shoulder length hair. Creating the same style for myself with long hair will take more practice. Heats up fast and the gloves works great for burn protection. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> These curls actually hold for a very long time unlike other wands and curlers I&#x27;ve tried! And I&#x27;ve tried quite a few since my hair won&#x27;t hold curls very long. It takes practice and patience but it makes beautiful, lasting curls.</li>
    <li> My hair is stick straight and never ever holds curls. This curling wand was my best investment ever. It curls my hair without the need for hairspray, even though I still use a flexible hairspray. My curls lasts for days when before I couldn&#x27;t get my curls to last 4 hours. I love this wand, best arsenol in my collection</li>
    <li> My hair is normal in every sense of the word. It&#x27;s not overly oily, it&#x27;s what would be considered normal thickness. It&#x27;s not frizzy or rough or naturally wavy. My hair is straight and soft. (Note, everyone who works with my hair says it&#x27;s soft, so I&#x27;m not bragging here). It&#x27;s also very long. But, for the longest time, I have had very bad luck with curling my hair. I&#x27;ve tried the clamp and that doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve even tried the curl rollers and those didn&#x27;t work. My hair curled beautifully, but it didn&#x27;t hold without a bunch of hairspray, even then it didn&#x27;t hold all that well. I was about to give up on trying to curl it until I found this as I was scrolling through Amazon. I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I didn&#x27;t buy it, I artfully had my aunt buy it for me for my birthday. (She bought the 1/2\\&quot;-1\\&quot; barrel). I used it that night to curl my hair. I saw a difference right away. About five seconds after I wrapped my hair around the barrel I unwound it and my hair fell in perfect curls. I had to go back and do the tips, but that&#x27;s just because my hair is long. It took me about twenty minutes to curl all of my hair. I ran my fingers through it, to loosen them up and they didn&#x27;t fall flat. They stayed. Hours later, the curls were still there. I was amazed at the performance of this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also heats up quick, just like it says. And I love how I can lock the temperature so that way if I accidentally press the temp up or down buttons the temperature will stay the same. I don&#x27;t use the glove that comes with it. It&#x27;s hard to hold my hair so I just don&#x27;t use it. As long as your careful to keep your hands away you won&#x27;t burn. But I have burnt myself with it. It&#x27;s rare, and it&#x27;s when I&#x27;m not paying attention. One of the only cons that I can think of is since it doesn&#x27;t have a clamp, the hair will slip on the barrel. It&#x27;s just something you have to figure out for yourself. Everyone has their own technique for this thing. It&#x27;s just a matter of learning yours.</li>
    <li> Curled my hair super fast, but it was really really hard to get my hair to stay in one place on the barrel. My hair kept sliding to the top and I ended up with super tight curls, not the look I was going for. Pretty hard to use</li>
    <li> Love it but wish i had gotten the bigger one because I have so much hair! But it works just fine, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and my curls hold overnight. Haven&#x27;t used my curling iron on barrel waver since I bought this.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do. I can make both wide and very tight curls with it. And let me tell you, this thing gets HOT! I really like that you can choose your heat level to meet your needs. I have thick hair and this works for me on about medium heat, which means less damage to my hair. For this reason, however, it&#x27;s crucial to either use the glove that comes with it or watch yourself in a mirror. I&#x27;ve grazed the wand a few times with my fingers and palm and it does burn immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take a little practice getting used to this and achieving the look I wanted but I was able to find tons of YouTube videos to help. After that it works wonders!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. I love it. I guess because they use pearls to make it, it gives a  silkier, shinier end result</li>
    <li> This is my first curling iron and it took a while to keep the hair on the barrel without my hair falling off. Once u get the hang of it its easy to use and creates beautiful curls and waves. Make sure u use hairspray because without it the curls will only last for about an hour! Great purchase and worth my money.</li>
    <li> Loved the wand! Really hot and curls the hair really fast :)</li>
    <li> This little tool is the BEST! My hair is tooooo straight and I hate it anything curling iron I used wouldn&#x27;t last me 2 hours it would go back to being straight. But this bad boy keeept my hair curled ALLL DAY!  I would recommend this whomever has problem keeping their curls.</li>
    <li> works great. shipped fast. good product i definitely recommend this curling wand</li>
    <li> Makes great waves...love it!</li>
    <li> Great product gets very hot</li>
    <li> This is the first curling wand I ever got, I picked it up at a local Fred Meyers and I was hesitant at first, considering it was so cheap. And pink really wasn&#x27;t my color. But I gave it a shot nonetheless and I have to say that I loved it!  This is my third year having the product(around there) and it works perfectly fine. I usually have the temperature set to 203 - 306 degrees because I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;ll burn my hair, and I don&#x27;t use gloves because I lost mine a long time ago.  I have no trouble burning my hair and I love the sleekness of the wand. Literally! The wand itself is very smooth and sleek and slippery, which gives your hair this smooth look.  It also heats up very fast, and it&#x27;s very simple/easy to use. I would indeed recommend this to beginnings because it&#x27;s what I first bought myself when I wanted a curling wand.  In short, I would give this a five out of five stars, because I&#x27;ve had this product for so long and it has never let me down yet.</li>
    <li> hard to use. Curls too tight</li>
    <li> Great wand have to try it out... realized I couldn&#x27;t do my short hair, need a smaller barrel for that. Which I didn&#x27;t know that, so my solution is to grow out my hair then try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/25/15 edit*****&lt;br /&gt;This wand is AWESOME!! I use it on my hair, my nieces hair, and heck I&#x27;d use it on my neighbors hair if I could. After a few trail and errors, I&#x27;ve quickly master this down. I&#x27;m now the new favorite aunt who can do cute curly hair styles on her nieces hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy and simple to use as well.</li>
    <li> Who ever made a bad review on this product honestly doesn&#x27;t know what curls are! It works every time! I found that the cork screw curls were my favourite. Even with the straightest of hair, I got gorgeous, big, curls! (: &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I never write reviews. This curl wand is amazing!!!! I have never ever been able to get my hair to curl. This wand does it perfectly!!! I have long thick hair, this takes maybe 20 minutes to compete all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I got the small one bc I read if u have a hard time to get your hair to stay curled, the smaller rod is better. I&#x27;m glad I did! Best purchase ever!!! You won&#x27;t regret :-)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love! This wand...it makes the perfect curls, and for that great wavy look it is perfect. Warms up very quickly, has different temperature settings which is great because I don&#x27;t like to apply too much heat, at the lowest setting it works wonders.</li>
    <li> One of my daughters was home recently, talking about her curling wand.  This one was available at a good price, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is waist length, fine, and I have a lot of it.  It&#x27;s also severely stick straight, and won&#x27;t hold a curl for 10 minutes without lots of hairspray.  It&#x27;s not permed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:  It gets very hot.  It heats up very fast.  The curling time is shorter than with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like: There&#x27;s no tactile stop between the handle and the hot barrel, so I kept sliding my hand closer to the barrel and burning it.  That is undoubtedly a problem of mine, but others may have the same problem.  I&#x27;m uncomfortable wrapping my hair around the barrel, instead of clamping and twirling the appliance so the hair is wound around it from the ends toward the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are very tight, &amp;#34;boing-boing&amp;#34; curls, as my daughter calls them.  Even though I brushed through them, they were still tight, although less so.  Many reviewers said their hair retains its curls overnight, but mine didn&#x27;t, nor did my daughter&#x27;s.  I suppose that&#x27;s a testament to how straight our hair is.  Oh, well, no big surprise there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: my daughter likes her curling wand better than I like mine (same model).  I think I&#x27;ll give mine to my other daughter, so someone who will enjoy more has it.</li>
    <li> Love this. Works quickly and actually holds a curl for 48 hours. Normally, using a curling iron, my fine hair loses a curl in 2 hours!</li>
    <li> Best curler ever! Gets super hot and curls very fast. With 2 small kids, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time for beauty. But I can curl my (long) hair in 5 mins with this thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve watched a ton of youtube tutorials on using this. It makes my hair look goofy and the end dont match the curls. So much easier to use a curling iron than struggle through my hair with this, only to look half crimped/half curled.</li>
    <li> Great price and really fast shipping as usual. I can&#x27;t believe how this little wand makes such beautiful curls in a matter of seconds!! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is the first wand that I&#x27;ve purchased so I cannot compare this to other wands, however this wand is extremely ease to use. It heats up very quickly, and curls the hair within 5 seconds (my hair is approx 22 inches long)! I used the wand on my hair at 5:47 this morning, and right now it&#x27;s 7:39 PM and the curls are still as tight as they were when I first did them; they have not fallen at all. And I did not use any product when I curled my hair. This wand is perfect in my opinion because it only took 10 minutes to curl my entire head of hair. I love Remington!</li>
    <li> They work wonders on your hair.i love the look after curling my hair with these. Definitely recommend to buy these.</li>
    <li> My favorite styling product</li>
    <li> Doing my hair is not my strong suit but this wand is great. I have used it on myself and daughter and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all and there is no pulling like the traditional iron. Great product, very fast heat up!</li>
    <li> This is the best wand I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s heat settings are great and it really gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast. Simple to use and reliable. I have long hair that is naturally wavy and my hair is of normal volume. I can curl all of my hair in 10 minutes. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! It takes some time to get used to a new way of doing things. But it bring a nice curl to your hair and it goes fairly quick once you get the hang of it. The glove is great in theory, but its really tough to section off the right amount of hair with that, so I have resorted to using (and yes, sometimes burning) my fingers. But this gives me finger wave curls after brushing them out so I am happy!</li>
    <li> Great product! The wand is easy to use and heats up very fast...Has a  variety of temperatures to choose from. I have used mine many times and have had no issues</li>
    <li> I love this wand. I have always wanted one and saw the great reviews this one had. It came quickly, and heats up fast too. It also makes great curls in my hair that last a long time! I actually half curled my hair (to test it out) then went out and just threw my hair up in a messy bun and way later that night, the curls were still so nice. Buy this product- can&#x27;t beat the good price too.</li>
    <li> I just got it today ,and  I love it</li>
    <li> received used product.. returning it.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling product I have ever used!  It takes less than five seconds for each section to curl. Plus, the curls stay!  My daughter has naturally straight hair and had never been able to keep a curl, however, that is not the case with this curling wand.  We get compliments on our hair every time we use it.  I have thrown away my curling irons. This.is.the.best!</li>
    <li> This wand works amazing! Definitely recommend it! It does get very hot and it could burn your fingers so make sure you use the glove it comes with. One of the best styling tools I&#x27;ve used. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love my wand ..my curls are so pretty and I get a lot of compliments on my hair! Plus it&#x27;s pink!!</li>
    <li> So I was skeptical about this as I read some of the reviews from less than happy people. I already have curly hair and I was looking for something to help define what I have. I really love this wand, once you get used to handling the wand the curls come out beautiful. I like to straighten my hair and create loose curls with this wand. The glove is like any ole winter glove and its just mostly there to prevent you from accidentally brushing against the very hot barrel. I&#x27;m sure you can a fancier wand but for this price it&#x27;s pretty great. I would suggest curling in different directions to add a more natural look. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works awesome! With thousands of reviews and five stars, do you really need any other reason to get?</li>
    <li> I really liked this curling wand. It works well and looks good. The only thing wrong would be the glove it comes with seems to be pointless, it is made from thin material and I do not trust it to protect my hand from the burning wand. Over all I love this and it creates adorable curls.</li>
    <li> Love this! After reading some of the reviews I was skeptical about purchasing but I absolutely love this curling iron. I watched a few videos to learn how to use it before it arrived and was curling in no time! I was initially glad the protective glove came with it but quickly found that I was not coordinated enough to use the glove! No worries, I haven&#x27;t burned myself yet. The curls last for a couple of days with a few minor touch ups.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product.  Nice curls.  Really doesn&#x27;t work for short hair.  Using the glove is awkward. Needs more work.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Arrived before scheduled time. I tried it and I love the curls..Easy to use &amp; the glove that came with it totally helpful! Great price!</li>
    <li> This is the best wand ever! I use it all the time! My curls last so long, they even look great the next day! Would absolutely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wife purchased for gift.  As advertised and securely, efficiently shipped</li>
    <li> Love it! Just need to be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t curled by hair since I had mid back length hair, (which was 10 years ago) but this thing is awesome.  I have color treated relaxed hair that&#x27;s about shoulder length right now.  It does take a while to do my whole head considering how long it is but this thing works perfectly.  It makes my hair really shiny and doesn&#x27;t just fry my hair.  I use this and the curls last about 4 days slowly getting more wavy.  I love the waves too.  The only thing i&#x27;m not a fan of is that glove it comes with.  It does stop you from the instant burn but if you leave it on there for more than 2 seconds you will defintely feel some heat.  I will probably by a real thermal glove eventally but I love the wand.</li>
    <li> Pretty wonderful-I was able to curl my 10yr old daughters hair (that is past her waist) in about 7 minutes. The curls are lovely, I think it will take a few times of doing it to get the perfect spiral look, but first time trying and it worked great.  Gets hot-very hot- quickly. Yes as other reviews state you must use the glove.  It doesn&#x27;t have a clamp like a traditional curling iron, just the wand.  But she and I both love the results and saves the headache of sleeping on spiral curlers at night.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair tools I own. Creates long lasting curls and is easy and fast to use.</li>
    <li> It does give me the curl and last more than 24hours. However, I am looking for 1.5inch curling tong that would give me a nice wave.</li>
    <li> I love this and whenever i do curls with this i get compliments.The only thig is even when using the gloves sometimes i get burnts and i think it needs more grip.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair and this barrel is way to small.  The curls are tight ringlets.  I got this smaller size barrel on the suggestion of another reviewer but I should have gone with the bigger size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works well but its a little hard to navigate. I admit I love the old school curling irons better. The glove is cheesy but that is to be expected for the price of this product. Overall its good but I think I&#x27;ll gift it to my niece!</li>
    <li> great and makes your hair feel so soft. The second day curls are soft beachy waves, and it&#x27;s so easy to use. I haven&#x27;t used the glove it comes with yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not satisfied with the appearance and hand-feeling. i want to return the goods,who can tell me how to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Kind of prefer a flat iron, but this is a very nice tool. Small, so better for short or fine hair.</li>
    <li> I was a novice at the clip free curling wand and I mastered it on my second try. I like the temperature control and the swivel cord. You can burn yourself if you’re not careful – IT IS A CURLING IRON. Yes the glove is lame, but I don’t use it – I don’t need one. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my 20 something daughter for Christmas.  She loves it!  Her hair is hard to curl, however, using this her hair has been holding the curl all day.  She&#x27;s very happy with this product and she claims that it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> The curling wand it&#x27;s great and easy to use. The glove that came with the wand it&#x27;s basic you can&#x27;t touch the barrel only can touch the hair when it&#x27;s hot. Overall it&#x27;s great for the price, but not for professional use.</li>
    <li> When I have the time to curl my hair, I really like the results from this wand.</li>
    <li> This Remington T studio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Iron is an excellent product, my daughter is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Takes a bit of practice to learn to use the glove (you WILL need it) and get the technique down, but it really curls your hair well. They last all day, too.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It takes some getting used to.  I have long layered hair and it held the curl really well.  I&#x27;m pleased with this wand... I just have to practice using it more.</li>
    <li> Okay I don&#x27;t really shop on Amazon but when I do they never disappoint me. First off shipping was quick for me at least. I order on Saturday got my wand on Monday afternoon. When I plugged the curling wand it heated up right away. I set it to 356 and it has stayed there since. When it heats up it heats up QUICKLY and it burns like no other. The wand works with no problem and I&#x27;m glad. Remington never disappoints. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wand for a beginner because it&#x27;s slippery because of the pearl creamic but if you still wanna try it go ahead. I think it&#x27;s the best wand out here! You get way more for your money</li>
    <li> Easy, quick, and the curl lasts!</li>
    <li> Very effective - only a few seconds needed for curls! Makes beachy waves vs. ringlets on my hair - very pleased. Works best with recently blow-dried hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely thick hair and with a normal curling iron it would generally take me at least an hour to an hour and a half to curl her hair. Well, with this hair wand it takes me 20 minutes or less!!! I am in Love with this product. I would definitely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I can appreciate the heat, however, this wand is difficult to use. Lots of fear of finger burning. I&#x27;m sure it takes more practice that I don&#x27;t have the time for. The pattern of the curl is very pretty but the curl does not last long enough in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling wand last year and use it at least once a week. I have naturally curly and wavy thick hair so on days when my curls are especially wild, I add in random ones with the wand to make it look more even and toned down. I like the varying thickness because you can create small, tightly curled sections or looser curled sections. I use it at the maximum heat setting (410 degrees) because of the thickness of my hair. Overall, I think this product is great - do not waste your money on the overpriced wands at Sephora or other similar stores because this Remington one works wonderfully and is economical. I should add in that it comes with a safety glove so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers when wrapping your hair around the wand but I&#x27;ve never used it.</li>
    <li> My hair naturally is a thick, frizzy, wavy mess (not cute!) I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair daily since I was 12 years old and although that&#x27;s not the best way to treat your hair I apply protein and oils to help keep shine and stability. The main point of my story is I was getting so sick of my hair just being dead straight. Curling irons had never worked for me for some reason so I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with my signature straightened look. I then decided to attempt the curling wand and I have never been happier! As a first timer and with negative past experiences with curling irons, I was skeptical to try the wand but I&#x27;m very glad I did. It is very easy to use and naturally with practice, each end result improves. I still have to straighten my hair prior to using the wand but what I love about it is that no hair spray is needed, the curls are instant and a stay intact all day. I definitely recommend this curling wand to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a new, yet easy to do look. I ordered the 1/2-1 inch and although I am very pleased I plan on ordering the larger size as well for more bouncy curls. The protective glove is for sure an added bonus that I highly recommend using especially for newbies due to the wand getting VERY hot VERY fast. The curling wand arrived just two days after ordering, securely packaged. Great product and no surprise that it&#x27;s a best seller.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Works on my sisters super long hair and on my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love the glove.</li>
    <li> My girls like this for curly hair. We have the Zyliss Baby Curls and it&#x27;s a lot thinner so they wanted this one for bigger curls. Careful though! It&#x27;s easy to burn yourself on this!</li>
    <li> I recommend this to everyone I know. My hair doesn&#x27;t normally hold a curl well. I really don&#x27;t know how to use a curling iron, the clamp makes dents in my hair. THIS product curls my hair! I watched a tutorial online, and after a few tries I got the hang of how to curl hair using this. It comes with a glove, I didn&#x27;t bother to use it. Of course I burned my fingers a few times, but I learned how to avoid that.  I really love that the tip is not hot, it&#x27;s just so much easier that I don&#x27;t have to avoid touching it.&lt;br /&gt;You wont regret buying this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Walmart , in the beginning i was not quite sure about it&#x27;s effectiveness , but when i tried it from the first time i liked it , it gave a gorgeous style and with a very easy technique and less time when comparing doing it with my hands and hair clips ,,, For this reason i really recommend this product for any one who is really interested to get a wavy hair ....it has a lot of advantage :  1-fast to get hot ,2- easy to apply it could finish all your hair even if its long in maybe 10 or less mints , 3- cheap comparing to nice result 4, very light weight ,5- nice looking and very hot temperature up to 410 ,,, i do really recommend it ...</li>
    <li> everyone should love this wand.  It even comes with gloves for those persons who always burning their fingers.  It definitely does its job.  No complaints</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get this in the mail, and it came surprisingly quick without extra pay! Anyways, I&lt;br /&gt;Tour through the box to get to it and tried it out first thing and it was a little difficult to get use to but after a weeks use it was easier and quicker to use!! Love love love the fact that it heats up quickly because I am such a procrastinator that its perfect for me to get ready faster in little time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There nothing not to dislike about this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall GOOD BUY! (: 5 stars</li>
    <li> This is the only way I can curl my hair and have it keep a curl for two days without hairspray! I love it! Best birthday present from my sweet husband!</li>
    <li> A little difficult to get the hold of. Always use the glove. It seems unessasarily, but I burnt myself once with thst thing and I&#x27;ll always use the glove from now on. Perfect curls, though. And they last all the next day. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great wand ! Check out my video using it https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vUpc7IAxiEc</li>
    <li> granddaughter loved it.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron. First time i ever bought one, it is easy to use and i get the curls exactly like i want. Just watch a tutorial in youtube and you are set!!</li>
    <li> My bestie loves her curling wand! It works even on my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Before buying this version of the wand, I used my sister&#x27;s older one to make sure I was making the right choice, and was pleasantly surprised at how well her&#x27;s worked! I have naturally thick curly hair, so it&#x27;s not very often that I find hair products or flat/curling irons that work well enough on my long locks. After the first few uses of this wand, I&#x27;m very happy with how my hair turns out every time - whether it&#x27;s purpose is to add volume to stubborn strands or apply perfect curls to my whole head, the results are fantastic! Just like most of the reviews, I&#x27;m exceedingly happy with my purchase and highly recommend this product for any woman looking to change things up and/or add a little oomph to your &#x27;do.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time using this item as I&#x27;m used to a curling iron.  So holding the curl as it set was harder than I had thought.</li>
    <li> I love this wand curler. It&#x27;s so easy to use and it makes very nice curls.</li>
    <li> Now the glove that comes with it- does not prevent the heat from penetrating, but the wand is awesome. Your curls will most certainly last. I like that it has temperature controls versus the ones that have a set 400 degrees.</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago. I love how fast it heats up, and it does its job soooo well! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a really good wand. Once I got the hang of it i have been able to style my hair. It is also very fast and efficient, it takes less than 20s for me to create long-lasting curls.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first wand ever so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to. I&#x27;ve usually only flat ironed my hair due to my hair is so frizzy and is usually only curly after I wash and air dry it but then turns frizzy no matter what product I used. So here I thought it was time for a change and why not try this wand the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;First off its fool proof, if I could use it I believe anyone can. Second.. It leaves your hair shiny and smooth. It does get hot quickly so I suggest to not leave your hair to long. It is true the barrel is sleek and your hair can slide off easily but it&#x27;s all in how you angle your hair. All in all I love this product. And I&#x27;m not getting paid to leave a good review nor do I work or have any affiliation with this company.</li>
    <li> This wand (1/2-1 inch) works very well for me.  I could not handle spending a lot of time curling my hair.  My arms would get tired quickly; never got used to it.  I have long, thick, Asian hair.  With this wand, I can create big waves by curling big sections of hair each time - maybe 7-10 big sections for my whole head and I am done.  I don&#x27;t do it very often but when I do, it is not so strenuous and I actually don&#x27;t mind curling my hair.  Hopefully with practice, I will get better and faster at doing it as well.</li>
    <li> Best hair appliance ever!!! Sexy full body waves or curls can be achieved with this wand. Super fast to use, got so many compliments on my hair. I have long hair  about half way down my back and I got the 1- 1/2 inch perfect size, glad I didn&#x27;t get the larger one. Once you try it you&#x27;ll fall in love</li>
    <li> First time using this kind of curler. I usually use one where the clamp opens up, you spin your hair around and then you close the clamp to curl it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this one, I&#x27;m going to go back to that kind of curling iron. It&#x27;s very difficult to keep your hair wound around the size you want it to be. It pretty much always ends up going to the top, where your curls will end up super crimpy and small. You have to be really slow and careful if you want varying size curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is much too easy to burn your fingers on the iron since you have to hold the hair around it tightly. Lastly, I really don&#x27;t like the resulting curls, they&#x27;re a lot more crimpy than they are curly. I have fine, asian type hair so take it as you will.</li>
    <li> I have stick-straight fine hair that refuses to hold a curl.  I bought the Remington CI95AC/2 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand on the advice of my sister who promised that by using this product I would have curly hair all day.  Because I have stick-straight hair you know that means I have always wanted curly hair and on the promise of my sister I had to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling wand is a bit intimidating.  It works kind of like a curling iron but you have to hold your hair on the wand using your fingers or hand - did I mention this wand can heat up to 410 degrees?  (Finer hair can use less heat)  Thankfully, it comes with a small glove to protect your fingers from getting burned.  Take my advice and USE THE GLOVE, especially when you&#x27;re first getting the hang of this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having trouble figuring out how to hold the wand and wrap your hair around it to create the type of curl you want check out you tube for all kinds of tutorials.  In the end, my sister was right, when I use this product my hair stays curly all day!  I do not use the wand every day because it takes up more time than if I wear my hair straight and I also feel that using that kind of heat on my fine hair everyday would cause damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> Literally, the only curling iron that has ever been able to curl my hair and hold it. I have very thin straight hair and it works perfectly. It also has the glove, which is just like a cheap winter glove but it works well enough for me! I love it and would suggest it for anyone who has trouble with holding a curl!</li>
    <li> Came right on time. Can&#x27;t wait to use it. The glove though is like a winter one. So be careful about the glove.</li>
    <li> I love it I have been having mines for over a year now and they still work as good as new! No problems and my curls look great, makes my hair look silky!! :-)</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for Christmas presents. I gave one to my sister, and I tried it out on myself. Wow! I loved it! User friendly, even for a clutz like me.  I always would get ugly crimps from curling irons, and I never learned how to curl my hair with a flat iron. I used the glove that was provided, and I gave myself a head full of beautiful curls. So easy. It took a few attempts to get in a rhythm, but after about five minutes I felt like I knew what I was doing. I didn&#x27;t even burn myself.</li>
    <li> I use this wand to curl my 2 daughter&#x27;s hair for recitals and performances and it works great. I feel like I have more control over the wand compared to a standard curling iron. They were 2 &amp; 4 at the time of first curling and there were no incidents.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly! This is good</li>
    <li> This wand is awesome. It heats up very quickly and it is very simple and easy to adjust the heat setting. Because of the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; at the base of the wand (where it meets the handle) it never falls over and doesn&#x27;t rest directly on any surface. It does an excellent job with creating curls or waves. I love it and am happy to add it to my collection with Remington flat iron and blow dryer. Funny how that works but I think this company makes some great appliances that are affordable and last.</li>
    <li> This works great! It heats up hot and fast and gives me great loose curls that last all day. And with hair as thick as mine, I appreciate a styling tool that works so quickly.</li>
    <li> So far I love this curling wand! Definitely worth the price. Heats very evenly and works really well!</li>
    <li> I have very average hair. Not thin, not thick but for some reason my hair will not wrap around the wand with out sliding off the barrel.</li>
    <li> Most amazing device ever!  Very easy to use and curls come out beautiful.  They even stay the next day.  I don&#x27;t even have to add hairspray for the curls to stay.  The wand creates a natural look.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron it makes way better curls then the curling irons i have had in the past and also you can&#x27;t beat the price !!! very good quality and it is also a bonus that it comes with  a heat protective glove! I will be purchasing more products from this seller in the future! love that you can control the heat too! my hair usually doesnt take a curl very good, but i tried it out today, and so far I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your time or money on this item.. the shipping took forever and the product sucked. It took forever to heat up and when it did, it wasn&#x27;t even that hot. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The wand is amazing. Curls your hair anyways you want it. You can do tight curls or waves and it will last you for days. I love my wand !</li>
    <li> possibly my own fault, I didn&#x27;t realize the item would have an American plug&lt;br /&gt;and as I live in the UK the cost of an adapter wasn&#x27;t worth it&lt;br /&gt;returned.</li>
    <li> I bought the 1\\&quot; for my shoulder length hair, and I love it! My hair is thick and holds style very easily, but my curls from the wand would actually last days. Only takes about one practice run to become a pro at it. I can&#x27;t wait until my hair grows back out so I can use it again :)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! And amazing product!</li>
    <li> I was worried that this 1&amp;#34; wand would give me too tight of curls, but I am very glad I purchased this smaller size instead of the larger barrel. Once a little time and movement goes by, the curls get a little more natural, but still beautiful, looking. The glove did not fit my larger hands, but I find that as long as the skinny end is pointed downwards and you are using this while looking in a mirror, its not too likely that you will burn yourself- BUT BE CAREFUL! This thing can reach very high temperatures!&lt;br /&gt;I also love the look that the ceramic gives my hair. I feel like my hair looks very smooth and soft when I use this wand. It is also very easy to use after a little practice. Transitioning from a curling iron to this wand may take a little getting used to, but after a few attempts, it became much faster than a curling iron for me. These curls last all day when I leave my hair down, and transition to a cute ponytail once the day is over. This would be a great gift for any girl who loves to style her hair, and for those who do not like to use a traditional curling iron. I feel like this wand is much easier than a curling iron because you simply wrap the hair around with your fingers instead of twisting and clamping. You also avoid the clamping marks that a curling iron leaves... Great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wand. Let&#x27;s just start by saying that my hair is stubborn. Absolutely stubborn. Like rip it out of my head from frustration stubborn when it comes to curling my hair. My hair absolutely refuses to curl with a regular curling iron, hairspray, and everything else that I&#x27;ve tried. From the first time I tried this out, I squealed with excitement. My hair is long and thick, and so my curls (when my roommate actually gets my hair to curl) always fall out. Well not when I was using this! The curls were tight and bouncy without my having to use a bunch of product. I absolutely love this thing and am thinking of getting the thicker version as well (for bigger curls). Now I dont know much about hair or makeup advice, but I can say that after years of being unable to curl my hair by myself, I&#x27;ve finally done it by using this wand!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter uses this all of the time and it makes her already beautiful curls look so good and it is very much in style. She has no problem working with it.</li>
    <li> It took me just a few minutes to learn how to use it. I think that the glove is optional because with a little bit of practice you can get perfect curls without using it.</li>
    <li> My daugher is in LOVE, after buying many of these this one shows how one should work and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my gf she loved it. and it got here right when it said it would no problems.</li>
    <li> Amazing what this little thing can do.I would definitely recommend getting this little gadget.  No more sitting under the dryer for 3 hours</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look like they could be natural curls, I&#x27;m so happy with this product. Recommend to get if you&#x27;re interested in curling your hair someday.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of this item for two granddaughters.  Both have been pleased and that makes this grandma very happy.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical... the twenty dollar version rarely works like the more expensive versions. But I sure was surprised! I have mid back length, kind of curly/wavy and color treated hair. I normally have a hard time keeping the bottom half curled because it weighs itself down. But this curling iron kept ALL of my hair in ringlets, without hairspray, for 3 days (until I HAD to wash it out). It probably would have stayed longer!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend using the glove... that thing gets HOT! The glove is sort of awkward, but for me, awkward is better than burnt.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I did not buy the larger barrel instead. Because it works SO well, the curls did not relax and stayed very tight. The smaller barrel is probably best for someone with shorter hair, or who&#x27;s hair does not hold a curl as well.</li>
    <li> La entrega fue rápida y en excelentes condiciones, recomiendo 100% al vendedor y el producto. La rizadora deja el cabello muy lindo.</li>
    <li> gift for my daughter. she uses it often and seems to like it very much. good purchase for me thank you</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair, to the point almost every stylist I have been to has been shocked at how much hair I have. I&#x27;ve never been able to get a curl to stay and it&#x27;s so thick it would take a lifetime to do, only to have it lose the curl quickly. I had given up on ever having curls until I read the reviews on here and decided to give this thing a try. Holy cow! It works! Quickly! I curled my hair in under 20 minutes. It&#x27;s still curly on the 3rd day. I didn&#x27;t use any hair spray or anything. I can&#x27;t even believe it. Buy this thing.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. She claims it is much better that all the expensive curlers she has purchased in the last decade. Judging by my wifes comments I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it its perfect the curls come out perfect just the way i liked it&lt;br /&gt;It came really fast in the mall.&lt;br /&gt;Im in love with it &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use. I have never used a curling iron or wand and this is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had a metal curler before I got this, and my hair is stick straight and usually can&#x27;t hold curls very well. It didn&#x27;t work very well and I did some research, and this was the best deal for the price it looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works miracles with my thin straight hair, you can set it to different temperatures and lock it at those temperatures, and I like how you can get different sized curls depending how far up or down the rod you curl your hair. So this would actually work fine with short hair, too, I imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my curls and waves that I&#x27;ve made since I bought this! I LOVE IT and even if it doesn&#x27;t last I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another, for $20 how can you go wrong with such  a great product??</li>
    <li> Easy curls, and no burns.  It&#x27;s taking me a bit to figure out how to position my hands, but even without being 100% sure, my hair still looks beautiful. Also, I love that it takes maybe ten minutes to get a full head of curls.  Would definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> The best price for a curling wand that actually works very well! It heats up to 410 degrees, and that is enough for coarse thick hair like mine. I found the 1/2&amp;#34; to 1&amp;#34; barrel to be kind of small for my needs so maybe I&#x27;ll get a bigger one soon. The one con about this curling wand is the cord. It&#x27;s flimsy, only about 6&#x27; long, does not swivel, I suspect it will not last because of that. Other than that it does the job in 20 minutes or less.</li>
    <li> i use it almost every day is really easy, if you need one of this in your house dont think about it just get one, they easy to use and your hair will look very nice</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
    <li> It would be nice if the wand were a bit longer for long/thick hair but overall it&#x27;s pretty nice.  It gets pretty dang hot and so the glove comes in hand.  All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great starter... But I do think at some point I&#x27;ll be looking to upgrade.</li>
    <li> I found this iron after searching top products in Amazon beauty.  This iron makes the most fabulous curls. It heats very fast, the glove is very protective and I&#x27;ve thrown my flat iron away because this is so great.</li>
    <li> Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My injury level:&lt;br /&gt;0/10  I almost always burn myself with my straightener, but I don&#x27;t burn myself with this - go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My success level:&lt;br /&gt;9/10  Just like the box on the first try... I kid you not.  I wasn&#x27;t even using a real mirror (go computer screen reflection!)  The curls lasted beautifully (normally they fall right out).  They held their shape in windy conditions during a 30 minute walk.  They looked lustrous and un-frizzy, with an adorable &amp;#34;idealized natural&amp;#34; form.  I felt like an anime heroine.  I didn&#x27;t know hair could even look like this irl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair:&lt;br /&gt;Heavily layered.  A few inches past my shoulders, at the longest.  Medium thickness.  Naturally wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience level:&lt;br /&gt;Noob.  Never had much success with curling irons.  It takes too long and I always get kinks from the clamp because I&#x27;m leotarded.  Prefer to curl with a straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why do people have such varying experiences?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argument 1: The iron is too hot!/The iron is not hot enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the setting the wand automatically turns on at: 375.  I did not think to use the glove.  You don&#x27;t need to hold the hair with your fingers against the iron.  You just maintain the appropriate angle and leverage, and hold onto the very tip of the hair lock.  Watch some videos and you&#x27;ll have an ah-HA moment.  At one point I did hold my hair to the wand with my bare fingers, just to see what people were experiencing and I still have fingertips and everything.  This tool&#x27;s temperatures fall within a normal range, for contemporary standards - it&#x27;s like using a CHI flat iron.  If it&#x27;s not hot enough for you, or is heating slowly, I think you just got a defective one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as burning yourself goes, I think different people have different spacial awarenesses.  I don&#x27;t seem to know where my forehead is, so I burn it all the time with my straightener.  But my hands and arms were never remotely at risk with this iron, and since the tip was pointing away from my head, I was unlikely to brush against my ears or face.  What I&#x27;m trying to say is: what is dangerous for one person might be easy for you, so don&#x27;t give any review too much weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously don&#x27;t leave the thing plugged in around children or resting with its heating element against a burnable surface.  Is this the criteria we are using to review styling tools now?  Let&#x27;s all just agree that heating elements should be used responsibly (read: with a degree of paranoia) and that no product design is going to save you if you do something careless/irresponsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argument 2: Does not work with layers!  -and- Need to be an expert to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was inspired to buy this because I was watching a YouTube tutorial employing this type of curling iron.  My reaction was: FINALLY!  I don&#x27;t have to deal with that stupid clamp anymore!  The clamp always screws me up!  Yes, I am dumb enough to be foiled by a proper curling iron, but do not let people tell you that you need to be advanced to use this one!  Look at the numbers.  Maybe you will be one of the 4% who find it awkward.  But the odds are in your favor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as layers go, mine are pretty overkill atm and I just didn&#x27;t feel hindered by them at all.  I would say... can you figure out how to maneuver your layers when styling your hair normally - like if you were to do a braided updo or something?  If you can, they won&#x27;t suddenly become a problem for you in this situation.  As I said, I was inspired by a YouTube tutorial, and her hair was even more layered than mine, and a completely different hair type.  One thing that helps is working with a large enough section of hair.  It says right in the manual, to use bigger sections of hair for looser curls.  That&#x27;s what I wanted (I was hoping the .5-1&amp;#34; wouldn&#x27;t be too slender!) so that&#x27;s what I did.  When you&#x27;re using large sections of hair, it&#x27;s easier to maneuver the layers.  I twisted a bit when the hair became sparse and it didn&#x27;t affect the curl.  What&#x27;s better, with large sections the curling is over in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noob + Curler + Layers + 15m work &#x3D; Picture Perfectayers.

    <li> I had never had experience using a curling wand before which is why I purchased this product. The product was cheap and seemed to have good reviews. The product itself is great and it creates very nice curls for its price. Also, it heats up fast and stays hot. Overall, worth the price.</li>
    <li> My curls are finally like the celebrities! I love it and its super easy!&lt;br /&gt;I think i might have to get a bigger barrel for perfection tho.</li>
    <li> very hard to use unless you have a very long hair. I hurt myself once and never use it again.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron, its the one everybody gets or has so i wanted to get it too. But target was always sold out so i order from Amazon, got it pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its just as good as everyone says it is.</li>
    <li> I Purchased this a couple months ago and it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s the wiring inside... sometimes it turns on sometimes it won&#x27;t and while curling my hair it always just shuts off...</li>
    <li> This Wand does what it says, it&#x27;s simple to use too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is it has just the one &#x27;glove&#x27;. Anyone who has used tongs will automatically be tempted to touch the ceramic.&lt;br /&gt;Also, try to keep it away from ears, neck and forehead.  &#x27; It will burn.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for sensible adults only. No kids, no teens and no one with butterfingers.</li>
    <li> Bought this to get those supermodel waves, and the barrel size creates really tiny curls. If that is the look you are going for then great. If you want big loose curls, buy a larger barrel. This product will give you prom hair, not supermodel hair.</li>
    <li> makes tighter curls than I expected, but works great &amp; the glove is very helpful when learning to use it</li>
    <li> I still suck at fixing my hair with this thing.. grrrr the frustration. I burned myself many times, even when I wore the glove that comes with it</li>
    <li> Works great once you get the hang of this style curling iron</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  If you&#x27;re not completely sure how to use watch some youtube videos.  After watching a few I&#x27;ve got it down like a pro and this wand works just how it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item very carefully reviewing the reviews and looked for the best best around! Gosh Amazon beat Walmart prices? OMG I had to buy! It works great!!, the price even better, amazing curls! and comes with the glove.. I mean what mor can you ask for .. quality, price, bonus full glove! I luv it!!!</li>
    <li> Some times it doesn&#x27;t turn on and that bothers me also it blows the circuit a lot but other than that it love it. It makes the PERFECT curls and I enjoy using it even my mom and my sister use it all the time!!!!💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚❤💜💜💙💙💛💛💙💙💜💜💜💚💚💜💜💙💛💛💛💛❤❤❤💚💚❤❤❤❤❤❤💚💚💚💜💜💜💙💙💙💙💙💜💚💚❤💗</li>
    <li> all my other curling irons will be handed over to the thrift shop. easy to use and perfect curls each time. enough said. get it.</li>
    <li> First of all, after buying and using this wand, I feel obligated to put a few of the exaggerated negative reviews about the actual use of this tool to rest. This is just like using any other curling iron, but you wrap your hair around the wand starting from the top of the head rather than at the bottom with a clamp holding the section of hair in place. If you are concerned about burning yourself on this wand, use a lower heat setting. There are plenty of heat settings available. That being said, this is not a curling iron for beginners. Maybe you should consider using curlers instead or starting out with a clamp style wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this curling iron because the reviews all claimed the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look of these big to small curls. I did not like this at all....it made my hair look  UNnaturally curled instead. I have long hair about 10\\&quot; past my shoulders and have been wrapping my hair around a 1/2\\&quot; wand without tapering. I do love the sleek design of the pearl ceramic and will purchase the 1/2\\&quot;, non-tapered wand from this company in place of this tapered tool.</li>
    <li> Curls stay for a few days if you want! Once brushed out with wide-comb or fingers, it looks great! Curls arent too curly and loosen a little bit within a few hrs to create great curls.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair so any curl or wave added to it is usually gone the second I walk out the door but to my surprise the waves I get from this wand stay all day. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is a great curling wand!</li>
    <li> I luv this wand and each curls I make with.....it is everything they say it is. Bouncy curls and heats good</li>
    <li> Love!!!!! I have a lot of hair and this curling wand gets every bit and with a little hairspray it lasts for days :)</li>
    <li> I love the feature it has that it will automatic shuts off after an hour. And the digital indicator showing the temperature is useful, along with the base with the cord twists to prevent tangling. It only takes about 10 minutes or so to heat up.</li>
    <li> love this wand curler!! curls very nice and gets very hot!! and the fact that it is pink is an added bonus lol!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It comes with a glove i thought i wouldnt need it but it came in handy. It made really pretty curls. If you want it get it!</li>
    <li> Love how hot it gets. Save your money guys</li>
</ol>
