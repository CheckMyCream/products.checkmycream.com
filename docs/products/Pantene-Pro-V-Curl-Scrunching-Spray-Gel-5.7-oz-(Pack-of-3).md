<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The gel is a bit thin and feels thinner when applying to wet hair. After it dries, it&#x27;s a soft hold and not hard/crunchy like I expected for a &amp;#34;Max Hold&amp;#34; gel. I prefer Aussie MEN Super Hold gel.</li>
    <li> No flakes, great hold for the whole day.</li>
    <li> Good styling gel for the price. I liked that it didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I dont use alot of gel but this definately gives a great hold and I had no flakes</li>
    <li> I love this specific pantene product.  I will be ordering more in the future.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a long lasting gel that lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> Nice product to shape longer hair.  It is not as good as a spiking gel.</li>
    <li> very good if used before blow dry. keeps hair in place</li>
    <li> I have hair to my butt, and Pantene is the best!!! Now it curls much easier!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This gel holds really great. It is very strong and hard. I like it but I don&#x27;t need to style my hair with max hold so next time i&#x27;ll get something less strong.</li>
    <li> Pretty good gel product, just a tad thick but it holds &amp; doesnt flake</li>
    <li> I love this gel.  I have long hair with shorter hair in the bang area.  Because of the length, I needed a gel that would stand  up to weight and last more than one day if I  needed it too.  I put it on the ends and mostly the scalp area for lift on top....doesn&#x27;t take a lot!  Comb it through and then blow dry or air dry...makes no difference.  Touch the ends up with flat iron...I flip the ends under and curl the top with my flat iron.  Adds volume that does last and is super easy to work with...not heavy or &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; looking at all. I hope they NEVER stop making.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my kind of hair but for my daughter work fine</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to tame my barely controllable cowlicks.</li>
    <li> This product flakes very badly. If you do comb or brush the hair or even sleep after application, you will notice very visible white particles on your hair. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very well at all</li>
    <li> Great product! You only need to use a small amount to get great results. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a great smell.</li>
    <li> Held me down all day long. Worked much better than expected</li>
    <li> Handy cream useful in styling. worth buying it.</li>
    <li> Great product and quality. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Many hair products out there don&#x27;t feel as free and light to sleep with. It does cause some flakes but not really noticeable in an everyday environment.</li>
    <li> I usually dont use gel on my hair, but i purchased this because i got it a deeply discounted price. I have now added this to my subscribe and save. I love it!!! does not leave your hair sticky or stiff. Highly recommend this product especially if you have used moose in the past this replaced the moose i used to use.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great for my hair and smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I got this with a &amp;#34;clipped coupon&amp;#34; to see how it was. It works alright to keep my hair styled, however I need to use a LOT. So that is the reason for my 3 star rating. With that stated I will include that it did not make my hair greasy, which is great. So it works okay, but you may find yourself having to use a bunch each time. For the price it is a 3-4 star product IMO.</li>
    <li> Hi.&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture and smell.&lt;br /&gt;I rub it on my hand to check it and took a small piece of my hair&lt;br /&gt;it  seem to work well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Elizabeth Wieder</li>
    <li> Many stores don&#x27;t carry the Max Hold anymore and only have the 3 or lower versions&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep purchasing this from Amazon... This Max Hold Gel (4) is great&lt;br /&gt;Pantene has always had great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pantene Pro-V 24 Hour Weightless Volume hold 3 is also&lt;br /&gt;a good product but leaves my hair moving too much throughout the day so that is why I use and recommend the Max Hold Gel - 4</li>
    <li> This gel by Pantene is great.It kept the curls in my hair all day long for 24 hours.It was not sticky or anything.I will continue to use this everyday on my hair!</li>
    <li> Not good for my particular needs. I haven&#x27;t used gel in a while and thought this max hold product would work for a messy/spiky look (I am a guy and have shortish, straight, asian hair), but it does not hold my hair up or in place at all. Positive is that the gel is not heavy and does not get stiff. I am going back to hair wax though.</li>
    <li> Interesting how I cannot find this where I live. It is a redesigned package for the same product made by Pantene that I can no longer find.....ingredients are all the same..</li>
    <li> smells and is amazing</li>
    <li> This is a must have add on item! Its an AMAZING gel!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great my son loves it! Easy to style your hair and go. It last all day at school.</li>
    <li> Works just as expected.  Good gell.  Pantene is a name I have always truested well and this didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gel ever.</li>
    <li> Hair becomes dry after some time.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here. It works great. Does not leave any residues or white flakes in the hair like cheap brands. keeps hair in place all-day and easy to wash out the next day. Hair looks healthy and shiny in this all day. Very happy. I&#x27;m a regular subscriber of this now.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold well. Don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> my hair is difficult but this helps</li>
    <li> Solid but it doesn&#x27;t last a whole day. Super cheap but you are paying the price for it. IF you have thick hair this might work but if you have a lot of thin hair, it breaks up. Water the hair helps, but it&#x27;s not a good look.</li>
    <li> This is really nice gel and it doesn&#x27;t leave white dandruff behind and had good hold.  If you ate looking for Jersey Shore style hold then this is not for you. My one complain is for some reason the gel leaks from bottle all the time and half the gel is just wasted. Besides this it&#x27;s pretty awesome gel with no smell and good hold.</li>
    <li> Great hold with no flaking. I used to use hair wax and went back to gel after 8 years of the wax. Great product and lasts all day. I usually go to the gym at noon and my hair still stays in place afterwards for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel product I will use for my hair. I&#x27;m a guy who uses a little gel in the morning before brushing, and it holds my hair for 80% of the day the way I want it. I&#x27;ve tried other less expensive products, with poor results. A great price and does exactly what it is advertised for.</li>
    <li> Not as sticky as a lot of other gels out there, works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied with this product it leaves my her fluffy and wet looking when other products leave my hair frizzy looking&lt;br /&gt;I will totally keep buying this product</li>
    <li> Wife likes it, she uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Top was broken and 1/2 the gel leaked out on my bathroom counter the 1st night</li>
    <li> I love they way it holds in my hair, but I also love that it smells so good! And also, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I stuck my hand in a tub of glue haha :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not max hold but I like it.  You can&#x27;t spike with it or sculpt but keeps my hair in place.  My hair is currently about a hands length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Male 40+</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thick gel, but the hold is great.</li>
    <li> I really  like it. I used Aussie  gel before but this works just as good and cheaper on subscribe and save subscription.</li>
    <li> Love Pantene products!  This gel is perfect!</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding this product in the stores that usally carry it. Had been trying to get more for 3 weeks with no sucess.  I like this product, it helps keep my curls longer.</li>
    <li> Very good gel with great holding power.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Great holding power.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to help keep my hair under control.  My hair is very straight and loves to fall in my eyes.  It allows me to brush my hair back and keep it off the face while not giving it the sticky look of hair spray.</li>
    <li> As a retired hairstylist, I am very particular about the gel I use on my own hair, and this one is the best,by far, of any of the many I have tried.  I haven&#x27; been able to find in two cities, so it made me very happy to find it on Amazon.  It gives me just the right amount of texture for staying my Asian, very short, very old hair without needing curlers, blow drying, or anything other than my bare fingers.  It dries quickly, has no odor, is never sticky, and can be refreshed with a simple wet finger combing.  I don&#x27;t usually even need my Pantene hair spray unless it&#x27;s a very windy day.  I love it!</li>
    <li> my friends and family find this to be an overpowering gel and consistently comment that I smell like hair product despite my cologne. quite annoying.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this gel and the stores quit selling this one that&#x27;s #4 hold. Love this will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Use it every day to give my short do a little lift!</li>
    <li> s***** ass gel, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this gel for my short, fine , curly  hair. This gel holds with a natural look, not stiff looking, not sticky either. Holds the volume well when  blow drying and cuts the frizz. Helps to keep hair straight. For a natural curly look without the frizz, apply , style with fingers and let dry.</li>
    <li> Great hair gel if you really want body.  I buy in quantity so that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Good price with the clipped coupon</li>
    <li> I use it daily, leave my hair nice and shine. will buy more when run out.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair too crispy. It hold well but I can barely use any org hair looks greasy and is crispy to the touch. Not my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel ever! Holds my hair in place all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes of replacing the salon gel I was using that costs double. First time I purchased this, I got the level 2 and this time I got the 4. The 4 is much better. It&#x27;s holds better and lasts longer. Not quite as long as the salon brand but good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I got it at a great price. Work good.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair such great body and I really love it.</li>
    <li> It was definitely not the same product I originally used.  Same container.  I do wonder why this cannot be found in stores anywhere but Amazon had the container with totally inferior product.  The cap was heavily taped which I thought was to prevent leakage, now I wonder.</li>
    <li> I use gel every day and have tried many brands, and right now Pantene is my favorite.  The hold is strong without making your hair look greasy and smell bad.  I&#x27;ve also tried the same gel in the strength a step down from this one and like that equally.  Will definitely keep using this product unless they switch formulas like some of the past brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am using the gel right. I use it on toweled dried, still wet hair, then blow dry, then use hair wax/paste. It doesnt seem to hold very strong (but I dont even know if I am using it right..), however it is very useful with organizing hair so that there wont be frizzes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;And I like how it is easily workable with hand to hair.</li>
    <li> Many stores don&#x27;t carry the Max Hold anymore and only have the 3 or lower versions&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep purchasing this from Amazon... This Max Hold Gel (4) is great&lt;br /&gt;Pantene has always had great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pantene Pro-V 24 Hour Weightless Volume hold 3 is also&lt;br /&gt;a good product but leaves my hair moving too much throughout the day so that is why I use and recommend the Max Hold Gel - 4</li>
    <li> This product works great! My daughter has very long and, thanks to the Georgia humidity, somewhat frizzy hair. Hairspray leaves too much gross residue but this gel from Pantene works all day without all the nasty white stuff that hairspray leaves! We would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> So love this ... it is more than I expected. Keep my hair in place for the whole day and its not dry. Love the texture of he gel and its not sticky when I put it on my hair... no foul smell. Will surely get another bottle</li>
    <li> Love Pantene products!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was on sale and my husband is always looking for new gel.  The best part about this one is it keeps a strong hold so he&#x27;s able to keep his spikies nice and hard.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Hold the style pretty well.  Make your hairs look fuller.</li>
    <li> Worth the price. This is very handy for styling.</li>
    <li> Best gel for my curly hair!!! Unfortunately, it&#x27;s very difficult to find the level 4 in stores! I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s discontinued or not:/</li>
    <li> amazing quality gel lasts long time</li>
    <li> two things I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;1- I used other gels before and this one hold but not really strong or the max that I needed!&lt;br /&gt;2- What about this white particles (powder like) after application for sometime? is it just me? Did anybody noticed that? really bad and stopped using it after 2nd time!</li>
    <li> I love all Pantene products.  I use their shampoo and their gel, and it works really well for my hair.</li>
    <li> stiff hair-good product.</li>
    <li> The best styling gel I have used to date.</li>
    <li> The product leaks gel over time outside badly even when put sideways, the gel is good but the packaging makes this product a two star.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but make sure the cap is snapped closed before you store it standing up.  It may seemed closed until you find a puddle of hair gel on your counter top.</li>
    <li> Great product, can&#x27;t wear my hair naturally without it. My husband and son use it as well.</li>
    <li> Good strong hold, good value, however I have to use ALOT to get my hair smoothed down completely</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product.</li>
    <li> Really is a good product for frizzy,, fly away hair.  Has great hold.  I have tried many different products and this one seems to work the best for me.</li>
    <li> Great product making it easy to purchase.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product!</li>
    <li> Great hold and non flaking.</li>
    <li> Work great.It is about right strength. can be washed away with water</li>
    <li> Amazing prices and cash shipping, thank you! Will be back to shop more!!!</li>
    <li> High quality and holds good in all conditions.</li>
    <li> this gel sucks, it dont hold strong.</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V Stylers Max Hold Gel works quite well at holding your style if you curl, roll or flat iron your hair. It works well for men&#x27;s hair if they like to mess it up a bit. It doesn&#x27;t work as well if I want to let my naturally curly hair be free. It gets a little crunchy. I recommend this for heat styled hair that you want to stay in place. I prefer something less sticky if I am not planning to flat iron or heat set my hair.</li>
    <li> I wish the &amp;#34;Max Hold&amp;#34; was a little stronger, but it is still useful.</li>
    <li> I hate product and love this stuff. It leaves my hair really soft. The max hold is ok for gel. It&#x27;s certainly not pomade strength. But my hair doesn&#x27;t feel hard, or break or anything after I use it. I recommend it for light hold needs. Also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like crew.</li>
    <li> This product give me a very good hold, without messy flaky residue in my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff holds my hair to the max. THE MAX.</li>
    <li> A little too stiff, for my liking.</li>
    <li> I normally go for Paul Mitchell Super Clean Sculpture hair gel. They worked for me great over the years. Since this Pantene Pro-V was on  sale I decided to try. The gel is OK, but it is not a whole day hold. You need another spray gel to hold the hair in place, especially if you have thinning, straight hair. But, considering these were about 40% cheaper than the saloon price of Paul Mitchel&#x27;s I use this all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Bal</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works well.</li>
