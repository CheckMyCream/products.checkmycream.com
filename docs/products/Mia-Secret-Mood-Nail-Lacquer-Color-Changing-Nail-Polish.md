<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would buy all the colors if I could !!!! Works great</li>
    <li> This nail polish is so fun!  It changes color based on temperature, so it&#x27;s cool to see it go from purple to pink when I hold a hot beverage or go from pink to purple when I go outside on a cold day.  Very cool product, makes me feel like I&#x27;m a kid again!</li>
    <li> It actually does change color as described, but your fingernail has to be on ice, or something really cold, in order to see the purple. The pink is extremely light. You need to thick coats to see the pink. The purple is really dark. But the purple is only seen when your nail is extremely cold</li>
    <li> Chips off way too much even on acrylic nails. Colors nice though and it does change colors .</li>
    <li> I have receive the mood change polish and I really like it I when I paint my nail I just love to watch how is changes colour it very fun I absolutely love it</li>
    <li> I love how it changes but you will definitely need a top coat because there is no shine. This polish chips very easily. I find myself taking it with me to work to do touch ups. Over all good product.</li>
    <li> The nail polish was great although it came off to soon.</li>
    <li> I really like this polish. I use a base coat and a top coat and I haven&#x27;t seen a chip yet, it changes really fast and it&#x27;s fun to watch it change. I also got this product in a week. I would buy this againüëç</li>
    <li> polish is hold flaked off same day painted nails</li>
    <li> Shipping was as expected. Colors change great! You&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even need a top coat it doesn&#x27;t chip at all!</li>
    <li> awesome product... i just love it :) very happy</li>
    <li> I love this polish but it started chipping in one day. I was disappointed as the tips are the part that changes colors and with all the chipping off...I couldn&#x27;t enjoy them past a day. You do need to put on several coats for full effect. I also used a clear top coat that didn&#x27;t interfere with the color changing. I won&#x27;t buy anymore...but my girls will love putting this on their nails too!</li>
    <li> Changes color and looks great!  Dries matte but a top coat takes care of that easy.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this looking at the reviews but I&#x27;m glad I did. I got this for my daughter and it actually changes colors! It does chip off easily but she&#x27;s little and likes to change her nail polish often so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Hey you get what you pay for js</li>
    <li> While it did start to chip off just under a week of wear and I did have to put on several layers (3 I believe) in order to get the full effect of the colors, the colors changed just as expected. It was very cool and I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good thing is it came the next day of ordering but YES IT CHIPS OFF FAST... GOTTA PUT A TOP COAT OF CLEAR ON...</li>
    <li> The order was exactly what I wanted and I received my nail polish in a reasonable time. They were quick to give me a conformation number.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great color nail polish and i love it on my hand&#x27;s,and I use it everyday and i would like to say thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Just like the other reviews said, use a base and top coat to make it stick and look shiny. The color change is slower than I was hoping, but that&#x27;s comparing to the Solar Gel type formulas which look more like &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;. Good for my daughter who&#x27;s too young for solar gel polish</li>
    <li> Great polish daughter loves it chips easy but overall good polish for price</li>
    <li> I love it!  When I am upset it turns purple and when I am relaxed it turns pink.  Sometimes, it will be both colors.  The only thing that I do not like about it is that it is a very flat color and you should use a clear overcoat on it.</li>
    <li> I am an older lady!  ( just turned 63) I liked this and now that Amazon reminded me I will get this out and use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s very interesting about this is I don&#x27;t get too many comments by girl friends/coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s by men!  I don&#x27;t know why they remark about my changing color nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as good as an old fashion mood ring.</li>
    <li> This polish does not stay on long..</li>
    <li> I just wish the bottle was bigger but the colors are exactly what you see on the picture. I will order another color soon.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed having my nails change color.&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, this is not the best nail polish quality so you are going to have it peel off in about 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> This don&#x27;t switch with mood only temperature</li>
    <li> I got this a couple of days ago I read the reviews so I took a risk and purshased it I put it on put on a top coat with stars in it and a plan top coat it was so amazing it really changes colors  so I bought the other color the blue one can&#x27;t wait to try that one but the polish stays on just use a good top coat and your good!!</li>
    <li> WOW what a Mood Keeper!! This polish really works and it looks soooo cool!</li>
    <li> Color change not noticeable. Polish peels off after a day. Would not recommend. Bad product.  A waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Purple and pink look like photo.&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t change Color if you don&#x27;t have nail tips past your fingers or close.&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because there&#x27;s no such thing as mood polish. It&#x27;s hot and cold sensitive. Therefore, if you&#x27;re buying this hoping for the french look as the pics show, you won&#x27;t get it if you don&#x27;t actually have tips to look french with!!!&lt;br /&gt;But if you take shower or wash dishes etc (heated things) nails will turn pink. If run cold water over hands or stick in fridge for a minute etc (cold stuff) they turn purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining about the matte color, that&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t apply top coat!!! Sheesh. That&#x27;s a given!&lt;br /&gt;Many wonderful brands (eg China glaze) dry matte and require a top coat! Many. That is NOT indicative of quality!!! At. All.&lt;br /&gt;Proper polish application always includes base, color (2-3 coats), and top coat (1-2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this color on using base and top coats and it lasted 7 days with ZERO chips or anything. And it worked great every day (color changes)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy and fun. I will buy the full set if colors after trying this one and it being so awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative (if any) is the pink is a bright pink. Not something I love. (But I&#x27;m anti pink so it&#x27;s not a fair judgement). Even though I don&#x27;t love the shade of pink...the polish was so great and does exactly as it was advertised to (and more than expected!!!) Definitely recommend. Try it. (But short nails...beware. You may not get the french look!!!)</li>
    <li> it does exactly what is says it will do. looks cute at the beach/pool when you cool off it gets purple! hah!! and it stays on well!</li>
    <li> The color change is fun and dramatic. I&#x27;ve had it on my toenails for a little over two weeks and it&#x27;s just starting to chip. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This polish goes on good, but dose need two coats. But it dose not change with moods. It changes with cold and warm.....</li>
    <li> love the color changes, just chips easily.</li>
    <li> Nice paint, it works as described, changes color with temperature changes.</li>
    <li> This is super fun, the color change works well but the polish does chip quickly</li>
    <li> I bought this polish to use with my daughters (7 and 9 yrs old).  They were so excited because they could see the color changing as I painted their nails.  We like this so much, I ordered the other colors as well.  So happy to have found color changing polish that doesn&#x27;t need the UV light.</li>
    <li> Really does change color with hot under the collar or cold temp. Had to buy for friends from Amazon when couldn&#x27;t buy anywhere else who really wanted it when they saw mine.  :)</li>
    <li> The shipping came earlier then expected which was excellent . The polish itself works but chips easily even if you have one layer or two or a top coat .</li>
    <li> Love it. again had no idea this color changing nail polish was out these until i received this i  am actually wearing it now</li>
    <li> the color changes between purple and pink very obviously ...it is just so cool ..and didnt have any bad smell ....love it ...&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is it doesnt last very long maybe 2-3days it starts to crack no matther how many layers I put on..but still love it  ...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish! I was skeptical at buying it at first because it seemed too cheap to be cool or work very well. But it&#x27;s so awesome I bought the rest of the colors available. When your hands turn hot or cold it changes color almost instantly. I would definitely recumbent this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really cool! Color changes and sometimes gives an ombre effect. The only issue is it chips off REALLY easy even with top coat.</li>
    <li> This is very cool. I just got this and put it on one nail to see how it looks. I have my own long nails and the bed is pink and my tips are purple. Got this for my daughter who has short nails so don&#x27;t know how it will look on her nails. But overall I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Chips very easy. My girls ages 4-6 loved the color and the changing of colors. Just beware it chips super easy!</li>
    <li> My daughter Love that it changes color but it&#x27;s a very cheap type of nail polish</li>
    <li> I did a base coat and top coat like suggested in other reviews. Works great and lasted almost a week, I&#x27;m hard on my hands, between very frequent washing (work in childcare) and I like being in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;But the color was so cool. My nails had different looks all day. Sometimes purple, sometimes pink, sometimes fancy French manicure, sometimes gradual change from tip to base of nail.</li>
    <li> Quality of the polish was not good. It comes off easily</li>
    <li> Wasnt a pretty finish even after i put clear over the nail polish, did change color but looked lumpy and messy</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this product because although it does change colors, which is nice, the polish chips too easily.  I applied a few coats and the next day the color was chipping off on every nail.  By the end of the week it looked terrible.  I would not purchase it again at this price.</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle of Mia Secret mood changing color polish and was told free shipping.It came postage due for $1.83!What a rip off.I have put 3 coats on my nail and it is very dull looking,,not at all like the photo.I would Not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa S.</li>
    <li> I like to find some different things.  This polish is really cool and does turn color easily.  But it seems to chip really easily.  Maybe have to layer a few clear top coats to stabilize the chipping.</li>
    <li> The color is not true to what&#x27;s in the bottle.  When it changed my nails looked weird like only part of my nails changed</li>
    <li> Love it came fast.  And stays on long</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t really like ir the color only changes when u wash ur hands</li>
    <li> Was very excited to find this product and purchase it for a friend.  Was even more excited that it shipped as quickly as it did.  Needless to say my friend was very excited to get it, since I had not told her that I had ordered it for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review was not kind.  The person I bought it for had told me that it didn&#x27;t work.  I then jumped online and wrote a negative review as well as negative feedback to the seller.  Who by the way immediately responded wanting to make it right.  While that was happening the person I bought it for called me.  It seems she only tested the nail polish under cold/luke warm water.  Once she went to wash her hands under hot water it immediately changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are going to buy this product make sure the person you are buying it for is smarter than the bottle of polish.</li>
    <li> Loooove it! Works great and covers nicely. I recommend and am going to get other colors.</li>
    <li> I love how it changes (: It does look how it is shown here. It chips at the top maybe a week after, but who cares! Just use a top coat. It&#x27;s the best nail polish (Especially now since it&#x27;s going to start getting colder outside, which means purple lovers can see the purple :D)</li>
    <li> Awesome color change.  But did chip easily even with a quality top coat</li>
    <li> Works great on natural nails and acrylics.</li>
    <li> This product was beyond amazing it works very well i highly suggest this product It changes from pink to purple in seconds.</li>
    <li> The polish does change color! I wish it was more evident on the ends of my nails. I would like to see the difference between the tip cool color and the nail bed warm color. It is fun and amazing. I would pick a color that has a large contrast to really notice the change. Seller was quick on shipping.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 10 year old niece. Very reactive to temperature and changed colors even with a heavy top coat layer. It spreads thin and chipped easily, so a couple of coats may be needed. Matte finish. Would definitely buy it again in different shades!</li>
    <li> This polish does change colors.  It chips very easy.  I even used a top coat and it still chipped with in hours of putting it on.  I would recommend a top coat because it has a dull finish after it dryes without a top coat. Still it is not worth the money because it will not stay on for a full day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t change colors....</li>
    <li> Needs two layers of polish.</li>
    <li> Turned pink right away after I put it on and never changed back to purple. Disappointed:/</li>
    <li> Polish does not change colors as I expected. Dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a really good polish. I did my toe nails with it about 2 weeks ago and it is still looking good (no chipping or peeling) The color is great and it does change color just like it says. Very good quality with a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> love love it!! everyone thought it was also pretty I was looking to see about more colors but i only see colors that are not really usable</li>
    <li> I loved the color changing and the colors. But it chips so easily that I had to reapply it. Every other day</li>
    <li> Great and it works amazingly.  It is super pretty and it came super early. The bottle is super small though!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t change the color at all</li>
    <li> Arrived safely packaged before expected arrival date. Polish is a little thick, but works great. Changes from purple to pink. I used base coat, 2 coats of polish, &amp; a top coat. I plan ordering more in other colors.</li>
    <li> This nail polish met my expectations. The color changed as seen. It dried without much shine, so I put a top coat on, which I would have done anyway.</li>
    <li> I have worn this polish on my acrylic finger nails. It did not chip the entire time I had it on. The colors are beautiful. I would definitely buy another color of this polish. I am wearing on my toenails now and I have experienced some slight chipping, but nothing major. This polish goes on very nice. It is something fun and different.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 13 y/o niece for christmas, she absolutely loves it! The color changes as expected, will look for other colors to add to her collection.</li>
    <li> i truly love this polish and i been using it sparingly as i dont want to run of of it</li>
    <li> I bought this at random on Amazon, and was a bit skeptical about how well it would work or how good it would look.  It turns out that this color is fantastic!  Even with a basecoat and a topcoat, the color changed easily depending on whether my hands were warm or cool.  Typically, most of the nail was pink and the tips were purple - a cool french manicure without the work!  I could not stop staring at my nails, and actually later went and purchased every color they had!</li>
    <li> The same as the others reviews it does chip really fast and easily plus my mom had to put ice directly on her nails and it does changes the color but the temperature needed for that has to be very intense</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says.  It goes from purple to pink.  I purchased this for my granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Total crap! Equivalent to painting your nails with water-soluble fingerpaint. Dusty and clumpy going on, and chipped within an hour. Thick pink and never changed color. I&#x27;ve had the salon-quality applied professionally, and this is nothing even close. Wanted in a hurry, so paid more for expedited shipping than the actual product price. A huge disappointment! Do not waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I was excited about color changing polish.  However,  it did not have a shiny finish nor did it last long.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE POLISH ITSELF BUT I STILL HAD A LOT OF CHIPPING POLISH ON MY NAILS!! tHE COLOR IS GREAT AND IT SURE STAYS ON GOOD!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and it really does change colors the only down fall is this does chip very easy so it would be best if you use a base coat first and finish with a top coat, a very fun interesting polish for any age.</li>
    <li> makes a great impression and really pops. A few of my friends have borrowed it and love it too. just a peice of advice the polish does chip easy so use a good base and top coat</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think the polish would work but it did.One coat worked great with a top coat to add shine. It didn&#x27;t chip and so far it has lasted about 2 weeks</li>
    <li> This polish is no good. It chips off the next day after u have applied it. Even if a top coat is put on.</li>
    <li> Hot temperature makes it pink, cold makes it purple, and it dries REALLY quickly but I would recommend a clean coat on top to remove the &#x27;dry, pasty&#x27; look it has.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 0 stars if possible. Dries chalky and streaky. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> just received this today i put it on my toes and it did change from purple to pink. it was a fast delivery. thanks</li>
    <li> Streaky and chips too easily</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase.use a base and a top coat for some shine and protection.</li>
    <li> Chips within hours!!  Nice color, but, not great quality.</li>
    <li> This nail polish dries really fast, so no need to worry about smuding! It totally works, and I wish there were TONS more color options!</li>
    <li> I like this one, it does change colors, very much a noticeable change. It&#x27;s cute I used it on my granddaughters nail and she really liked it. So yeah this one is a good investment stylish the color too...</li>
    <li> it really does work!!!&lt;br /&gt;my body temp changes all the time&lt;br /&gt;i even had a lady i work&lt;br /&gt;with ask me if my nail color changed&lt;br /&gt;because it was pink at one time and&lt;br /&gt;turned purple.</li>
    <li> item as described! mom loved it!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this polish. The color is nice and I like watching the change. The only downside is that it does chip easily as the other reviewers have said. It chipped hours after I put it on even with a top coat. I definitely would buy this again however.</li>
    <li> I like the changing color, but the finish isn&#x27;t very shiny.  I do wish the main color of the polish was lavender as it looks in the bottle, but pink is the color on the nails.  When it changes, the tips of my nails were lavender.  It&#x27;s fun though!</li>
    <li> Not the best quality chip easy</li>
    <li> It dries very lumpy. Not a fan of it</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described n was shipped very quickly</li>
    <li> Unique and really meet expectation !</li>
    <li> This polish really works! It changes colors based on the temp of ur hands - super cool! Chips kinda easy but a good top coat should keep that under control. I ordered the blue now that I know it works!</li>
    <li> Love how it changes colors! However, doesn&#x27;t last long and dull.</li>
    <li> Changes nicely...too bad its  flat color and not glossy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and it works great but I don&#x27;t know if putting a top coat of clear on it would matter</li>
    <li> color change aspect is cool..color chips off immediately</li>
    <li> Works as described. It will basically be purple if you are cold and pink when you are hot. On long nails, the tips might be a different color creating an ombre effect. It is really matte so looks better with a clear topcoat. I am overall pleased with this polish and it&#x27;s a decent price.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter. She love the changing colors and likes to show her friends her cool nail polish. I think its cool the price and shipping were good too</li>
    <li> Neat, i&#x27;m excited to see new colors...</li>
    <li> Really works! Only down side is the polish chips easily. Other then that super cool how it goes from purple to pink depending on temperature!</li>
    <li> DESCRIPTION IS FALSE. the color change based on temperature like putting your hand under cold water.</li>
    <li> Very pretty heat change polish. Only obviously detectable if you have a free edge on nail. Cool because nail longer than finger is the cool color and nail on nail bed is warm color from body heat.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Doesn&#x27;t change well at all. I  used much better thermal nail polishes that are sensitive to cold/heat. I can wash my hands with this and the color never changes.</li>
    <li> This polish is a lot of fun, easily changing colors as the temperatures change.  When I placed my order for the purple to pink, I was actually shipped the pink to peach.  The company let me keep the incorrect color, as they sent me the original order for free.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish. Its a nice purple color. When your body temperature heats up or when you put your hands under warm water, it turns pink. it&#x27;s pretty cool. Idk about anyone else but I liked it.</li>
    <li> Did not last too long. Chips easily.</li>
    <li> This item arrived fairly quickly which was great! I noticed the nail polish dried to a matte finish so I highly suggest using a top coat. Also, the nail polish chips very fast but it does change from purple to pink as it says. Overall the product is good.</li>
    <li> Love this polish. Color changed outdoor. Delivery on time</li>
    <li> I love the color, and I love the concept.  I loved watching the color change.  But it chipped so easily.  I used two coats and also put a top coat on.  It was really chipped the next day.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish!! Everything about it is amazing! I love how I can manipulate the colors and how it leaves that ombre effect on my nails after its left alone. I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing other colors.</li>
    <li> My little girl and wife love it.  My wife paints all my nieces nails with it.  They had a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> This nail polish works amazingly well. Goes on smoothly and dries very fast! The only thing I didnt like is that its not very shiny, but since it changed colors it was still very fun to wear! My nails are very long so it looked like I had a french manicure. The tips purple and the base of my nails pink from the warmth of my hands.</li>
    <li> This  nail polish is thin and chips easily however it really does  change colors like it says. Requires a few coats and a top coat to last more then a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I loveeee love loveeee üòä I ordered the polish March 9th &amp; I was supposed to receive it March 17th buuuut I got them today on March 13th üòÅ went to the nail shop got acrylic and had them coat it 3 times &amp; ofcoure put clear on &amp; when they were under the dryer drying they were all purple at first and I was thinking it didn&#x27;t work but after it dryed it was so pretty &amp; changing colors really good üôå I&#x27;m soooo happy with this purchase üíÖüíÅ</li>
    <li> I love it but it chips easy. Fun to watch it change colors lol. I can always tell when my fingers are getting cold.</li>
    <li> The color is very true to the pink purple that you see and it does change like its suppose to. It is a matte color but with a top coat its ok. But it chips very easily. For some reason with 3 coats of polish and 2 coats of top coat it won&#x27;t last more than 3 days if it even lasts that long.</li>
    <li> This product did not change color. Stays only purple.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish. I really get the full effect when its windy outside or in the car with the air on. when you wash your hands the nail polish will change also...Really cool!</li>
    <li> Polish would chip off the next day and I even used a gripper</li>
    <li> This nail polish tends to crack so easily compared to regular nail polishes. However, as far as I can tell, any color changing nail polish does crack easily. I love the color change though. If you are too busy to do your nails very week or every other day, this isn&#x27;t the nail polish for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I would have loved it if I would ever received it!</li>
    <li> Quality is not good. Needed several coats to even cover the nail. It does change color but not significantly.</li>
    <li> It start off purple and change to pink but it never change back to purple.So not my ideal of mood change</li>
    <li> this s*** only last for one damn day or at least a couple hours</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish!!!!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and I love the colors .. Cold water change to purple.. Hot water change to pink.</li>
    <li> Pretty color.... but yet to change color!</li>
    <li> I loooovvvveeee it and it changes to what it s supposed to change to. will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this fo my mom, she loves it so I&#x27;m about to order another one in a different shade.</li>
    <li> Chips momentarily! Not a really good quality, but great color change! I would only recommend to expect to wear this product for a day only.</li>
    <li> It changes color exactly like the bottle says it does.  I love it.  Not sure how they get the pink/purple to go diagnally but I am sure I will figure it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know is it pink. i think it&#x27;s purple to another purple, i can&#x27;t see pink. Not like what i thought.</li>
    <li> Works Amazing if you have long nails. So if your nails are always super short don&#x27;t buy. If they are long this prouct is amazing.</li>
    <li> This brand lived up to my expectations . It changed from a pretty pink to an awesome purple. I would buy Mia brand again.</li>
    <li> A magic nail polish,When the temperature becomes hot to cold,or cold to hot , it will change color ,amazing ~!</li>
    <li> This nailpolish is AWESOME - it makes me happy when I&#x27;m sitting at the computer all day - it is less boring when I can see the colors changing. Pretty colors too. It does chip easily so make sure to put on nail protector under and above this nail polish so it will last longer.</li>
    <li> chipped off right away. didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!! I cannot stop looking at my nail now! I went back and ordered another one and now im thinking of ordering another color.  Only reason why I did not give it 5 stars was b/c like all the other reviews say, it does chip super fast.  I even tried coating it with a long wear but still it chips off :( But I will still order another one :-)</li>
    <li> perfect item and service</li>
    <li> The granddaughters loved it.</li>
    <li> great!!!! It did change color</li>
    <li> Polish is very very thick.  The colors are quite darker than picture.  The polish has a rubbery texture to it.  The polish was changing color for me as I was applying it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that it would &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; so good. It does change color depending on the hands&#x27; temperature, and my granddaughter really likes it.</li>
    <li> Cute, changes to pink!</li>
    <li> Great conversation item.  Everyone noticed the different colors on some fingers.  Changes colors easily when hands are hot or cold.  Pretty colors.&lt;br /&gt;  Bought a second bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail polish last year and i love the colors and how it changes due to temperature, but in all honesty, it chips super easy. I&#x27;ll be wearing it for a day and the next day some polish has already chipped off, and i didnt even mess with my nails or anything! All in all, great polish, just be prepared to only wear it for a couple days before it goes away.</li>
    <li> No color change in water, heat or air conditioning.  Chipped fast</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get this one, got a pink glow in the dark instead.  Not what I wanted, the one I got doesn&#x27;t even glow.</li>
    <li> Love it... even though it was really dull at first, top coat made it shine. Dried fast. I&#x27;m ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> if u do housework.... dont buy this because it does chip easy, and the color it is when warm is pink, i thought it wiuld have been purple</li>
    <li> It does work you just need a top coat and than it lasts week n a half to two weeks :) I love this nail polish!</li>
    <li> i luv how it changes colors depending on the situation....def want to try other colors offered..it also goes on smoothly</li>
    <li> the color change is cool but the polish is sooooo thin. you need soo many coats and then they still chip a lot.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s purple when cold and pink when warm. The only bad thing is it chips easily</li>
    <li> This nail polish was runny, it didn&#x27;t change colors and came off easily.  I would not recommend it at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color. Only downfall is that it chips very quickly. In less than 24 hours, I had to reapply it again.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is so awesome.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Really works but need a lot of coatings to not be so see thru could deff use improvement</li>
    <li> love the color of it but this is cheap fingernail polish chips real easy</li>
    <li> Like how it changes but chipped easily</li>
    <li> I order this for my girls, they love nails like their mom, it came in fairly quickly but this is more for kids not for adults, it goes on okay but you need about two coats, regardless I&#x27;m purchasing the other colors for them : ) (purple into pink is the first we got...pretty)</li>
    <li> I love how it changes color!! Right now my nails are pink but the tips are purple!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Using and wearing this polish is nothing but fun!  I especially enjoy doing my nails with my grandaughters with this polish.  They delight in seeing how to make it change color.  I would recommend this to anyone from 8yrs-80yrs!  Just for fun I put a lavender opaque over coat!  It shimmers and changes color!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my niece as a gift, she loved it! The color changes in the sun, but she also discovered it changes more quickly under hot/cold water.</li>
    <li> it actually works and then some nice color pink a nice color for you when the temperature changes it</li>
    <li> I liked this nail polish. It was really thick so it only took a couple of coats. I wear acrylic tips so everyone thought it was cool that my nails were pink with purple tips. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that cracks appeared within the paint (which is abnormal with quality nail polish, especially on acrylic nails). Also, I wish it was just a little bigger. But overall it was something new to try and it was fun to wear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the picture it comes off very easy</li>
    <li> Polish is nice but chips away fast.  Also  when it was shipped I ended up paying for postage.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this polish cahnges color sometimes all purple and sometimes all pink and at other times looks so good half pink and half purple and when it comes through two tone the color blends so well looks like you paid a real lot to have professional done.  I want to buy more colors and an extra bottle of the purple/pink so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Its OK, what you should know is it paints on like a matte. Looks a bit like colorful white out.</li>
    <li> I love the color and it really does change but it chips very easily.</li>
    <li> it only took about 4 days to arrive, and I was anxious how the color would change, but it changes in hot water! :) it&#x27;s a cheap polish, so you&#x27;ll need a pretty good top coat, but it really works! and it&#x27;s super cute. I definitely want more colors.</li>
    <li> It does the job of color changing but it chips very easily.</li>
    <li> It did its job with changing colors, and of course you need a good quality top coat to make it last.</li>
    <li> No sheen and it didn&#x27;t change color for me.</li>
    <li> The nail polish is nice and changes color. The only problem, it does not stay on for long. I used the bottle up pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> perfect everyone loves this  Thank you</li>
    <li> This nail polish never changed color for me!  I purchased the purple to pink  with the expectation that it would change based on someone else&#x27;s review. Well, it didn&#x27;t.  I was a waste of money. If you want to buy it simply based on the color alone just know it goes on matte. No shine at all like indicated in the photo.</li>
    <li> This polish changes color like it says. You get more than the 2 colors shown. if you are thinking about getting this...do it! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why all the negative reviews. I have bought 3 different ones so far and they all work really well. it is a Matt finish so I just put on a top coat of clear and shiny..which I do any way when I polish.. and Walla shiny !! will be buying more, also will get some for the granddaughters for Christmas .</li>
