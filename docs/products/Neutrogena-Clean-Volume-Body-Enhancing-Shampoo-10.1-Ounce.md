      <li>far as I can tell it does a good job</li>

      <li>B0058DIXTE Neutrogena Clean Replenishing Conditioner, 10.1 Ounce (Pack of 2)]].  </li>
      <li>makes my hair really clean.</li>
      <li>Stay away if you need your hair actually clean with no residue.</li>
      <li>Between neutrogena and aveeeno marketing their products like they are natural, clean and healthy I&#x27;m fed up!</li>
      <li>Most $20-$40 shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s are for delusional people with too much money to blow</li>
      <li>and I thought if it&#x27;s good enough for her I will give it a try.</li>
      <li>My hair really does feel bouncy and has more \\&quot;life\\&quot; to it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was perfect and is even pay more than normal to get it...just not exotic, rarity rates of $40/bottle is right out.  </li>

      <li>I recently made the switch from Redkin to this, and I love it so much better.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this shampoo.</li>

      <li>It is a simple shampoo without a strong scent like most shampoos.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard that for every day shampoos, you should use clear ones and not creamy shampoos because they have more chemicals and leave residue.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is good, but I&#x27;m a guy with short hair, and I don&#x27;t notice too much difference with conditioners (my gf likes it though).  </li>
      <li>I love this particular formulation and can&#x27;t find it in the stores, so I was glad to find some left through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Have used other Neutrogena products and loved.  </li>
      <li>Did not like it at all dispite good reviews I saw about this product by other consumers.</li>
      <li>* not harsh - not overly strong on the scalp or hair as some shampoos cannot be used daily&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, it is very long and tangles easily.  </li>
      <li>Great product, but hard to find.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price for two. This shampoo brought back memories because I used it in high school but havent seen it in stores, still smells the same and it is not overwhelming, really cleans hair and gets oils out, my hair is prone to buildup and gets oily and this shampoo really helps.</li>
    <li> Love it but it is too expensive.</li>
    <li> I previously used another Neutrogena product and can no longer find so tried this.  I use for the purpose of getting hair products (body builders, gel, spray, etc) out of my hair before using my more expensive shampoo which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work as well for this specific purpose. This is great--a nice fragrance, even though it does what it&#x27;s suppose to, it isn&#x27;t as harsh as the other Neutrogena and even has a body building element built into it.  The pack of two for this price is a steal---I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere and paid almost as much for only one bottle.  Won&#x27;t do that again!  Amazon.com--you&#x27;re the best!!</li>
    <li> This is, without question, the best shampoo for men with thinning hair. It&#x27;s not overly fragrant, like so many other shampoos, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat, like Neutrogena&#x27;s anti-residue shampoo ([[ASIN:B0072CTW30 Neutrogena Shampoo Anti-Residue Formula Hair Shampoos]]). It works especially well when alternated with Neutrogena T/Gel ([[ASIN:B0009KN8UA Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)]]).</li>
    <li> awesome - use it ALL the time, for years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard that for every day shampoos, you should use clear ones and not creamy shampoos because they have more chemicals and leave residue. Normally, clear shampoos are a little too drying though. This one by Neutrogena is great! It really cleans just the right amount and my hair feels great after. It&#x27;s got a very light fresh scent, so I depend on my conditioner to leave more of a pretty and long-lasting smell. I&#x27;ve also noticed that I shed less after using this shampoo after about a month. It&#x27;s great and I recommend it for people who have normal-oily hair who are looking for just a fresh and cleansing shampoo that&#x27;s simple and does its job. I just wish they sold these in stores! Well, thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> It is a simple shampoo without a strong scent like most shampoos. There is definite volume after using it. It is a good value.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my daughter because she loves it.  She says it cleans her hair very well and get rid of any build up from other products she will use.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo!  I have used it for years.  Cleans well, rinses well, &amp; does add volume to my now thinning hair. BUT $80 for 2 bottles -that is stealing from the consumer.  $25 for 2 with PRIME when available is expensive yet, like others have said it&#x27;s not available in the stores for a lesser cost any more.  Looks like the sellers are well aware of this fact.  No shampoo is worth $40 per bottle!</li>
    <li> Go figure.  This was the best daily shampoo ever made.  Here&#x27;s what it did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* great cleaning - no matter what gunk made it into my hair, it washed out&lt;br /&gt;* no dandruff&lt;br /&gt;* not harsh - not overly strong on the scalp or hair as some shampoos cannot be used daily&lt;br /&gt;* added volume but not grease/wax/chemical feel - my flat, fine, straight hair felt good and looked good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was perfect and is even pay more than normal to get it...just not exotic, rarity rates of $40/bottle is right out.  If I find an alternate, I&#x27;ll post it, but don&#x27;t hold your breath.  It took me 15yrs to find this perfection, and I&#x27;m sad to go back to the experimental phase again...</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo but very hard to find!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shampoo - and you can make the quality difference right in the first usage. Highly recommended ! Price in Amazon with subscribe and save is better than my local Safeway.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best I have tried in every price range.  It is not available everywhere, so get it at Amazon.  I got noticeably more volume from this product.</li>
    <li> Like the Shampoo, leaves my hair very natural, but was shipped in a soft envelope and leaked and was a mess.</li>
    <li> I love trying new hair products and bought this after reading the reviews. I have normal hair so I didn&#x27;t think a shampoo like this would be not cleansing enough for me...BUT it makes my hair oily faster than usual.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent but I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have short, color processed hair and can&#x27;t go a day without washing it because it is sticking up all over the place when I get up in the morning. I switch off between this one and a restorative shampoo and it has worked great to keep the volume in my hair without adding any build up.</li>
    <li> Not great for me.  Left hair too limp.  Have oily hair even with gray.  Have used other Neutrogena products and loved.  Think aloe vera too much for my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this everytime I wash my hair, for the first shampoo.  Then my regular for the second.  My hair scalp are fresher and cleaner than they ever were.  The multi-pack is a great value and was sent very quickly</li>
    <li> I tried this product while staying at a hotel for a week. I was hooked. My hair is wavy and can get a bit frizzy. Somehow this product helps with the frizz and volume even while I let my hair air dry.  This shampoo leaves something behind but it&#x27;s not greasy. I do however,  have to wash my hair every other day. I love this shampoo. I had to order it on amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it at the local store.</li>
    <li> I discovered this shampoo about 2 years ago.. My hair is fine and even thinning.. The only part of me that seems to get thinner as I get older  This shampoo adds body and volume to my hair.  It is a great product.  So, of course, Neutrogena discontinues it.  I was happy to find it on Amazon and at a reasonable price.  I bought enough to last me several years.</li>
    <li> I love this particular formulation and can&#x27;t find it in the stores, so I was glad to find some left through Amazon. I guess that I&#x27;ll have to transition to another formula, as there is little of this left.</li>
    <li> Found quickly on Amazon, quick delivery  and packaged well. Think this  product may be in the process of being phased out, and I have been us using it for years.  Have enough now for a long while.  Hope I can find  it when I need it. Amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> J&amp;J, owner of Neutrogena has decided to remove this item from its product line. I&#x27;ve used for several years and like it very much. Paid a premium price to replace for a &amp;#34;temporary fix&amp;#34; until I can find something else. Neutrogena made a suggestion but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and can no longer find it in the local drugstores. I was happy to be able to get some bottles of it on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know if this product is no longer made.</li>
    <li> Meh, I expected more from reading all the reviews.  Unfortunately, it was just ok for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does just what it says it will do. Very nice on the hair and great extra volume too.</li>
    <li> I liked the price on this shampoo, and I have no problem with Neutrogena products writ large. However this shampoo left build up on my roots and weighed my baby fine hair down to the point it looked like I hadn&#x27;t even washed it only hours later.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Gentle;  but thorough cleansing.  Been using it for years;  but it&#x27;s disappearing from store shelves.  Glad to find it on Amazon and at better pricing, too.</li>
    <li> Love the way it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> clean feel, non-greasy; on time delivery; a little pricey but a quality item.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of difficulty finding a cheap and easy solution for may rather oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;I usually rotate shampoos, because after a while even this one seems to stop working. But I can repeat it quite often.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo. They seem to have now improved the sent.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived incredibly fast, in a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the harsh winter I found it in my mail box frozen, I missed checking  it one day so it sat out there at least 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;But no problem. It thawed well! Good to go.</li>
    <li> The shampoo arrived promptly. This is the best and most gentle shampoo for extremely &amp;#34;petite&amp;#34; hair.  When Neutrogena discontinues this product, I&#x27;ll mourn for many, many moons. My hair is the most baby fine hair known to womankind. It was an unfortunate combination of genes, I&#x27;m sure. Sorry, mom and dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I tried this shampoo, there was no way to give my hair any oooomph. None of the shampoos I tried made especially for fine hair delivered. In fact, these other shampoos did the opposite: they weighed the teeny tiny pile of the few strands I have down! Not an attractive look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo, my hair feels clean, fresh and slightly less small.</li>
    <li> This item arrived so quickly I couldn&#x27;t believe it...and the shampoo itself is great too...winning! I&#x27;ll be using this product for years to come and I thank you for that...</li>
    <li> I tried this, several times.  I have very thin blonde hair.  I would wash  my hair in the morning, and by the evening... it was dull and oily.  I know my sister and her husband, swear by this... it works for them.  I guess I am the exception.  I&#x27;ll be giving mine to my sister.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel fresh and clean, and it&#x27;s definitely Volumizing. I have kind of thin hair and this combined with hair wax after my showers makes my hair look pretty damn full. I was upset they require you to purchase 2, but damn I&#x27;m happy I have a 2nd bottle, will definitely order another pair long before that 2nd bottle run out.</li>
    <li> Someone at Amazon made the decision to ship this product unprotected with 27 lbs of cat food, 4 bags and 48 cans, all in the same box.  The shambox was not in a protective box, it was not bubble-wrapped.  Somehow the shampoo lids were unscrewed and the shampoo, as you can imagine, was out of the bottles and a sticky mess!!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, no residue.</li>
    <li> Not too expensive and it smells good and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  In my next life I&#x27;m going to go into hair care.  Most $20-$40 shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s are for delusional people with too much money to blow and I&#x27;d like to be selling to them.</li>
    <li> Cleans your hair without over cleaning.  I have fine hair, it is very long and tangles easily.  I think this shampoo makes it more manageable and easier to comb through.  I bought it with the Clean Replenishing Conditioner, but any favorite conditioner works just as well so I know that it&#x27;s the shampoo that&#x27;s helping.</li>
    <li> Between neutrogena and aveeeno marketing their products like they are natural, clean and healthy I&#x27;m fed up! TAKE THE PARABENS OUT YOUR PRODUCTS ALREADY. I want to use these brands still be since I&#x27;ve been paraben free I can not. It&#x27;s too bad too because a lot of the products ARE good.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered quickly and completely lives up to his title.  It is clean feeling and smelling.  Only a small amount is needed for each shampoo.  If I cannot find it locally, I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I found it at a local store after reading reviews on Amazon and I must say, I&#x27;m impressed! My hair really does feel bouncy and has more \\&quot;life\\&quot; to it. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO BUT IT IS OVERPRICED</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that Neutrogene has shampoo product until I used it in hotels. It feels fresh and clean. Worthy recommendation.</li>
    <li> A good shampoo that leaves your hair clean without fragrance which is also leaves your scalp feeling clean and fresh</li>
    <li> This is a quality shampoo and a fair price.  No silly marketing, with magic ingrediants.  Your hair is dead, it is either clean or dirty.  The magical marketing is very expensive.  I choose a quality product, that is priced well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give 4 stars not 5, because 5 is for truly outstanding products.  This is very good, and easy to recomend.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling very clean. I don&#x27;t know how to really judge shampoo but this one leave my hair feeling soft similar to what it feels like after you use conditioner. I am just finishing my first 2 pack and I will continue to order this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with [[ASIN:B0058DIXTE Neutrogena Clean Replenishing Conditioner, 10.1 Ounce (Pack of 2)]].  The conditioner is good, but I&#x27;m a guy with short hair, and I don&#x27;t notice too much difference with conditioners (my gf likes it though).  But this shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I put some gunky waxy stuff in my hair sometimes, and most shampoos don&#x27;t wash it out that well.. this one does.  My hair feels nice and clean after using this shampoo, without any gunk left behind.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for another person who has used this product for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and uses it</li>
    <li> I recently made the switch from Redkin to this, and I love it so much better. No more buildup, nice soft and clean hair. I&#x27;m so happy I made the switch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this when I had long hair (somewhat fine, and somewhat straight) and recently chopped off 8 or so inches, and love it with my shorter hair. I won&#x27;t be going back to redkin!</li>
    <li> I have been using your Neutrogena shampoo for years . It makes ,my hair shinny and silkie. I was upset when I could no longer buy it in stores ! I hope you are going to continue to make this product .</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and have tried lots of expensive shampoo&#x27;s for volume. This makes your hair feel clean but not dry, gives it  volume d hair does not look or feel dry. Favorite on my list after spending a lot of money over the last several years.</li>
    <li> again this is one of those things that scientists should really review the product and not regular people.&lt;br /&gt;as far as I can tell it does a good job and I have no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair dry and lifeless. Did not like it at all dispite good reviews I saw about this product by other consumers. smell is not good either</li>
    <li> Great product, but hard to find. I work in a local pharmacy and we can not purchase this item. I also can not find it at the big box stores.</li>
    <li> makes my hair really clean.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and have been using it for years.. Now the price is $69 for 2 bottles??!? Give me a break. Anyone have recommendations for a shampoo that is similar?</li>
    <li> I always feel like shampoos are building up on my scalp and I have to go back to neutrogena to remedy it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time and was glad to find it on Amazon because it is no longer carried by local retailers. I have very fine, very straight hair. This product leaves my hair very smooth, silky and shiny. It does not feel weighed down like it typically does with other shampoos. I do have to use a conditioner is conjunction with this shampoo because my hair will be left tangled otherwise. Overall, I am very pleased with this shampoo. The price on Amazon is wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> I love it, however the cap was loose on one bottle and it leaked all over the packaging.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that I use.  I have &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; hair that other shampoos seem to weigh down.  This product cleans well and adds volume.</li>
    <li> Great value for a quality product</li>
    <li> Do not know why the company has stopped making this product. Lots of allergies makes this a good option for me</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair clean and shiny. I have very fine hair and alot of products weigh it down leaving it feeling heavy and dull. I saw a magazine article saying it was what Heidi Klum uses and I thought if it&#x27;s good enough for her I will give it a try. Amazon was the only place I could find to get the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair. After I tried it for 3 days, my hair is so dry now, and it made my hair look more flat. I think I will only use it once a week instead of using it everyday. Another thing is one of the bottle was broken after I received my package (see the picture I uploaded), I have contacted the seller, but they ignored me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for good shampoo that leaves my hair with a nice feel and volume.  This product does a great job and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena Clean Volume Body Enhancing Shampoo for years.  I am very allergic to fragrances and other shampoos make me itch, but not this one.  I would rate it average for body enhancing.  Overall, a very good, reasonably priced shampoo.</li>
    <li> This was a great find for me, because I cannot use scented shampoos.  I love the way it leaves my hair feeling clean, but still with body.  This is a shampoo that is very difficult to find in stores so that I am delighted to be able to find it here.  I will definately be reordering.</li>
    <li> This is not as good as a very expensive Molten Brown product I have been using.  However it gets your hair clean with one application, and doesn&#x27;t strip color.</li>
    <li> Stay away if you need your hair actually clean with no residue. Especially if you have any rosecea or psoriasis/excema. Illicits allergy-like response if you are sensitive at all. Stick with the other Neutrogena residue removal shampoo. Think it&#x27;s the panthenol.</li>
    <li> this shampoo smells great and it lathers so much i have shouder lenghth hair i used a quater size to wash my hair the lather was alot  i feel the squeaky clean i sweat at night i woke up and my hair is still clean not greasy looking or feeling</li>
