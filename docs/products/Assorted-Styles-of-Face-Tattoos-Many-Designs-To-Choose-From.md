      <li>Great for Halloween.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup, so maybe that was the issue, but I found that it stuck great, but was just a challenge to remove.</li>

      <li>This set looks amazing on - not the easiest thing to remove, though - so plan to look like this for a while.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find these temp tattoos.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Nope not that easy!</li>
      <li>Looked amazing and easy to get off as well.</li>
      <li>On the plus side it was easy to put on &amp; again did look amazing.</li>

      <li>I got many compliments throughout the night.</li>
      <li>and I do recommend it to complement any of your party needs. :)</li>
      <li>Glad I bought these.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to wear :)</li>
      <li>The additional package I purchased included two, was better quality and prettier.</li>
      <li>It was a lot better than having to do it my self which would have taken a lot more than the 30 minutes it took to apply this tattoo.</li>
      <li>It turned out really nice and unique .</li>
      <li>Such a pleasant surprise!</li>
      <li>Five dollars well spent- very happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>Thought it would be as easy as it is taking off a temp tattoo that my kid wears with baby oil.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply just take your time.</li>
      <li>easy off.</li>
      <li>These do need alcohol to remove, they come off easily with it, but not so easily without.</li>
      <li>Painted white around the tattoos and turned out beautiful.</li>
      <li>This looked absolutely fabulous with my costume...</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, looked really cool</li>
      <li>super easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Need clean skin.  </li>
      <li>Bought one last year and everyone at festival loved.</li>
      <li>but they looked really cool.</li>
      <li>I,against the directions, applied them over full fresh set make up (regular foundation and powder) and they were amazing.  </li>
      <li>Got it right in time for Halloween with 2 day shipping.</li>
      <li>Honestly it&#x27;s kind of a mess with your eyebrows, but mine stuck and looked fine even when they overlapped my eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It looked great however, and lasted for the whole day despite the mess of cake and whip cream my daughter had gotten on her face.</li>
      <li>It was only 20 cents more than this one item.</li>
      <li>Looks fantastic and professional.</li>
      <li>Very nie clors!</li>
      <li>Be sure to read the directions carefully and follow them exactly.  </li>
      <li>Did not take much time at all.</li>
      <li>After that, you can use a a liquid or cream make-up to lighten the exposed skin if you wish, gently wipe it off the tats.</li>
      <li>I expected better quality when applying.</li>
      <li>AND when it was time to remove them, it made it much easier to get off with make up beneath.  </li>
      <li>Made my costume so much easier this year.</li>
      <li>but it looks really nice and same quality as the black and white one I did wear on Halloween :)</li>
      <li>Trick - cut the eye tattoos in half and do the top, then the bottom.  </li>
      <li>I had to scrub, scrub &amp; scrub some more which left face tender, red &amp; almost feeling burnt.</li>
      <li>These tattoos were a lot of fun, I got a lot of compliments, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.  </li>
      <li>I will say that if you are young enough to not be all that concerned with how rough you have to be with your face in order to remove it - then this is a sexy option for any holiday/rave/</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t regret how cool the tattoo completed the costume but may want to try something else if I venture back to a similar look.</li>
      <li>Hard to take off but cool how it looks on for the first day...</li>
      <li>Smaller swirls hearts and flowers not so much.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get it near your eyebrows....  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>You will need to cut &amp; carefully place the portions on CLEAN dry skin.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t transfer well and was so delicate it easily tore.</li>
      <li>my skin was red and sensitive for days after.</li>
      <li>My husband had some on bare skin, and it was much more difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>

<li> Children can use these on heavy paper to make pictures that last year after year for their Halloween windows or refrigerator decorations..  </li>
<li> Just take your time and don&#x27;t accidentally get the sheet wet before it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re a little older and it has recently come to your attention that the skin under your eyes does is in fact very delicate and whatever you do to it might not be recoverable at this point.....</li>
<li> I wore part of this after I applied makeup as one other user had mentioned</li>
<li> press down and hold for a looong time or it tears.  </li>
<li> so the removal was a little harsh.</li>
<li> There is nothing to dislike about a Day of the Dead decoration or picture.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t wasted your money!</li>
<li> However, the removal was a pain, ended up having to scrub them off so hard</li>
<li> then maybe you should at least avoid wearing the parts around your eyes and substitute makeup.</li>
<li> The eyes were a little difficult to place despite cutting into smaller portions.</li>
<li> I was really disappointed that this came with no directions and only one tattoo.  </li>
<li> Took approximately 10 min.</li>

    <li> Absolutely  LOVE these! I was the most awesome,  unrecognizable &amp;#34;calaca&amp;#34; at the party!  I received tons of compliments.</li>

    <li> Daughter wanted this for Halloween, u fortunatly it should up a week later then promised.</li>
    <li> This was the best Halloween I had in awhile!!! I was so happy to find this tattoo!!! It was a lot better than having to do it my self which would have taken a lot more than the 30 minutes it took to apply this tattoo.</li>
    <li> Great quality! Looked amazing and easy to get off as well. Wore them while running a 5K event and they were perfect.</li>
    <li> super easy to put on. looked great. lasted all night. easy off.</li>
    <li> I am not an artist but wanted to do a Dia de los Muertos costume for Halloween. I was thrilled to find these temp tattoos.  They looked good for 2 days, and I had to use rubbing alcohol to remove them.</li>
    <li> Great for my Halloween costume. Hard to take off but cool how it looks on for the first day... it starts peeling off for the 2nd and 3rd day...</li>
    <li> worked perfectly and so easy to apply and take off! i got so many compliments and would order it again!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t wasted your money!</li>

    <li> Beautiful colors. Bought one last year and everyone at festival loved. Can&#x27;t wait to wear :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this until after Halloween so I didn&#x27;t get to wear it - but it looks really nice and same quality as the black and white one I did wear on Halloween :)</li>
    <li> Pieces of the tatto ripped &amp; stuck to paper. I expected better quality when applying. Maybe the one I recieved was defected?</li>
    <li> Will buy from this again next year - great hit at parties!</li>
    <li> Idea of them awesome. Top transfered perfectly. Smaller swirls hearts and flowers not so much.</li>
    <li> This looked absolutely fabulous with my costume...however it was a nightmare trying to take off my face! Thought it would be as easy as it is taking off a temp tattoo that my kid wears with baby oil. Nope not that easy! I had to scrub, scrub &amp; scrub some more which left face tender, red &amp; almost feeling burnt. I&#x27;ll def rethink before applying anything like this to my face again. On the plus side it was easy to put on &amp; again did look amazing.</li>

I will say that if you are young enough to not be all that concerned with how rough you have to be with your face in order to remove it - then this is a sexy option for any holiday/rave/whatever you&#x27;re planning to wear this for.

    <li> Easy to apply, looked really cool</li>
    <li> These are beautiful and easy to work with.  Be sure to read the directions carefully and follow them exactly.  It can be tricky.  I used this Tattoo to decorate one of our Halloween pumpkins.  It turned out really nice and unique . Children can use these on heavy paper to make pictures that last year after year for their Halloween windows or refrigerator decorations..  There is nothing to dislike about a Day of the Dead decoration or picture.</li>
    <li> These were FABULOUS!!! I,against the directions, applied them over full fresh set make up (regular foundation and powder) and they were amazing.  AND when it was time to remove them, it made it much easier to get off with make up beneath.  My husband had some on bare skin, and it was much more difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;They lasted and looked perfect until I removed them!! Definitely would order again and again&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Looks fantastic and professional. Easy to apply just take your time. Pieces must be applied separately. Can&#x27;t be placed all at once. Glad I bought these. I have sensitive skin so the removal was a little harsh. But, I would doit again.</li>
    <li> Overpriced for only one sheet (one face) of tattoos. The additional package I purchased included two, was better quality and prettier. It was only 20 cents more than this one item.</li>
    <li> I asked the seller if they could get the tattoo to me by Halloween (3 days in advance) and they did!! Such a pleasant surprise! I used the Sugar Skull tattoos and then painted around them. It came out awesome and no one could tell I had on tattoos. Everyone asked how I could paint so intricately. Five dollars well spent- very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great for Halloween.  Made my costume so much easier this year.</li>
    <li> Very nie clors! Hope looks good on my face</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use them but they looked really cool.</li>
    <li> The eyes were a little difficult to place despite cutting into smaller portions. I damaged one part of the frame that shaped the eye because of this.&lt;br /&gt;It looked great however, and lasted for the whole day despite the mess of cake and whip cream my daughter had gotten on her face. Came off easily enough with alcohol w/o any irritation to my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> Got it right in time for Halloween with 2 day shipping. Thank you!!! You have to cut the tattoo in separate sections to apply. Took approximately 10 min. and it came out sooo cute!! What a great idea!</li>
    <li> Looked great for Halloween!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get it near your eyebrows....  press down and hold for a looong time or it tears.  Keep away from humidity... not something that will hold to skin with makeup already applied.  Need clean skin.  No white background.</li>
