      <li>Pretty good for a mom with her hands in the water and cleaner all the time!</li>
      <li>I have the CND top coat and love it!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>(I also used the CND Weekly Top Coat, and the shine remained in tack).</li>
      <li>For me 3-5 days is better than 1-2.</li>
      <li>you can probably do better at a drug store</li>
      <li>I use this with the shiney top coat and my manicure lasts a week.  </li>
      <li>plus it smooths out most of my ridges.</li>
      <li>I guess the top coat also matter though</li>
      <li>I love CND products</li>
      <li>I Love it.  </li>
      <li>I was even more impressed because I spent most of that week in the garden, digging my hands through all types of planting material, including turface (fine clay gravel), and the manicure still survived!</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell too terribly strong... :)</li>
      <li>I have used this with two cheap polishes along with its shiny top coat and my polish lasted a week, it is just now chipping</li>
      <li>I so far have had great results from this products.  </li>
      <li>The CND topcoat was good but not like the glass finish I used to get where my nails looked much like the gel nails that everyone is getting.</li>
      <li>It is amazing, it really works!</li>
      <li>I apply the Super Shiney top coat.</li>
      <li>I bought it in combination with the Super Shiney top coat by CND.</li>
      <li>Also works great under regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>Maybe it works better on other people, just not that great for me.</li>
      <li>I love that I am now able to do a professional manicure myself!  </li>
      <li>but it quickly became cost prohibitive for me when I moved from Cali to Georgia.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the best base coat I have found... and i have tried MANY!!</li>
      <li>I rarely do a manicure without it.</li>
      <li>The edges of my nails will get worn off but it&#x27;s not noticeable unless you get right up on it.</li>
      <li>Top Coat and together my manicures last 3 times longer.</li>
      <li>First off, it IS CND brand</li>
      <li>Really holds the polis on!</li>
      <li>I ordered what is pictured and titled so why wouldn&#x27;t I expect exactly that?</li>
      <li>(I also use a nail hardner as a first coat....</li>
      <li>And for the first time in my life, a manicure lasted a week on my nails.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>and they recommended this polish to help the polish stick better and last longer.</li>
      <li>It is a certainly must have.</li>
      <li>Nails dont chip as fast with this basecoat.</li>
      <li>Did not see much of the difference without its use.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
      <li>CND really gave this product the correct name.  </li>
      <li>and I can go a whole week without any chips.</li>
      <li>Did I tell you that I am very impressed?????&lt;br</li>
      <li>I definitely notice my at-home-manicure looks more professional and lasts longer when I use this.</li>
      <li>and you can get a good week to ten days with this even with your hands in water doing dishing and other chores.</li>
      <li>I had a top coat many years ago with a cobalt blue sticker on it that was unbelievable</li>
      <li>By the end of the first day, the polish looked a week old.</li>
      <li>So I paid more for less.</li>
      <li>The search for a decent manicure which holds up to housework continues.</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>lol weird,</li>
      <li>I normally use the CND Shellac system of doing my nails.  </li>
      <li>Contacted the shipper and they sent me a new bottle.</li>
      <li>I bought the base coat thinking that it would be a good combo with the CND top coat.</li>
      <li>helps my manicure last a week or more and keeps my nails from yellowing from wearing dark nail</li>
      <li>It comes out clear and not green!  </li>
      <li>I even take this to the salon for them to use when I get a professional manicure.</li>
      <li>After years of salon manicures that barely last 24 hrs, I had given up on the whole idea of painting my fingernails.</li>
      <li>I am the type that I could not go even one day without my nail polish chipping or peeling completely off.</li>
      <li>A coworker always has pretty nails, when asked how her nail polish stays on so long, she told me about this product.</li>
      <li>I have really oily nail beds, and couldn&#x27;t get polish to stay on no matter how many coats of color or top coat or base coat</li>
      <li>This is a very thick product that fills in my seriously ridged nails and makes polish look perfect and last super long.  </li>
      <li>Finally got polish to stay on my 8 year old&#x27;s nail for longer then 1 day!!  </li>
      <li>Very watery and my nail polish lasts just as long as with a sally hansen product!  </li>
      <li>But I started to get tired of wearing the same color polish for two weeks no matter how nice it looked.</li>
      <li>I noticed that it was almost as nice (my hands are a little shaky</li>
      <li>If you like to paint your nails, it&#x27;s well worth the money, and a little goes a very long way.</li>

<li> The long story short is it made my nails peel away in layers.</li>
<li> It really does help the polish adhere much better than any regular base coat I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The product is pretty good, I don&#x27;t usually use a base coat</li>
<li> However, a few months ago, I was given a manicure/pedicure at a new spa as a gift.</li>
<li> every polish ive tried thins out and spreads so its nearly impossible to get a nice coating of color...</li>
<li> This base coat really does keep your nail polish on much better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
<li> Finally a Base Coat that REALLY does more than cake on another layer.  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t believe how long nail polish lasts.  </li>
<li> I am now on day 6 with the same polish and it&#x27;s not chipping off - typically, my nail color would start to chip off the following day.</li>
<li> Before that&#x27;s dry</li>
<li> Kept my manicure from chipping longer than my regular base coat and looking more like I had been to the nail salon.</li>
<li> I was later able to find Stickey Base here on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve already used it about a dozen times, giving my friends manicures.</li>
<li> I will try it with regular polish, but for now, it is no better than regular base coat, and putting the Vinylux on as recommended by CND works better.</li>
<li> It works extremely well.</li>
<li> but there is no way to prevent that (other than using my hands less).</li>
<li> The only negative is that it is one of the strongest smelling polish products I have ever used.</li>
<li> I have used it three times now, twice with dark polish and now with a lighter color.</li>
<li> I love this base polish.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> Stickey Base Coat helps keep your polish stay longer when you use it.  For me 3-5 days is better than 1-2. (I also use a nail hardner as a first coat....probably would last longer w/o the nail hardner)</li>
    <li> Great basecoat, but I did notice when I went down to the beach.. not sure if it was the climate, water or what but my polish literally peeled off... it hadn&#x27;t done that at home, just at the beach.. lol weird, but yeah, it&#x27;s easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell too terribly strong... :)</li>
    <li> keeps my manicure looking good</li>
    <li> great as a base coat your nail polish will stick to it</li>
    <li> Really holds the polis on! My manicure lasts a month!</li>
    <li> I wear this under nail stickers and it seems to hold them a few days longer.  Also works great under regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love this base polish. This is my second purchase of it. It is used at the salon I go to as well. Works to hold on to your polish and reduce chips!</li>
    <li> I have used this with two cheap polishes along with its shiny top coat and my polish lasted a week, it is just now chipping so I think that&#x27;s pretty good. I&#x27;m not a big polish person so if a week is lousy then disregard my review. I bought this after seeing someone with very plain gel nails, they were so shiny I decided to buy some for myself until I saw the price! That&#x27;s when I got this. I had a top coat many years ago with a cobalt blue sticker on it that was unbelievable - my nails looked like glass. I wish I could find that (if anyone knows what I&#x27;m talking about, please comment!). The CND topcoat was good but not like the glass finish I used to get where my nails looked much like the gel nails that everyone is getting. Still, good product.</li>
    <li> I definitely notice my at-home-manicure looks more professional and lasts longer when I use this. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time now and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> CND really gave this product the correct name.  I normally use the CND Shellac system of doing my nails.  Occasionally I do a normal manicure and use this sticky base coat.  It really does help the polish adhere much better than any regular base coat I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the color throw you.  It comes out clear and not green!  The only negative is that it is one of the strongest smelling polish products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> this was a waste of money,there is really nothing else to say.. don&#x27;t buy it you can probably do better at a drug store</li>
    <li> This is a very thick product that fills in my seriously ridged nails and makes polish look perfect and last super long.  Exactly what I need in a base coat.</li>
    <li> I specifically got this because bloggers claim it extends the life of Vinylux polish, and smoothes ridges.  It hasn&#x27;t done either for me.  I will try it with regular polish, but for now, it is no better than regular base coat, and putting the Vinylux on as recommended by CND works better.</li>
    <li> Made my nails peel :(</li>
    <li> Kept my manicure from chipping longer than my regular base coat and looking more like I had been to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is my nails or not, but I had chipping within 2 days with this product. Maybe it works better on other people, just not that great for me.</li>
    <li> Just two words! IT WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;Two coats, as the directions indicate, before my polish, and I am a believer. NO CHIPS for 7 days - just slight tip wear. But NO chips. I am in shock. Usually, my polish starts chipping at about day 3, so this Stickey Base Coat is a deal breaker. I am usually a shellac fan - but I hate waiting in the salon, even with an an appointment, the smell, and the whole process of taking the shellac off. I also used the Stickey Base Coat on my feet and again, NO chips. Did I tell you that I am very impressed?????&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried this - you must! (I also used the CND Weekly Top Coat, and the shine remained in tack).</li>
    <li> this product is great!! definitely keeps my polish on for + 7 days considering prior to this my manicure wud only last 3 days &amp; the chopping begins.</li>
    <li> This product is not of salon quality.  Very watery and my nail polish lasts just as long as with a sally hansen product!  would not recommend</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with chipping manicure like everyone else. I loved gel nail polish when it came out but it quickly became cost prohibitive for me when I moved from Cali to Georgia. I couldn&#x27;t see myself spending $30 on a manicure every 10-14 days. So then I bought all the stuff to do it at home. I noticed that it was almost as nice (my hands are a little shaky and I am apparently a little heavy handed with my polish). But I started to get tired of wearing the same color polish for two weeks no matter how nice it looked. I also wanted to give my nails a break in between gel polish and didn&#x27;t want to do the gel all the time. So I was reading on a blog and they recommended this polish to help the polish stick better and last longer. Well it works. My polish has lasted a week without chipping. It wears a little along the nail edge but there is no way to prevent that (other than using my hands less). Even the gel polish would wear at the nail edge after a week. I have used it three times now, twice with dark polish and now with a lighter color. Same result. Very happy. Will not polish my nails with regular polish without using this as the base coat.</li>
    <li> I am the type that I could not go even one day without my nail polish chipping or peeling completely off. I bought this after reading reviews. I bought it in combination with the Super Shiney top coat by CND. I can&#x27;t believe how well it keeps my polish on. I will get some chips if my nails are longer but I&#x27;ve since cut them about even with my finger tips and I can go a whole week without any chips. The edges of my nails will get worn off but it&#x27;s not noticeable unless you get right up on it. I did swipe my nails with alcohol prior to putting on the polish. I also waited about a minute while it was still tacky and then applied polish. Before that&#x27;s dry I apply the Super Shiney top coat. I&#x27;ve used both OPI and Sinful Colors nail polish and both have stayed. Totally digging this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It helps my polish last longer. I will recommend it to all my friends. Great base coat</li>
    <li> I bought this because when my nails were done at the salon, they literally did not chip and just wore out after one week! When I use it at home though, my nails still chip. I guess the top coat also matter though and my nails don&#x27;t yellow, which is the point of the base coat!</li>
    <li> A coworker always has pretty nails, when asked how her nail polish stays on so long, she told me about this product. So I purchased and tried this. It is amazing, it really works!</li>
    <li> Finally a Base Coat that REALLY does more than cake on another layer.  I Love it.  I use it in concert with the Out the Door Top Coat and together my manicures last 3 times longer.</li>
    <li> I love the shipping! I can&#x27;t wait to try this out</li>
    <li> I rarely do a manicure without it. It works extremely well.</li>
    <li> I so far have had great results from this products.  I wash dishes by hand, i bath the kids and still four days and no chips.</li>
    <li> I have just tried once. Did not see much of the difference without its use. I love CND products</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  I love that I am now able to do a professional manicure myself!  I use this with the shiney top coat and my manicure lasts a week.  Pretty good for a mom with her hands in the water and cleaner all the time!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t polish my nails without this stuff.  It does extend your nail polish.  With natural nails, the polish doesn&#x27;t adhere as well as it does on artificial nails.  This product kind of changes that and you can get a good week to ten days with this even with your hands in water doing dishing and other chores.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this base coat. The long story short is it made my nails peel away in layers. I prepped my nails and did all things I should, but it peeled anyway. It&#x27;s taken 3 weeks to get my nails back to presentable shape. I wish this had worked. Back I go to OPI, which only lasts about 3 days. :(</li>
    <li> I have really oily nail beds, and couldn&#x27;t get polish to stay on no matter how many coats of color or top coat or base coat I put on. I got Stickey at ULTA because the sales associate recommended it to me. LOVE IT! I am now on day 6 with the same polish and it&#x27;s not chipping off - typically, my nail color would start to chip off the following day. The Stickey base coat is totally worth the $8.50 I paid at ULTA. The color polish I put on isn&#x27;t Essie or OPI either, it&#x27;s $1.99 nail color from Walgreens, and it still looks like a $25 mani from a salon. Don&#x27;t spend money on expensive polish anymore, just get this base coat and you&#x27;ll be really happy with your own mani/pedi.</li>
    <li> I have the CND top coat and love it! It keeps the polish on my nails for a week. I bought the base coat thinking that it would be a good combo with the CND top coat. Not so. The polish stays on my nails for only 3 days if I use this base coat. I&#x27;ll use up the bottle, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  It works.</li>
    <li> Terrific base coat. helps my manicure last a week or more and keeps my nails from yellowing from wearing dark nail color.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best base coat I have found... and i have tried MANY!!</li>
    <li> May add a day or two to my polish.</li>
    <li> Finally got polish to stay on my 8 year old&#x27;s nail for longer then 1 day!!  Awesome product, I will never polish without it again!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same stuff, folks! My home manicure lasted almost a week. Without this base coat, it lasts about a day. Period.</li>
    <li> I read so many great reviews about this product. My polish lasted 1.5 days. The claims that this gets the polish to \\&quot;stay\\&quot; for over a week didn&#x27;t seem to apply in my case. Waste of money for me. So disappointed. The search for a decent manicure which holds up to housework continues.</li>
    <li> After years of salon manicures that barely last 24 hrs, I had given up on the whole idea of painting my fingernails. However, a few months ago, I was given a manicure/pedicure at a new spa as a gift. The spa used CND Stickey Anchoring Base Coat. And for the first time in my life, a manicure lasted a week on my nails. I was even more impressed because I spent most of that week in the garden, digging my hands through all types of planting material, including turface (fine clay gravel), and the manicure still survived! I was later able to find Stickey Base here on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve already used it about a dozen times, giving my friends manicures. This product gives even home manicures with $2 nail polish a longer life. If you like to paint your nails, it&#x27;s well worth the money, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Best basecoat i have ever purchased. Nails dont chip as fast with this basecoat. It is a certainly must have.</li>
    <li> I like this brand, stays a bit longer than regular polish.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem so sticky but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Received this broken and leaking. Contacted the shipper and they sent me a new bottle. The product is pretty good, I don&#x27;t usually use a base coat so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this base coat for years.  The only base coat I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually improves the life of a manicure!  Using it improves endurance of the polish by several days.  I even take this to the salon for them to use when I get a professional manicure.</li>
    <li> This base coat really does keep your nail polish on much better than anything else I have tried.  Painted my nails a week ago and only the smallest bit of the tips have worn off (and I am an office worker) - no chips at all plus it smooths out most of my ridges.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how long nail polish lasts.  Never going back to gel again. This is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is the worst basecoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  No matter what polish/top coat combination I used (Essie, OPI, SecheVite, Revlon Colorstay, etc), my nail polish would chip the next morning after painting them the night before.  This happened 3 times before I gave up.  I&#x27;m not talking just tip wear, I&#x27;m talking actual chips in the nail polish after just sleeping and no use.  By the end of the first day, the polish looked a week old.</li>
    <li> This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used! It helps my nail polish last days longer.  Buying it online also saves a few dollars</li>
    <li> I ordered what is pictured and titled so why wouldn&#x27;t I expect exactly that? Unfortunately what I received is nothing close to the sort! First off, it IS CND brand BUT it says &amp;#34;Shellac Power Polish Base Coat&amp;#34; not what I wanted... Secondly its supposed to be .33 oz. I got .25 oz. So I paid more for less. I wouldn&#x27;t be as disappointed as I am if it actually worked well but its the worst base coat ive ever had. I even have a UV curing lamp and it DOES NOTHING every polish ive tried thins out and spreads so its nearly impossible to get a nice coating of color... I wish I could&#x27;ve returned this...</li>
