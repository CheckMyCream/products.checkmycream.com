      <li>Really gorgeous, full wig.</li>
      <li>but this was easy to braid so as to look nice and be out of my way for the party.</li>
      <li>I guess its ok for one use maybe</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It was a nice cheap wig.</li>
      <li>Make sure you brush it from the bottom up or you will tangle it.</li>
      <li>Pretty dang good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>I will be honest if you are looking for a full wig, this is not it, it is very light not as full as it looks in the photo, I tried parting and braiding it in two</li>
      <li>Tangles easily though.</li>
      <li>awesome IF you have dark Hair otherwise when you wear it you can see through and</li>
      <li>Fine wig for the price.  </li>
      <li>My daughter need a wig for a fashion show at school, this wig was great for the several times it was used</li>
      <li>the wig itself is very nice and very long, but just not the color i wanted</li>
      <li>ITS TRUE LENGHT.&lt;br /&gt;TRUE COLOR.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>It does tangle super easily but if you take the time to comb it, it does in tangle and is super soft.</li>
      <li>and it was well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>A good wide tooth comb and some tlc</li>
      <li>And oh I ordered black but the color I receive was really brown, it looked good on me</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does tangle a lot and fast, even right out of the box</li>
      <li>I personally loved a couple of things about it such as the fact that it is the actual length depicted</li>
      <li>few dark colours you pick are great!</li>
      <li>it held the wave from very low heat well and took to braids just fine.</li>
      <li>Too much tangles</li>
      <li>ive bought these wigs before and they have been much thicker this last purchase the wigs were so thin and so incredibly tangled!!</li>
      <li>so it didn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
      <li>There are clasps inside to adjust the fit - but even with my hair in a low bun</li>
      <li>i needed this for my grudge costume, but ended up using my real hair instead.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t tangle as much.</li>
      <li>Nice deep black with a shine like real hair.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a very very long budget friendly wig then this is it.</li>
      <li>BUT It does tangles a lot and it normal for its length, how ever it does not shred when you comb</li>
      <li>Less hair than expected, but really good quality and longer</li>
      <li>It came in well packaged and with a new wig cap.</li>
      <li>It came all tangled and couldn&#x27;t be fixed or returned!Waste of your money!</li>
      <li>tangles easily, the ends are a bit frizzy, and the bangs are a little too wavy, ran some conditioner through it and tripped the ends</li>
      <li>It does tangle very easily but such is to be expected with long wigs.</li>
      <li>than that its en &amp;#34;OGGGMM it looks Natural wig&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>It did come with much needed wig cap and hair net.</li>
      <li>Kind of thin in the back though.</li>
      <li>The weight makes my wig stand fall over if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
      <li>very soft, and very long.</li>

<li> Kind of thin in the back though.</li>
<li> The weight makes my wig stand fall over if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
<li> very soft, and very long.</li>
<li> Most of the hair goes to length, not thickness, so if you have long hair you are left with a weird bulge and no volume.</li>
<li> it was awkward fitting.</li>
<li> If you have long hair this wig will not work.</li>
<li> but then its 40 inches long so that definitely should be expected.</li>
<li> Very Long</li>
<li> so I just did a single braid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Came with black hair net</li>
<li> It was inexpensive, Long wig hair is kind of annoying</li>
<li> but it was not full enough</li>
<li> (if wig powder applied ofcourse) because its a Natural black not a jet black !</li>
<li> i ended up sending it back, not worth the trouble.</li>
<li> i noticed that some other reviews also write about the mismatching colors as well.</li>
<li> The wig was really long, past my thighs.</li>
<li> you do try to look for a BLACK  wig cap.</li>
<li> I tried brushing them to get the little tangles out</li>
<li> can be a definitive everyday use if styled</li>
<li> Could be a everyday use wig</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it being thin in the back like some customers reported.</li>
<li> I suggest braiding your weave or at least using elastic bands down the length of your hair to hold the hair in place</li>
<li> PART IS LIKE FOR SMALL HEAD PPL , it weren&#x27;t even sit on my head</li>
<li> then they turned to HUGE HORRIBLE tangles, I stayed there for 45 flipping minutes trying to de tangle it</li>
<li> i received my wig today, but was quite disappointed to see that the black wig is actually a dark brown.</li>
<li> Super thin and tangles horribly!</li>
<li> Very thin and the cap was a bit too small for my head, but did the job for one night.</li>
<li> waste of money!!!</li>
<li> Its thin</li>
<li> very poor quality</li>
<li> the bangs were awkward too.</li>
<li> and it sheds like crazy</li>
<li> I hated it!!!</li>
<li> and when I got them they were terrible.</li>

    <li> Its thin and it sheds like crazy, it came in the package and it was already tangled. I guess its ok for one use maybe</li>
    <li> It was a nice cheap wig. It felt cheep but looked nice.</li>
    <li> Very thin and the cap was a bit too small for my head, but did the job for one night.</li>

    <li> My daughter need a wig for a fashion show at school, this wig was great for the several times it was used and it was well worth the money.  We didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for a couple of wearing.</li>
    <li> I got this wig for a different cosplay but ended up using it for lolita. The wig was really long, past my thighs. So I ended up cutting it and it made a really nice lolita wig. It was not styled when it was arrived but that it made easier for me to style.</li>
    <li> tangles easily, the ends are a bit frizzy, and the bangs are a little too wavy, ran some conditioner through it and tripped the ends and  now it works great!</li>
    <li> This wig is a steal for $10 however you look at it! It did come with much needed wig cap and hair net. If you are looking for a very very long budget friendly wig then this is it. I personally loved a couple of things about it such as the fact that it is the actual length depicted and I honestly didn&#x27;t even need to reshape the bangs, I just parted it on the side and voila I looked awesome!

    <li> Less hair than expected, but really good quality and longer than I thought!</li>
    <li> Pretty dang good quality for the price. Braids well.</li>
    <li> Quality is nice and the wig cap is a nice addition!</li>
    <li> waste of money!!! very poor quality and it gets so tangly! ive bought these wigs before and they have been much thicker this last purchase the wigs were so thin and so incredibly tangled!! hair goes all over the place!! DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> i received my wig today, but was quite disappointed to see that the black wig is actually a dark brown. i noticed that some other reviews also write about the mismatching colors as well. the wig itself is very nice and very long, but just not the color i wanted</li>
    <li> ITS TRUE LENGHT.&lt;br /&gt;TRUE COLOR.&lt;br /&gt;but fullness, from 1-10&lt;br /&gt;its a 6!&lt;br /&gt;Its awesome IF you have dark Hair otherwise when you wear it you can see through and the wig wap and everything if you have blonde hair .&lt;br /&gt;If you do try to look for a BLACK  wig cap. Could be a everyday use wig BUT It does tangles a lot and it normal for its length, how ever it does not shred when you comb it.&lt;br /&gt;Only few dark colours you pick are great! Insides are not  that noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;other than that its en &amp;#34;OGGGMM it looks Natural wig&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;You can wear it but carry a brush lol!&lt;br /&gt;However when wearing head wear IT LOOKS amazing in the sun (if wig powder applied ofcourse) because its a Natural black not a jet black ! ♥&lt;br /&gt;This can be a definitive everyday use if styled correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if its for every day use, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It came in well packaged and with a new wig cap. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it being thin in the back like some customers reported. It does tangle very easily but such is to be expected with long wigs. A good wide tooth comb and some tlc and it says perfect. I ordered to use for a cosplay and it is exactally what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the quality for $10! Really gorgeous, full wig. Came with black hair net</li>
    <li> very soft, and very long. Nice deep black with a shine like real hair. Worked perfectly for what I needed it for. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Fine wig for the price.  Tangles easily though. Wig cap was great and the wig is perfect for occasional light use.  Very Long</li>
    <li> Its a truely amazing wig, My cosplayer sister love it.</li>
    <li> Make sure you brush it from the bottom up or you will tangle it. it held the wave from very low heat well and took to braids just fine. The weight makes my wig stand fall over if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive, Long wig hair is kind of annoying but this was easy to braid so as to look nice and be out of my way for the party.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Kind of thin in the back though. Nice for cosplay.</li>
    <li> Too much tangles like hella cant even braid it, i like the color but that&#x27;s it... THE WIG HEAD PART IS LIKE FOR SMALL HEAD PPL , it weren&#x27;t even sit on my head</li>
    <li> I bought two wigs from here and when I got them they were terrible. I tried brushing them to get the little tangles out then they turned to HUGE HORRIBLE tangles, I stayed there for 45 flipping minutes trying to de tangle it I tried everything! I&#x27;m never buying from here again! I hated it!!!</li>
    <li> Super thin and tangles horribly!</li>
    <li> this wasn&#x27;t good for me. it was tangled when i pulled it out and you can see the weaving because it was not concealed well. the bangs were awkward too. i ended up sending it back, not worth the trouble. i needed this for my grudge costume, but ended up using my real hair instead.</li>
