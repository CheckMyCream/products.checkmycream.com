<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the feel of this. I only use it around my eyes, but it can be used on your whole face.  After a week or so, I noticed the fine lines starting to fade and my skin definitely began feeling tighter.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have pale skin so circles under my eyes are usually a daily occurrence until I started using this.  My concealer stayed on better and it felt great putting it on in the morning.  This will be in my daily routine.  The bottle is small but you don&#x27;t use much so it will last!</li>
    <li> I got a high discount code for purchase it. I love it. my eye is puffing, so I use eye gel to reduce the under eye puffing.</li>
    <li> The blend in this eye cream particularly caught my attention.  It has Hyaluronic Acid, Organic Jojoba Oil, MSM, Peptides, Stem Cells and Matrixyl 3000.  This sounded like a pretty powerful complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed the help due to dark patches under my eye near the tear duct.  In just a few weeks, that particular area lightened up which thrilled me.  The fine lines around my eyes seemed less noticeable as well.  As to the puffiness and bags under my eyes, not much changed; however, nothing changes overnight.  With continued use I feel there should be improvement.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is wonderful, whenever I apply to my eye I don&#x27;t have anymore wrinkle.</li>
    <li> Product is very nice leaves your face feeling younger as well as looking younger. I think the dark spot reducing will take time and patience but you will see a slight difference in a short amount of time but patience is needed for them to fade. Great product I recommend it</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my dark circles and I don&#x27;t have an issue with puffiness. I gay it two stars because it did minimally reduce my wrinkles. I&#x27;ve used this for two months by the way.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural never disappointed me. I love their entire skin care and hair care line. I use their regular eye gel in the morning before I put on makeup. This one I use it at night before bed. I know thenbottle is kind small, it has 15ml. A little goes a long way and you dont really need to apply too much each time. Helps with fine lines. Gel is quite concentrated and absorbs nicely. Love all of their skin care products! Great products at drug store skin care prices.</li>
    <li> This eye gel goes on smooth, absorbs quickly and seems to be helping with my very puffy eyes!</li>
    <li> This eye gel goes on smoothly and it is absorbed by my skin really fast, which makes my morning routine a breeze. No need to wait 15 minutes for it to dry in order to put the rest of your makeup on.  It is made with natural and organic ingredients which in my book are a win win!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is great. It makes me look refreshed and young!</li>
    <li> I liked Eye Cream for Wrinkles.I have been using for almost a week and I like to put it under my make up.</li>
    <li> love this for my night treatment routine i am noticeing a bit of tightening at the edges of my eyes already after almost 2 weeks i can see a change. i recieved this product in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Recommend awesome product awesome company</li>
    <li> Whoa, this is exceeding my expectations.  The first thing I noticed is that the consistency is very lightweight, spreads easily, not sticky or tacky after the very short drying time.  Then, the fun part - feeling and seeing the effects.  My fine wrinkles were 90% gone.  Now, I haven&#x27;t been using this very long, but the refreshing cool scent (not minty, more cooling cucumber I guess?), and the tingly tightening feeling are great.  No, my wrinkles don&#x27;t stay gone - yet.  I&#x27;m fairly positive that this product will have a positive effect over a matter of a month of use. No problems with makeup (actually the eyeshadow looks much smoother, and my undereye area doesn&#x27;t collect mascara like it normally would), no problems at all ... other than I want to keep applying it just to feel that cooling sensation.  :) Very excited!  Definitely recommend!!  (The bottle is small, but 1/2 a pump covered eye area, temples, forehead, nose, upper cheeks)</li>
    <li> Feels so hydrating under the eyes . The  only downfall I have w/ it is it doesn&#x27;t seem like much product is in the bottle , but I do love it !</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING eye gel - soothes and cools. reduces wrinkles and dark results. Results are almost instantanious!  The gentle and effective Youth Express Eye Gel provides all around care and protection to the eye area and is all natural. I received during a promotion and in my unbiased opinion this is a winner.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel. It works for me.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.. it is very soothing, long lasting, and it works!  Non irritating to the eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a dead sea eye serum for a few years... Til the prices took a sky-high jump. I decided to try something different and was lucky enough to discover this product on my first try! I think it&#x27;s working better than the dead sea serum I was using. The little lines around my eyes are lessened and (more importantly) this serum reduces the under eye puffiness!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this companies products! !!  The eye cream has helped with my dark circles hasn&#x27;t completely helped but I am hopeful that continued use will improve more.</li>
    <li> I LOVE InstaNatural products! I&#x27;ve never had a skincare line work so well for me! I&#x27;ve tried the Eye Gel recently. I love that it is cool when you apply it. I&#x27;ve even put mine in the refrigerator and it really gives a wake me up in the morning! You only need a tiny bit and I mean tiny. I had some problems because mine was a little tackey after I waited for it to dry. What I love about InstaNatural is that you can use many different products at once and tailor what you feel like using each day. They work so well together! I was given the product at a reduced price to give my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have seen a big difference in wrinkle around my eyes after using this product. I saw a discount code for this and bought it right away. It feels really good when I put it on and the smell is good.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff out there</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product.</li>
    <li> wonderful eye cream to moisturize and soften wrinkles around eyes</li>
    <li> This is definitely a gel with an opaque, uber-absorbent, water-based texture that is cool and refreshing.  It absorbs really fast into the skin around the delicate undereye area. It&#x27;s so cooling, even without putting it in the fridge, although I am planning on keeping it in there for the summer.  Smells very faintly of cucumbers.  This is a tiny bottle, perfect for travel, it has an easy pump and a little bit (half-pump) goes a loonnnnggg way because the texture is so light and thin and spreadable, you can practically do your whole face and neck with a full pump.</li>
    <li> Good for men or women. This is a smaller version so if you want to travel with this product you don&#x27;t have to take the full size one. It is a mini and light weight and not bulky. The larger one is heavier and a little more bulky. For women who are on the go go. We never sit down to relax and rewind. This product is great for the under eye area. It is cooling and great smell. It is a nice thick gel that will stay place when you put it on. I am noticing firming up in the eye area in less than a week.  I could see a difference in my eye area. So I started using it all over the face. It was nice cooling effect on my face. I love that there is not parabens, sulfates or any alcohol in this product. I would suggest this for all skin types. As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Feels good and not greasy or heavy. Has a very light cucumber-like scent. I like the fact it feels a bit tighter around the eyes after using this eye gel. I don&#x27;t know that I have seen a reduction in wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t seen an increase in them. I like this eye gel and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works well. Took away all my dark circles and baggy eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used this almost daily since I received it. I am not sure whether it&#x27;s working or not. As I haven&#x27;t noticed any obvious changes. I was hoping it would help a little more with the puffiness in the morning than it does. A little bit seems to go along ways. It doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering sent or smell which I like.</li>
    <li> I have used it several times  and continue to use, not seeing must change but it does make face and eye area feel good</li>
    <li> I saw a reduction in puffy eyes and dark circles. Especially when I was low on sleep the night before.</li>
    <li> I wanted to share my experience with you since first using the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel.  First, I would like to mention that I love using the pump instead of a jar.  It creates less mess, and it also helps control the amount that I am applying onto my eyes.  One pump for me has covered both areas of my eyes, including around the eyelids.  I also love the cucumber scent of this product, and how cooling it feels around my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week One:&lt;br /&gt;I started using this eye gel twice a day, morning and night.  When I first wake up in the morning, I applied a small amount on both eyes.  I immediately felt a cooling sensation.  One important observation is that every time I applied the eye gel I noticed the areas around my eyes became tighter.  I also have dark circles, and although I did not see any improvement with the dark circles, I did notice that the puffiness around my eyes has been reduced to about 30% the first week of using the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week Two:&lt;br /&gt;Although I did not notice any brightening around my eyes the first week, I did start noticing it at the end of week two after using it twice per day.  I have also noticed a slight up-lift around my eye area and I love it!  Around day 10 of using the eye gel, I started noticing a slight improvement of my dark circles.  The puffiness has improved to about 50%, and I also noticed that since my dark circles have slightly disappeared, my under eye area has finally started to brighten up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty impressed with the results.  One thing I do recommend with this product is to use it consistently everyday for continued improvement, as it as done for me.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I hope that this review has been helpful for your purchase decision.</li>
    <li> Insta Natural products are the best products out there! I use all their products, from Eye Gel, Youth Express, and Vitamin C moisturizer. Not only are they inexpensive, but they are natural, and they work! Will continue to purchase their products. They are amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the gel formula it goes right into the skin without waving any residue behind. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I put this on at night after cleansing.  It does irritate my skin or my eye area.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in wrinkles yet, but these things take time.  I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Late nights studying I developed dark circles. This has helped minimize the color under my eyes. Really like how well it makes my eyes look rejuvinated</li>
    <li> This goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> I am a teacher, so I spend a lot of time in front of my computer screen. I&#x27;m way too young to have circles under my eyes this dark! I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for about a month, and I notice a great improvement! People have stopped telling me that I look tired, and I&#x27;ve been able to stop wearing under eye concealer!</li>
    <li> Use it everyday love it,</li>
    <li> Best Face cream ever, the glow this face cream gives you it is crazyyy!!!!</li>
    <li> Great eye gel. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my puffiness and the wrinkles seem to be fading  I did receive this to test.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels when you apply it.  Nice product.??</li>
    <li> Cooling and refreshing.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for dark circles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for that perfect eye cream, and I&#x27;ve yet to find exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. It does moisturize the eye area, it seems to make my eyes appear my smooth and tight, but I still have dark circles. It does seem to lighten them a little, but I was hoping it would be more noticeable. Depending on what you&#x27;re trying to treat, you might be okay with that. I do like the feel of this cream/gel more than other products I&#x27;ve tried. It isn&#x27;t sticky at all and absorbs quickly and fully. A small amount goes a long way. I also really like this brand, having tried several other products on their label.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything different, I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks...maybe later if I keep using it night and day</li>
    <li> While I did notice the skin under my eyes does appear healthier the unfortunate dark rings are still present. As an otherwise healthy caucasion adult male due to long nights and a job in I.T. I have dark rings under my eyes visible at most angles after using as directed I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in that regard.</li>
    <li> This is one of mt most favorite skin care routines. I love to keep this in the fridge. When it comes time to use, it is so cold and feels so good on my face. I can feel this working.</li>
    <li> have only been using for about a month. Maybe every few days to once or twice a week. Havent noticed a huge improvement in my dark cirlces, but i have noticed a small change.</li>
    <li> I use this ar night and my eyes look great the next day. I have had dark circles my whole life. This product does what it says it will do. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and the results have been fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of deep &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; around my eyes even as a kid. Now that I am older I want to prevent these from getting worse so I was happy to get the chance to use this product. One thing I am thankful for is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn the skin around my eyes. Some creams do that. This is a gel so it can be cooling and refreshing on the face. I hope to see a big difference by the time I am done with this bottle.</li>
    <li> This little bottle goes a long way. I purchased it at a promotional price to try and test as a consumer. Prior to receiving this product, I didn&#x27;t use any eye gel. I used a Vitamin C Serum followed by moisturizer. I used the same moisturizer around my eyes as I did my face. The first few days, I thought &amp;#34;this is ok&amp;#34; but I really didn&#x27;t see the point of using it. The more I used it, the more my eyes woke up. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and now when I put it on, my eyes immediately feel and look better. It&#x27;s like a wrinkle eraser. At least for the day. I&#x27;m now addicted to the stuff. You don&#x27;t need much so be careful with the pump to avoid waste. It&#x27;ll last much longer than you imagine. I&#x27;ve been using it for over two weeks and have barely put a dent in mine.</li>
    <li> After using this product for several weeks I have to admit I love it. It takes very little, not even a full squirt to do both eyes and then some. I was surprised with how much it has helped me and I feel so much better about my appearance. It also feels so refreshing and I love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Great product I always have dark bags under my eyes from not betting enough sleep and this eye cream is really making a huge difference I love it</li>
    <li> Nice eye gel.  Hydrates and smoothes the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few days and I already see a tremendous difference and that is saying a lot since my allergies have been terrible and this product still was able to greatly diminish the dark circles and bags I had under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Product did not work for me, it swallowed my eyes, but the company has a great customer service</li>
    <li> The second time I use it my husband tell me that without makeup I still lookin beauty full ohh real work</li>
    <li> This eye cream really works wonders. I had an injury to my eye and face several years ago and it still bothers me from time to time but once I put this on the area it instantly soothed it. It really seems to be helping the appearance of my scar and my aging,and it smells really good too!</li>
    <li> I love applying this eye cream - the nice cool gel consistency feels great! I have noticed a little less puffiness in my two weeks of using the cream, and I love the nice light spa-like smell of the gel.</li>
    <li> Having been plaques with dark circles due to allergies and frequent lack of sleep this products significantly reduces the look o both the dark circles and the droopy look.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference under my eyes after just a few days of using this nice product. received at reduced cost for honest opinion/review.</li>
    <li> I never tried the product but I find it very strange that the ingredients are absolutely the same 1:1 as the ingredients in Majestic Pure Eye Gel Type 1 ($18.50)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to think of that.  Who copied who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Matrixyl 3000, Palmitoyl Triepeptide-3, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Plant Stem Cells, Cucumber Hydrosol, Organic Jojoba Oil, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Silk Amino Acid Blend (Sodium L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylate, Sodium Lactate, L’Arginine, L-Aspartic Acid, L-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid, Glycine, L-Alanine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-threonine, L-Isoleucine, L-Histidine, L-Phenylalanine), Wildcrafted Vinca Major (Periwinkle), Organic Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice), Wildcrafted Euphrasia Officinalis (Eye Bright), Wildcrafted Ganoderma Lucidum (Reishi), Organic Gotu Kola, Boswellia Serrata (Frankincense), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin</li>
    <li> I have been using this and have started to see and feel a softer eye area.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this eyecreme. I feel like I can already see a reduction in the crows feet around my eyes. The best part is that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep this in the refrigerator and put under my eyes and on eyelids before I go to bed. I love the cooling feeling. The smell is nice and light. It is slightly sticky, so I will not be wearing it in the morning under makeup. I feel like it has been helpful for my dark circles, but can&#x27;t comment yet on wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, but my husband fought me for it! (Not seriously, but he explained how he needed it more than I.) My husband works odd hours, long days out in the elements, in a high stress environment- and you can see that in his eyes more than anywhere else on his body.  He has crows feet, puffy eyes, and dark circles most of the time, so this product was exactly what he needed.  After using religiously for a couple of weeks-- we&#x27;ve seen a big change in his eyes! It&#x27;s amazing how much more youthful they appear now.  His lines have softened, the puffiness is gone, and the dark circles are faint!  He&#x27;s floored and so am I!  Now, I need to buy a bottle for myself!</li>
    <li> The best eye cream for wrinkles that I ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This is  a very  good eye  gel for the summer &amp;#60; I have  mature skin and would like  a cream for the winter&amp;#62;.  I like how  it  de puff the  eye, and colling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with their eye serum at night, can  see  big improve in the dark circle , as well as the  de puff. I can honest say I do look 10 years younger. Good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this with a discount, to exchange  for  my honest  review. My opinion is all mind, and unbiased.</li>
    <li> I like that this product is natural. I have not seen any significant changes around my eye. But will keep using it until the product is finished.</li>
    <li> Whenever I see a product promising to reduce dark circles under my eyes, I always want to try it so I was happy when this&lt;br /&gt;Eye Cream for Wrinkles, Dark Circles was offered to me at discount to test and review.  It came very quick and was packaged nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: goes on non greasy, made in USA, Alcohol free, contains Hyaluronic Acid, natural and organic ingredients, made in FDA approved facility, excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: small amount, more of a travel size bottle,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this for just over a week, it took years of sun damage to destroy my skin so being patient in realistic results is required.  I would give this 4.5 stars and will use this for a month and will update my results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now. I have genetically dark under eye circles, and I was hoping this would help. The consistency is nice and it spreads well. However, I don&#x27;t see a difference. I will continue to use this product and edit my review if things change.</li>
    <li> Great to use for non greasy and effective skin care. I like that it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face and eyes.</li>
    <li> Does what is  claim - Love the depuff.Put in fridge , and really great for  pick me up in teh morning. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I like it!  I&#x27;m always happy with the products from this company!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks and I like the results I am getting. it definitely reduces the puffiness!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work but figured it was worth a try. I have been using it a week and my under eye and the &amp;#34;laugh&amp;#34; lines on the sides of my eye are less. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
