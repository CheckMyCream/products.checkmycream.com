      <li>They are easy to wash and use.</li>
      <li>The brushes are soooo soft, and amazing for contouring!</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product a lot.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the brand, SHANY is a 100% cruelty free company partnered with PETA.</li>
      <li>sleek design inconvenient roll-up carrier along with the superior quality brushes make this an excellent value.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft and apply my powders nicely.</li>
      <li>And the brushes themselves are nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Nice product soft bristles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After all they&#x27;re really nice, and soft.</li>
      <li>When you unwrap it, the brushes are in great quality and individually packaged in plastic wrap and some of the bigger brushes have a protective plastic layer over the top.</li>
      <li>They are overall pretty good.</li>
      <li>I bought these several months ago and most of them are still gong strong.</li>
      <li>This brush set is worth the price.</li>
      <li>They are worth the $12 or so dollars the set costs.</li>
      <li>Not a big deal, I just let them soak for about 2 hours in warm water and baby shampoo.</li>
      <li>Even if I had thrown them out I would of felt I got my moneys worth.</li>
      <li>I would place them definitely better than the $1 E.L.F brushes but not quite as soft or dense as the $3 &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; E.L.F brushes.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a good quality from such a cheap set.</li>
      <li>At first they&#x27;re smelly</li>
      <li>This is my second set of Shany brushes and I would say I did like the synthetic purple brushes better</li>
      <li>the last set of brushes I bought cost more for one brush than for the whole set of these</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how anyone gave this set any positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>I found that when i bought them they did not hold a ton of powder, but after the first time I washed them they began to really grip the makeup.</li>
      <li>very often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brushes are also much smaller than they appear, and the case is cheap.  </li>
      <li>, you&#x27;re really pretty.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Thankfully Amazon has a reasonable return policy.  </li>
      <li>They have a much longer handle than the E.L.F brushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The brushes are soft, and I end up using them for more brushes than is necessary just to feel the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It even comes with a little booklet detailing what each brush&#x27;s function was which was easy to follow since the brushes are numbered!</li>
      <li>It only took about 2-3 drops of super glue and they are usable again.</li>
      <li>and I have had so much fun playing with different colors and applications.  </li>
      <li>Like the angled  brush is kind of fluffy and not sharp and angled enough to get precise  line, i feel likei need to wet the brush first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Getting quality makeup isn&#x27;t enough if you don&#x27;t have the right brushes to apply it.</li>
      <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
      <li>But I was so happily surprised at the quality of this item!</li>
      <li>These brushes are extremely soft and very professional.</li>
      <li>I prefer my old Costco brushes  to theses ones.  </li>
      <li>They are soft and durable.</li>
      <li>These  aren&#x27;t as  soft  </li>
      <li>So I wanted to get myself some real brushes finally.</li>
      <li>I am a 50 year old woman who feels like she is a young girl again.  </li>
      <li>I really like some of the smaller brushes.</li>
      <li>As these are all natural I don&#x27;t have that problem at all</li>
      <li>After several months a few of the more used brushes did separate from the shaft.</li>
      <li>Even if you only need a few specific types of brushes, you can&#x27;t really go wrong here because the price is more than fair.</li>
      <li>Simply put, I just wanted some new, high-quality brushes for eye-shadows and blushes, and I got them in this</li>
      <li>I am a French teacher and even my students have noticed the &#x27;new&#x27; me.  </li>
      <li>They are soft and make make up application very simple and have actually caused me to venture out of my comfort zone and try some new techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The larger face/powder brushes are not quite as soft or dense as I would like them but not to the point that I won&#x27;t use them.</li>
      <li>These brushes seem durable and well made, and they feel much softer than some other brands of brushes that I have tried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>other reviewers had mentioned, there was a strange odor accompanying the brushes when first taken out of the package.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> they started to shed after one use it was horrible and irritating</li>
    <li> The case is okay. Gets dirty easily. Brushes are nice though.</li>
    <li> As described, love these!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m no makeup artist, but I do wear makeup every single time I leave the house. So I wanted to get myself some real brushes finally. I was hesitant because of the mixed reviews. But I was so happily surprised at the quality of this item! The carrying case is great, good size, and keeps everything in place. And the brushes themselves are nice and soft. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week now and I&#x27;ve seen little to no fallout/loose hairs on them. (However I mostly use the eyeshadow brushes as I don&#x27;t wear foundation or anything like that very often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are a wonderful item for any average makeup wearer and a great addition to any makeup wearer&#x27;s collection!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product a lot. The packaging of this very nice. I like how it gives you a booklet of what brushes are used for what. The brushes themselves are wonderful and work great. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> These are great.  The look beautiful and the brushes are soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give it a 4 star because of a little shedding the big brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag makes for easy travel and keeps the brushes in good shape.</li>
    <li> brush hairs aren&#x27;t falling off, easy to clean and happily purchased!</li>
    <li> I really liked this kit. They are soft and durable. I bought these several months ago and most of them are still gong strong. I found that when i bought them they did not hold a ton of powder, but after the first time I washed them they began to really grip the makeup. I now have to really tap hard to get powder to come  off the brush. They are easy to wash and use. After several months a few of the more used brushes did separate from the shaft. For the price of these brushes I was not upset. It only took about 2-3 drops of super glue and they are usable again. Even if I had thrown them out I would of felt I got my moneys worth. This is my second set of Shany brushes and I would say I did like the synthetic purple brushes better and they were a lot softer.</li>
    <li> This brush set is worth the price. There is a lot of fall put from the brushes and there is no suitable foundation brush if you use liquid.</li>
    <li> The order arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Every brush I could ever ask for! It was like Christmas opening up this package! The brushes are soooo soft, and amazing for contouring! These brushes are worth at least 3 times what they are charging. Insane!!! My makeup looks flawless! Thank you again, SHANY!!! In this pic I&#x27;m wearing all SHANY products btw. Gorgeous.</li>
    <li> It comes with too many eye brushes. Good quality, great customer service.</li>
    <li> These work so wonderfully! Very soft bristles.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product &amp; transaction. Definetly recommended.</li>
    <li> I just got my 12 piece Shany brush set in and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them. The bristles are very soft and apply my powders nicely. I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a good quality from such a cheap set.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 12 PC Vegan bamboo set. They are overall pretty good. I really like some of the smaller brushes. The larger face/powder brushes are not quite as soft or dense as I would like them but not to the point that I won&#x27;t use them. I would place them definitely better than the $1 E.L.F brushes but not quite as soft or dense as the $3 &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; E.L.F brushes. They are worth the $12 or so dollars the set costs. They have a much longer handle than the E.L.F brushes. They are around the same length as the Sephora brand face brushes.</li>
    <li> If I could give this a zero I would.  When I opened the package I was literally almost knocked off my feet by the smell and spent the next couple of hours feeling incredibly ill.  I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, but this brush set is TOXIC.  Absolutely horrible.  The brushes are also much smaller than they appear, and the case is cheap.  Another wonderful made in China product.  Thankfully Amazon has a reasonable return policy.  I don&#x27;t understand how anyone gave this set any positive reviews.  Apparently this company is paying people to write fake reviews.</li>
    <li> These  aren&#x27;t as  soft  as  i had expected. I prefer my old Costco brushes  to theses ones.  They aren&#x27;t very tight if that makes  sense. Like the angled  brush is kind of fluffy and not sharp and angled enough to get precise  line, i feel likei need to wet the brush first. Overall  they  are  OK. Great for the price though.</li>
    <li> As someone just starting out with make-up and vegan-ess it was hard for me to find quality brushes without harming animals in the process. These brushes are extremely soft and very professional. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the brand, SHANY is a 100% cruelty free company partnered with PETA. The package came in a sleek box, and when you open it the pouch comes out. When you unwrap it, the brushes are in great quality and individually packaged in plastic wrap and some of the bigger brushes have a protective plastic layer over the top. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and if you&#x27;re looking for some brushes this is a great starter kit. It even comes with a little booklet detailing what each brush&#x27;s function was which was easy to follow since the brushes are numbered!</li>
    <li> At first they&#x27;re smelly&lt;br /&gt;A couple of bristles came off in the beginning&lt;br /&gt;After all they&#x27;re really nice, and soft.</li>
    <li> Nice product soft bristles. No shedding as of yet. Overall money well spent😊</li>
    <li> These are amazing!  I am a 50 year old woman who feels like she is a young girl again.  I purchased these with the SHANY make-up kit and I have had so much fun playing with different colors and applications.  I am a French teacher and even my students have noticed the &#x27;new&#x27; me.  They have said, &amp;#34;Madame, you&#x27;re really pretty.&amp;#34;  Awww, so precious!  Thank you.  And knowing that they are vegan and made of sustainable bamboo is just icing on the cake.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am no make up expertby any means, however, these make up brushes are amazing.  They are soft and make make up application very simple and have actually caused me to venture out of my comfort zone and try some new techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On most brushes I have tried (even extremely expensive name brand ones) they shed little hairs all over my face because I have sensitive skin cause me to break out. As these are all natural I don&#x27;t have that problem at all I don&#x27;t have to worry about the shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the sleek design inconvenient roll-up carrier along with the superior quality brushes make this an excellent value. the last set of brushes I bought cost more for one brush than for the whole set of these and I was not nearly as happy. I definitely recommend these especially for the value.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality brushes. This kit doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and is exceptional build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft, and I end up using them for more brushes than is necessary just to feel the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting quality makeup isn&#x27;t enough if you don&#x27;t have the right brushes to apply it. These are some of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The quality is not so good for me.</li>
