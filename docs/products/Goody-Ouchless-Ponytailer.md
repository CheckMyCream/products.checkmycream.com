      <li>Also, they can fall out if you have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fine, nice colors.  </li>
      <li>My 3 year old daughter has fine, curly hair - these were the perfect size and do not hurt her when I put them in or take them off.</li>
      <li>Now that they&#x27;ve gone up in price, I&#x27;m just as glad she&#x27;s now wearing a bob, because at 3 she&#x27;d still be losing them faster than her mom could find them.</li>
      <li>My daughters both love them because the don&#x27;t pull their hair and they get to pick the color they want</li>
      <li>Quality is okay.</li>
      <li>Many colors, doesn&#x27;t pull out hair</li>
      <li>Love how many come in a package and that there&#x27;s 2/color and so many colors.  </li>
      <li>what more can I say.</li>
      <li>I love these holders because they stay put and don&#x27;t rip hair when removed by a toddler.</li>
      <li>would have preferred to have something much more durable.</li>
      <li>Unlike most rubber bands for hair, they don&#x27;t get tangled and don&#x27;t hurt when our daughter takes them out.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has never tried to pull them out and/or put them in her mouth, but to be on the safe side</li>
      <li>They snag runs easily, but otherwise, great for the price and are MUCH kinder and softer on my child&#x27;s head than a rubber band.  </li>
      <li>Not the greatest quality, but OK for my 1 yr old who is going to chew or lost them pretty soon :)</li>
      <li>but they do snag easily.</li>
      <li>However, I discovered an easy fix, by accidentally leaving some ponytail holders in my pocket as the pants went through the laundry.  </li>

      <li>Taking them off is easy too (even for her) since they don&#x27;t pull chunks of her hair out or hurt.</li>
      <li>Use these regularly and happy with them for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Go in and come out easily without ripping or tangling hair.  </li>
      <li>These are great for a quick hair style when the 2 year old isn&#x27;t really excited about sitting for a more intricate hair do.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is incredibly fine and always breaks no matter</li>
      <li>Super cute.  </li>
      <li>Great assortment of pony tail holders in all different kinds of colors - guaranteed to find one to match whatever outfit my niece wears!</li>
      <li>Besides this, they&#x27;re very durable and the colors are nice.</li>
      <li>Girls would enjoy.</li>
      <li>So you may have to redo the hair once or twice throughout the day, but it&#x27;s worth it to not be breaking off baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>Best of all, she hardly notices them when they are on.  </li>
      <li>Perfect little pony tail holders and can be used twice!!</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t stretch as good as a similar goody product.</li>
      <li>The ponytail holders seem to fray pretty easily (a couple already came frayed), but otherwise they do the job and hold my baby&#x27;s hair in place for a while.</li>
      <li>Regarding doing your daughter&#x27;s hair in general:  I received this great advice from another mom of older girls:  </li>
      <li>Wrapping these around just 2 times is quick and painless.  </li>
      <li>They do not wrap good and are too small to really be able to use.</li>
      <li>Great for little girls hair.</li>
      <li>lots of fun colors to choose from to match any outfit.  </li>
      <li>Colorful and does not pull out hair.</li>
      <li>waste money!!very cheap quality!!!</li>
      <li>They have lots of colors to match every outfit, they don&#x27;t hurt,  they are well priced and there&#x27;s so many of them that it&#x27;s Ok if you lose a few.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t hold as tightly as the other kind, but that&#x27;s kind of the point!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very soft and stretchy, so they seem pretty comfortable and as close to \\&quot;ouchless\\&quot; as a hair tie can</li>
      <li>My niece&#x27;s little girl loved these.  </li>
      <li>and they are soft and comfortable.</li>
      <li>these are ok for disposable use only (i.e. one time use).</li>
      <li>Product in the picture was exactly what I got.</li>
      <li>I bought these ponytail holders for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, it arrived in time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>The small size is perfect for my little girl&#x27;s hair which makes it easy to put them on.</li>
      <li>I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t stay in place with such a small amount of fine hair, but they work great.  </li>
      <li>Will certainly buy more later on when these have done their time.</li>
      <li>I bought these for my nieces and they are quite tiny, Maybe for thinner hair or young little girls, great set!</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are very cute and they really don&#x27;t pull the little one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased to have found these (they don&#x27;t tangle and pull out my hair like the plain covered elastic bands do).</li>

    <li> These are great for a quick hair style when the 2 year old isn&#x27;t really excited about sitting for a more intricate hair do.</li>
    <li> These do not work well. I bought them for my daughter. They do not wrap good and are too small to really be able to use.</li>
    <li> Great for little girls hair. My daughters both love them because the don&#x27;t pull their hair and they get to pick the color they want</li>
    <li> Super cute.  Purchased as a gift and she loved them.  Perfect for fine hair and they don&#x27;t hurt like rubber bands</li>
    <li> Not that great for thin hair.. they either fall out or break</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter has fine, curly hair - these were the perfect size and do not hurt her when I put them in or take them off. She now asks for &#x27;the soft ones!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I use these in my one-year-old&#x27;s hair. They are cute and don&#x27;t pull out any hair!</li>
    <li> My niece&#x27;s little girl loved these.  Since she was only 2, they disappeared one by one, but at the original add-on price of $1, they were an unbeatable deal.  Now that they&#x27;ve gone up in price, I&#x27;m just as glad she&#x27;s now wearing a bob, because at 3 she&#x27;d still be losing them faster than her mom could find them. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very cute and they really don&#x27;t pull the little one&#x27;s hair.  They also work well to snap big brothers.  (grin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I recently ordered two more sets of these, one for the little one, who&#x27;s now 5, and one for myself since I&#x27;ve grown my hair out, but it&#x27;s too fine for the regular adult bands.  They&#x27;re soft and they never catch in my hair.  The only downside is that they aren&#x27;t puppy proof. (grin)</li>
    <li> Nice for very small pony tails. Having them in pairs makes it nice for two ponies.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find now. Only thing that works on my hair without breaking it because the hair shafts are thin. This package will last me about two years!!</li>
    <li> They are awful and are falling apart. Cannot believe this is a goody product!!!</li>
    <li> Holds hair in place...what more can I say.</li>
    <li> Perfect little pony tail holders and can be used twice!! This is the best I&#x27;ve found on amazon</li>
    <li> My daughter usually takes everything out of her. But she really like these.</li>
    <li> Good quality would but again</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is incredibly fine and always breaks no matter how gently I put it in those little rubber bands. This helps tame her wild hair while being incredibly gentle at the same time. They don&#x27;t hold as tightly as the other kind, but that&#x27;s kind of the point! So you may have to redo the hair once or twice throughout the day, but it&#x27;s worth it to not be breaking off baby fine hair. These also look really cute!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for for my infants ever-growing hair. Does not bother her or pull her hair out and is a great size for her very thin hair.</li>
    <li> for baby girls, not adult size.</li>
    <li> Baby loves them!  Colorful and does not pull out hair.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good but I think they would be better if they were thinner and less bulky. Also, they can fall out if you have very fine hair. Besides this, they&#x27;re very durable and the colors are nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, goes around 3 times (you know that matters!) lots of fun colors to choose from to match any outfit.  These are not large enough in my opinion for adult hair, they don&#x27;t stretch enough.</li>
    <li> I use these for my four yr. olds piggy tails.  I use an elastic (rubber band-type), then put the terry one over it.  The terry ponytail holders do stretch out, but it is not like I can&#x27;t reuse them.  The assorted colors are great.</li>
    <li> I tried headbands and butterfly clips but my daughter continued to pull them out. She will wear this one all day long. It started as a forehead ponytail at age 13 months and it has progressed toward the back of her head at 17 months. Se has thin hair and I can tie it in 4 wraps which I do when she is drinking her milk in the morning.</li>
    <li> The ponytail holders seem to fray pretty easily (a couple already came frayed), but otherwise they do the job and hold my baby&#x27;s hair in place for a while. I can tie one 3 times around one small tuft of hair. I also like that there are so many of them and the colors are really nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a toddler with not a lot of hair. No pulling, no orchids, great colors! Very pleased with these.</li>
    <li> I love these for my 16-month-old daughter!  They are small enough that I only have to wrap them around her little pigtails twice, or maybe three times if I want them to be extra secure.  Most other ponytail holders (even those apparently intended for small kids) are so big they require 4+ wraps, which means longer for a toddler to have to sit still and get her hair pulled at - not a good combination!  Wrapping these around just 2 times is quick and painless.  They&#x27;re very soft and stretchy, so they seem pretty comfortable and as close to \\&quot;ouchless\\&quot; as a hair tie can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be aware of is that because of their small size and puffy nature, these hair ties are a potential choking hazard, perhaps more than other types of ponytail holder.  My daughter has never tried to pull them out and/or put them in her mouth, but to be on the safe side I take them out before she naps alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And two random pieces of advice:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Regarding storing these ponytail holders:  If you&#x27;re like me, it drives you crazy when you&#x27;re doing pigtails and can&#x27;t find two hair ties in matching colors.  I&#x27;ve found a storage system for these ties that works (for me, at least) to alleviate that problem.  When storing, I just squish one of the hair ties flat, and stick it through the middle of the matching tie.  They&#x27;re so puffy you don&#x27;t have to double-wrap it or anything; as long as you&#x27;re just storing these in a little basket or something and don&#x27;t rummage through too vigorously, they&#x27;ll stick together and then you won&#x27;t have to hunt to find two matching ties.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Regarding doing your daughter&#x27;s hair in general:  I received this great advice from another mom of older girls:  Almost from birth, you should constantly \\&quot;do\\&quot; your daughter&#x27;s hair - brush it every day, and as soon as it&#x27;s long enough, use bows, do pigtails, etc.  This way your little girl is used to having her hair played with, so she won&#x27;t melt down when it&#x27;s time for brushing/fixing.  She&#x27;ll also be used to having accessories in her hair, so she won&#x27;t try to pull them out all the time.  (One of my favorite bows for babies with short hair: [[ASIN:B003GPIRJW 3\\&quot; Simple Grograin Hair Bow]]  I think I was using this with my daughter when she was just 3-4 months old, and she did not have much hair!  The bow was purely for style, not function, at that point.  As her hair got longer, these bows were useful for pulling her hair back from her face.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 6 months later:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been meaning to edit this review to take away a star, since these ponytail holders eventually stretched out and were less useful.  However, I discovered an easy fix, by accidentally leaving some ponytail holders in my pocket as the pants went through the laundry.  As it turns out, throwing the stretched-out ponytail holders in with a load of regular laundry (machine wash &amp; dry) gets them shrunk back to their original shape!  They might be the teeny tiniest bit fuzzier after washing, but it hasn&#x27;t bothered me.  I do recommend using a mesh laundry bag so they don&#x27;t get lost - or worse, stuck somewhere they shouldn&#x27;t be in your washer or dryer.  Given this trick, I&#x27;d still give these 5 stars!sed to having accessories in her hair, so she won&#x27;t try to pull them out all the time.

    <li> 42 in the pack with a variety of colors equals good value for me. The small size is perfect for my little girl&#x27;s hair which makes it easy to put them on. Taking them off is easy too (even for her) since they don&#x27;t pull chunks of her hair out or hurt. Ouchless indeed!! Great find. Will certainly buy more later on when these have done their time.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has wavy, fine hair, which is really hard to control.  I&#x27;ve been looking at lots of different hair clips and accessories, trying to find something that can hold onto her hair and be comfortable enough that she doesn&#x27;t constantly try to remove it. After reading the reviews for these, I decided to try these.  They work great- as some other reviewers have said, there isn&#x27;t any metal to snag on the hair, and they are small enough to hold her fine hair securely.  Best of all, she hardly notices them when they are on.  Price is a big plus as well.</li>
    <li> Product in the picture was exactly what I got. Good for infants, kids or people with fine hair.  They won&#x27;t bind.</li>
    <li> After a couple uses they start to shred and get stringy. But they work great for not getting hair tangled in them.</li>
    <li> My daughter who is 18 mo&#x27;s old has a lot of hair that must be taken away from her face. This bands are almost perfect. As long as the child has something to play with, nice hair-do could be constructed that lasts entire day.</li>
    <li> I needed these for my hair. Looked and looked at Walmart. They were always out of them. Ordered them here for $4.35. The day after I got them I went to Walmart and they had them for $1.97. Should have just waited. I could have bought 2 packages. They are very small. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gentle on hair, many beautiful colors, good for kids &amp; thin-medium haired adults. If you have really thick locks it may not stretch enough to fit all the hair in your ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;arrived on time well-packaged. Good price. I would definitely order more in the future</li>
    <li> These are probably ok for pigtails, but way too small for a ponytail.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my three year old daughter. For the price it is hard to beat. Comes with a good assortment. Quality is on par with the price. They get the job done though we have found that they stretch out over time. Would still recommend.</li>
    <li> I had some of these that were probably 20 years old, and the elastic was finally giving out. Bought these as an add on product with tennis shoes. They arrived promptly and are exactly what I wanted - for someone with baby fine thin hair, these do the job of keeping my hair off my face during workout sessions. Very pleased to have found these (they don&#x27;t tangle and pull out my hair like the plain covered elastic bands do).</li>
    <li> They work but don&#x27;t last long, stretch out fast. But look good.</li>
    <li> good but they do snag easily. they don&#x27;t stretch as good as a similar goody product. it at least has good range of colors which work for pigtails &amp; lots of them so if we lose some there are plenty.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 3 &amp; 5 year old girls! I even use it in my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I gave one of these to my girls teachers to have extras on hand.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my nieces and they are quite tiny, Maybe for thinner hair or young little girls, great set!</li>
    <li> They are Ok. Not the greatest quality, but OK for my 1 yr old who is going to chew or lost them pretty soon :)</li>
    <li> Save your money.  These have very little stretch.</li>
    <li> I love these holders because they stay put and don&#x27;t rip hair when removed by a toddler. Great colors too.</li>
    <li> Little ponytail holders.  These are the small size, so for girls with hair that is not too thick.  Delivery was fine, nice colors.  Girls would enjoy.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my three year old with fine hair and they just aren&#x27;t stretchy enough.  They&#x27;re too big to not double wrap but not stretchy and large enough to wrap around a single pony twice.  These went in the trash.</li>
    <li> Simple ties. Small. Quality is okay.</li>
    <li> Junky.  Not like the ones made in the old days.  Gets stretchy and thin.</li>
    <li> Great for toddler hair!</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> perfect for my 7 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> These are nice, and they don&#x27;t break my hair.  But they do stretch out after a few uses.</li>
    <li> So many colors and they are great quality...a definite great deal!</li>
    <li> These are uber-cheap and, well, you get what you pay for.  They&#x27;re so tiny and don&#x27;t stretch much, that they&#x27;re hard to put in my daughter&#x27;s hair quickly (like most babies, she&#x27;s not interested in sitting still while mommy tinkers with her hair ties).  Then, if you finally do get them in, they&#x27;re stretched out completely.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> In the pic it looks like they are lil bigger but in real thats for barbie dolls to make their hair pony tail.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair. They never stay in! I guess because they are too soft.</li>
    <li> Price was right but the quality is lacking, some of them are falling apart on the tube, I purchased these for a 3yr old as i know she will loose them.</li>
    <li> waste money!!very cheap quality!!! works for nothing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I​ throw it away when I received</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s fine toddler hair! She looks very cute in pigtails.</li>
    <li> My LO has thin but long hair and these keep her hair up longer than most baby clips. I like how there is a lot of bands that come in the package, especially since we tend to lose a lot.</li>
    <li> Not after I receive&lt;br /&gt;I do not know where he is</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 18 mo toddler&#x27;s fine hair. I loop it around maybe 3 times and this keeps her little pony tails or pigtails in place. She occasionally removes them but that&#x27;s probably typical and there&#x27;s nothing Goody can do about that.</li>
    <li> these are ok for disposable use only (i.e. one time use). would have preferred to have something much more durable.</li>
    <li> Great little pony tail holders for thin toddler hair.  Go in and come out easily without ripping or tangling hair.  Quite a few included for the price, since these seem to disappear pretty frequently.</li>
    <li> Great, easy to use and inexpensive so I&#x27;m not heartbroken if they get lost.</li>
    <li> I bought these ponytail holders for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, it arrived in time and is exactly as advertised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Cheaper than I&#x27;ve found them at brick and mortar stores, and don&#x27;t tangle up in my daughter&#x27;s baby-fine hair. Use these regularly and happy with them for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they do unravel a bit over time with multiple uses. If they didn&#x27;t unravel, I&#x27;d have rated a 5.</li>
    <li> Nice colors&lt;br /&gt;Nice variety&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t always stay in place, but my daughters hair is very fine.</li>
    <li> They have lots of colors to match every outfit, they don&#x27;t hurt,  they are well priced and there&#x27;s so many of them that it&#x27;s Ok if you lose a few.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have long hair, and I needed something to tie up my hair that would not break my hair off. The other types of pony tail holders were breaking off my hair.  I like this product because of the terry cloth material and the ease of use. I recommend this to anyone. It is better than other items.</li>
    <li> Unlike most rubber bands for hair, they don&#x27;t get tangled and don&#x27;t hurt when our daughter takes them out.  We use them nightly for when she sleeps and they are soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> What can I say....a variety of colors...inexpensive and my granddaughter loves them....can&#x27;t get any better than that!!</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have medium length thick hair and they get rapped 2 times in either if my fav styles and it stays and is soft enough to not to be issue when I am doing forward and backwards rolls. And tjey are pretty inexpensive so no fuss if loose them. Scrunchies don&#x27;t workas well as I rremember them working and regular pony tail holders are to big wrapped twice but to small to be wrapped 3 times and when force the 3rd they be uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Good price...they do the job!</li>
    <li> Very beauty on my girl hair ..</li>
    <li> They are good for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. The only problem is she doesn&#x27;t keep them in, she takes them out and tries to eat them. But i would tell other mom&#x27;s that have toddler daughter&#x27;s to try it.</li>
    <li> Good product, service and deal considering I can not drive.</li>
    <li> They snag runs easily, but otherwise, great for the price and are MUCH kinder and softer on my child&#x27;s head than a rubber band.  Love how many come in a package and that there&#x27;s 2/color and so many colors.  My preschooler likes these too.  I would totally order these again!</li>
    <li> Great assortment of pony tail holders in all different kinds of colors - guaranteed to find one to match whatever outfit my niece wears!</li>
    <li> These are great with my daughters fine hair.  The little rubber ones get caught and cause hair breakage.  Not these.  I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t stay in place with such a small amount of fine hair, but they work great.  The only downfall is she can easily pull them out if she wants.</li>
    <li> way too tight.....not happy with them at all.</li>
    <li> Great for my yorkshire terrior&#x27;s ponytail. Many colors, doesn&#x27;t pull out hair</li>
