### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My hair feels great!</li>
      <li>I got this and the shampoo for a friend for Christmas, and she says the shampoo is great</li>
      <li>Works great also.</li>
      <li>Great that it&#x27;s organic, but it just tears your hair up.  </li>
      <li>and it works great for me.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>What a shame as it was otherwise a nice alternative to chemical ridden products.</li>
      <li>All while making your hair healthier with the mild cleansers and beautiful oils.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, but leaves hair silky and smelling wonderful.</li>
      <li>I used to love this conditioner, but I think the formula has changed.</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo for a couple months and although I DO love the ingredients and the way it makes my hair feel/look.</li>
      <li>Love the smell &amp; the way my hair feels after use.</li>
      <li>I love the product and the timely manner in which it arrived.</li>
      <li>then this shampoo may work okay for you.</li>
      <li>I am beyond happy to have finally found a quality product, and the fact that it&#x27;s a reasonable price is just a bonus!</li>
      <li>I REALLY want to love this shampoo........</li>
      <li>My husband however loves it, he says it makes his hair super soft and smells nice, which it does</li>
      <li>It does take some getting used to at first because the texture is so light it doesn&#x27;t feel like its doing anything in the shower</li>
      <li>However once your hair dries it feels amazingly healthy, hydrated, soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>and my hair is straight and smooth.</li>
      <li>First off, the consistency.</li>
      <li>My husband has short, dry hair and it works great for him.</li>
      <li>The only things it has going for it are the natural ingredients and that it smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t actually function as a conditioner.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is much like lotion.</li>
      <li>It does not lather very well at all.</li>
      <li>Either way and as of this moment, I would never recommend it unless you don&#x27;t have much hair to comb out, (and why it probably works for some men).</li>
      <li>The shampoo is very watery.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is waxy and doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair.</li>
      <li>personally I feel it&#x27;s a HUGE improvement from the old one!</li>
      <li>and I have to use A LOT to get a decent lather.</li>
      <li>I am not searching for a new shampoo/conditioner set even though my giant bottles are still more than half full.</li>
      <li>I had to stop using it because I had huge problems brushing my hair out when it was wet.</li>
      <li>, I was so used to having foamy shampoos and heavy conditioners that I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would turn out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy with normal guy hair.</li>
      <li>Goes on like thick milk, which is nice.</li>
      <li>What arrive is no different than the bottles I had called about in the first place which leads me to believe I was told incorrect information,.</li>
      <li>My hair has NEVER been as dry as it is right now.</li>
      <li>I have no problem with the tangles after, but have not used chemical-laden conditioners for years, so am not missing that slippery feeling they give.</li>
      <li>It does not make your hair feel soft at all.</li>
      <li>I have been a long time user of Avalon products including this conditioner and absolutely knew the makeup of this product had changed.</li>
      <li>love the shampoo but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work very well, unfortunately</li>
      <li>Because there are no real anti-tangle ingredients and I have very long/thick hair</li>
      <li>Not impressed but okay for natural option.</li>
      <li>If you have thin, fine hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Left my hair sticky. Did not expect it to be so disappointing</li>
    <li> This conditioner is waxy and doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have the shampoo that goes with this and my hair is straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> So drying to my hair. I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Not impressed but okay for natural option.</li>
    <li> Used this lotion for years now and finally decided to go organic for my hair care products.  Love this! My hair feels great!</li>
    <li> My hair feels like straw and I hate the way this smells.  I would never recommend this product and I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great that it&#x27;s organic, but it just tears your hair up.  I ended up using the shampoo as body wash because it is just too harsh and drying for hair.</li>
    <li> I REALLY want to love this shampoo........ I know it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s organic and all, but this shampoo and conditioner is absolutely terrible. First off, the consistency. The shampoo is very watery. It does not lather very well at all. I have thick hair and I have to use A LOT to get a decent lather. The conditioner is much like lotion. You again, have to use A LOT to evenly coat your hair. You pump 3-4 pumps and it disappears after a single swipe onto your head. I have to pump about 8-10 times to cover all of my hair (my hair is about 2 inches past my shoulders). Then, the after effects. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 3 weeks. My hair is turning into straw. I am not searching for a new shampoo/conditioner set even though my giant bottles are still more than half full. My hair has NEVER been as dry as it is right now. If you have thin, fine hair then this shampoo may work okay for you. But if you have dry hair or thick hair, STAY AWAY!!</li>
    <li> I love the product and the timely manner in which it arrived. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love the smell &amp; the way my hair feels after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with normal guy hair. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for years. I&#x27;ve tried others but always immediately come back.</li>
    <li> Not a good detangler. It smells somewhat chemical-like once in the hair!</li>
    <li> love the shampoo but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work very well, unfortunately</li>
    <li> This is literally the worst conditioner I have ever used. It does not make your hair feel soft at all.</li>
    <li> I used to love this conditioner, but I think the formula has changed. The only things it has going for it are the natural ingredients and that it smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t actually function as a conditioner. My hair was harder to comb out after using it than it was before.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all to manage tangles</li>
    <li> I got this and the shampoo for a friend for Christmas, and she says the shampoo is great but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It leaves her hair in knots.  From the other posts, it sounds like this may be the result of the formulation change.  Wish I had read the reviews before I got a big bottle of it for her, or that she told me about it before the one month return period was over.</li>
    <li> Such a wide range of reviews, I had to add mine to the mix. As with all hair care products, they work differently in different types of hair. My husband has short, dry hair and it works great for him. I have long, curly, and tending toward frizzy hair and it works great for me. I do change around every couple times to nourish my hair with different formulations. This is one of my regulars and my husband and I both like the way it moisturizes our hair. I have no problem with the tangles after, but have not used chemical-laden conditioners for years, so am not missing that slippery feeling they give. The other regular use conditioner for me is ShiKai Everyday conditioner. Works great also.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Avalon products including this conditioner and absolutely knew the makeup of this product had changed. It is nearly impossible now to comb my hair out after washing which was never a problem before. I called the company and was told I had an outdated product, (even though it had only been purchased a few months before). So I asked the customer service representative if she felt Amazon was selling their a current batch and she said yes. This would also mean it is the current formula. What arrive is no different than the bottles I had called about in the first place which leads me to believe I was told incorrect information,. I may try to call again, I&#x27;m not sure. Either way and as of this moment, I would never recommend it unless you don&#x27;t have much hair to comb out, (and why it probably works for some men). What a shame as it was otherwise a nice alternative to chemical ridden products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t contain silicones ,pvc polyquats or guar gum. Let me tell you it&#x27;s impossible! even the $30 conditioners still have that junk in them. I am beyond happy to have finally found a quality product, and the fact that it&#x27;s a reasonable price is just a bonus! It does take some getting used to at first because the texture is so light it doesn&#x27;t feel like its doing anything in the shower, I was so used to having foamy shampoos and heavy conditioners that I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would turn out. However once your hair dries it feels amazingly healthy, hydrated, soft and shiny! All while making your hair healthier with the mild cleansers and beautiful oils. Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I know the formula has changed and personally I feel it&#x27;s a HUGE improvement from the old one! The older formula had the usual junk in it like Dimethicone which &#x3D; nasty build up and the first ingredient was water instead of Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE*** I used this shampoo for a couple months and although I DO love the ingredients and the way it makes my hair feel/look. I had to stop using it because I had huge problems brushing my hair out when it was wet. Because there are no real anti-tangle ingredients and I have very long/thick hair my knots were horrible to brush through! My husband however loves it, he says it makes his hair super soft and smells nice, which it does but he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about brushing out knots so I have reluctantly passed it onto him.</li>
    <li> Goes on like thick milk, which is nice. It&#x27;s not heavy, but leaves hair silky and smelling wonderful.</li>
