      <li>amazing ......</li>
      <li>Good product and is a better alternative for acne that doesn&#x27;t respond to salicylic acid and or benzoyl peroxide.</li>
      <li>De La Cruz is an overnight kind of thing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear it during the day though because it&#x27;s kind of cakey looking.</li>
      <li>all of the popular medicated additives, or Rx&#x27;s...nothing.</li>
      <li>This is the best adult acne medicine I&#x27;ve ever used and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
      <li>ACNOMEL ADULT ACNE CREAM IS THE BEST ZIT CLEARER AND PREVENTION</li>
      <li>out there, as well as Rxs, and this is by far the best (and cheapest!).  </li>
      <li>and it is so much more effective.</li>
      <li>Used to buy it in Mexico, but with all the crime we are glad we can get it here.  </li>
      <li>so I can spread it better.    </li>
      <li>What a life saver before a date:)</li>
      <li>/&gt;You should get some :)</li>
      <li>So glad that I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Because of the smell, I use it mostly at night.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the only thing you should have, but it is an excellent addition to your skin care products.</li>
      <li>For those people who don&#x27;t like the tinted version, this could be a better option.</li>
      <li>Give me back my great flesh-colored Acnomel!  </li>
      <li>Bumpiness is gone and most pimples healed.</li>
      <li>I really love this product and it&#x27;s been around since my mom was a kid and used it.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I find this product rather interesting</li>
      <li>I tried a lot of those salisylic acid and benzoyl peroxide acne treatments before this and none of them did anything but irritate my skin even more.</li>
      <li>We began using Acnomel, a prescription lotion, and another product (Rezamid), and got outstanding results.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>Then I found this &amp; am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad for those of you it did work for.</li>
      <li>Certainly,  better than salicylic acid products, and it does not bleach my cloths  like benzoyl peroxide does.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use benzoyl peroxide -- way too drying.  </li>
      <li>With my stunningly handsome and nearly blemish free new visage, I was even able to attract a beautiful and successful woman (of impeccable morals, by the way) and convince her to be my bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to find the right balance because 10% sulfur packs a punch, but once I did my skin has been clearing up more every day!</li>
      <li>and I really wish I had known about the awesome benefits of sulfur when I was in high school.  </li>
      <li>And it heals my acne very quickly.  </li>
      <li>(it goes on fine underneath my makeup).  </li>
      <li>Excellent for trouble spots.  </li>
      <li>During daytime you have to use Acnomel lightly or it will show.  </li>
      <li>Remembering what a nun once beat into my knuckles with a ruler: \\&quot;God helps those who help themselves\\&quot;, I decided to give Acnomel a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I believe everyone would enjoy this product so I am recommending buying it.</li>
      <li>It does leave a brownish tint, which doesn&#x27;t blend so well with a light skin tone.</li>
      <li>This product is really great and is the only thing that has shown significant improvement in my rosacea type acne.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a mattefier for my super oily skin.</li>
      <li>Acnomel gets rid of acne quickly after it starts</li>
      <li>Like the other great Numark Lab products it&#x27;s cheap and very effective and unfortunately hard to find.</li>
      <li>It does work if you are consistent with applying it and keep your face clean with the Witch Hazel.</li>
      <li>Maybe it could be combined with a nice smelling essential oil or cream that is noncomodogenic to hide the smell.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive and definitely worth at try!</li>
      <li>It clears up issues right away with no side effects at all.</li>
      <li>but was much more expensive)that consistently keeps my skin clear of blemishes.</li>
      <li>Acnomel is the first product I&#x27;ve tried with sulfur.</li>
      <li>My son was starting to break out in more \\&quot;cyst\\&quot;-like pimples.</li>
      <li>Sulfur is also good for your skin in general, so you will notice that the skin on your back and shoulders starts looking brighter.</li>
      <li>so the smell is pretty well covered up.</li>
      <li>Acnomel works pretty well.</li>
      <li>The best aspect is the absence of benzoyl peroxide -- meaning no more ruining of sheets, clothing towels</li>
      <li>pretty sure God bears no hard feelings, as He has given us countless blessings in the years since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>God&#x27;s blemishes are much fewer and farther between, and my skin remains healthy and free from excessive dryness.  </li>
      <li>If you have medium skin with red tone, it should be fine for you.      </li>
      <li>The color does not matter, it does not show as much as it does on the face.</li>
      <li>Acnomel also contains clay, which really helps to absorb excess oil.</li>
      <li>It really helps the oily skin.</li>
      <li>So I wash it off after 20 minutes or put on before going to sleep, or just don&#x27;t put on that much.</li>
      <li>It WORKS,,,dries up the cystic pimples fast.</li>
      <li>It really dries out the spot and is tinted so it covers the redness.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway this product works very well, and in addition with PanOXYL, i will be purchasing again when i run out.</li>
      <li>But, it works well for light acne on my back and shoulders!!!</li>
      <li>Most help for a very short while, then the shine comes right back.</li>
      <li>Sounds a bit gross but these are really just more sebum accumulated under the skin that are more like bumps, some of which can be hard.</li>
      <li>For face, It is not any better than average.</li>
      <li>WOW, this stuff really works!</li>
      <li>it supposedly contains much more sulfur than mask treatments i have used and has significantly less odor...</li>
      <li>There are many similar products in the market but Acnomel cream is the only one that truly works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to acne sufferers.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The bottle seems to go a long way, and it is totally affordable:)</li>
      <li>Just as good if not better than creams sold at local stores.</li>
      <li>I have what would probably be considered mild to moderate adult cystic acne.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to be able to continue using this product long enough to evaluate whether it works to clear up my acne or not because the smell is just too bothersome.</li>
      <li>I look very young for my age.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>NOT worth paying to have acne when I can just get it for free.</li>
      <li>but they are bumpy and can get pretty big.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used to buy it in Mexico, but with all the crime we are glad we can get it here.  Just as good if not better than creams sold at local stores.</li>
    <li> My skin started breaking out (especially in the chin area) horribly out of the blue a few months back and I tried every single product I could think of to ease my skin issues...Murad, Proactiv, Bliss, Philosophy, Clinique, as well as a few drugstore standards.  After they didn&#x27;t work, I went to the dermatologist who gave me Veltin and Doxicylin (antibiotic).  They didn&#x27;t work at all either and just caused horrible peeling of my skin so I went back and she gave me Differin, which also didn&#x27;t help at all.  My friend recommended this to me because she had a similar bout of unexplained acne (we are both in our early 30&#x27;s, so maybe hormonal) and she said it was the only thing that helped her.  Anyway, I wash my face with a BP based cleanser, moisturize with Cera Ve and apply a thin coat of this 2x/day (it goes on fine underneath my makeup).  It completely cleared my skin up in about 2 weeks.  Has been a few months and the pimples haven&#x27;t reappeared.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I have had Acne since I was a teenager and now I am a senior citizen.  I have been using this product for 50yrs. It WORKS,,,dries up the cystic pimples fast.</li>
    <li> Acnomel works pretty well. When I get a big honkin&#x27; zit, this stuff helps to dry it out and shrink it within a night or two. Use extra moisturizer before applying acnomel to avoid flakey spots. It&#x27;s not a flattering smell, but I use it at night so nobody cares. Or even during the day if I apply a slightly smaller amount, then my makeup goes on after that (after acnomel dries/absorbs into skin) so the smell is pretty well covered up. I either wear it at night or wear makeup (foundation) over it, so I&#x27;m not concerned about how the tint is off (though it&#x27;s not too badly off anyways). I highly recommend this to acne sufferers. It&#x27;s not the only thing you should have, but it is an excellent addition to your skin care products. The bottle seems to go a long way, and it is totally affordable:)</li>
    <li> I have dealt with acne since I was 12, fortunately only lightly as an adult, but it is still an issue.  This is the only remedy I&#x27;ve ever used that works and usually showing results within less than 24 hours.   The best aspect is the absence of benzoyl peroxide -- meaning no more ruining of sheets, clothing towels etc. -- and it is so much more effective.</li>
    <li> It clears up issues right away with no side effects at all. I will keep using this product for as long as I need to.</li>
    <li> Acnomel the Best! I have what would probably be considered mild to moderate adult cystic acne. After using this product for  one month my skin was mostly clear. After six months my skin is completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product every night as a preventative agent. As long as I do it seems to prevent new cysts from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the smell its not that bad.and it&#x27;s worth it if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price take a shot and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for cystic acne. Whenever I feel one coming on, I&#x27;ll dab some of this on it and within 2-3 days the cyst is gone. The only downside is that it&#x27;s tinted so I only use it at night.  Very inexpensive and definitely worth at try!</li>
    <li> Good product and is a better alternative for acne that doesn&#x27;t respond to salicylic acid and or benzoyl peroxide. Just note that it is TINTED. The tinting isn&#x27;t bad but it certainly isn&#x27;t the right color for everyone and it won&#x27;t blend like your foundation will.</li>
    <li> ACNOMEL ADULT ACNE CREAM IS THE BEST ZIT CLEARER AND PREVENTION I HAVE EVER USED. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE TAN COLOR TO TONE DOWN THE RED....</li>
    <li> I have suffered from Acne since I was a teenager. Now I am in my late thirties. This is the only cream (except a prescription only lotion that worked well also but was much more expensive)that consistently keeps my skin clear of blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years. I tried a lot of those salisylic acid and benzoyl peroxide acne treatments before this and none of them did anything but irritate my skin even more. Acnomel gets rid of acne quickly after it starts and I wear acnomel on problem spots like chin and forehead at night and it keeps the acne from even starting. If I get lazy and stop wearing it the acne will slowly come back. I don&#x27;t wear it during the day though because it&#x27;s kind of cakey looking. That being said, I always stock up on it whenever I can find it. Like the other great Numark Lab products it&#x27;s cheap and very effective and unfortunately hard to find. I get mine at Rite-Aid where it&#x27;s often out of stock and I&#x27;m always worried they will discontinue it and I will have to go back to being a piazza face.</li>
    <li> It does work if you are consistent with applying it and keep your face clean with the Witch Hazel. I like to just use it overnite.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to be able to continue using this product long enough to evaluate whether it works to clear up my acne or not because the smell is just too bothersome. I put it on before bed and wake up in the morning still smelling it. My husband complains of the smell as well.   The tint and the texture that bothered some people was not a problem for me - just the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an adult acne sufferer since my eighteenth birthday, when my adolescent acne decided to grow up along with me. That was 23 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not bitter about my condition. I realized that since I&#x27;m so devastatingly handsome, adding blemishes to my visage was just God&#x27;s way of keeping me humble, and helping all the area ladies of loose morals to resist certain temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I discovered Acnomel. I struggled with the notion of trying to go against His plan. Remembering what a nun once beat into my knuckles with a ruler: \\&quot;God helps those who help themselves\\&quot;, I decided to give Acnomel a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were fantastic.  God&#x27;s blemishes are much fewer and farther between, and my skin remains healthy and free from excessive dryness.  With my stunningly handsome and nearly blemish free new visage, I was even able to attract a beautiful and successful woman (of impeccable morals, by the way) and convince her to be my bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure God bears no hard feelings, as He has given us countless blessings in the years since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, ladies and gentlemen, buy Acnomel and you can be attractive again!  And God won&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J. Hutton</li>
    <li> All this did was make it worse. It was thick &amp; not flesh friendly at all. I smelled like sulfur all day long, which eventually made me sick. NOT worth paying to have acne when I can just get it for free. Another waste of my money. Had some insensitive jerk accuse me of actually working for a rival company because of my review. Hate to tell you all but there are just some of us who never find anything that will clear up a complexion. Nothing has worked for me in 2 decades - or if it did they would discontinue it. I&#x27;m a hideous mess with dozens of growths plaguing my face &amp; nothing, not some stupid kit, or cream, or lotion, or gel, all of the popular medicated additives, or Rx&#x27;s...nothing. And this didn&#x27;t work either. But I&#x27;m glad for those of you it did work for.</li>
    <li> After changing dermatologists 3 times, the latest and greatest listened when we said Differin didn&#x27;t work for my child. He recommended all sulfur-based products because of her sensitivities. We began using Acnomel, a prescription lotion, and another product (Rezamid), and got outstanding results. My daughter&#x27;s skin is as clear as the day she was born.</li>
    <li> I tried many things and this is the best product out there. It does leave a brownish tint, which doesn&#x27;t blend so well with a light skin tone. So I wash it off after 20 minutes or put on before going to sleep, or just don&#x27;t put on that much. But it works great. This is hard to find in stores, so I went to Amazon. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a mattefier for my super oily skin. I&#x27;ve tried several products over the last 20 years. Most help for a very short while, then the shine comes right back. Make up only lasts a couple of hours. Acnomel is the first product I&#x27;ve tried with sulfur. I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and wow! It really helps the oily skin. My makeup is lasting all day, with only 1 or 2 blots during the day (compared to 6-8 times.) I&#x27;m curious as to the long term effects. Will it make my skin start flaking? I look very young for my age. Everyone says it&#x27;s because of my oily skin.</li>
    <li> As an adult stuggling with acne issues, this is the ONE product that will help shrink a pimple after it has already surfaced.</li>
    <li> Acnomel was my old standby when I had terrible cystic acne.  And though it did not clear my cystic acne - only product that worked well was accutane this worked well to at least mask the huge cyst while it was healing.  I really love this product and it&#x27;s been around since my mom was a kid and used it.</li>
    <li> This product is really great and is the only thing that has shown significant improvement in my rosacea type acne.  It is thick and tinted and can look really cakey and gritty so I just use it at night before bed and wash it off in the morning and my skin looks amazing! I am so happy to have found this because I have literally tried everything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this acne medicine several times over the years and imagine my surprise when I couldn&#x27;t find it at any stores! So glad that I found it on Amazon. This is the best adult acne medicine I&#x27;ve ever used and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> This has alcohol in it. booo! bad for skin, very irritating. use De La Cruz 10% Acne ointment instead, works wonders and no alcohol. Find it amazon, also at foodmaxx grocery stores and maybe other mexican food places. The benefit of acnomel -- can be work in the day time, and men probably will like that coloring/cover up option. De La Cruz is an overnight kind of thing.</li>
    <li> I use this when a zip appears and it will usually be gone in 2 days or less.  It really dries out the spot and is tinted so it covers the redness.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> There are many similar products in the market but Acnomel cream is the only one that truly works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This both dries and covers...I have used it for years and continue to purchase it and use it as necessary</li>
    <li> It dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t heal anything. But it hid it well like a concealer. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Who would you recommend this product to? I believe everyone would enjoy this product so I am recommending buying it.</li>
    <li> very hard to find in the drugstores - I am an old guy that still gets zits from my oily skin. works well and doesn&#x27;t burn the skin - only thing I have found that works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use benzoyl peroxide -- way too drying.  During daytime you have to use Acnomel lightly or it will show.  For nighttime, though, be liberal in applying it.  Clearasil used to make a vanishing product with the same key ingredients, but discontinued it &amp; I didn&#x27;t like their tinted product. Then I found this &amp; am satisfied.  Acnomel also contains clay, which really helps to absorb excess oil.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. I put it in at night when I feel there is something brewing. It has salicylic acid and really helps to dry and clear out an area I am concerned about. Usually by the next morning its good! I also like that is has a beige color to it so it even helps to cover up the area. Im glad I found it on line!!</li>
    <li> The color of this cream is almost GRAY now.  I have purchased several tubes and they are all off-color.  I called the company, and they said that, yes, something went wrong with the normal skin color of the cream when it was being made.  It&#x27;s awful!  Give me back my great flesh-colored Acnomel!  I miss it :(  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Excellent for trouble spots.  I apply it before bed and usually clears up blemishes in just a day or two!</li>
    <li> I have been using acnomel for a short time now.  It does dry up my pimples and reduces itchiness and redness.  When I stopped using it, the pimples began to come back.  I bought the white vanishing cream, not the tinted version, so it goes on and disappears into my skin.  For those people who don&#x27;t like the tinted version, this could be a better option. The only down side for me is the smell.  I personally don&#x27;t mind the smell but I think other people could smell it on me and they might be turned off by that. Because of the smell, I use it mostly at night. Maybe it could be combined with a nice smelling essential oil or cream that is noncomodogenic to hide the smell.</li>
    <li> nothing else works like acnomel...it don&#x27;t smell good, but it works&lt;br /&gt;one word says it all .. amazing ......nuff said</li>
    <li> I have used this product for my face, back and shoulders.    For face, It is not any better than average. It is tinted for coverage  (I think also to cover the color of sulfur--active ingredient-- which is yellow), but it has too much red for my skin. My skin is medium with a yellow tone. So, it shows as red patches unless I cover all of my face and neck. Then, my face becomes redder than usual, not my natural color.  If you have medium skin with red tone, it should be fine for you.      It is also hard to spread because it is gritty and thick. I mix it with a  drop of moisturizer to have a thinner cream so I can spread it better.    But, it works well for light acne on my back and shoulders!!! Certainly,  better than salicylic acid products, and it does not bleach my cloths  like benzoyl peroxide does. The color does not matter, it does not show as much as it does on the face. Sulfur is also good for your skin in general, so you will notice that the skin on your back and shoulders starts looking brighter.</li>
    <li> vanishing acne withing a week! this is the only product that works on my face and the only one i use.</li>
    <li> I have been meaning to write a review for this. I find this product rather interesting it supposedly contains much more sulfur than mask treatments i have used and has significantly less odor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this product works very well, and in addition with PanOXYL, i will be purchasing again when i run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gel and was hoping to reduce the size of adult acne.  It did not work for me and my husband. After use it, the acne spots turn into dark marks and took long time to absolve.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and I really wish I had known about the awesome benefits of sulfur when I was in high school.  I&#x27;ve had moderate acne with occasional cystic acne for half of my life, have tried every OTC cleanser, toner, gel, gadget, etc. out there, as well as Rxs, and this is by far the best (and cheapest!).  Be careful though, this stuff can dry the hell out of your skin if you don&#x27;t watch out.  I initially used it every night as I don&#x27;t care for how it looks, and after a few days the majority of my face was flaking off.  I cut it down to every other night, and use Acnevir (a much more mild sulfur medication) on the opposite nights.  I also mix the Acnomel with a moisturizer (I prefer AmorePacific Moisture Bound Vitalizing Masque, expensive but lasts forever).  However, I was still getting oily skin through my makeup during the day.  Acnomel does a wonderful job of keeping oil at bay!  I just use a little less than pea-sized dab mixed with my L&#x27;Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream and it works wonders!  No cakey look and awesome coverage that lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving this a try, especially if you&#x27;re like me and have tried almost everything.  Just don&#x27;t give up on it.  I had to find the right balance because 10% sulfur packs a punch, but once I did my skin has been clearing up more every day!</li>
    <li> My friends and I used to use this in a different format when we were teens. Bought it for my 14 yr old son who is using Proactive but still breaking out. Acnomel has a different active ingredient than Proactive I believe so hopefully it will help. We haven&#x27;t used it yet, but if it&#x27;s like what I used it has a bit of a tint to it that helps to hide the redness.&lt;br /&gt;...three days later...WOW, this stuff really works! Bumpiness is gone and most pimples healed. Not too drying on him, no flaking skin.&lt;br /&gt;You should get some :)&lt;br /&gt;May 2013: UPDATE: This product is quite amazing. My son was starting to break out in more \\&quot;cyst\\&quot;-like pimples. Sounds a bit gross but these are really just more sebum accumulated under the skin that are more like bumps, some of which can be hard. There is no real redness but they are bumpy and can get pretty big.I put a generous amount on the cysts at night so that it can work while he sleeps. If you do, put an old towel or the like on your pillowcase to prevent staining. The result is truly amazing. After just one application the size was minimized greatly and after a couple of applications, most were gone. The ingredient is sulfur and was used in ancient times I discovered.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since my very first ZIT!!!!  It is cover up/make up for MEN!!!!  And it heals my acne very quickly.  What a life saver before a date:)</li>
