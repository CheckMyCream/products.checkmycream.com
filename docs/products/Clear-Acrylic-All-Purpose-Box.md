    <li> This is a nice little sturdy box that I&#x27;m using to store our extra electric toothbrush heads. It works great for that. Perfect size.</li>
    <li> this was perfect for the intended purpose!  great value and quick shipping!!!!!</li>
    <li> seems great quality, working out well for my cotton ball needs !!!</li>
    <li> I thought the price was high for a plastic box butI was suprised to see that it is much heavier duty than expected, well made hinge assembly, no cheap plastic box.</li>
    <li> As described, no scratches &amp; clear</li>
    <li> Love this little box! It&#x27;s sturdy and is great for storing those little odds and ends that always seem to accumulate on my dresser. Quick ship and well packed too!</li>
    <li> Really nice way to get rid of clutter in your bathroom drawers. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Very pretty for a plastic box. Gave this away as a gift - does not look cheap. Well made and crystal clear. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Outstanding Product. I use these to hold &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; electronic systems during hardware/software product development. The systems are accessible, yet remain safe. When development ends, the entire box goes back on the shelf and its contents remain in view.</li>
    <li> I needed a little box to hold a few things within reach and this item is exactly perfect.  The lid edge sticks out such a tiny bit you can&#x27;t even see it but that makes it so easy to lift the lid.  It&#x27;s very well made, crystal clear.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The order arrived very quickly. Happy with the quality of the boxes; just as described online.</li>
    <li> These boxes were a little smaller than expected but were perfect for holding my daughters jewelry and small hair items.</li>
    <li> I use this on my vanity for misc storage. I feel that it is bigger than pictured but that&#x27;s just me</li>
    <li> I bought these for sand and shells from my Myrtle Beach trip and they are perfect! Tight closure, solid material, transparent as clear glass. That was very important to me to see my display, looks as good as glass</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, Professional Seller, Beautiful! Thank You 5 Stars ★★★★★</li>
    <li> Attractive.  Just perfect for storing cotton squares and swabs.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very hard, beautiful, thick, clear, acrylic case for storing just about anything. I use them for collector&#x27;s team set baseball cards.</li>
    <li> Good quality construction. Looks like it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> Box was cracked but the box was intact and well protected.  Must have happened in factory before packaging.  Item was smaller than expected...my fault.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  The size is perfect for my use.  The acrylic is high quality, very clear and a good weight.  It opens and closes exactly as it should.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very well made and good looking.</li>
    <li> A really nice box for jewelry or any type of small items. Just be careful when opening the box: open lifting from only the front, and don&#x27;t wrap your hand around the whole top because you might get pinched at the hinge (it happened to me)</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, meets my needs.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I was looking for.  I came across a perfectly preserved dragonfly and wanted to keep it protected.  This box is the perfect fit for it.  I had a piece of mirror cut to fit inside the bottom of the box and set the dragonfly on that.  It&#x27;s very cool looking!  The box is very clear, well made and of good quality.  I would buy another one when the need arises.</li>
    <li> Beautiful box, well made. Best of all, no ugly glued-on sticker to detract from the beauty of the box and that results in a marred surface when removed. Great for protecting small jewelry items, like rings and earrings, while making them easy to find on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Really nice box with hinged lid. Kind of expensive but worth the quality! I&#x27;m using it for my assortment of essential oils. Shipping was free and fast!!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful box!  Sturdy and looks like crystal!  I&#x27;d like one a little larger now so I&#x27;ll definitely look for one my the same manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is a very solidly built product.  It is very attractive and expensive looking. The only complaint is that the cover smudges very easily. I purchased 4 of them for office use and am extremely pleased with them. It&#x27;s a great size. We cut paper towels into small squares and place them in these containers and take out one square at a time and squeeze alcohol on it to wipe down equipment.</li>
    <li> This container is gorgeous!  Crystal clear with a flushed lid.  I don&#x27;t like containers where the lid sits lower than the sides, it&#x27;s not as clean looking.  I used my container to store Q-tips &amp;#34;portrait-orientation&amp;#34; and they fit perfectly.  I&#x27;m tempted to purchase more!!</li>
    <li> Great see through box with weight and seems strong. I love it because it holds my everyday earrings where they stay dust free and I can see which ones I want to wear right away.</li>
    <li> I filled it with sand and shells from the beach and it looks very nice. The acrylic is great quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a home project, and needed a nice acrylic box that did not look cheap. This box has crisp edges and a shiny finish just as in the picture.</li>
    <li> great weight box. made very well. quick ship</li>
    <li> Well constructed and perfect for cotton and swabs or really anything you want to put in it. I&#x27;m planning to order a few more. I love the flip top box! Came extra quick and packaged well.</li>
    <li> These boxes are perfect for one&#x27;s everyday earring collection.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars but no feet so any water spilled on bathroom counter will discolor it and make it stick to the counter. Otherwise perfect for Q tips.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of these boxes and they are absolutely beautiful!  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Solid little box. Exactly as expected</li>
    <li> I bought one of these because it is easier to load and retrieve small cotton balls than the upright jars you see.  Works great.  I just bought another to store all my thumb-drives I keep collecting, not to mention miniature Bluetooth and WI-Fi adapters, etc.  This box lid easily opens with one finger.  You can see exactly what it is in it too.  Simple but very effective storage solution.</li>
    <li> These boxes are attractive and functional.  Best of all, they are also affordable.</li>
    <li> It is well made and just the right size for the  crab shell.  Plus it is for my Granddaughter, and will keep it well protected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to hold an Arduino project.  The Arduino Uno R3 controller fit perfectly inside this box with plenty of room for an LCD screen.  The acrylic is easy to sculpt using a rotary tool which makes adding holes for switches and cables quite easy.</li>
    <li> It is a small box. Check size when ordering.</li>
    <li> This was really nice. It&#x27;s plastic but it&#x27;s a good quality. My grandfather was in World War II and I put his dog tags in there to protect him. It was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. It was smaller than I thought it would be (I didn&#x27;t actually look at the size in the description) but the receiver seems satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my cotton swab container.  I have two of them in different locations in my house.  It&#x27;s convenient.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this box - it is well made.  Ordered it to display a family heirloom and it works well for that..</li>
    <li> Actually very nice. I purchased this as a project case for a clock I was building. The hinges won&#x27;t stand up to too much abuse (like dropping it or treating it very roughly) but the box itself looks quite durable, as the Acrylic is quite thick. No scratches and the acrylic is clear (ie not tint or discoloration).</li>
    <li> its exactly what I wanted. It was alittle more then I wanted to spend, but it works and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The boxes are nice and sturdy (I Bought four). However, the first one I opened was damaged- it had a broken hinge. When I looked into exchanging it, the process didn&#x27;t really offer me the right option, which I found very frustrating. So, I just decided to keep it and avoid the hassle. I will consider this the next time I order that type of product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect to hold my makeup removing pads.</li>
    <li> Purchased for the remained of my cat, not ashes, but her footprint.  Nice, sturdy and durable.  It&#x27;s a box, don&#x27;t know what more to say :-)</li>
