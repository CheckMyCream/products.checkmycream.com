<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> perfect dupe for the Urban Decay Naked 2 Palette. Colors are beautiful, easy to apply and highly pigmented.</li>
    <li> I am in Love! The colors are great and they have great pigmentation! No regrets whatsoever!</li>
    <li> I love the red shades in this palette.</li>
    <li> Best! Love this kit so much!!</li>
    <li> Only reason for 4 stars is the cheap packaging- but you get what you pay for in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this palette is an equal, if not better option, to the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette (rosy toned nudes).&lt;br /&gt;I am typically a fan of Urban Decay shadows, and I have loved my naked 2 palette more than any other palette that I have owned but the Naked 3 is my least favorite- THIS IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE IF you are in the market for rose toned nudes. There are more matte colors (which is better for mature skin or if you smoke out/blend eye shadow looks) and they&#x27;re surprisingly pigmented. There are more shades both shimmer, sparkle, and matte to choose from and the quality for the price is good.</li>
    <li> this palette has really good pigmentation and good quality</li>
    <li> Very beautiful colors in this pallet. Great alternative for the naked 2 and 3 pallets if you are looking to save some cash for the same quality and colors as the naked pallets.</li>
    <li> amazing palette!! great dupe for the naked 3</li>
    <li> First Item I bought with PRIME.  It shipped in 2 days which was Christmas eve.  Daughter loves it</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day. beautiful shades that blend well.</li>
    <li> very good , I love it</li>
    <li> I like it! The eyeshadow colors last longer and are very pigmented they arrived well packeged. Good price.</li>
    <li> Thank You it was in a good condition</li>
    <li> Great shadow with lasting power but there are A LOT of pink shades in this palette. Overall a great product and the price is awesome too!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous pigmentation. I really enjoyed this palette so much. I think I will consider purchasing other palettes of Costal Scents because of how great of a value this one has been. Perfect for someone just beginning too. Easy to use and so many usable shades in one package!</li>
    <li> Last all day and has a great pigment.</li>
    <li> I really loved this! It is so pigmented and the colors are great for fall! I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Yes. It was really nice. Good colors.</li>
    <li> Sparkle stripper set.... If us wanna be neutral natural looking stripper. Just sayin</li>
    <li> Great product, goes on easily but sometimes it flakes during application. Great colors though. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great colors and pigments! There are some great pink and purple shades that work well for anyone. I would use every shade! I have the naked palette and I love both! Similar but different. Other reviewers who say this isn&#x27;t pigmented isn&#x27;t using a proper brush.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who has had a reaction to this eye makeup? Had to wash it off after a few hours of wear, my eyes were watering and red - even after removing it they were hypersensitive all day. I have only had this happen one other time about 20 years ago so I am not typically allergic to ingredients in eye makeup, which made me wonder what was in this. A google search brought up a lot of discussions about quality control and the fact this product was made in China, and although I found nothing that specifically addressed whether there was anything harmful in it, with the news reports over the last few years regarding questionable and harmful ingredients used in the manufacture of pet products and children&#x27;s toys in China, I would rather not risk it. I will pay a little more and buy something I feel more comfortable using. An added note about the quality of this product: When I first opened it my initial reaction was that it looked more like an inexpensive watercolor set I would have gotten for my kids than a makeup set, primarily because of the cheap cardboard the case was made of. But then I was thinking that must be why they can sell it for so much less than the name brand product it duplicates. Generally speaking I had no complaints about the color saturation, but during application with a makeup brush there seemed to be a lot of excess makeup color that was in places I did not apply it to, ie the inside bridge of my nose.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors come out a bit light but I really like this palette! Great variety of colors and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and one for a friend. We both loved it. Easy to apply and the colors are fabulous.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenage niece and she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Usually use Naked palettes, this is a very good alternative. I would even say I like the colors better. And much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this palette lots of beautiful colors. More on the pink side if you&#x27;re wondering. Wasn&#x27;t as big as i expected but still a great palette. Pigmentation is great and hardly any fall out. Also had super fast shipping i ordered 10 o&#x27;clock at night came 2 days later early afternoon. Achieved a beautiful look today. Cant wait to see what other looks i can do &#x27;</li>
    <li> Colors are fabulous!!! There is really no need to get a naked palette; the Revealed palette works better than my Naked palette. Love them!</li>
    <li> THE BEST PALLETTE EVER, SO GOOD QUALITY, I WANT TO BUY ALL OF THEM!!!!! REALLY LOVED IT</li>
    <li> This palette is just ok.  I really should have spent the money on the urban decay palette and I would have been very happy.  The color options are great, but the pigment is not and the shadows break up easily when rubbing your eye shadow brush over it.  Some colors are too sparkle-y and transfers easily all over my face, so I look like a glitter face.  The matte colors work for blending and smokey eyes.  It doesn&#x27;t even come with an applicator, which is probably not a problem for some, but it was for me.  I will probably end up throwing away.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. I bought this set for my mom and so far she has no complaints.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to them, be careful if you have sensitive skin.  They made my eyes water and burn.  Disappointed as I really loved the colors. :(</li>
    <li> I love love love these eye shadows. No need to apply a lot and sticks very well and easy to blend.</li>
    <li> I love this palette so much! It&#x27;s my first eye shadow palette and it&#x27;s just as I expected it to be. A few color are kind of *meh* but just apply those with your finger and you can make them work. I fell in love with the Naked 3 palette but it was just so expensive and I&#x27;m a college student (broke as heck!) so I searched for some dupes and the first row of this palette kind of resembles the Naked 3 plus it has more beautiful colors in the bottom row. If you want something similar to the Naked 3 plus more colors (and not paying $50 something) ,your search ends here. You can pull of similar looks (if not the same) as someone using the Naked 3. If you are still not sure after reading all the way here, emilynoel83 and coffebreakwithdani (and many others) have tutorials and reviews using this palette. I hope I helped with this review, good luck! :)</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows are high quality and very similar to UD naked palettes but much more affordable!  I bought this because I didnt want to shell out more than 50 for the UD pallete. You get 20 eyeshaows for under $20 and the colors are beautiful.</li>
    <li> I really really like it. Its nice, great price, if you watch the youtube  you will know which colors are good and which one is so so. Overall great palette and I agree, why spend $$$ on a Urban Decay 3 palette when you can get this one for $ and create the same looks.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, yet affordable palette.  I did not buy Naked 3, but believe from reviews I have read, that this is a great substitute.  The colors all work together, and there is quite a range of them.  You can go very natural if you wish, or more dramatic for night.  Very high quality shadows.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this palette for about a month now. The packing is great, and the design is gorgeous. Colors were smooth for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great pigmentation on most of the shades, great price. The worst thing that happened was that my palette came...dirty looking. The colors were all over, but that may have been due to bad shipping. No cracked eye-shadows though, god bless. I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t break me out. The shades on the bottom row are gorgeous. The whites and light pinks are very pigmented. Dark skinned ladies and men will have a little to no trouble with this product showing up on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The black color is hideous. It&#x27;s mixed with the shade next to it (shipping/handling maybe?) so it&#x27;s an unappealing purple. The shimmery shades do fallout on to the cheek and a lot of the shades are very similar. The shade next to the first shade in the palette was streaky, but that was the only one. The gold colors in the corner are very sometime-y. The barely transfer onto the eye, and when they actually pick up, there is too much shimmer, and not enough color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;This palette is great, with a few flaws. You don&#x27;t pay for what you get, and that&#x27; a good thing. Hopefully your shades don&#x27;t come all jacked up.</li>
    <li> Wow! For $20 this is a amazing palette. I review makeup and am a huge fan of BH Cosmetics eyeshadow&#x27;s but had yet to try  Costal Scents. These palette is so close to the Urban Decay Naked 2 and 3 palettes I would go as far to say skip them, get this and save yourself $80. Most of the shadows are pigmented,  buttery and blend like a dream. They feel like high end shadows for a drugstore price. A few of the shimmer shadows have chunky glitter in them and don&#x27;t have good pigment. But for a palette with this many shadows a few duds are ok with me. If your on the fence on this palette, get it! You won&#x27;t regret it.  I have since ordered , ore Costal Scents makeup and brushes through their site and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  I would go as far to say some of the eyeshadow brushes are perfect dupes for MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this palette, the colors go on good. They appear more vibrant and bold when used with primer. I love all colors, but I especially love the cranberry color. I would buy this palette over and over and over again.</li>
    <li> Powdery can&#x27;t stay on brush!</li>
    <li> This is a great palette , great price , great soft colors !!!</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows work great, especially when you apply primer first! However, when I did receive my palette, there was loose eyeshadow dust everywhere. Overall I still love this product!</li>
    <li> I was soo excited when i ordered this item only to find a different product in the package.  Now i have to go through the hassle of returning the item and not until i return it will i receive a credit so that i can re-order...</li>
    <li> Great eye shadow to add to your collection. It does flake off a little bit.  But still well worth the price. There&#x27;s more shimmer colors than matte.  Usually I avoid shimmer eye shadows due to my heavy upper eyelid. But I don&#x27;t think these shadows are too shimmery. Again it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow!! Goes on great &amp; lasts all day!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this because I already had the Naked 3, but I think it was those berry colors that suckered me into getting it. I watched a lot of reviews for this palette and saw the comparisons of eye shadow colors from the Revealed 2 to the Naked 3. Basically, the Revealed 2 is a crazy good dupe for Naked 3. The colors are almost exactly the same AND the Revealed 2 has extra colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coastal Scents has pretty good pigmentation in their shadows. They&#x27;re not as buttery or creamy as Urban Decay, of course, but it is quite good for a fraction the price of a Naked palette. If I were someone on a budget or didn&#x27;t care about name brand makeup, I would get this palette hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a mirror. I&#x27;m someone that always uses the palette mirror when I do my makeup, so this palette just kind of throws me off. Although I have both the Revealed 2 and the Naked 3, I still find myself reaching for the Revealed 2 just because I love the matte berry colors in there!</li>
    <li> The color are very nice and pigmented</li>
    <li> Great gift for my wife.</li>
    <li> beautiful colors, smooth application.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shades, great price.</li>
    <li> received this set for Christmas. like that the cover is magnetized, not liking that the case is cardboard. I quickly found out that the shimmery colors go on much better wet, otherwise my face ended up all glittery. overall great colors, like playing with color combos</li>
    <li> This is very good. Nice colours. And give you exactly colour on you eyes</li>
    <li> Very good pigmentation</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed. The eyeshadow are chalky. You must use a primer and a base for the eyeshadow to stick. But it is not a bad product for the price and beginners.</li>
    <li> Love all the natural warm colors!! They go great with all different types of skin tones and are so shimmer, doesn&#x27;t bunch up on your lids and last all day long!</li>
    <li> This palette has versatile, pigmented colors, great for many daily looks, and dramatic looks on all skin tones. I have used it every day since I bought it. Great for everyday natural looks and happy hour!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the colors and so did I.</li>
    <li> I love this set. Good staying power, I like the colors and it was a good price.  I&#x27;m not a make up snob though so I only worry about if it blends well, has the colors I want and stays on all day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to crease at all so not sure if that is application (with a brush) or the eyeshadow but I have had good luck with this.</li>
    <li> This palette had to grow on me but I&#x27;m starting to like it. The colors are beautiful and color pay off is great. There is a lot of fall out so do the eye makeup before the face. I use it in my freelance makeup kit. It&#x27;s similar to the URban DEcay naked palette as far as the colors. Overall good dupe.</li>
    <li> Good range of shades.Very Pigmented.</li>
    <li> Excellent dupe for higher end palette. Some fall out but staying power on eyelid is very comparable to top selling brands. I bought more than one palette. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Comparable to a combo of Naked and Naked 2. There are not exact dupes for each of their shades but you can recreate any of their looks with slightly differing shaded. 1/3 of the price. Very pigmented and not a lot of fall out for most shades. I&#x27;m very pleased and looking forward to buying more Coastal Scent palettes</li>
    <li> I use this more then I use my Naked palette which I didn&#x27;t think would happen. I love it and have told my friends about it because it is a great product and an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good things about this palette</li>
    <li> Fast delivery &amp; great purchase. Happy with pallete.</li>
    <li> I love this palette so much. There are just too many good things to say about it. I love all the rose tones, and I really like that I have 20 shadows to choose from. I like to take this palette with me on trips, because it has such a great selection, and the price is on point. The quality of the shadows is also great and buttery</li>
    <li> Excellent shadow at a great price, it is a great dupe for the Naked 2 Urban Decay shadows.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. My sister loves this palette. She likes the neutral combinations and experiments with different looks. This is a great palette for use with or without a primer.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money on the nacked 3 when you can get this. this is worth it!</li>
    <li> Great colors.long lasting. Great price.</li>
    <li> Love love love these! Stays all day without a primer! Fantastic</li>
    <li> I been using every single day. The colors are just great :)</li>
    <li> Holy crap this palette is amazing, great pigmentation, almost no fallout, except on one or two colors. Plenty of matte colors, and it&#x27;s awesome for fall.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color combinations.  Long lasting and a great value.</li>
    <li> Colors are deep and long lasting.  Love them as liners as well as shadows.</li>
    <li> I love the colors. They are beautiful and well pigmented, but one or two of them aren&#x27;t the best formula wise. Some of them (those one or two) are crumbly, but the majority are amazingly like butter.</li>
    <li> I expected to love this palette after looking at and reading all the reviews but I think it&#x27;s just okay. Some colours are really nice but others not as much. The mattes are pretty good but I find some of the shimmer to be a little chalky and need the use of a primer. I&#x27;m wondering if I should have spent the extra on the Naked 3 but most people say that this has great dupes and is similar in quality so not sure</li>
    <li> I love these colors and the price. They are the closest to Ulta  Urban Decay that I can find anywhere especially at this price the only downfall iss thee is no brus or any kind of applicators included would have been nice to have known ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;No problem to finbrushesthry go on smooth snddi not crease. I love all the colors sometimes it&#x27;s hard to decide which bed to wear a color complimentary wheel would be good too, i woud absolutely recommended these dig you&#x27;re looking for the smoky neutral colors.</li>
    <li> This was a very nice alternative to the naked brand.</li>
    <li> Well pigmented , last long. I really like these and I&#x27;m looking to buy the other palettes from coastal scents</li>
    <li> Thank you! Great eye shadow! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Great loved the colors with my yellow green eyes</li>
    <li> This palette has a nice selection of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; colors for the price, and arrived intact with none broken (I got lucky).</li>
    <li> great quality, great pigmentation, i think it has a lot of great mattes and deep pinks and purples, really great for smoky eyes. i think this is a great purchase. decent dupe for the naked 3 plus more</li>
    <li> Best product and received it on time! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love love love this palette and it came shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> Just okay.  Colors fair, very dry. Doesn&#x27;t apply to eyelid as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a great little palette, with lots of neutral options, but I would not say they are quite as pigmented as Urban Decay shadows, but still amore affordable alternative</li>
    <li> Excellent dupe for Urban Decay Naked 3 palette. Reordered one for a friend as well.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeeeee this ,every color is pretty!</li>
    <li> It so beautiful the best colors so beautiful I love every color in the palette be blessed!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this palette. I&#x27;d been wanting UD Naked 2, but didn&#x27;t want to buy it both because of the cost and because of&lt;br /&gt;the company being owned by a non cruelty free corporation. This palette is even better than the UD, in my opinion. Not only is it cheaper, just as good quality and cruelty-free, but you get an extra 10 shadows. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the colors in this palette! It has a great selection and as long as you have a good primer the shadow will stay on without creases. I typically use brands like Urban Decay and Too Faced and this one is definitely comparable! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> amazing palette! creamy blend-able and worth your money they&#x27;re so pigmented</li>
    <li> Excellent shadows that work best with an eye shadow primer.  NYX make a great inexpensive one.  This kit is a little too rosey for me.  I prefer the first pa</li>
    <li> These colors are so bright and the best part they are very affordable. After watching the reviews on YouTube I had to try them and for the price I paid you get so much more. If you have any doubts about buying this palette buy it you will love it!! This product has been compare to the naked palettes 2 and 3 I have never it used it because of the price but this is a great look alike and some of the colors are almost dead on for the naked palette.</li>
    <li> Arrived early than expected. Great colors &amp; good quality. Small flat case &amp; easy to store. Worth $10 not $20.</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing and so affordable.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. i love all the colors!</li>
    <li> Watch out UD... Coastal Scents reveled has stolen your thunder! I find myself reaching for this more than my naked palettes, this is the closest, if not exact dupe I have seen for them, the colors are vibrant, and pigmentation is AMAZING! You&#x27;re basically paying a 1 per shadow here. So many beautiful looks you can create. If you are on a budget, and looking for a good quality eyeshadow palette, I would recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with the pallet. I think it&#x27;s nuts that we have to pay 50+ dollars for quality makeup. Revealed 2 is quality makeup that is fantastic for the price. I have been wanting the naked pallets for so long and couldn&#x27;t afford it, so I bought this. I am in love. The lighter shades seem like they aren&#x27;t pigmented, but they are. Great for high lighting!! The darker shades are SO pigmented but so rich- it&#x27;s amazing. The only flaw (which I shouldn&#x27;t even be saying) but some of the shades of purple are REALLY close together and I thought it was a little pointless, but they still bring quality to the pallet. You can never have too many shades ;) They&#x27;re are so many combinations you can do with this, it&#x27;s unreal and I&#x27;m so excited to try!!! A++++</li>
    <li> Love it! Comparable to &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> accidentally bought this one when I meant to get palette #1 - but I love it! the shadows are very buttery and last all day - highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am in love with these colors!! Just buy it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I really like this one. I am so over my ud shadows and never use them anymore. I grab this one everyday. I can create a ton of looks with just this pallet alone and I love the matte shades in this one. If you want the ud naked 3 pallet DON&#x27;T!  Get this one, the colors are spot on, apply smoother, have better pigmentation  and blend better. There is only 1 shade in this pallet that has a ton of fallout but it doesnt bother me because i only use that shade as an inner corner highlight. With the colors provided you can create a look for every season. This Is my everyday pallet!</li>
    <li> This palette was just ok. I know a lot of people say that its a dupe for the Naked 3 palette and that may by true on some levels. but i think that the amount of shadows just confused me lol, and I find that if i use more than 3 colors at a time it just starts to look muddy, which is not so with the Naked3. It is a good palette for the money but not my favorite and not really comparable to the Naked3</li>
    <li> Now i want to go back and order the 1st one too! i mean its soft and pigmented. So similar to the naked pallet and since I dont wear makeup often, i can never justify splurging on cosmetics. This is great way to get the look and not break a hole in that wallet :D</li>
    <li> Like Urban Decay but much cheaper!</li>
