### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Ulta has the best!</li>
      <li>She gets about a week (by her reports) out of each application, which is shorter than what &amp;#34;they say&amp;#34; but still perfectly acceptable and on par with what she gets from the salon when she goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>words: If you purchase this product and use it, make sure you follow the enclosed instructions!</li>
      <li>To me the nails look nice, they have that shine from the salon.</li>
      <li>i liked this product alot.</li>
      <li>Took advice from another user, and I run two cycles for the color coats, and that really seals it perfectly.</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s thrilled with the convenience, the color choices and of course -- the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kind of a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Which is nice.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>The product works great, once you get the hang of applying it (be very sure not to leave any on your skin when you cure it or the polish will peel off quickly).  </li>

      <li>Love this set&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
      <li>hubby wants to go on a date, great i can paint my nails in 20min</li>
      <li>Nails were very beautiful but they only lasted 3 days.</li>
      <li>a teacher who uses her hands a lot and what I found was that, while the polish held up much better than its non-gel counter-part, it did chip after just two days.</li>
      <li>In fact, I plan on adding more colors to my collection.</li>
      <li>Be sure to apply the polishes as directed and &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; your nails as directed.</li>
      <li>This was also priced way better versus any retail store.</li>
      <li>I love this product and am recommending it to all my friends and fellow working moms.</li>
      <li>Has done the job, her nails never looked better.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>and you will love it as well.</li>
      <li>It was OK for it to be sent through the mail, but I could not return it.</li>
      <li>I just finished my first manicure with this set, and am beyond thrilled with the results!</li>
      <li>With Sally Hansen&#x27;s gel system, my nails are perfect the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love gel/shellac manicures.</li>
      <li>Two weeks later and it looked awesome.</li>
      <li>You need to somehow label your gel and top coat bottle</li>
      <li>Co worker had her nails done and paid about 25 bucks at a nail salon, my nails looked better and I can use my kit over again, she&#x27;d have to pay another 25.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to stop just short of the cuticle.</li>
      <li>a bit of practice, you will love this system.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be able to go about life and look mah-velous doing it.</li>
      <li>But one caution:  make sure you wipe your nails with the pads like the instructions say.</li>
      <li>has been saving me over $60 every two weeks and stays on so many compliments</li>
      <li>this is better</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I supplemented the polish with gelish and shellac (way better polish).</li>
      <li>With this kit, my nails have never looked better.</li>
      <li>I wash dishes, my hair, pull the top of of whatever food product</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>Was very cautious the first time I applied because there are so many directions, but the process could not be easier and my manicure was perfect for 10 days!</li>
      <li>This worked great, and was fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Used it twice and then went and bought a better light.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, I used the light with other (cheaper) brands of gel polish and had no problems, which means more choices too.</li>
      <li>We have a pool party today and that will be a true test!</li>
      <li>Easy to do and just as long-lasting as a salon gel manicure.</li>
      <li>I also gave myself a pedi since it was so easy.  </li>
      <li>I use soaked cotton balls on my nails wrapped with foil for 15 minutes to remove the polish - comes off easily with this method.</li>
      <li>, there are NO returns on this, so make sure you really want to own this before you buy.</li>
      <li>Like others say, run your thumb around the cuticle before curing if polish leaks off the nail to clean it up and make it more secure.</li>
      <li>The polish was also easy to remove and didn&#x27;t cause any damage, and the light seems study.</li>
      <li>and it should turn out fine....</li>
      <li>she heard all these things are cheap and dont work..</li>
      <li>This removes a sticky film that results from the chemical process of the gel setting under the light.</li>
      <li>This is important.</li>
      <li>I save SOOOO much money doing my own shellac myself instead of paying $30 every two weeks.</li>
      <li>one final note, a friend of ours had purchased a $150+ salon nail kit that she was happy with.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVED this! Made my nails super shiny and only took about 10 minutes to do my nails!</li>
    <li> I really do like this kit quite a bit. Took advice from another user, and I run two cycles for the color coats, and that really seals it perfectly. Glossy, lasts 10 days (and then I get bored and switch it). Love that I don&#x27;t ruin a manicure by not giving enough dry time. After one week had a tiny chip, but I am pretty darn brutal on my nails, use them to open packages, garden, do dishes, type all the time, work out, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had regular nail polish on my toes, and they didn&#x27;t look or last nearly as well. Color in photo is &amp;#34;Taupe Tulip.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a means to have a durable nail polish for my hands. I admit that my slightly lower review may be due to operator error (read: I&#x27;m not using it correctly). However, I have followed the instructions (twice!), exactly as they are outlined in the enclosed instructions. I even went on YouTube and looked up some tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I&#x27;ve discovered about the product: It works. And it works well. On your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a teacher who uses her hands a lot and what I found was that, while the polish held up much better than its non-gel counter-part, it did chip after just two days. When I put it on my feet, however, my pedicure hasn&#x27;t chipped or faded in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Would I use it again? Yes. In fact, I plan on adding more colors to my collection. I like it. I like how bright and shiny it looks after applications. I like that it doesn&#x27;t chip or flake on my toes and even seems to uphold a little better than traditional nail polishes on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Bright and shiny colors, durable&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Chips on the hands (for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last words: If you purchase this product and use it, make sure you follow the enclosed instructions! This means putting THIN coats of polish on your fingernails and toenails. You cannot rush the process. So, as a final thought, make sure you have time to devote to pampering yourself.</li>
    <li> i liked this product alot. it works great and the gel polish lasts for a long time, usually nail polish comes off the next day</li>
    <li> Has done the job, her nails never looked better.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing😀😀 love it.</li>
    <li> so far have really enjoyed this. My nails last MUCH longer that with regular polish but as soon as you get a &amp;#34;chip&amp;#34; the whole thing will peal off.  Either way though, it peals off pretty clean and easy so I can just redo 1 nail quickly if needed. The red color is a true red and it is beautiful!  Very glad I bought this. Can&#x27;t wait to try a new color.</li>
    <li> Gel polish nail starter kit - excellent find and the red polish is the perfect tint.  One warning, when curing the nail polish, it burns a little (no one warned me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product saved my family money -- instead of paying for manicures and polish changes  - we do it at home and we get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> This was the best purchase I have made to save money! The quality look my nails have is great and no chips for 13 days! This was also priced way better versus any retail store.</li>
    <li> This takes a little getting used to, but once you do, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever used traditional nail polish. And you can save a TON of money doing this yourself at home over going to the salon. The colors are a bit limited right now, but I think that will change soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions and follow them to the &#x27;t&#x27;! This is important. It takes a bit longer to get the color on, with all the steps, but once you&#x27;re done, you can go about your day or night. There&#x27;s no dry time. The UV light &#x27;sets&#x27; the polish, not dries it.  I tend to do my nails at night, around 10 or so. After I&#x27;m done, I may wait 15 minutes to go to bed, just from years of being traumatized by smudging nail polish while I slept, or getting those stupid bed sheet lines on them, and I could have done my nails at 3 in the afternoon and had that happen! With Sally Hansen&#x27;s gel system, my nails are perfect the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip:  be careful putting the base and, especially, the top coat on. Try to not have any excess past the nail. Put just enough on. Then touch up what you need to. Once you put your hand into the UV light, whatever excess there may be, sets right where it is, and can look a bit messy. It&#x27;s best to stop just short of the cuticle. That gives a cleaner, salon look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a bit of practice, you will love this system. Your nails will be set almost instantly. You&#x27;ll be able to go about life and look mah-velous doing it. But one caution:  make sure you wipe your nails with the pads like the instructions say. This removes a sticky film that results from the chemical process of the gel setting under the light. If you don&#x27;t wipe your nails off afterwards, they can smudge a bit. Don&#x27;t worry, after the last time in the light, you will not wipe the polish right off, as long as you followed the instructions exactly. Enjoy your beautiful nails!</li>
    <li> Bought this kit and returned it two weeks later, the first couple days it looks great. Then my nails started to chip and fade. I even tried other polish with the light and it failed miserably. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this set&lt;br /&gt;Made my manicure so much fast and it don&#x27;t have a scent which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Nails were very beautiful but they only lasted 3 days. Not worth it. I have used the kit twice and same thing happened.</li>
    <li> Infra light is good, the base coat and top coat are excellent, color looks nice. The negative part of the product is the remover, its too complicated to use, but beside than that for the quality and brand it worth the price, i would buy it again...</li>
    <li> Nice product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! Work great and quickly. Used for my toes too!</li>
    <li> I loooove this soo much. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.</li>
    <li> Is really really nice!!</li>
    <li> I was leary but did what they instructed and let me tell you. It was  AWESOME!!! I got tons of compliments. The color lasts the full two weeks. and it is a BREEZE to get off if you use the cotton ball and foil trick you will find all over YouTube!!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I applied the polish, I hadn&#x27;t read any tips online and just went by the directions. I got polish on my cuticles and skin, didn&#x27;t wipe my nails with the pads before starting (only washed and dried them) and put on too thick of coats. The polish lasted a couple,days but then started chipping off near the cuticles. The polish stayed on the tips until the very end. The second time I read tips online, including 1) wipe nails with alcohol before starting and after each step 2) don&#x27;t get it near your cuticles 3) polish the tips [but now my tips are super thick because I didn&#x27;t realize I needed to smooth it out before drying] 4) very thin coats. It&#x27;s been over a week and they still look great, but the thick tips still bother me. If they still look good next weekend I&#x27;m going to try filling them instead of full removal. It&#x27;s a long process but even Essie and opi chip off my nails after 3-4 days, so getting two weeks is worth the time! And I love the shine! I recommend searching for tips before using.</li>
    <li> I like the concept and that I can do this at home at a fraction of the cost.  I will say that the polish does not last two weeks like they say.  I can usually get about 5 days before the polish begins to peel.  With that being said the polish should be a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is so easy to use and apply, everything works perfect.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve not had any problem with the light and I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish, however, is terrible!! I can prepare and paint my nails like a professional (I used to be one) and after one day, two nails peeled off. After three days another peeled off and it just kept going like that! I&#x27;ve even re-prepped my nail and put a new coat on. It&#x27;s not lasted the day through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will say that I&#x27;m not a forgiving person when it comes to my nails. I wash dishes, my hair, pull the top of of whatever food product my kids hand to me. However, when I&#x27;ve had the salon do my nails it never came off until I went back and they took it off. No exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you purchase a nice, high wattage light by itself. Then I would suggest you buy the lacquer and top/base coat from a company that&#x27;s known for higher quality product. I would go so far as to say try something at your local big chain beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this item on eBay (lucked out and got it for about $14.99). Well I have only had it on for one day, but so far they still look pretty good. Applying was easy enough although I did run in to a minor problem when I was removing the tacky layer off of the nail after I have cured the top coat; when I wiped down all the nails with the alcohol pad to remove the tacky layer, all of the polish that was on the pinky on my left hand came off. I know that I cured all of the layers and followed all of the instructions to the T. For some reason the polish on my pinky did not cure; I ended up re-painting my pinky (which took only about 3 minutes), and it came out correctly the second time. So far I do like the kit and the polish. I do have to be honest, I do not expect this polish to last on my nails for more than 5 to 7 days tops (I am very rough on my hands and nails). If it does last that long then I will be more than happy since regular polish only last for about a day before it starts to chip and I have to do touch ups. Would I recommend this kit? Yes, only if it was on sale and if you purchased it at a store where you could return it if it does not work out for you.</li>
    <li> This set is amazing, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. The only problem is, when it arrived the acetone gel remover that comes with the set was spilled inside the box and empty. That&#x27;s why I give 4 stars instead of 5</li>
    <li> Great price. Awesome product. It works great!!!</li>
    <li> Was very cautious the first time I applied because there are so many directions, but the process could not be easier and my manicure was perfect for 10 days!</li>
    <li> This gel system is very different from regular nail polish. Once the polish cures and dries, it is has hard and durable as auto paint or the stuff they use to paint stripes on the street. That&#x27;s good. It will withstand a lot of abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caveat: Fingernails are porous and absorb moisture. This means if you have any sort of length of natural nail, if your hands are in water a lot, your nails will become soft and bend. The nail polish does NOT bend. It will separate from your nail.  This won&#x27;t be much of a problem if you do not have long nails or the length of your nails does not extend past your fingertips. If at all possible, do NOT peel off the polish, protect your hands in water with rubber gloves as you would with regular manicures. Follow instructions for removal of the product. It takes a lot of patience and acetone (which is very drying to the surface of the nail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other caveat: If you peel off the nail polish, it will easily come off. It also takes with it several layers of your own natural nail. This creates damage to the nail surface similar to that of acrylics. Prolonged and regular usage of this product will probably damage your nails. Growth of the damage will probably take at least six months or so, depending on how fast your nails grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: It is very fast, very convenient. You can do an entire manicure in less than 15 minutes. It takes about half a day to &amp;#34;cure.&amp;#34; At first the surface will feel &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; and will appear dull. As the material dries, it becomes harder and smoother and shinier and tougher than any regular nail polish. The gel polish dries hard and shiny. It is as tough as they claim.</li>
    <li> After I got a gel manicure for my wedding and it not only lasted a month but was strong and allowed my nails to actually grow, I was excited to buy a kit to do the same thing at home for a fraction of the price. That didn&#x27;t happen. The color chips after a few days and it doesn&#x27;t remotely strengthen my nails. A complete waste of money. Do not recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend, she used it twice, and was in the middle of doing her nails, and the light just stopped working! however, i can&#x27;t seem to find anywhere on amazon that i can return or exchange this item. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I love gel/shellac manicures. The polish lasts about 3 weeks for me before my nails grow out enough that the polish needs changed. I was tired of spending up to $30 for a gel manicure and decided to invest in this relatively inexpensive starter kit. I previously used the Sally Hansen Gel Nail Strips without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product! I found that the polish was easy to apply (easier than regular polish because it&#x27;s thinner and smoother), and the UV lamp works great - even with other UV polish brands (I purchased some OPI). I have no complaints about this product whatsoever! If you&#x27;re a decent nail polish applier, this will work for you. Definitely be sure to remove any nail polish you get on your skin (just leave a little bit of room between the edge of the nail and the skin around your nail) - it&#x27;s easy to remove prior to setting with the UV light. I use soaked cotton balls on my nails wrapped with foil for 15 minutes to remove the polish - comes off easily with this method.</li>
    <li> So far so good, It came right on time, and the minute I got it I did my nails, they came out nice! 👌🏾💅🏾 (red my lips)</li>
    <li> I just did my nails, so no idea how long it will last but the easiness and quickness I&#x27;m already sold! No drying time, I had no issues when it came to peeling or bubbling just follow the directions and it should turn out fine....I love this! Even if it only last half the time it says... It&#x27;s still 6 days longer than usual! Love it!</li>
    <li> I save SOOOO much money doing my own shellac myself instead of paying $30 every two weeks. It certainly doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real professional stuff, but it&#x27;s so convenient and a much better deal.</li>
    <li> Used it twice and then went and bought a better light.  This is okay for a child who wants to play manicure but I don&#x27;t think the light is strong enough to set the gel manicure like the professional lights do.  The polish was nice, ordered the red which covered well.</li>
    <li> this is much cheaper than going out and getting ur nails done every 2 weeks. its convient too. hubby wants to go on a date, great i can paint my nails in 20min their dry and i dont have to worry abotu sticky ness. however it probably only lasts 5-6 days at the MSOT but i must say even when i get htem done at the nail place, they dont last long. im rough on my hands - working in a hospital and gardening - and oily fingers dont help the polish stya on.</li>
    <li> I am a life-long nail biter. With this kit, my nails have never looked better. Of course, my teen age daughters love it, too!</li>
    <li> and it&#x27;s awesome.  really easy to use and last for a couple of weeks.  love the colors and the clear.</li>
    <li> Got this for the girlfriend, she was not happy at first she heard all these things are cheap and dont work.. I said just give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She ended up loving it, she just put it on and they look great. It&#x27;s a process, but lets face it. If you are going to the salon and getting it done, that is a process. To me the nails look nice, they have that shine from the salon. She liked them, only time will tell. I will update when she is further along. Also the LED thing seems sturdy, i put my hand in there and felt the heat. Looked really nice and was  a complete kit</li>
    <li> This product does not work. Lasted 2 days. Waste of money. Do not purchase this product. I going to file a complaint with the BBB. False Advertisement</li>
    <li> Did not like it.  It was OK for it to be sent through the mail, but I could not return it.</li>
    <li> One of the worst products that Sally Hansen has ever made.  It is truly horrible and needs to be off the market.</li>
    <li> How disappointing!  This light does NOT set the polish.  I must have kept my nails, with the FIRST coat, under the lights for 50 cycles (30 seconds each), and they were STILL tacky.  What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The polish and other accessories with this kit were great though, sure would have been pretty if they would have ever set.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy polish and the light from somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are NO returns on this, so make sure you really want to own this before you buy.</li>
    <li> What disappointed me the most was the size of the light.  You can barely get 3 nails under it at a time.  As with always when you try to paint your own nails, it can be a little difficult and it was no different with this.  The color of the polish is very nice however.  I would have rated it higher if the light was more useful.  So...to me it&#x27;s &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Easy to do and just as long-lasting as a salon gel manicure. The kit as sold has the potential for 10 manicures. Additional polishes in several colors are available. Simple, quick, economical, gorgeous color. This set is a winner!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it included everything, but they could&#x27;ve filled up the polishes a little more.  Sally Hansen doesn&#x27;t make the best shellac and the light is a little weak, but it does the job.  I supplemented the polish with gelish and shellac (way better polish).</li>
    <li> I did my first at home gel manicure yesterday. I also gave myself a pedi since it was so easy.  My husband wasn&#x27;t so happy with the mani because it took such a long time.  I cured each step twice and you CAN&#x27;T fit all 5 fingers under the light so you have to do your thumb separately.  That means I had 12 minutes of curing time plus application time...what he didn&#x27;t realize is that the longest part was removing the old gel.&lt;br /&gt;The color is really REALLY red.  I will be buying a different color. I am very hard on my nails, so I will be lucky for this to last a week.  I will publish a follow up.  We have a pool party today and that will be a true test!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I&#x27;m not a regular at nail salons and don&#x27;t normally get my nails done, but thought it was time to shake it up a bit. This Gel kit is super easy and made my nails look like I had them done by a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;.  Co worker had her nails done and paid about 25 bucks at a nail salon, my nails looked better and I can use my kit over again, she&#x27;d have to pay another 25.  Just sayin. And new bottles to go with the kit are easily accessible either here at Amazon or my local CVS store. Which is nice.</li>
    <li> This met all my expectations.  Super easy to use and it last on my nails for st least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This kit is a great deal for what you get. I read mixed reviews about the lamp but I have been using it for 4 months now and have had no issues. The bottom coat is really good, I have used other bottom coats and the color peels off in days. The red color it comes with is a really nice basic red. It can be worn for all occasions. The longest I have had the polish go without chipping is almost 2 weeks. The nails start to grow out before the polish chips. The nice thing about the lamp is you can use it with any other LED polish. There are a lot of brands out there you can get at your local beauty salon. I no longer use the pads the kit came with, I just bought a box of alcohol swipes for $2 and it works just as well.</li>
    <li> If you apply shellac the way you do normal polish, you&#x27;re lucky if it stays on for a full day. However, if you apply shellac exactly as the directions tell you to, it can stay on for usually 2 to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was exactly what it was advertised to be, and overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product pretty skeptical about how well gel nails really worked. ESP this one. I thot 30 seccond curing? Yea rt well see. But this is by far the best my nails have ever looked like ever! I am sooo excited about this. I do my nails all the time bc theyre always chipping after doing dishes and things like that. But these last forever no matter what u do and it comes with super easy instructions.Anybody can do this and its super quick to do. Im telling everyone to get one of these its worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> I use this product a lot and so far I have loved it special when it comes to little girls hand it&#x27;s really</li>
    <li> I hate to sit at the salon and have my nails done and this works just like salon shellac.  Love it because I can do my nails whenever I want to with no witing or appointment.</li>
    <li> I like this gel, and the color is red ,I tried some others  it didn&#x27;t work this is better</li>
    <li> Purchased in July as an experiment.  Had gel nails done in a salon and they lasted 4 weeks.  This lasted two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, invest in a better brand, or have them done professionally.</li>
    <li> So simple and such great results! Follow directions and get a flawless manicure every time. You need to somehow label your gel and top coat bottle Cuz once you open bottles the 1,2,&amp;3 steps are gone.</li>
    <li> Great price, cheaper than any other place.&lt;br /&gt;The gel nail polish lasts about a week but I like the fact that is very easy to remove.</li>
    <li> The two glitter gels turned out to be colorless, like clear nail polish with some glitter in it.  Want my money back!</li>
    <li> This product has been by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I am leaving this review to warn others about possible similar future reactions to this product. Unlike other Sallie Hansen products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, this one was absolutely horrible. The experience: Wanting to go with the trend of trying out at-home do it yourself gel nailkit, I was excited to give this a try. First bad experience was the gel polish. It was so liquidy it literally ran right off my fingernails like water, running all down my fingers. I shook the polish prior too and I also tried applying a second coat. Instead. I had to wipe my hands clean off this runny mess! After finally getting the polish to stick a little bit to my nails I proceeeded with the top coat and then cured everything under the lamp. Following instructions I kept my nails under the light for the time describled in the instructions or rather till the light went off before proceeding to the next nail.&lt;br /&gt;I immediatly noticed my nails stinging while keeping them under the lamp. What followed next, was a nightmare I never want to go through. The gel polish products have some kind of substance in it that made me wake up the next day with my fingers brake out covered in all these little blisters itching like as if they have gotten bit by a thousand fire ants and some off my fingernails lifted off my nailbed. It was extremely painful and after 2 days off being in severe pain and symptoms not subsiding, I had to go to the dermatologist who had to put me on steroids and anti-histamine blocker to stop the allergic reaction from spreading, which by now had also developed on my neck which I had touched with my hands and in order to heal this. 5 days later, the blisters went away but my fingers were peeling like a snake shedding skin. 4 weeks later everything has healed but I made the stupid mistake off using the top coat again which I thought was ok to use and I started breaking out again and had to go back to anti-histamine blocker and made me realize that BOTH coats included in the kit had a very bad chemical that my body didn&#x27;t agree with, as well as the UV lamp who burned the nails off my nailbed. Never again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definetely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone and I am upset that I spent alnmost 50 dollars only to put my health in danger and having to spend more money on dermatologist and medicine. Sallie Hansen needs to know about what this product can do to people! Also, who wants a polish that is so thin that it runs right off your nails???</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter - she loves it.  Be sure to apply the polishes as directed and &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; your nails as directed.</li>
    <li> I love this because I can have professionally looking done nails at home! Now if I could just paint them like a professional!</li>
    <li> I just finished my first manicure with this set, and am beyond thrilled with the results! Application was very straight forward. The directions are very straight-forward, just make sure you follow them completely! While the process was a bit more time consuming than a traditional manicure, I was able to immediately resume my normal activities without a single dent or smudge. I will be interested to see how long my manicure lasts, but have high hopes given prior reviews.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stay on for two weeks for me.  but it does for my daugher. so i got her one also</li>
    <li> Super easy to use, with great results! Follow the instructions to the letter, though. My only displeasure is that the bottles aren&#x27;t labeled, and the caps are all the same color, so make sure you note which one is #1, #2 or #3 as you take the cap wrapping off!</li>
    <li> has been saving me over $60 every two weeks and stays on so many compliments</li>
    <li> This kit is fairly easy to use as long as you take your time to apply the product correctly and precisely. I followed all the instructions included and my nails came out great! And best of all they stay chip-free, so far for more than a week! This kit will pay for itself in just a few uses compared to a salon manicure, which I also like. However, this product on Amazon is currently more than double than what I payed at Target (about 60$) for the exact same thing! Don&#x27;t get ripped off!</li>
    <li> this would be a great item if it came with a better plug.  fell apart after 1st use.</li>
    <li> Buy this for lamp, get nail polish somewhere else.  Ulta has the best!</li>
    <li> First time use was rough...after that it was smooth sailing. I love it.  My nails look fabulous and they are long lasting</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the light, the polish, or both. I can&#x27;t get this stuff to stay on for a full week. Within a few days it starts chipping and peels off.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I was very skeptical about purchasing this kit. I usually get my gel nail done every two weeks but I was tired of giving away my money within two weeks the polish would chip I&#x27;d have to go back to the salon. I am not at all disappointed with this purchase. The left photo is when I first polished my nails and toes and the second photo is two weeks later. Before purchasing I read other reviews and some had problems with the polish chipping. I too had a couple of chips here and there but nothing major. Please keep in my job requires a lot of typing and my nails did not chip from it. I would highly recommend leaving your nails under the LED light for at least 90 seconds and not 30 seconds as instructed. The polish texture is absolutely wonderful even if you aren&#x27;t a pro at painting your own nails it still looks good. Since my purchase I recently bought another Sally Hensen gel polish at Target and I love it as well, works the same. The only down side is the process would take half the time if there were two LED lights instead of one but I can&#x27;t complain for the money I&#x27;m saving. For anyone who&#x27;s looking to save money I would highly recommend you purchase the kit. Follow the instructions and don&#x27;t cut corners ( leave nails under light at least 90 seconds each time) and you will love it as well.</li>
    <li> The light is a little small but it works fine.</li>
    <li> The lamp has 6 LED lights, but 3 of them don´t turn on, so I can´t cure the complete hand at the same time.</li>
    <li> Would prefer to get all 5 digits done at once but that&#x27;s my only complaint at this time. Beats going to the salon and the time involved with that, not to mention the cost. Will be looking for another color to alternate with the red.</li>
    <li> Great kit, but the polishes are really tiny and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last for more than a couple of manicures, but the lamp is good and it&#x27;s what I was looking for - good small lamp ;)</li>
    <li> Works very well have used it several times. Price is very well worth it. Would have given 5 stars except that the gel has a tendency to peel off after about a week whereas the salon gel does not. Still it has paid for itself considering what I spend at the salon to have them done once.</li>
    <li> So my wife was tired of painting her nails and waiting for hours for them to dry. She didn&#x27;t want to go to the salon all the time or for that matter, pay the price of the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were a little skeptical (at first), but she&#x27;s hooked after her first use. She gets about a week (by her reports) out of each application, which is shorter than what &amp;#34;they say&amp;#34; but still perfectly acceptable and on par with what she gets from the salon when she goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the husband&#x27;s perspective -- this kit is pretty awesome. A few coats, a few seconds under the included light, and despite her complaint that it can get a &amp;#34;little hot&amp;#34; -- she&#x27;s done in only a few minutes, doesn&#x27;t stink up the whole house, and she&#x27;s thrilled with the results. That makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: The colors can be bought locally or here on Amazon, but we found that you can buy small bulk lots (3 or so colors, top coats, whatever you need) on eBay for a substantially lower price than most other places. Take a look, your results might be different but she&#x27;s gotten a ton of colors since buying the kit and she&#x27;s thrilled with the convenience, the color choices and of course -- the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one final note, a friend of ours had purchased a $150+ salon nail kit that she was happy with. She&#x27;s not anymore when she found out that this does every bit as good of a job, and costs a tiny fraction of that. Food for thought...</li>
    <li> This worked great, and was fast and easy to use. It&#x27;s exactly like a salon. Like others say, run your thumb around the cuticle before curing if polish leaks off the nail to clean it up and make it more secure. Two weeks later and it looked awesome. I did it on my fingernails and toes. The red in the starter kit was perfect, I have pale skin and reds are tricky for me but this one was great. Best of all, I used the light with other (cheaper) brands of gel polish and had no problems, which means more choices too. I&#x27;m really happy I bought this and it will save tons of money overall. The polish was also easy to remove and didn&#x27;t cause any damage, and the light seems study.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is a game-changer for me.  I never used to bother painting my nails, because it would chip in one or two days, so it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  The first time I used this kit, the manicure lasted 2-1/2 weeks.  After 7 days I got one tiny chip, and then not another chip until 7 more days later.  I had a few chips when I removed the polish, but the main reason I needed a new manicure was because of nail growth.  I read a lot of reviews before buying this product, and even watched a you-tube video on how to apply.  I followed the directions for application to a T (and it took me about an hour to complete the manicure).  To remove the polish, I bought pure acetone nail polish remover and soaked my hand in it (one at a time) until the polish just lifted off, and then I used an orange stick to gently scrape it off.  It was very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also amazed at how beautiful and shiny the polish looked. The &amp;#34;Red My Lips&amp;#34; color was very pretty, and I after using that I bought the Pink Pong color and that color was very nice as well - an opaque puddy-pink color (very neutral and sophisticated).  I also think using this polish is strengthening my nails because of the layer of gel protection while they grow.  I love this product and am recommending it to all my friends and fellow working moms.</li>
    <li> Better than expected, i regret not getting into gel nails sooner</li>
    <li> The product works great, once you get the hang of applying it (be very sure not to leave any on your skin when you cure it or the polish will peel off quickly).  Unfortunately, the price here on amazon is about twice the price at target.  It&#x27;s $59.99 there, and currently (december 8, 2012) more than $100 on amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, for mother&#x27;s day. She&#x27;s a little OCD with her nails (as far as chipping goes), so I thought this would be perfect for her - making the polish last longer. She loves it, but said that when she uses it...if by some chance she gets the polish on her skin, and tries to remove it, it usually peels off the polish from the nail as well. Kind of a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She still uses it all the time, and for a home manicure/curing set it&#x27;s pretty decent. And it doesn&#x27;t take long to do at all so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
