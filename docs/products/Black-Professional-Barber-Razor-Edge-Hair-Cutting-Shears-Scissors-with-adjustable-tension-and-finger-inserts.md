<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Great product.I have only used once so far but seem very sharp.I am not a professional hair person but these work very well . I like the black color.I would recommend these to any home users.</li>
    <li> Scissors comes with a  leather case and appears well made.  I have used it twice to trim my mustache and I have no complaints.  The nomenclature &amp;#34;Razor Edge&amp;#34; may be an exaggeration, though I find the item sufficiently sharp for my purposes.  In my estimate, one needs a longer pair to trim the hair on the head.</li>
    <li> good scissors -- fast service.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. I love these scissors for trimming hair.</li>
    <li> Much better than the previous brand I purchased on Amazon. You can tell this is professional quality from the first use.</li>
    <li> I groomed my dog and trimmed my daughter&#x27;s hair and they were great.  However I looked at them this morning after my boyfriend cut his sons&#x27; hair and they came loose in the middle.  I tightened them as best I could.  I hope it worked long term...disappointed</li>
    <li> Very sharp scissors perfect for cutting hair</li>
    <li> For the price they seam to be cheap , they don&#x27;t seam to make a clean cut , tend to pull the hair and not cut all</li>
    <li> Scissors were as advertised, very sharp and appear to be well made, I bought them for personal use and they are a great buy for that. I had to remove the finger inserts so my fingers would fit. Very happy with the scissors so far.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair because I never like how they cut it at the salon. I love these scissors! They definitely get the job done. I read in reviews before I bought them that some people had trouble fitting their fingers in them so I was nervous because I have bigger fingers but they fit me just fine. They also come with a nice storage case. Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Lets you cut with more detail</li>
    <li> My husband bought this scissors for me. I was trying to find a good pair of hair scissors to cut my bad tips (Obsessed with that) and finally I got a good one. This pair of scissors are really good. I will totally recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> A quality product, Sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got my hands all black from the color. Couldn&#x27;t even use.</li>
    <li> Bought a few pair of barber scissors, and these are by far my favorite. Not sure about the case... I don&#x27;t use it. But I like the scissors.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but after looking at other reviews,  I decided to try them out. They arrived before their scheduled time, and they work great for me. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is that they have a pink rhinestone in them. In the picture they don&#x27;t show it, but hey, it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Almost razor sharp scissors, excellent tools for cutting hair.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  until my son borrowed to cut paper...</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  They are very sharp and comfortable on my fingers.  The price was great.</li>
    <li> These scissors are great! They cut hair very well and are very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Came in lovely case too</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift and they said they were very happy with the quality of the product!</li>
    <li> Nice design and sharpness.  Works just fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these to trim my natural hair. I LOVE THEM! They are amazing and you can&#x27;t beat that price for shears of this caliber. They may not be ideal for a male because they have a pink gem on them and the handle is sparkly but I love them. They are so sharp also. My husband uses them also to cut his chin hair. They made a clean cut and comes in a nice black leather case. I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied!</li>
    <li> Work exceptionally well. Very sharp, snips hair with ease and fingers as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent scissors....use them to groom the dogs.  No more hair in their eyes.  Wish I had them years ago.</li>
    <li> These shears are a great deal for the price! They fit perfect in my hand and are super sharp. My only complaint is I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks now and the black is starting to rub off around the finger holes.</li>
    <li> Great scissors better price  A must have in your house! Comes with a nice case and cuts perfectly. Has two inserts for little fingers, too.</li>
    <li> Amazingly good scissors!  Very sharp and do a great job.</li>
    <li> I got both 5.5 and 6.5. Shipping was fast! The scissors are very sharp. I use them daily styling hair. On the 6.5 toward tip was a tool mark that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t effect the cutting. Have been using these for over a month, they are holding the edge nicely. Best scissors for the money. Not sure why there are negative reviews these scissors are sharp. I am waiting to see how they sharpen.</li>
    <li> The scissors are very sharp and cut hair with ease! Very impressed so far - I&#x27;ve only used them twice:).</li>
    <li> Excellent hair trimming scissors at an excellent price!</li>
    <li> compared to the scissors my wife used before these are a game changer. She was able to cut cleanly and quickly through hair with smooth cutting They are extremely sharp, and opening and closing the is incredibly smooth because of the Teflon used to reduce friction in the scissors. Great Great Product cant stress that enough.  Thanks utopia care</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Scissor great for the price and arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price, thanks.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed.  Comfortable in hand and razor sharp.  Versatile enough and fit my wife&#x27;s hands well enough for good control.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase. It was a waste! I needed a temporary pair of shears until my new ones arrived. Even taking smaller sections at a time, it still folded the hairs and didn&#x27;t cut precisely.</li>
    <li> Never using cheap scissors again !!! I am no professional but these are AMAZING! I use to cut and style my human hair wigs.</li>
    <li> Love these shears! I cut a few of my friends hair, and it works very well. Much better than the kit scissors I had before.</li>
    <li> I Use it on a 5 and 10yo.  Nice sharp set.  It operates smooth with a good cut.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> we are not hair dressers. only people that want very good scissors so my wife can cut my hair at a good price. this are very good hair cutting scissors that look great also. the best price on amazon and maybe the best scissors also. very well made so we can put in our backpack and travel the world for the next few years and cut our own hair</li>
    <li> Perfect for my beard and sharp as hell awsome scissors</li>
    <li> The best part is how smooth these are. They have a nice robust feel with an almost effortless squeeze of the fingers to cut. FYI - I am not a stylist or know anything about cutting hair. Just know a good product when I see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My first review was in March 2014, now its Feb 2016. I still have the same pair and still satisfied for how well they&#x27;ve kept their sharpness. My wife has used this to cut wrapping paper and I continue to cut my own hair without fail. The blade at the tip has dulled slightly, but its still manageable. But to spend $12 for something that has lasted 3 yrs...cant beat that.</li>
    <li> Great sharp scissors! I will be able to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair much better than using the ones I purchased from Target. It seems like pretty good quality for in-home use.</li>
    <li> Only got to use once so far, and briefly at that, so is really hard to say anything for sure, BUT, it did seem a whole lot better then the old pair I just pitched. This is why I like to wait a bit for reviews. So for now, I am giving the 5star.</li>
    <li> Great super sharp sicssors&lt;br /&gt;A real bargain. Would order again!</li>
    <li> First set was useless. Bent hair not cut it. Refund was good and quick. Purchased 2 more that work well. Keep the 9.99 price point. I will buy more as they wear out. I&#x27;d rather by 10 10dollar shears than 1 100 dollar shears to be resharpened.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery could be quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Johnny The Barber&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Great pair of shears to have. Used while I was in cosmetology and they were realy great compared to the kit shears.</li>
    <li> Does the job, great price.</li>
    <li> Super sharp and perfect for trimming hair at home.</li>
    <li> Our old hair trimming scissors (they were expensive) had begun to fail to cut well.  So I looked for a replacement, and found these at a price which would probably be cheaper than resharpening.  These scissors glide through loose fine hair very easily.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. The scissor is okay but the black case is not well made. It looks ugly and cheap. Overall 4 stars</li>
    <li> I love these scissors! I ordered them because I lost my other pair while moving and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I use them for trimming split ends, but these could definitely be used for regular hair cuts. They&#x27;re sharp, they come with their own little case and they fit my fingers perfectly. I will say if you have large fingers these won&#x27;t work for you and they have a small pink gem on them so obviously they weren&#x27;t meant for men. These are unbeatable for the price and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The scissors are cheap, arrived quickly, and are of good quality. The pink/glittery &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; accent is cute, and the scissors DO come with a case and glittery rubber insets.  Very nice, would recommend~ ^.^</li>
    <li> Great, professional scissors at a fantastic price!  Would rank them right up there with much more expensive scissors!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a scissors to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair and this one works perfect and the case is very usefull.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional hairdresser by any means, but these scissors seem to work very well. I recently started cutting my husband&#x27;s hair and these are comfortable to hold and cut easily. He even says his hair feels softer when he runs his hand through it. As an amateur, I am very satisfied, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. Cut well, seam durable, and nice case.</li>
    <li> Smooth, tight, quiet.....sharp. They look good as well, and come with a nice case. Hard to go wrong at this price-point.</li>
    <li> The product was as described and worked well for me.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Good quality for price.  Great for trimming around ears.</li>
    <li> For 30 years I used to own slim, thin, sharp barber shears made by Kayser from Solingen Germany. (Google it!)&lt;br /&gt;By mistake while flying, I had placed them in my hand carried bag and it was confiscated at a cursed TSA check point.  I am sure a TSA agent is enjoying using them!&lt;br /&gt;I found these at Amazon and they fill the bill, though they are not as thin as the ones I lost!  :o(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional stylist or anything, I just needed a good pair of scissors for when I trimmed my hair. Theses are great, easy to use and very sharp. So sharp that I accidentally sliced my finger open while digging through my bag for something, I didn&#x27;t put them back in the case. Bled profusely for a whole day, was afraid I might need stitches. Be careful while using these.</li>
    <li> I just used these scissors yesterday and they’re the best scissors I’ve ever owned!  The scissors come in a nice black pouch which is not real leather but it’s still very nice.  The scissors are sharp and they cut easily!  I absolutely love them and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, good quality for the price, wife (my barber) says they cut well without pulling.....nice product!</li>
    <li> Very nice product!  Just used them on my daughter&#x27;s hair and they are great!</li>
    <li> I just cut my husband&#x27;s hair with these scissors.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I have never had scissors cut hair so easily.  They were always shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly.  Scissors came in a nice carry case.  My wife tried them and loved how they cut.  We have only had for a short time, so hopefully they will last.  So far, we are pleased with our purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and sharpness! Love them!</li>
    <li> I love it.. I have really long and thick hair...I ordered this shear for me...and when I saw it, honestly thought it would not work in me.. I was surprised when i used!!!the cut its clean and surprisingly accurate and confortable to use thanks to the silicone cover on the part of the fingers!That is comfortable and aesthetically chick... and it comes with a cute blak case... for protection ... very easy to carry wherever you want without any hazard!! And the most important!!the price is great...!!! its a very good product for the price!! La recomiendo! :)</li>
    <li> These scissors are so great! I was so excited about receiving them in the mail. They cut my hair without the hassle and such precision. Overall, this was a great by; I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great scissors, great price.  Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Scissors are sharp, easy to handle and in a nice case.  Nothing not to like about these.</li>
    <li> The grind wasn&#x27;t perfect near the tip, and simply wouldn&#x27;t cut hair-  But, on a positive note, my money was refunded...</li>
    <li> Love these. I saved money doing myself</li>
    <li> The scissors are great! The holes are a little small with the plastic/rubber spacers in there, so I just popped them out and now they&#x27;re perfect. Super sharp and cut really well. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought these JUST for trimming my mustache.  They trim it better than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Really smooth cutting and motion created with these let you do precision work.</li>
    <li> Super Sharp, excellent quality, may buy a second one for a gift.  You won&#x27;t be sorry for this purchase</li>
    <li> Great Product! Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Great scissors comes in a nice little case</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Does nice haircut...good price &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Very impressed it cuts smooth. Comes with a a case which is also nice. Well worth the price. It is sharp for razoring ends too.</li>
    <li> Perfection!!! Looks very professional and cuts perfectly.  I know they probably will not stay sharp for long but for the price, you can not be them! So I bought 2!</li>
    <li> I needed a good pair of scissors and was hoping that this was it. Doing a test cut on my own hair, the scissors don&#x27;t really cut but more close and pull the hair out of my head. A little disappointed but they look very nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect! exactly what I ordered/needed</li>
    <li> Great product with great service.</li>
    <li> Great scissors, SUPER sharp. Case is nice too.</li>
    <li> These shears are decent. I don&#x27;t believe they willstay sharp that long but they are nice. The case is great.</li>
    <li> Scissors are sharp, with a nice sturdy feel to them. They are black in color, the weight is comparable to other hair scissors I&#x27;ve used, and they have a finger rest on one finger hole.  The finger holes have removable rubber inserts to accommodate larger/smaller fingers. There is a small cushion between the finger holes which keeps the metal from rubbing. The scissors come with a black zippered vinyl case, with cushioned interior and elastic bands to hold scissors in place. I&#x27;ve already used the scissors to trim my bangs and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought these scissors to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  They come with a lovely case, useful for when we&#x27;re traveling.  The blades are sharp and the whole package is attractive.</li>
    <li> Love them :-)  fast delivery and awesome product</li>
    <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the black paint rubs off of the blades, but they cut well and feel good in the hand.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and and liked what i read. The cosmetic appearance of these scissor is not bad, but the performance was HORRIBLE! They were dull as can be, the hair folds right down beween the blades and they will not cut the hair. the scissors are useless! I guess you get what you pay for. you buy cheap you get cheap. Have to purchase a new pair, else where. I can&#x27;t even pay to have them properly sharpened unless I send out to have it don&#x27;t and that will cost me more than the scissors itself.  Too bad cause I liked the look of these. The feel of these in the hand is very awkward too. The structural design doesn&#x27;t fit with me. Just very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Thin, slim, sharp and very nice color. I also liked that it came with its own case. The only issue I have is the Removable rubber inserts coming out.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much! I really like these; black is a great color. The packaging is extraordinary and it shipped very fast. Gets the job done; very sharp. Great Price! For occasional trimmings and overall if you want to cut your own hair. I do. My hair is long, thick, and very wavy/curly and these were great for cutting my hair. Many people do not know how to cut curly hair and all I would get were split ends from people not knowing how to cut my hair. So I cut started cutting my own hair. I create layers and mold my hair the way I want it. Great product. Great price. You won&#x27;t regret getting some of these. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality.  Much much better than the &amp;#34;hair scissors&amp;#34; I picked up at Target for a similar price.</li>
    <li> Received the shipment very fast.  They look nice a little heavy.  I like the case. .  I have not used them yet, so I cannot comment on the quality.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the scissors, originally purchased two pair, for myself and grandson, recently purchased third pair for my granddaughter. We are all happy customers. Great quality for the price, the zipper case a bonus, very sharp and quick shipping. Would recommend to anyone that trims or prefers to cut their own hair, no more uneven ends.</li>
    <li> Yes the scissors where just as described and were great quality and sharp. I was impressed and they seemed professional. My wife even liked them.</li>
    <li> Nice scissors, the case is a bonus, they did a great job for cutting my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I used the scissors 3 times and they fell apart in my hands. They literally came apart. The blades seem dull because they are very painful if cutting your hair low. Terrible pair of scissors. Look elsewhere. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> They work well.  I am happy  with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Pretty much as expected - they work well - seller was on time and description is accurate.  Comes in a nice case.</li>
    <li> Scissors work great. A very good deal</li>
    <li> I was worried from some of the reviews that it wouldn&#x27;t fit my average-sized male fingers, but even without removing the inserts in the fingerholes they work fine. (When cutting hair you only want to use your fingertips anyway.) Removing the little rubber inserts makes the holes even larger, for those with larger fingertips.</li>
    <li> Great product, and excellent seller!!!</li>
    <li> My dog ate some and it died.  Too much automated email&#x3D;an automated crap review.</li>
    <li> I tried running with them, I think they made me run faster</li>
    <li> Awesome, sharp and precise.  You will definitely get your moneys worth with these.</li>
    <li> Perfectly sharp with a precision cut.  I cut my own hair in small increments between professional salon visits...e.g. bangs, sides, etc.  So they were a great addition to my home beauty tools.</li>
    <li> These shears were purchased as a gift.  They were very sharp, but the tips did not overlap properly.  About a half inch from the very ends, she had trouble actually cutting.  Unfortunately that&#x27;s where all of the detail work is done.  Her comment was, &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t even dropped them, yet.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m not sure if it was a shipping problem or a manufacturing problem.</li>
    <li> Good product. I&#x27;m. 100% satisfied</li>
    <li> The scissors arrived on time in a really nice storage case. They are very comfortable to use. The finger inserts really do make them comfortable for small or larger fingers. I cut my own hair and while I can&#x27;t afford to invest in outrageously priced scissors I am always looking for better and better quality because it makes a difference. These were the perfect balance. Excellent quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> my hands still waffled at the hair while cutting.</li>
    <li> Perfect scissor!! very sharp and fit my fingers.</li>
    <li> product exactly as described. Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy. Used last night for first time and was throughly impressed.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller! A+++</li>
    <li> These work well!  No more expensive trims...I can dust my ends at home when needed</li>
    <li> Scissors are great, sharp and easy to handle especially for someone like me who likes to keep ends trimmed.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Nice, quality shears with case.</li>
    <li> They cut like a dream. Not for salon use, but for the price, they&#x27;re amazing. Definitely using for all of my family and friend at-home clientele.</li>
    <li> VERY high quality scissors. I love them!!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am a barber with a busy shop and have been very pleased with the quality and recommend them for anyone</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband who cuts his own hair. Very nice and sharp for the price. Only downside is I did not notice the glitter and sparkle and pink stone thing on them when I found these and bought them on my tablet, they looked solid black. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought them if I had noticed that. So needless to say we were very surprised when they arrived and were pretty girly. But they are just for cutting hair so he doesn&#x27;t have to look at them very long. I actually think it annoys me more than him. Maybe make ones all in black for the men out there who are using them.</li>
    <li> I am cutting my own hair about once a month. It does a good job and is very sharp. Just what I needed for a quick trim in between salon visits.</li>
    <li> Great shears. Has good grip. Nice and sharp. Does a great job. Timely shipping. Would like to see other products. Like razors! And different size swivel style.</li>
    <li> For the money, they are a really good pair of scissors.  Work great, cut my own hair and trimmed my wife&#x27;s hair.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Light and sharp but a bit too short for my liking</li>
    <li> Nice pair of scissors for hair cutting.  Smooth and sharp blades and feel very comfortable in your hands.  Cuts hair so easily and precise.</li>
    <li> After years of useing the wrong type of scissors to cut hair, it is so nice to these new one.  I would difinitely buy from Utopia Care again.</li>
    <li> These were delivered SO SO fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The case is great and they fit nicely. I saw a few reviews complaining about them being too small. But I have to think those people fingers must have been too fat because I had no problem with them whatsoever</li>
    <li> I ordered these hair cutting scissors because the ones I originally picked out weren&#x27;t available with super saver shipping. I&#x27;m glad, because these scissors are GREAT! Super sharp and stylish, they&#x27;re even better looking and working than I expected. And the leather case is a full zippered case, not a little sleeve like I expected.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get much out of these based on the low price, but I was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve been using these scissors to trim my beard for the past week or two. It cuts pretty well and are a nice size. I also like the black matte-like finish. Only a few instances of the scissors pulling a hair or two, but again, for the price I don&#x27;t have much to complain about. They also came in a nice carrying case.</li>
    <li> These are nice scissors.  They are really sharp and make it easy to cut hair.  They come in their own case.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not as long as I like my barber Scissors but I still like them Sharp</li>
    <li> Very nice at any price. That these are a good value us even better!</li>
    <li> Used these to clip my dog...did well until they started to dull.. thought it was a little early to dull but did sharpen them and they are ok</li>
    <li> This is a review of someone who is not a hair stylist, or owned any similar scissors before. I honestly have nothing to compare these with, but they are very sharp.  I bought them to trim my 10 year old&#x27;s hair. She only wants 1/2 inch trimmed every time I take her to a salon, and I&#x27;m sick of shelling out $35+tips for that every 3 months.  Not to diminish the work of hairdressers, but I haven&#x27;t gotten a raise in 4 years at my job so every penny counts.  Anyway as I was saying, the scissors are very sharp, and it was a breeze to cut hair with.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, so can&#x27;t speak of long term usability/durability.  Came with a neat black case too. Overall, unbeatable for the price!</li>
    <li> Great transaction and product.  I would buy from again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> It is great, doing it&#x27;s job very good. I am looking for 5.5&amp;#34; from this brand, is there any?</li>
    <li> I love these scissors, they are very sharp and did a great job - the scissors did a great job, I didn&#x27;t do so great cutting my own hair :-)</li>
    <li> Best hair cutting scissors I have owned. This is not my profession, but these are one of the most efficient tools.</li>
    <li> It cut hair pretty good but I can&#x27;t get the trim close to the corners of the ear because the edges of the scissor is not pointed enough to do the hard edges good if you want to have a square edges look in the back.</li>
    <li> These are very nice looking scissors and cut very well.  They are an excellent value. They come in their own zipper case.</li>
    <li> These scissors feel and cut great. The zipper pouch they come in is really handy too. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> came quickly; highest quality</li>
    <li> pretty good scissors!  it would be better if they had a sharpener to accompany.  pretty good purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> I love these scissors. The grip is rubbery and gives you full control of them. They also cut very well.</li>
    <li> I really like the shears they come very sharp and smooth opening and closing them . only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was the it is a barbers shears and it has a pink gem stone on the pivot screw. and they could be a little more ergonomically, but other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> i use these to trim my own hair. so far so good, works great for my intended uses.</li>
    <li> Excellent pair of scissors! They&#x27;re sharp and have a good feel in the hand.</li>
    <li> Nice . Really sharp Great for the money.</li>
    <li> These scissors are extremely sharp and great quality. It even comes with a pouch to help protect them for as long as possible.</li>
    <li> Nice hair scissors. They work well for me and do what I need. The rubber rings inside the handle holes may fall out but go back in really easily.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Nice scissors at a great price.</li>
    <li> damn nice scissors. I&#x27;m not a pro, just a beardy man. They work well trimming my fur!</li>
    <li> Really lousy product...didnt cut at all, as if they&#x27;ve been used for a long time...</li>
    <li> The scissors:  The balance on the actual scissors themselves are good, my only dislike was the size of the finger holes.  I&#x27;m a man with long slender fingers and it felt rather tight.  This may be because of the added rubber cushioning in the ring which is horribly decorated with sparkles.  The same sparkle design appears on the red cap where the two blades are screwed together.  For a plain black scissor it&#x27;s a very cheapening design.  The actual metal itself is decent for the price you&#x27;re paying.  It&#x27;s not meant to last several years, but instead only 3-4 at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery:  I received the package in a cushioned Utopia case (vendor name).  The scissors themselves were damaged.  The blade had a small dent caused from using it to cut another object which matched or was harder than the actual metal itself.  This made closing or snipping with the scissors not fluid.  When I filed for a return, I found that I had to pay for the return.  Having come in a plastic sleeve bag which I had to cut open to take out the dam product, my total cost to return it came out to $4.80 which included a new bag and shipping.  This means I just lost out on 34.3% of my purchase price on the account of the vendor&#x27;s incompetence.  Needless to say, it wasn&#x27;t entirely the product which was terrible but rather the vendor.</li>
    <li> They are good shears, recommend to anyone trying to get decent scissors for a low price!</li>
    <li> I purchased these scissors after years of using scissors I bought at the drugstore.  I wish I had discovered Utopia&#x27;s sooner.  I have been cutting my hair for years and had no idea that using these professional shears would make the job so much easier and faster.  The scissors cut quietly, smoothly, quickly and do not snag like the ones from the drugstore -- and all for a very reasonable price.  They arrived in a very nice case.  I am very satisfied with this product and plan to use it for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I did some reading of the reviews for these scissors before I bought them. Didn&#x27;t come across any that stated the black rubs off when it comes into contact with skin, but that&#x27;s what happened, it may stop after so many uses, but I won&#x27;t find out, because I can&#x27;t use them. Cons: The blades are not aligned, and pull the hair instead of cutting it. Attempted to tighten them, but couldn&#x27;t. So, now they&#x27;re just cluttering up my counter until I either get them fixed or decide to return them. Pros: They fit my hand well, and were comfy for the short while I tried to use them.</li>
    <li> Scissors were of superior quality and came in a cool case.</li>
    <li> I like it. It cuts well enough for trim and touch ups. It came with a case to store and carry it, which I did not expect, and is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the positive reviews and considering the price, I ordered two which was a double mistake because these scissors are junk!&lt;br /&gt;Even the tensing adjustment is junk!&lt;br /&gt;I have been cutting my hair for decades now and these scissors neither cut at the tip nor in the middle but rather yank my hair as I attempt to cut.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how awful they are.&lt;br /&gt;Who sharpens these things anyway?&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER recommend these to anyone even for cutting paper!</li>
    <li> Good as any scissors I&#x27;ve used. would recommend these</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had them long, but so far so good. There&#x27;s little sparkles in the black handle part.</li>
    <li> Absolutely marvelous!!</li>
    <li> Worked well for 3 weeks, then started. tube in the hair.</li>
    <li> These are definitely well built scissors.  They are nice to the touch and look great, however, they are a little bit heavy.  Overall, I would recommend them.</li>
