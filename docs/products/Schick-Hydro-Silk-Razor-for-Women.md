<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this razor.  So gentle--it gets the job done but you can barely feel it.  The only downside is that the handle gets gunky inside the clear part after a while.  You can&#x27;t clean it because it&#x27;s on the inside, but it looks gross, so you will have to replace it every 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> Sensitive skin here, checking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched over from the Venus Pro-Skin (which I&#x27;ve been using for the past year) because I was having issues with more cuts, razor burn, pimples on my legs, and random rashes (particularly behind my knees). Now, not all of this can necessarily be contributed to the switch, I&#x27;m sure; buuuut, I can say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is definitely a smoother--and closer--shave...without the cuts.&lt;br /&gt;2. The lotioned strips are much better for my sensitive skin than the (seemingly frangranced) soap of the Venus as well--just in general, and I&#x27;m experiencing decidedly less razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;3. The rash behind my knee has disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have had is getting the razor attached. With the Venus, even if the head was taken out of the packaging it could be easily and safely attached without risk of cutting myself. Which the Schick, lacking the flared based where the razor attaches, I almost sliced my fingers to ribbons when I thoughtlessly took the new razor head out of the individual wrapper before attaching it. Easily avoided, though.</li>
    <li> really helps with razor burn but they don&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Every woman should use these.  Thirty plus years of shaving pits and legs have never been so easy.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever found.  It gives a close shave without any irritation.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I live in a very dry climate. This razor helps take the pain out of shaving and keeps the burn to a bare minimum.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from being a BZZ agent, and it is the most amazing razor EVER..  It doesn&#x27;t feel like you are even shaving at all but it is doing it&#x27;s job. you could even shave with just water if you wanted to( I tried it), it doesn&#x27;t leave those nasty razor burns all over your legs and under arms.. I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this hydro silk line of razors.  And they just glide on the skin and remove the hair without one even realizing it.  It makes for a very smooth shave.  And it just feels so good.  I won&#x27;t shave with anything else after using this line of razors.</li>
    <li> This is the bomb! I didn&#x27;t have to go over and over my hair to shave it unlike other razors. Plus, it&#x27;s non-disposable, so all you need to do is buy a razor head.I got this for free from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> Omg i love the shick hydro silk i received it by being a bzzagent and nothing else comes close I love the smooth feeling no cuts or nicks I don&#x27;t use any other razor now thanks shick</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a part of a BzzCampaign to try and then review.  I absolutely LOVE it!  It gives me a nice close, shave with no razor bumps or redness.  I have sensitive skin so that is important to me.  I also like how it has its own moisturizer so that if you don&#x27;t have enough shaving cream in one spot you don&#x27;t have to worry!</li>
    <li> I liked how this razor got my legs extremely smooth. The handle was also comfortable in my hands and didn&#x27;t slip out. I would recommend this razor to everyone for the smoothest legs they will ever have.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzz Campaign. I LOVE this razor! Before I would buy whatever one was on sale but this one is amazing! It allows for a super close shave and I have really dry skin it helps with too. I definitely won&#x27;t be switching from this razor!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Bzzagent for free to try. I have mildly sensitive skin but this razor did not irritate my skin at all!&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin feeling smooth and clean. Definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend hates it says it was no good! WELL THANK YOU I finally found a razor I LOVE and he hates and wont use (I think there are designed gender specific)! A fantastic razor. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. Its comparatively priced but works way better than that other razor I USE to use. My boyfriend can have it!! #BZZAgent always hooks me up with the best products to try.</li>
    <li> Overall I loved this product! It was great like the other schick products I usually use, but moisturized more. I receveid it as part of my BzzCampaign and I have purchased refills and will continue to at least for the foreseeable future!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to receive thistazon to try through the BzzzCampaign and BzzAgent. I was very excited to try the new razor. Although it does give a nice close skin shave I didn&#x27;t care for the Shea Butter. In the second razor it was slimy and I had to continuously rinse off to shave, it was frustrating for me.</li>
    <li> I received this razor and cartridge free from Bzzagent and the review is 100% my own. I absolutely LOVE this razor system. This is the first razor that hasn&#x27;t made my sensitive skin turn red after shaving. I recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin but wants smooth legs!</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried ever razor on the market... every new razor that comes out, I have to try because maybe it&#x27;ll be the one.  It never is.  Until I tried this razor.  This razor gives me a close shave without irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t slice and dice my legs either.</li>
    <li> Smooth and close shave. And I only have to go over an area once to get all hair. LOVE this razor! Got it from Bzzagent to try out and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a bzzagent campaign. I really like the razor and my legs feel smooth after shaving. I don&#x27;t get razor burn or shaving bumps at all! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the price.</li>
    <li> I received Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor to test on behalf of a BzzCampaign. I absolutely loved it. It gave the smoothest shave! This is the only razor I will use!</li>
    <li> This razor is as close as you can get to the feel of waxing or laser treatments. I choose these procedures over shaving because of really sensitive skin and perpetual razor burn. Since I&#x27;m so particular, I was really only tempted to try this product because of my participation in a \\&quot;Bzz Campaign\\&quot; for [...]  I received the razor for free, along with a replacement cartridge, and tried it out in exchange for posting my opinions and sharing the bzz with my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this is the only razor I have ever used that can give me a smooth shave without the pain and itching for days after. I originally scoffed at Schick making a product that had five blades and a moisture strip that completely surrounded the shaver, but there is definitely a method to their madness. No nicks, scrapes, or razor burn is a major plus, and when the hair regrows, you aren&#x27;t dealing with ingrown hairs or irritation.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I know it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just for the record, BzzAgent doesn&#x27;t care if your reviews are positive or negative, as long as they are honest. So even though I received this product for free originally, I would definitely spend my own money on it again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I got to try it for the first time a couple months ago as part as a Bzz campaign. The way it glides over my sensitive skin is the stuff of legend. Usually pretty soon after i get a razor im back to getting razor burn but ive had this razor for a while now and its still just as awesome as the first time!</li>
    <li> Love this razor! Works so well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I received it free as part of a BzzCampaign. I have recommended it to many friends and family.</li>
    <li> Shaving never felt so good.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely love this razor, I have REALLY sensitive skin so a lot of razors were really tough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor as a campaign in BzzAgent but not because of that I&#x27;m just giving these razor 5 stars. It&#x27;s the only razor that left my skin feeling soft and smooth and didn&#x27;t leave any rash on my skin. I definitely recommend it to everyone but specially to people with sensitive skin. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is the best rasor out there! Im a buzzagent and this is just one of the many fantastic products I&#x27;ve reviewed.  Not only does it leave your sensitive skin soft and smooth, the hair actually seems to grow back slower. I&#x27;d also recommend using Schick shave cream for the perfect shaving experience!</li>
    <li> Typically I am a Venus gal, and Venus alone... I was given the opportunity to try the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor through BzzAgent and was beyond impressed! Typically my legs are always covered in razor burn and are very dry and itchy when I try other razors but Schick left my legs completely smooth and also very moisturized! I have found my new favorite razor! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor to test as a member of Bzzagent.com.  I was already using the Schick Hydro Silk razor when I received my sensitive razor to try. I tested the razor out a few months ago while the weather was cold and dry. My legs were dry and in need of moisture. I was happy to try the Schick Sensitive razor and used it immediately.  I used the razor while I showered and it was easy to hold onto it because of the grips on the handle.  The moisture strip at the top provided a soothing lotion that was activated by the warm water of my shower. I used my regular shave cream to shave and found that the 5 blades were able to glide easily along my legs without causing any nicks or cuts. I shaved one leg with my regular Schick Hydro Silk Razor and the other leg with the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor.  I noticed an immediate difference in the feel of my skin after I dried off.  My one leg was noticeably smoother and softer than the leg that I shaved with my regular razor. I had my husband do a blind test and he even noticed that the leg I shaved with the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor was smoother than the other.  I have used the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor since and I would recommend it to anyone who wants soft, smooth legs.</li>
    <li> Really great razor keeps your skin soft. It felt very. Good on my skin. I will buy again in the future</li>
    <li> The item is very good, with just one shave not only do you feel like it got everything but it also feels smooth to the touch ,I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#BZZAGENT</li>
    <li> I love this razor, doesn&#x27;t give me razor burn or any cuts. My teenage daughter likes it too.  :-) :-)</li>
    <li> My first impression with the razor was the design. I was amazed by the design of the handle, which feels perfect in my hands and has a nice grip so that you will never accidentally slip while shaving. I also loved the design of the razor head. The head is equipped with two strips of lotion, which are activated when you put the razor under water. The lotion strips are my favorite part of the razor because it makes the shave much easier because it glides smoothly on my skin and leaves my skin feeling soft after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor, I used a disposable Bic razor. The Bic razor does not even compare with the Schick razor in performance, speed, and design. With the Bic razor, I was finding myself going over the shaving area multiple times to get a close shave. However, with the Schick razor, it only takes ONE sweep to get a close shave. With my Bic razor, I always had ingrown hairs even if I exfoliated. Now with the Schick razor, my ingrown hairs have been minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving using the Schick razor and plan to be using it for a long time. Itâ€™s the best razor I have ever used! I definitely recommend trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this item for review purposes from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> Great razor, smooth shaving. Helps reduce the bumps when shaving, comes with extra razor and wall mount to hang it.</li>
    <li> This razor is not just nice to look at but it is also an excellent razor, provides a vey close shave and does not leave you conpletly dry but you still need to apply lotion afterwords. It has become my favorite razor since I received it from BzzAgent for testing purposes. I have purchase it again since receiving it!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a  Bzz Campaign and loved it! Most razors leave me with severe razor burn and this one did not. I was so excited! Plus the razors have lasted longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used.  This is the only razor I use any more.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used! I can get 5-10 uses out of one razor head! I shave my entire body too.. Leaves my skin soft and not dry!</li>
    <li> I will never own another razor again. Smoothest shave and all I need is water and no breakouts and I have super sensative skin</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a campaign for BzzAgent and I absolutely fell in love with it! No more razor burn, it leaves my legs silky smooth, and it outlasts any other razor I have every tried. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but shaving and sometimes leave me feeling uncomfortable.  this is even more prevalent in the summer months when I&#x27;m shaving more often.  it must be something to do with the chrome coating because this razor is awesome!  From my armpits to my legs....smooth sailing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m typically a Venus fan, but I thought I&#x27;d try something different. On my first use, I was very impressed with the results. Smooth skin, few missed strays, and no nicks or cuts. That said, I was &#x27;new blade&#x27; careful, very lightly &amp; slowly getting the feel for a new shaped razor. The second time, I was in a hurry and overconfident and seriously cut three chunks out of my skin within seconds! I slowed down, lightened pressure, and all was well after that. I&#x27;ve never, ever done that before. I&#x27;ve nicked myself before, but this took chunks out of my skin. So BE CAREFUL! Slow and steady. After about 8 uses, there&#x27;s still a lot of moisturizer left. There&#x27;s thick slime that comes out of the pad surrounding the blades. Does it help, maybe. I did a side by side comparison with my Venus (which has had about 20 uses) and each leg felt the same afterward, so I doubt the moisturizer has any special benefits. Get this razor if you&#x27;re gentle, slow &amp; methodical while shaving, but if you&#x27;re in a hurry and used to using a little more pressure &amp; speed, you may want to pass.</li>
    <li> I received this razor FREE in a BzzAgent campaign. I am so happy because I seriously think this is the BEST razor ever. I&#x27;ve used so many different kinds and I was truly amazed that this one was so different. I have 5 daughters and they all agree and now use it too!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor through BzzAgent and was pleasantly surprised by the way this handle fits in my hand compared to different razors. It is easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand easily. I will be sticking to this razor for now on.</li>
    <li> This razor is so easy to use as it glides over your skin. It has a super smooth feel and keeps your skin soft so if you don&#x27;t have gel for shaving, you won&#x27;t cut yourself up. It moves gracefully over curves, bumps, and is perfect in your bikini area!</li>
    <li> This razor made my legs feel so smooth and soft. It didn&#x27;t over dry my skin and helped keep it soft. I loved being about to try it before buying throughy bzzagent sweet deal. Yes the price is alittle high but it was worth it this time.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a buzz campaign.  I love the close shave it gives me and no irritation,  but it does cut my legs very easily. I will sacrifice chunks of skin for a close shave though! Using it with a good shave gel reduces the cut skin though!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I received one for a buzz agent campaign to try it out and review it, I won&#x27;t be going back to a different razor anymore. It has such a close shave that it lasts longer than a normal razor, my legs have never been so smooth. It has also lasted me about twice as long before having to switch the cartridge, as my previous razor.</li>
    <li> There are five blades and two moisture strips, it works great! The razor itself is super moisturizing and it gets all the hairs, leaves my legs (and arms) nice and smooth without being itchy or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as part of a Bzzagent(.com) campaign and I LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> This was a great razor, I really like the moisture beads, they did make a big difference and I did notice&lt;br /&gt;since I&#x27;ve always dealt with dry skin. I would buy this again. One note, make sure you don&#x27;t lave the razor sitting on your tub side (i always do this) because the moisture beads sometimes will become kind of melty, because of the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to BzzAgent, I got to try it free!!</li>
    <li> I received this from bzzagent for free and i had to say that it works great on my sensitive skins. The only downside is that after using this shaver, it seem like my hair style legs grow sooner than other shaver that I had use before but other than that I work great for me.</li>
    <li> Even though I was lucky enough to receive this razor as a BzzAgent and it has completely won me over and I&#x27;ll buy it again because it&#x27;s worth every penny! The long lasting effects of this razor are dreamy! This razor just keeps giving silky smoothness with no irritation afterwards. This razor truly out performs that of any others I have tried so much so that I would put it in a class of it&#x27;s own. It is my new standard for shaving. Highly recommended to anyone who values a quality product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor courtesy of BzzAgent, and I can&#x27;t picture myself shaving with any other razor! It is perfect for anyone that has sensitive skin, especially those that get red bumps after that shave, like me. No more red bumps, ladies!!</li>
    <li> For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always had trouble with razor burn due to sensitive skin, so I was weary at first when trying this razor. I&#x27;m a BzzAgent, though, so when I was offered the opportunity to try it for free as a part of a BzzCampaign, I thought why not? Well, I&#x27;m so glad I did because this razor is PHENOMENAL! With this razor, I stayed smoother longer, my sensitive skin was not irritated, and I had no razor burn whatsoever! I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try this product out for free and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Previously, I was always using mens razors in order to get a closer shave. I&#x27;ve officially stopped using mens razors and started using this! It moisturizes my sensitive skin while also giving a close shave. In my opinion a closer one then mens razors. This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> This razor glides smoothly and evenly, no nicks, or shaving bumps either! No skin irritation at all, My New FAV Razor!</li>
    <li> Best razor ever. I have super sensitive skin and always got razor bump when shaving. Shaving was just not fun. This product has this gel like coating that acts like a buffet when shaving. Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Will never use any other razor again. I can shave with out it hurting, itching, etc... definitely would recommend to everyone especially if you have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always had trouble with razor burn, annoying bumps, and itchy dry skin due to sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and I was so excited when I was offered the opportunity to try it for free as a part of a BzzCampaign, I thought why not? Well, I&#x27;m so glad I did because this razor is PHENOMENAL! With this razor, I stayed smoother longer, my sensitive skin was not irritated, and I had no razor burn. bumps, or itchy dry skin whatsoever! My legs are silky smooth with this razor!</li>
    <li> Received this as part of BZZ campaign and absolutely loved it.  Amazing close save... soft skin.  Oh yeah!!!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love love love this razor. It is super easy to use and change the blades when you need to. It gives you a nice close shave and your skin is silky smooth afterwards. The best part is you only have to use one stroke of the blades, no more repeat shaving because it feels like you missed a spot. This thing doesn&#x27;t leave any hairs behind.&lt;br /&gt;This has been my favorite razor to use so far and I have tried quite a few. The blade seems to last a long time. They last a few weeks before you have to change the blade and I shave every day. They are a bit cheaper than other brands also.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;shaves really well&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave cuts and nicks behind&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin&lt;br /&gt;leaves your skin silky smooth after you done shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wish the blades lasted a tad longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!!&lt;br /&gt;Btw I got to try it FREE from BZZAGENT</li>
    <li> The razors are gentle on your skin and leave them really soft &amp; smooth.  The price isn&#x27;t bad either.  It&#x27;s been used for over a month now, every other day use, and the razor still works well.  It goes nicely around the knees and ankles as well.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve said before that I&#x27;ve enjoyed two brands as top razors for me, Gillette Venus and Schick Hydro. This is no different. Legs are smooth, provides a close shave, and the blade lasts a good amount of time. I do think the Venus Embrace offers more in terms of providing lubrication for a shave, but this does well too. It certainly does not have the problem that the Venus Moisture Bards do, aka, they will fall of once you use them a lot or not last the entire amount. One complaint that I did notice after using this for awhile, is the goo, or gel started squeezing through the holes a bit, maybe two of them. This is very minor, and I would readily buy another one over a Venus Moister Bar. I still think the Embrace line edges out over this one just because it applies the lubrication better.</li>
    <li> I have been holding onto a different Schick razor that is no longer sold.  It was the perfect razor, and I was so glad I had extra cartridges.  Then I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care razor as a BzzAgent.  Boy, am I ever glad I received this razor.  I have been loving it so much, that my old Schick has been sitting in the shower unused for weeks now.  This one is now my new favorite!  An even better smoother shave then any disposable I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using razors because my skin is uberly sensitive to razors but If I have to then I use this razor. It has enough razors space to cleanly shave without causing harm. The moisturizing strip helps to avoid skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor as part of a BzzCampaign. This razor is awesome.  It gives a close shave and I now can go longer between shaving.  Excellent and will not use a different razor anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor for sensitive skin. I received it free as a Bzz Agent and will continue to use it. Perfect razor for smooth skin. It even comes with a travel case.</li>
    <li> I received this as a part of a Bzzagent campaign and I was very pleased with the results! I have very sensitive skin and this razor, along with Skintimate shaving cream keeps the bumps down. I have replaced my old razor and love this! :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor! I would never have tried it if it weren&#x27;t for receiving one as part of my Bzzcampaign. I am getting rid of my old and sticking with this one from now on. It left my legs feeling smooth and no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Love the design of this razor. It is so lightweight and easy to shave with. It&#x27;s smoother than other razors and the hydrating strip really work. I encourage every shaving woman to give this razor a try!</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis so anything to do with my skin I am very picky. This razor was perfect. I didn&#x27;t get razor burn and it was very comfortable to handle. I received a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I received the schick hydro silk sensitive razor from a campaign on a site called bzzagent.I was very impressed with this razor! It was one of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor as part of bzzagent.com, and it is so much better than its non-sensitive counterpart for many reasons. I have sensitive skin, but I also have eczema. I was able to shave my legs without worrying about cuts or scrapes. It was an extraordinarily close shave, but one which didn&#x27;t leave my skin begging for moisture afterwards. I&#x27;m so buying this again!</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free in a bzzcampaign from bzzagent a few months ago and I have not bought a different brand or kind of razor ever since! This is my absolute favorite razor of all time. Let me start off by saying I have very sensitive skin and this has been the most gentle razor for my skin because it has a moisturizing serum that seriously makes the blades glide so smoothly on your skin. I get no nicks or cuts on my legs like I do with other razors. I used to use another very well known name brand razor and this Schick Hydro Silk sensitive care razor knocks it out of the park! Other razors don&#x27;t even come close. I told so many of my close friends about this razor and they now only use this razor too. If you are hesitant because of the price do not hesitate. It is so worth the money and I would even be willing to pay more for this razor because the quality is that good. The cartridges lasted a long time before I had to replace even one of them and I shave often. I couldn&#x27;t imagine summer without this razor because it really gives you a close shave and gets you ready for beach attire. I am so thankful to have tried this first for free during a bzzcampaign because otherwise I would have never learned about this amazing razor!</li>
    <li> This Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor is absolutely fabulous. I love it so much, I shave my legs every day now because it&#x27;s so easy and actually makes my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve tried women&#x27;s razors and men&#x27;s razors and disposable razors and non-disposable razors and some were ok, most weren&#x27;t good enough for my skin. I always seemed to get razor burn, I&#x27;d cut my legs, or my legs would be red and irritated afterwards. The first time I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive, everything changed. First of all, I don&#x27;t even have to use shaving gel or cream anymore! I am totally serious! I shave in the shower with just a bit of water going down my leg, and the built-in hydrating strip makes the razor just glide across my skin. Don&#x27;t apply a lot of pressure to get a &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; because this razor works best with just a light touch, and you still get the closest shave ever. And since I&#x27;ve been buying this razor, I haven&#x27;t had a single cut. That just blows my mind. LOL Also, here&#x27;s a little tip for taking care of your blades: after shaving, lightly pat dry the blades (don&#x27;t run the blade across a towel!) and then apply some oil to the blades and moisture strip (I use olive oil) using a q-tip. Let the oil stay on it until the next time you shave. Doing this will totally extend the life of the replaceable blades. I&#x27;ve been using the same blades for the past two months, shaving every day, and the blades are still in fantastic shape! I am so impressed with this razor, I actually don&#x27;t mind shaving anymore and I never thought I&#x27;d say that. I really recommend that you try this razor. I bet you&#x27;ll love it like I do. :)</li>
    <li> I received the razor in the mail for free as a BzzAgent.  I have always been a Venus user and have always had a problem with irritation in my bikini area until trying the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor.  I will never go back to Venus.</li>
    <li> I love this razor- it leaves my legs feeling so smooth every time. Not really any knicks or cuts either!</li>
    <li> I tried this razor through BzzAgent and I am glad I did! Not only does it have a cool design but it leaves my sensitive skinned legs feeling soft, smooth, and silky while keeping them really hydrated! I brake out over everything so when i tried this razor I was amazed .</li>
    <li> I first tried the original razor as part of a BzzCampaign program. Before I ever participated in that campaign, I was using my boyfriend&#x27;s razors because my experiences with women razors were not very positive. They still gave me nicks, made my skin break out with bumps, and I would have to shave over the same area several times to get a close good shave. I was so surprised when I first started using the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor. Not only does it get the job done, but I don&#x27;t have to shave over the same area several times to get a close shave and it leaves my skin smooth and bump free. My skin is a little sensitive, so any razor that doesn&#x27;t mess up my skin and doesn&#x27;t take so long to shave. Great product.</li>
    <li> Why haven&#x27;t I updated my razor preferences in ages?? The Silk is serving you baby-bottom smoothness. It glides so beautifully, you might be moved to tears.</li>
    <li> I liked it but was not in love with it.  I found the first couple uses were awesome then it was  a wrap.  Had to replace it because I had some razor burn spots.  But for a short term use they are great.</li>
    <li> This is so smooth shaving that I have to go back over my skin to see if it&#x27;s even shaving.  It does, but the moisturizing strips on both upper and lower borders do such a good job of stopping friction that I feel no drag at all.  Note:  It fell in the bath tub  and I didn&#x27;t notice and much of the moisturizing strips melted away but it still does a good job of shaving.  It came with a suction wall mount, but it falls off the shower wall about one a week.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. It has this built in lotion thingy that helps the blades to slide across the skin close and smooth. But you had better follow the directions and make sure you put it under running water to activate the lotion or your get razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, smooth legs and underarms. It also gives you a close shave along the back of the neck. Not like other razors that become really dull after shaving the legs a couple of times. I&#x27;ve used it three times and it still gave me a smooth, close shave. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this razor.  The first thing you&#x27;ll want to know is that the razor head itself is very large.  It&#x27;s about twice the size of all of my other razor heads.  It does have more blades than most of my other razors have, but they&#x27;re also just larger.  This is good if you want to shave in a hurry, but bad if you&#x27;re trying to get in to detail areas.  Second, the gel around the razor head gets used up in about 2 shaves.  Yep, that quick.  Finally, this razor really irritated my skin!  For a razor that is labeled as sensitive, I would not expect it to make my skin burn badly after use it.  It is definitely not sensitive at all.</li>
    <li> This razor leaves a silky smooth texture behind.  The soft grip makes it easy to handle and maneuver. The extra blades leave my legs silky even longer.</li>
    <li> I like this razor. It shaves close and leaves my legs feeling smooth with no irritation.  The handle is shaped nicely and easy to hold. The head of the razor is surprisingly large, which I guess is good for quickly shaving your legs, but does make it a bit awkward around the knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I don&#x27;t feel that there is anything special about this Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor. I also didn&#x27;t notice much difference between it and the regular Hydro Silk Razor, which I tried previously. I have most recently been using the Schick Quattro and have not been inspired to switch to the Hydro Silk Sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor about 1 month. This razor has a very sharp well made blade - I shave my legs 4 times a week and I&#x27;m still on the 1st blade. It&#x27;s amazing to me that the hydro silk has lasted so long, it&#x27;s still a silky smooth shave.  I would definitely recommend this razor.  Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
    <li> Since I started using this razor my legs are so soft, other razors would leave me legs feeling dry and scaly. i didnt think i could ever find a razor that made my legs feel smooth again.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have ecsema on out legs and it is hard to find a razor that doesn&#x27;t irrigate it. When we first used it we were surprised that it did so well. We now buy only this razor</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try as a Bzzagent.  I have super sensitive skin but for once I didn&#x27;t experience dry and itchy skin after shaving as I usually do.  Only down side is the glide protection gets a bit slimy at times, especially if you like a really hot shower or bath.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this razor. I have super sensitive skin and this razor get a close clean shave with out any irritation!</li>
    <li> I Love my New razor I received it a few months ago &amp; have used it since. My leg&#x27;s NEVER Looked or Felt Soooo Good.. Thank You #FreeSample @BzzAgent @Schick</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Skin Razor was given to me as a BzzAgent to review as part of a BzzCampaign. I loved this razor--the close clean shave paired with my ability to use a razor without purchasing expensive shaving cream was an easy sell. As someone with sensitive skin, I really appreciated my newfound ability to shave my legs and not find it necessary to apply lotion right after. My legs were left hydrated and clean shaven. I was even able to slide right into jeans without any burning sensation from the shave. 5 stars in my book!! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> really like this razor. I have very sensitive skin ,making shaving a torture. This razor was gentle on my skin and still gave a close silky smooth results</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the ergonomics of this razor. It&#x27;s so comfortable to use. I had the opportunity to review it as part of a BzzCampaign. I&#x27;ve since bought an extra to have one when traveling. The handle is really nice because whether it&#x27;s dry or wet, it&#x27;s very easily gripped. Some razors get slippery when wet and can be frustrating to try to use in the shower as a result, but not the Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor!</li>
    <li> Loved this razor. I dint cut myself or get razor burn. The handle was very comfortable.  The cartridge was easy to replace.</li>
    <li> I got this for free, but I would pay for it in the future.  It makes my legs so smooth!</li>
    <li> I tryed this razor as a buzz agent campane and was so impressed that it is the only razor that i use anymore</li>
    <li> This give a very close shave and it give you smooth legs. This razor will last you a long while and I recommend. I received this during a buzz campaign.</li>
    <li> This razor is great for senstive skin. It gives a very good clean shave and does not irritate my skin or cause razor &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; like many other razors. The handle is very nice and easy to grip even when wet. The case for the razor is very helpful. The razor does not rust, and is very long lasting.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a free sample through bzzagent and fell in love. I get the worst razor bumps whenever I shave and this razor DOES NOT cause them at all for me! Yaaaayyyy!  Perfect for summertime!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite razor! I will never go back to any of the other brands out there!  It&#x27;s an incredible close shave and leaves my skin very soft for days!</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a Bzz Agent campaign.  I love it as much as Venus if not more.  It totally works the same if not better than Venus.  I like the moisture strip because it isn&#x27;t too slimy and it lasts a while.  What doesn&#x27;t last are the blades.  I feel like this razor gets very dull very fast.  I feel like it is dull in a week or two.  I will keep trying it out and will purchase over Venus if it is cost effective.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of the Schick Hydro SilkÂ® Sensitive CareÂ® BzzCampaign. This was an awesome product to use in the middle of the horrible winter we had on the East Coast. My skin was dry, but when I shaved my legs with this razor they were silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the weather is warmer, this razor is my best friend. I use it every day for a smooth shave on both my legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong...give it a try!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even refillable!!!</li>
    <li> my wife got these and they made her legs so much smoother then other she has used. less cuts also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge Schick fan, but this razor is better than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. It is very sharp and even with shaving lotion I still ended up with nicks on my legs, but it does give a nice smooth shave. The razors last a long time and stay sharp. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor, you may like this one. I think the thing I like most about this razor is the fact that I can keep the same blade for quite a few shaves before having to replace, unlike others I&#x27;ve used before. My only complaint is that the Noxzema razor I usually use never cuts me, so that really is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Bzzagent.com I was able to receive this razor and a refill for free. If you&#x27;ve never heard of it you should check it out!</li>
    <li> I received this free as part of a bzz campaign. I love this razor. It eliminated any razor burn I would usually get with other razors. It makes your skin feel soft and silky. I got so many friends to try this as well and they all use this brand now, as do I.</li>
    <li> I loved the Schick Hydro.  The grip design makes it easy to hold in the shower.  The cost is less then other razors of lessor quality and the holder actually sticks to the shower wall for more then a day.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor from BzzAgent, and I really liked it. It is reasonably priced, long-lasting and provides a smooth shave on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver through a Bzz Campaign and absolutely love it.  The shaver features a moisturizing strip that lasts about 2 shaves before it wears off.  Used in combination with Skintimate Moisturizing Shaving Lotion, I had an amazingly smooth shave and my legs had none of the usual razor burn that other razors have caused.  Hard to complain about a free razor, but I have already purchased replaceable cartridges for the razor!</li>
    <li> I also recieved this razor as part of a BZZ campiagn- and I am very greatful I did! I have VERY sensitive skin and i usually have a burning/stinging sensation after shaving and If I do not apply lotion as soon as I get out of the shower... Ouch! Lots of hot, itchy red bumps everywhere the blade touched! This is the first razor that I did not experience those symptoms with! I was VERY pleased with the look, feel and feelings of my legs when used this. I did still have a mild stinging sensation after my first shave, but when I coupled this razir with the Shick sensitive shaving cream- there was no pain only glossy smoothness! Heaven, for a sensitive skinned girl like me!</li>
    <li> I found this razer to be very gentle on my skin providing a smooth close shave! Highly reccomend this item!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin when it comes to shaving. It got to a point that I would avoid shaving until I absolutley had to. I was able to try the Schick Hydro Sensitive Razor through Bzzagent. My kit included a coupon for Skintimate shave cream. I was hesitant at first to try it, but now I could never look back! No skin irritation from day one even when I shave regularly. A lot of times the block around the outside wears out before the razor, but I have found that not to be true with the Schick Hydro Sensitive. I love the fact that there is not a big bulky case that goes with it just a simple plastic one around the head.</li>
    <li> I love the Schick Hydro Silk cause it has that serum that works with your shaving cream to make for a smoother more sleek feel once your legs are fully shaved. And I recv&#x27;d mine to try thru BzzAgent.com and I have to say I love mine and using it. Well worth the $$$$</li>
    <li> This razor did not leave my skin feeling overly dry, and it gives a nice close shave.  Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have spent years dealing with red dots in my legs, especially in the heat in Arizona! But I tried out this razor through BzzAgent and I was so impressed. It&#x27;s sharp so you don&#x27;t have to do multiple passes and the moisturizing strips are really effective. Best razor I&#x27;ve used hands down.</li>
    <li> I received the razor from Bzzagent to try for free!  It is the best razor I have tried so far - I am still using it.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smooth legs without the bumps!  I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
    <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent and it gave me the best shave of my life. I typically get a lot of little red bumps on my legs after shaving and end up wearing jeans all summer. This year, I am going to rock some shorts with smooth, silky legs!</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a BzzCampagne, and I was really excited. I had heard good things about this razor, and my expectations were met and beyond. The blades get almost all of the hair, and they don&#x27;t nick or irritate your skin. And they last longer than other brands too. I would recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was privileged enough to be a part of the Schick Hydro Silk Razor BzzCampaign recently and was happy to try this out. I have very dry, irritated skin when it comes to shaving. I was very skeptical at first, but once I tried it and saw that my skin was not irritated, red or dry after using the sensitive razor, I was ecstatic! This was much more then what I thought it was going to be after trying so many different types of â€˜sensitiveâ€™ razors out there. I definitely recommend this product to any one and because of how well this worked! I wish the refills weren&#x27;t so pricey but since I got into couponing, I&#x27;ve been finding great deals and started stocking up.</li>
    <li> This razor is very easy to use and leaves you clean shaven with soft and smooth skin!!!  I highly recommend it.........</li>
    <li> I love this razor, I got it through the BZZ campaign where they ask you to try the product for reviews.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the stick on wall mount - doesn&#x27;t work at all.  That being said I bought a razor not something I care to hang on the wall so I wasn&#x27;t too upset by that.  The razor leaves you super smooth you can feel it moisturizing right away.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a BuzzCampaign.  I was highly impressed with the quality!  My skin is very sensitive and I have to use shaving cream to prevent razor burn.  I took the challenges of using it without cream to see how the moisturizing strip would be and it was great! Super smooth shave and no irritated skin to follow.  If you have sensitive skin I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I like how smooth is leaves your legs. It makes your legs feel more hydrated and smooth. This razor is highly recommende.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now and I have NOT had a single nick or cut from it! Definitely the best re-fillable razor out there and I will continue to use it because of its super close shave</li>
    <li> I have been an Venus user for several years. Thought I would try this since it was free as part of the Amazon Vine Program. I was quite surprised to find I preferred it over the Venus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a smoother shave with virtually no drag, no redness or razor burn, and the moisturizing bars make it easy to shave. I use a minimal amount of soap before shaving since the Hydro doesn&#x27;t really need it for a nice, clean, shave. I also like the handles and areas for finger placement - makes it a lot easier to hold onto while showering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, smooth, easy shave!</li>
    <li> I received my razor as part of a BzzCampaign. I have very dry, sensitive skin and was so excited that there was finally a women&#x27;s razor aimed at this specific need.  I&#x27;ve always found men&#x27;s razors to be better for my skin.  This is, by far, the BEST razor I&#x27;ve ever used! Not only does it keep my skin moisturized, but it&#x27;s so effective I only have to shave about once a week instead of every few days! As a working mom, any extra time I get is valuable, but it&#x27;s especially valuable when it keeps my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> Until I received this as a free sample from BzzAgent, I used a general purpose men&#x27;s razor because I liked the shave I got. Boy, did I not know what I was missing. The five blades and all the moisture were just what my sensitive and dry skin had been begging for.</li>
    <li> Awhile ago, I tried this razor for BzzAgent.  The razor has five blades that are flexible and glide effortlessly over the skin.  The moisture beads act as a shaving gel and make your skin silky smooth afterwards.  The razor works well long after the beads dry up as well.  The handle is easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t get slippery in the shower.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a BzzCampaign, and I absolutely fell in love with it!! I was having a very serious, and embarrassing issue with razor bumps, but using this razor has seemed to cure that problem. My skin is very smooth and bump free now. I need this razor always in my life- its really that good!</li>
    <li> I have been a habitual user of disposable razors for years.  I didn&#x27;t think the price was worth the results of an expensive razor and the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor proved me wrong.  The serum and moisturizers not only protect the skin during shaving, but also hydrates the skin resulting in little to no irritation.  While the razor blade head itself can be bulky, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a close long-lasting shave that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin this is the razor for you!</li>
    <li> This Schick Hydro Razor was sent to me months ago from BuzzAgent.  I love it!  It is long lasting and very effective.  I have already purchased more razors with the coupons buzzagent also sent me.  Just to have as backups.  Until they come out with something better than this, this is my holy grail razor of choice.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzz Campaign and it was amazing.  I have used disposable razors, ugh!  I have used other razors that have the moisture strip, not too bad.  This stands out among all other razors I have used.  The moisture strips last through many shaves more than other brands i have tried and I used this along with the schick sensitive shaving gel and my legs we so so smooth and no irritation or bumps. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good razor that is very comfortable to use.  Razor heads last a long time.  Included suction cup hanger is a nice bonus!</li>
    <li> I received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign for Schick. I still use this razor.. it leaves my legs silky smooth</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as a bzzagent. I looked forward to trying it, but didn&#x27;t really expect it to be any better than any other. I was wrong. The first time I use a new razor I always cut myself somehow, but not even a nick. That was enough to impress me but it even seemed to be reducing these weird red bumps I have and that was even better. Only now months later when the blades are starting to go dull have I finally managed to nick myself. I never believed I would switch from the original Venus razor, but that was before I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor.</li>
    <li> best razor ever never had a single problem!! Got review this product i can&#x27;t cannot say enough good things about.</li>
    <li> I got this through a bzz kit. It left my legs feeling silky soft and moisturized. Perfect for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I get a really close shave and I don&#x27;t get a rash from shaving! Plus my legs are silky smooth! GET ONE NOW! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This razor was so smooth, I had to check 3 different times to make sure I was actually shaving!  The shave was smooth and close and stubble did not grow back for 2 days!  This is huge for me since I see stubble the very next day!  I will never use another razor again....I am a customer for LIFE!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free trial from BzzAgent!  I was skeptical at first but when I opened up the box and tried it, I fell in love!  This razor is my new life razor, as long as they make it!  I love that I got this razor with several cartridges in February and that the moisture strip STILL hasn&#x27;t ran out of the first blade I&#x27;ve opened!  I love that the razor is still sharp and feels just as great as the day it was opened!  This is truly an amazing razor!</li>
    <li> I received one of these from bzzagent as a free sample and absolutely love it!  It is by far the best razor I have ever tried.  It shaves smooth every time, the sensitive lotion strip lasts as long as the blades and I  used one cartridge for almost 2 months shaving every couple days.  The handle grip is great and the head doesn&#x27;t pop off very easily if you bump it onto the floor.  I used to be a big fan of Mach III razors until Schick far surpassed it.  It is well worth the money and if you&#x27;re looking for a &#x27;different&#x27; gift for your best friend ladies, one of these with a scented candle, some chocolate and a soft fluffy bath towel would be very welcome to the recipient!  Nothing like pampering while getting the job done!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor as part of the BZZAGENT campaign.  It was one of the best razor I have ever used.  I didn&#x27;t even nick myself--a great plus to keep using the razor.  I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many razors before, but this Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor is top of the line!  WoW!  I have NEVER had a disposable  that cut this close and left my skin feeling sooo goood..EVER!  I received this Razor as part of a buzz campaign and have used no other since!</li>
    <li> I love the way it left my skin feeling. Very easy to use and easy replacing the blades. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best razor I have ever had.  It makes my legs super smooth!  Even my husband has stolen my razor!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and after about a month of use, this razor has not irritated it AT ALL. I think that&#x27;s a first for me. Also, I had an earlier version of a Hydro (not for sensitive skin), and one thing that bugged me about it was the mechanism for changing blade heads. It wasn&#x27;t rocket science or anything, but it wasn&#x27;t an easy &amp;#34;push button, pop off&amp;#34; mechanism. This feature has been added on this razor, so I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;When you find it, you don&#x27;t let go...&amp;#34; This is the way I feel about this razor. Schick Hydro leaves my skin soft and the shave lasts longer. I have recommended this product to my friends and family and I will continue doing so... I just love this product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this razor. I get a close shave without any nicks. It really is unlike any other razor I have tried. I&#x27;m impressed, good product Schick!</li>
    <li> I received my Shick Hydro Silk razor free because I am a  bzz agent. I absolutely love it! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but since I have been using this razor I have had no red bumps or cuts. One cartridge lasts me over a month and it gives a great close shave. The moisturizing strip lasts a lot longer than other brands and makes your skin soft. Since getting it, this is the only razor I have used because I like it that much!  I will be buying refills for sure:)</li>
    <li> I was lucky to be a part of the Schick Hydro Silk Razor BzzCampaign recently and was so excited to try the product. I have very sensitive skin and have had so many issues with razors irritating my skin. After the first use of the Schick Hydro Silk Sensative Razor I was HOOKED! I love this razor! It&#x27;s smooth, silky, doesn&#x27;t tear up the skin on my legs, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin bumpy and red like other razors. The one down fall of this razor is that the refill cartridges are a little pricy. But the good thing is they seem to last a longer time and several uses! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> No matter how hard I try to be careful, I&#x27;m one of those people who can&#x27;t shave her legs without cutting my ankle or something. Many razors promise that they reduce nicks and cuts, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck with most of them. So far with Hydro Silk--so good. Obviously, part of what&#x27;s working in this regard is the five very thin blades and the fact that there&#x27;s a nice bit of give to them as you go over contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I actually also think part of what helps is that it doesn&#x27;t rely on some giant, slippery &#x27;moisturizing strip.&#x27; I found it odd that some other reviewers said that it&#x27;s really slippery--I actually thought this one had less to it than any other razor I&#x27;d tried. You&#x27;re going to need shave gel to use this--but I think that&#x27;s a good thing. You have more control, and you&#x27;re less likely to press too hard and slice your ankle.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave with less strokes, so glad I tried this product. The razor comes with a convenient travel case, just be sure not to place the used razor on a wet surface or the moisturizing strip will diminish quicker.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a Bzzagent and that is how I got this item for free.  However, some items that I have gotten from there I simply did not like.  This is NOT one of those items.  I have been using this razor ever since I got it.  At first I was afraid that I would get cut but that simply has not happened.  This is something that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I began using this razor as part of a bzz campaign, where I was asked to critically evaluate the razor with respect to its effect on sensitive skin. My legs and underarms are quite sensitive and I have frequently had to deal with razor burn when using my previous razors. I was so pleased with the results of the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor, that I switched permanently. Aside from using my husband&#x27;s razor (which is not quite as user friendly on the legs), this is the closest shave I have gotten...and no razor burn! The razor truly does moisturize as you use it and my legs feel the same (and better) as they typically did when I lathered them in lotion post shave.</li>
    <li> The new Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor deserves nothing less than a 5 star rating. This has to be one of the most effective razors on the market. Once I tried it for the first time I was HOOKED! Smootth long lasting skin soft to the touch.l Dont miss out or get left behind! #GotItFree #GotADiscount #BZZAGENT</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this for free through a BzzAgent campaign, and overall I was pleased with the results. I&#x27;m normally a Venus razor user, and past experiences with Schick razors haven&#x27;t been that positive. Upon trying the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive for a few months, I found it to be great for my sensitive skin. The moisture bar was really great in soothing any red flare-ups I sometimes get. It also left a really clean shaveâ€”cleaner than the Venus. Also, the handle ergonomics was intuitive and not awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the hiccups I had with the Schick were the moisture bar got really slimy and started melting after only a couple of showers. It&#x27;s placed out of the way/water, but it still started to melt (also had the same issue Venus&#x27;s Olay moisture bars) and get gooey every time I used it to shave. It still functions fine, but it doesn&#x27;t look pleasant. Also, I nicked myself pretty bad. This is something I always encounter with Schick razors and rarely with Venus. Overall, if you&#x27;re a Schick razor user and haven&#x27;t tried the Hydro Silk Sensitive, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you have sensitive skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t switch from your Venus if you&#x27;re happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love the Schick Hydro, but every once in awhile, I would still get the little red bumps.  I got the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive as part of a BzzAgent kit. This razor is something completely different, though!The Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive leaves my legs smooth and never give me the little red bumps. The razor lasts for a long time and it works so well. A little more expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through my buzzagent.com campaign. I loved it, I have sensitive skin but did not have any problems which this razor and it left my skin moisturized and feeling smooth and that is why I gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor a few month ago for Free for being a BzzAgent,i was skeptical at first but i still use the razor and have boght replacement blades for it. The handle fits comfortable in my hand i only wish the blade was more flexible but that is something i can work with. It really is smooth and moisturizing at the same time it fells like i&#x27;m getting a closer shave without bumps or the feel of my hair being ripped out. The Blades last for quite a few shaves and dont go dull quickly. I recommend this razor to others</li>
    <li> I had the regular Hydro Silk Razor before this and I though I might expect a different experience with this one, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything. It&#x27;s just a s good as the regular one. And the aloe strip just as gooey when the cartridge is fresh. Overall still prefer to the Venus razors.</li>
    <li> I tested shaving one leg with shaving cream - the other with just the razor and am pleased to report that both legs were left smooth, non-irritated, and equal.  However, the design of the handle (or the material used for the handle) doesn&#x27;t grip well in my hand.  At one point, the razor flew from my hand into the shower, leaving legs of &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; (streaming slime...not gross...just best way I can describe it).  I had to rinse off the handle often to maintain a proper shaving grip -- so for that, deduct one star.  I love the 5 blade smooth shave, but don&#x27;t love needing to re-assemble the cartridge to the razor in order to continue shaving.  :)</li>
    <li> When I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor for review, I had been using the Venus Embrace by Gillette for at least 4 years. For a week or two, I used both in tandem for underarm shaving to see if I could distinguish the difference, using the Embrace on the left and the Hydro Silk on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro Silk was brand new and the razor head on my Venus Embrace already had wear on it. As a result, I expected the Schick razor to outperform the Gillette razor. Au contraire! It was a pretty even race. I kept having stubble on the right, so after the first week or two, I swapped and used the Embrace on the right and the Hydro Silk on the left. I&#x27;m very glad I did this, because I would have given the Hydro Silk a lower rating if I hadn&#x27;t. What I found was that apparently the angle at which I shave my right is different than the way I shave my left. So, while I can get a perfectly smooth armpit on the left, I find it challenging on the right to completely remove all stubble. So my stubbly right armpit was NOT the fault of the razor, as it turns out, but simply a matter of my holding the razor differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of holding the razor, while I still prefer my Venus Embrace overall, I preferred the longer/larger grip area on the Hydro Silk&#x27;s handle to the shorter/smaller grip area on the Venus Embrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the replaceable shave head, this is where Hydro Silk lost its 5th star. The shaving surface of my Venus Embrace shave head, which has a LOT more wear on it than the Hydro Silk, is still very smooth. Sure, it&#x27;s lost a bit of its lubricating strip, but there is nothing rough or hard on the shave head. After only 4 weeks of use (and most of it part-time), the white strips at the top and bottom of the shave head are nearly gone, and what remains are what appear to be hard, white bumps of plastic, some of which stick up off the razor head by 1/8&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both razors have 5 blades and, if you buy the kit that comes with the razor, 2 shave heads and a suction cup hanger for the shower, both cost about 10 bucks here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, while the Schick Hydro Silk performs about as well as the Venus Embrace, it will end up being more expensive in the long run because elements of the shave head wear down  more quickly. For my money, I&#x27;ll stick with the Venus Embrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 starsrazor, 2 shave heads and a suction cup hanger for the shower, both cost about 10 bucks here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, while the Schick Hydro Silk performs about as well as the Venus Embrace, it will end up being more expensive in the long run because elements of the shave head wear down  more quickly. For my money, I&#x27;ll stick with the Venus Embrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars</li>
    <li> I get awful razor burn and I got this to try from Bzzagent. It&#x27;s great! Close shave and doesn&#x27;t make me itch like other razors. The moisture strip did seem to dull the razor quickly and mine even rusted. But the moisture quality is most important to me!</li>
    <li> I have used the same razor for years and saw no reason to switch. Then I received my Schick Hydro Razor as part of a Bzzagent package and I have never looked back! I love  this razor. Its great for sensitive skin, easy to use, and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I will be buying the blades when mine run out instead of going back to my old razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a bzzcampaign and I&#x27;ve always loved how Schick razors are very lubricating and I was ecstatic to see the sensitive version. The aloe around the blade reallys helps cut down on razor bumps (i didn&#x27;t have any) and kept the shave slick. Great razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor and some refills during a BZZZ Agent campaign.  It was amazing. I say amazing because I used all I had and then used up what I purchased with the fabulous coupons they provided.  This morning I had to shave my legs with another type of razor.  Didn&#x27;t do nearly a close enough shave and left my skin dry and itchy.  Gonna have to search for more coupons.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a campaign from bzz agent to try it and review it for free , I have actually switched razors now and this is my preferred brand. The razor is sleek , eleastic to use with an ergonomic handle and a suction cup holder for the shower. I have noticed a huge difference in the softness of my legs and I have to shave far less with this razo . It is more affordable than my previous brand and it lasts much longer , I have not even replaced the cartridge yet and I have been using about 2 months . I would highly recommend  this razor and the refill cartridges as well , great product!</li>
    <li> I received this courtesy of BzzAgent in their Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor campaign. This razor is absolutely great! No nicks or cuts of any kind on my legs! Smooth and easy on the legs!</li>
    <li> I received one of these razors with the cartridges from bzzagent to try out and review. First let me start by telling you that this is my own personal opinion. I didn&#x27;t not get compensated for this review, only received the razor. When I received it I thought,&amp;#34;wow, I could use a new razor&amp;#34;. But I also thought it would be just as good as any other razors like this. I was wrong. I love this razor. It is lightweight and easy to hold and handle. But my favorite part is that it gives you such a close shave and leaves your skin moisturized. I have found that when I use this razor that I don&#x27;t have to shave as often as I did with other razors. That alone is worth buying. In fact I shaved my legs with this the day before leaving for a 10 day vacation. I did not have to shave my legs at all during those 10 days while on vacation. My legs stayed silky smooth. So b.c of that my husband wanted to try it out and he LOVED it. I know it is meant to be a womans razor but if it works great for him then why not use it. Since receiving the razor we bought another one just for hubby and bought extra refill cartridges for both of us. If you get a chance to try this razor out I would definitely go for it. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This razor is 5 star. It has comfortable grip, it&#x27;s attractive, and it&#x27;s sturdy. I can&#x27;t imagine using another razor. I originally got the razor from bzzagent.com to test out so it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor as a BzzAgent.  I like the feel of the handle . I have used Schick razors in the past, but this is an improvement to others I have tried.  It provided a smooth, clean shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> I received this from Bzzagent to try and it is by far my favorite razor.  I love the angle of the handle most.  It&#x27;s easy to grip and the head pivots well around knees and ankles.  The shave I get is also very very close.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Sensitive Razor complements of a BzzCampaign and I am SO happy I was able to try this free sample! I have never been able to get an extremely close shave without the use of shave gel and without have razor burn due to my sensitive skin. I am happy that Schick Hydro Sensitive Razor accomplished that and more! I now have the closest shave I have ever gotten, did not need to use shave gel or lotion afterwards and after 3 days my legs are STILL smooth and silky! I love this product and will continue to buy the refill cartridges!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you BzzAgent and Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive for a great product!</li>
    <li> I Love this razor I can skip a day shaving using the Schick it shaves so close.If you have not tried it you really must</li>
    <li> A super close shave with no nicks or cuts.  Leaves your skin feeling smooth as if you used lotion already.</li>
    <li> I received the schick hydro silk razor from bzzagent in my bzzkit to try out. I really like how this razor gives me a smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t cause razor bumps. I will continue to purchase this razor because I like it so much,</li>
    <li> This razor gave me the best shave of my life. While using the first cartridge I was skeptical because it seemed that the cartridge ran out so quickly. Once I used the second cartridge I decided to give it more shelf life and see if it would continue to work and it did. I am very sensitive to razors and was at first skeptical to try something new but Bzzagent.com gave me the opportunity and I am glad I tried it out. I recommend these razors to anyone who needs a razor for sensitive skin. I got it free from Bzzagent! #Gotitfree #bzzagent #schickhydrosilksensitive</li>
    <li> I received a razor while being part of a bzzagent trial campaign. The trial is over and I am still using the razor and have purchased additional cartridges. The razor works so well and there is no need for shave gel. you wont be disapointed.</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor!  I have the most sensitive skin and this razor really lives up to its name! No bumps, knicks or cuts and ever so smooth. Highlu recommended!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I hate wearing shorts or skirts that show red bumps when I shave. I also don&#x27;t like razors that don&#x27;t do the job and are high priced. I received Schick Hyrdo Silk Sensitive Razor for free from Bzzagent and I have to say this is the best razor ever. To this day I still use it. I have even went and bought refills. This razor leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky. No more razor bumps. I don&#x27;t have to shave till a couple of days later. The razor glides and hugs your curves with no problems. Although you can use soap with the razor I recommend using Skintimate Shaving Gel. The combo works really well together. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll ever use another razor and I hope (for my sake) they don&#x27;t discontinue this razor anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I have some of the most sensitive skin out there. With this razor shaving is a breeze and such a relief because I don&#x27;t have to worry about bumps or rashes. I received the my first original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign, &amp; immediately fell in love, &amp; I will continue to purchase them.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a bzz campaign and its the best razor I have ever used. Such a smooth close shave and you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area. Blades last a long time too!</li>
    <li> One of the most comfortable razors I have ever used. It was even delicate enough for my bikini line. Just wet the strip and your good to go. The moisture strip is enough that you don&#x27;t have to use shave cream.</li>
    <li> Got this razor as a campaign and didnt really know if it would work so i said the heck with it and tried it out and it was the most wonderful experience you could want from a razor the razor came with a refill and a free shaving cream coupon.... Doesnt cut scratch or leave irritation leaves skin silky smooth love this razor ....</li>
    <li> I got this razor from my Bzz campaign and I love it. It&#x27;s my new friend. I get a very close shave and my legs stay smooth longer once you use it you won&#x27;t go back to any other razors.</li>
    <li> Sleek and easy to carry around. Best shaving product out there and the best one I&#x27;ve used. No irritation and razor pumps.</li>
    <li> i received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign. I have always dealt with razors that didn&#x27;t get close enough without leaving razor bumps. The first time i used this razor i was hooked!!! It gives a close, smooth and razor bumb fee shave. I am in LOVE with this razor. Great for underarms, legs and bikini.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised how close of a shave I was able to achieve with this razor. And with it being for sensitive skin it worked perfectly without any nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> I have used a Schick Quattro for a while, so this is certainly a step up, but I was shocked at just how sharp these blades were! It shaved beautifully, and I was carefully not to press down, but to just let it glide over my legs, but I still sliced myself open over and over again. And the crazy part is that the blades were so sharp, I never even felt it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contour of the handle is amazing. It really gives the razor a nice grip and sits well in your hand. The blades have moisturizing beads and strips all along the head, which makes the shave even softer and closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, this is my new razor. I used the Quattro for what felt like a decade and was content with it... until I used this one! Just don&#x27;t press to hard or you will fillet yourself! Seriously sharp!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. It really helped with my sensitive skin so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn or rashes later on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of razors over the years, and before trying this one I had just convinced myself that each one inevitably came with its own downside. Some caused bumps, some caused redness that lasted for hours even in combination with multiple other &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; products, or they would leave my skin looking nice, but the smoothness would only last a few hours to a day after shaving before I was stubbly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has completely changed my feelings on shaving. The shave is really close, AND my skin looks and feels smooth for days after shaving! No redness, no bumps, just beautifully smooth skin. And unlike other razors that seemed too good to be true (and ultimately were), the blades have a much longer life than I&#x27;m used to. I tested the razor and refill cartridges for a bzzAgent as part of their BzzCampaign months ago, and I&#x27;m only on my second set of blades now. I don&#x27;t see myself ever going back to another razor again!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick(R) Hydro Silk(R) Sensitive Razor and SkintimateÂ® Shave Gel from BzzAgent. I was very excited to be able to try this product, especially this time of year in Minnesota.I have DRY, DRY and more DRY skin. I typically purchase razors that are on sale, normally refillable razors of other brands, Venus, etc. I have never purchased a Schick razor in the past so this was a totally new experience.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed about the razor was the 5 blades and the moisture strips on either side. It looked like a beefy razor, less likely to miss those stray hairs. I also appreciated the case that was covering the razor blades itself. Easy to open when needed but protected from accidental cuts from an open razor.&lt;br /&gt;The first shave I used the provided shave gel with the razor, I noticed results immediately. Nice close shave. Normally after a shave I need to apply lotion and even then my legs still itch. My legs were smooth, and no red bumps! Most importantly I was not itching my legs. That is one of the most annoying and embarrassing things when you are in public itching your legs because they are so dry from shaving. I was also pleasantly pleased with underarm shaving with this razor. No razor burn or irritation. That is the worst feeling to have especially when you need to put deodorant on. OUCH! This is a common issue with other razors for me.&lt;br /&gt;I decided for the next shave I would try it without the shave gel. Still pleasantly pleased. No razor burn or dry skin following the shave.&lt;br /&gt;The true test came when I used my normal razor the next shave. This shave I used my Venus razor with a new blade. Close shave, but again, itchy legs following and irritated underarms. I applied my lotion and still had issues later on in the day with dry legs. The shave gel did help a bit with the dryness in combination with the Venus razor, but nothing like the Schick razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have decided that the Schick razor is highly superior to other razors that I have used out there and I plan on making this my razor of choice from now on.used out there and I plan on making this my razor of choice from now on.</li>
    <li> After trying this razor through BzzAgent, I&#x27;m never going back to my old razor again. It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin and gives you a clean, smooth feel. Absolutely love it and fully recommend!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this razor!!!  I got this razor in my Bzzagent kit and have continued to use even after I rated it.  The close and smooth shave that it leaves my legs is perfect to start the summer.  I have noticed that my shave lasts longer and it has a lotion strip on it to make your shave even better.  I used to use another Schick brand for over 5 years, but this one is it for me.  I got in the in Fall 2013 and haven&#x27;t change brands yet.  Easy to use and a great price.  It went beyond my expectations for a razor, seeing that I&#x27;ve been using the same brand for over 5 years and decided to change to this Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor.I recommend this razor for anyone that prefers a close, smooth shave with a moisture strip.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzzagent Campaign.  I have this using it ever since and bought several refills :-) I just love how soft my legs feels.</li>
    <li> Ever since I tried my first Schick I&#x27;ve never gone back to Venus. I used Venus for ten years and now would never go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly wax but there are times I need to drag out the razor, and the Schick HydroSilk is always reliable. I&#x27;ve never had any nicks or cuts with them, unlike the Venus that ate my armpits alive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always will use this brand</li>
    <li> I have used lots of disposable razor and this is the best by far. You get a close shave but not the usual irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a trial through BzzAgent.  I usually have trouble with bumps and sensitive skin- I use this razor for my legs, underarms and bikini area and have had NO issues with sensitive skin, no cuts or nicks, and it leaves my skin so smooth.  The handle has nice contours, so it&#x27;s easy to use in the shower.  I will never buy another brand of razor again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, skin feels pretty rough after, not as smooth as the venus embrace I usually use but still shopping for an even better option.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from bzz agent as part of a campaign. I love this razor. Normally I have shave bumps after I shave and with this I did not. It gives a really close shave and does not dull as easily as other brands. i will continue to use this. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor is the best razor ever!  This one replaced my Venus razor.  There are 5 blades and this incredible hydrating serum.  Say goodbye to razor burn, bumps and that awful stinging! You get such a close shave.  The handle makes it easy to use even on knees and ankles.  The blade lasts for a very long time.  I received this razor free as part of a BzzAgent campaign where we try and review products honestly.  I now buy refills for this razor and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I received the schick hydro silk sensitive razor as part of a  bzz campaign it&#x27;s the best razor by far I&#x27;ve ever used. It gets a close shave with no bumps or irritation ! My skin is pretty sensitive and this razor never causes me any problems</li>
    <li> The smoothness and close shave this blade gives is like nothing before. I typically have a five o clock leg shadow after shaving in the morning. As a female, this is very embarrassing and frustrating. I&#x27;ve typically resorted to using men&#x27;s shavers. For me, they seem to give the best shave. I received a BUZZAGENT free razor and though heck, Ill try and boy was I happy. This is the best shaving experience Ive ever encountered! A must try for those females who are looking for a better, closer and less abrasive shave.</li>
    <li> I received my first Hydro as part of a Bzz Campaign and was over joyed after the first use. It was a close shave and I didn&#x27;t even get razor burn. Usually I would have to use my husbands razor to accomplish that. Not anymore though. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out the Schick Hydro Silk Razor using the BzzCampaign as a BzzAgent and I have been hooked ever since. It leaves my legs smooth and I have no issues with any bumps, razor burn or rashes from shaving. It is a life savor for my legs and under arms. I will not use anything else at this point. It has made me a true believer!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love this Razor. I original received  this razor as a part of a BzzCampaign. This razor gives a smooth shave and its very moisturizing to my skin. I never get cuts from this Razor which is a huge plus.  It fits comfortably in my hand, I dont feel like its going to fall out of my hand when i I grip it. I would buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> I love these razors and I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it free through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve bought another cartridge pack since the campaign and they are great!</li>
    <li> This razor is so good. I received a free one from BzzAgent to try and review.  I have now switched to this razor because I like it so much.  It leaves my legs smooth and moisturized.  #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I got this to try for free as a BzzAgent and am happy to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Price is totally on point with other similar products&lt;br /&gt;Handle feels great&lt;br /&gt;Love that it&#x27;s refillable!&lt;br /&gt;SO smooth feeling afterwards&lt;br /&gt;my super dry skin did NOT need shave cream to go with it, so I loved the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Almost *too* slick (I actually cut myself more because I probably wasn&#x27;t as careful because it was so smooth!)&lt;br /&gt;I actually think that the hair grows back faster using this than the Schick Quattro I&#x27;ve used for years previously.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find that the sensitive version is all that different from the regular Schick Hydro variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that this is GREAT for touchups, but I&#x27;ll still keep my Schick Quattro around for big jobs.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a Bzzcapaign.  I just needed to try out the razor and Bzz about it.  I have very dry and sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a very close and smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t leave me with bumps or cuts.  This is a great razor!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this Via bzz agent and this razor is awesome. Works great. The only down fall is the hanger provided sucks. The razor does not fit it, and it falls off easily.</li>
    <li> Due to the fact that I&#x27;m a bzzagent, I received this razor to review, and boy was I impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I&#x27;m a disposable razor girl, no pricey gadgets or pesty refills to have to buy or worry about.&lt;br /&gt;But after experiencing this razor, goodbye cheap disposables.&lt;br /&gt;You get a smooth close shave, no nicks or pulls.&lt;br /&gt;The refills last for many shaves and they are very easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely try this razor, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzzcampaign so I got to try it totally free. I am so happy with this razor.  I have extremely sensitive skin so shaving is usually awful for me, razors leave my skin so irritated.  The Schick hydro silk sensitive is not like other razors I&#x27;ve used the moisturizing strip actually works.  After shaving my skin feels moisturized and it&#x27;s not itchy. I highly recommend this razor not only for people with sensitive skin but those of you that just want a good quality razor that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> I chose four stars because this razor has lots of blades in it, and it has the moisture strip.  I&#x27;m not sure what makes it good for sensitive skin, but it did work on my legs.  I have ecezma on one leg, and it was very gentle over that small patch of skin.  For the underarms, it wasn&#x27;t so great.  I have to shave in two different directions under my arms, and I ended up getting several ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This razor is simply put amazing. it glides accost my skin making it feel smooth and silky so effortlessly the only thing i&#x27;d change is i&#x27;d pot a hole in the bottom of the handle to make it so i can hang it on my shower.</li>
    <li> I have used other razors for years, but this is the first razor that has not caused irritation on my skin after multiple uses.  The handle is nice and I am able to grip it comfortable.  It never slips out of my hand like others in the past have.  I have also let my child start using this razor (she&#x27;s 13), and she has no irritation with it either.</li>
    <li> Fantastic smoothness and moisturizing. Perfect of any woman. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who shaves. Especially gentle on the underarm area.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor as part of being a bzzagent! I was really excited to try I still use it 2 this day i recently changed the shavor head since it came with another one and I love it! I will bit be changing my razor anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Perfect combination: My sensitive skin and my Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor &#x3D; Heaven! It&#x27;s the perfect way to shave and not have irritating red marks on my legs; the guard around the head make for a smooth transition to shaving! I got to #TryItFree from #BzzAgent and I love it !!!</li>
    <li> This razor is great for just shaving legs. I get zero irritation in this area. Still getting bumps in the bikini area though so unless they have an ultra sensitive razor, looks like I&#x27;m still a two different razor brand type of girl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got to try this BzzCampaign.  It&#x27;s now the only razor I use.  It leaves my sensitive skin smooth and extra soft.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from a razor.</li>
    <li> To be honest I can be pretty picky when it comes to razors.. I have cut my legs shaving countless times and have scars to prove it! That being said, I must say I was intrigued when I was offered a free sample from BzzAgent. Wow. I love  how this razor handles. Glides smoothly around the curves and not a cut in sight. That is good enough for me!</li>
    <li> I received it as a member of Bzz Agent and have to say I was completely impressed by it.  For many years I have been using disposable razors and have tried some refillable ones from time to time, but none can compare to the close shave I received from this razor.  I highly recommend you try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I used the Venus Embrace razor for years until joining a BzzAgent campaign where I was sent this one for free. I was skeptical at first, wondering how different these razors could possibly be from one another, but I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a comfortable grip, and it&#x27;s not at all slippery when it gets wet, so you probably won&#x27;t drop it while shaving in the shower. I also love that it comes with a little plastic cover to clip over the razor head. You ever put your razor down when it&#x27;s wet and come back to it being stuck on whichever surface you rested it on? Problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really see you going wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Razor is good.  I do not like how quickly the moisture strip swells up all sticky and then dissolves very quickly.  Razor does work well at giving a close shave though for the first couple of times.  I received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign.  I would buy again with a coupon, but not at full price.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor that works well and also helps to keep your legs moisturized. I like how it shaves closely and has a handle that grips well even when wet. I received this for free and am a BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> One of the very best razors I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Did wonders for my skin and left them smooth. I just love it!!</li>
    <li> I recieved mine in a buzz campaigne and I love it. My skin loves it to , it makes my skin so soft and no razor bumps.</li>
    <li> When I signed up for my bzzkit, (I am a bzz agent and was offered this for free to try it and see if I liked it, I accepted). I wanted to try this razor but after receiving it I was afraid.  I have been using an old fashioned razor for a long time thinking that extra blades would create havoc on my skin.  Well, that&#x27;s not the case, the blade hugged the curves of every part of my body that I tried it on.  I was really impressed with how well it did with under the arms which is a difficult place for a razor to tread.  The gel extruded was a bit shocking as I am not a reader until something really interests me and did not read the directions prior to using.  I have read them now as I wanted to know about the clear &#x27;goop&#x27; that was not the same as what I had lathered on and understand that this is supposed to happen and is a good thing, it did not interfere with the shave as I thought it might. I also understand how to store the razor, funny thing, it comes with something so it can easily and conveniently hang in the shower, that was sarcastic, there&#x27;s a reason it comes with this handy tool, the blade should be stored upright.  This is the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had since I stopped using a depilatory and the razor itself, is light as a feather.</li>
    <li> For the longest time I stopped using women&#x27;s razors because men&#x27;s razors would give me a closer, smoother shave.  However, this razor cut through the hair like butter and was girly and easier to hold on to.  I received my razor as part of a BzzCampaign through Bzzagent and think it is the best product for shaving.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  Blades are expensive but last FOREVER.</li>
    <li> Im usually one to buy whatever razor is cheapest, or that I have a coupon for, but when I was sent the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive razor, I completly changed my mind about purchasing razors! I have very sensitive skin, along with Psoriasis, so shaving is not always something I look forward to. I used this right before my sisters wedding and my legs were so smooth, and were not irritated at all! It&#x27;s hard to find any product that will do it&#x27;s usual job, AND a little extra. This, did just that. My legs felt smooth, but also felt moisturized after shaving! I will definelty continue purchasing the cartridges for the razor, love the results I get!&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this razor by BzzAgent as part of a BzzCampaign, thanks BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> First time using this razor and so far it&#x27;s been excellent, my legs are smooth after only one slide.</li>
    <li> i love this razor it is very good for sensetive skin and i love the handle .</li>
    <li> let me feeling silky and smooth</li>
    <li> It seems that when I use other razors my shave lasts longer, this this i need to shave everyday. I still need to use shave cream/gel and the reason I bought this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor from BzzAgent for free, I absolutely loved this razor, it was beyond amazing, I have really sensitive skin, especially when blades become dull, this razor is great when it comes to shaving, the blades are always sharp, and I don&#x27;t have to put extra effort into having smooth silky legs, I would highly recommend this razor to anyone. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better razor to try out. Give this razor a try and you will be amazed on its high quality and performance.</li>
    <li> My skin is not especially sensitive but I first tried this razor during the middle of winter when my skin does get very dry.  I received the razor as part of a BzzKit  and am forever grateful that I was introduced to this product.  The first time I used it I had to feel my leg to be sure it was really shaving, it slid over my skin that smoothly.  I also did not feel like I needed to slather on the lotion when I got out of the tub after shaving.  if it makes my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin feel this good it has to be great on sensitive skin types.</li>
    <li> I really liked all the coverage from the many blades. Also liked the gel strip ot helped cool any burn from shaving.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor to try as part of a Bzz Campaign. It left my legs feeling soft and smooth. The handle was easy to grip, and didn&#x27;t feel slippery in my hand.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive dry skin and have problems with shaving. The Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor provides a smooth comfortable shave with no nicks, cuts or irritation. I got one for my daughter who suffers from armpit rashes after shaving. After the first use she was smooth, comfortable, and rash free. Putting on deodorant afterwards was not a problem.  I love this product and will continue to use it happily! I received my first Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor as part of the BzzAgent campaign and am thrilled to have been part of that group[[ASIN:B006DR2BEW Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor]]</li>
    <li> I was giving this product to try by the BzzAgent .com people and so glad i was chosen.&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with sensitive skin &amp; hard to shave legs/under arms. I have thick hair that doesn&#x27;t shave very easily. This razor has been a life saver! The shave latterly lasts a day or two longer than any other razor and that is saying a lot for me! I highly recommend this razor to ANYONE! not just those with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I received the original razor as a part of a Bzz Campaign!  I was pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave as well as the way my skin felt after the shave.  My legs were soft and smooth immediately.  I have recommended this razor to my family and colleagues.  I will never use another razor.</li>
    <li> I got this &amp;iacute;tem thanks to bzzagent. Com&lt;br /&gt;The p4isuct its great I recomend it. Go get it at your favorite store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brand for years. Recently I had the opportunity to try this, and now I&#x27;ll never go back to the others. The hydrating strip lasts much longer, it moisturizes better, and the razor seems to last a little bit longer. The handle of this isn&#x27;t much different than other brands, but what it does have that the others didn&#x27;t was a holder that I could put on the wall to keep the razor from constantly being wet. Also, since it is for sensitive skin, I seemed to have less razor bump. I totally recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from BzzCampaign and just purchased my own, amazing razor, leaves your skin extra silky. I have sensitive skin and these razors do not give me razor bump or burn! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a BzzAgent campaign.  I really liked how smooth this razor made my sensitive skin.  The moisturizing strip can get a little slimy at times, and the razor is really sharp when you first get it (be very careful).  But otherwise it gave me a smooth clean shave and my skin didn&#x27;t break out like it often does.</li>
    <li> This razor is easy to hold onto and shaves pretty close.  I&#x27;m not thrilled with the way the head pivots.  I do like that the moisturizing strip doesn&#x27;t get goopy or clog up the blades.</li>
    <li> Love this razor! I think it does a pretty great job for sensitive skin, while still giving me a close shave at the same time. I love the water activated lotion/beads that help provide a smooth shave for sensitive skin and almost make it where you don&#x27;t really even need shaving cream! The grip of the razor works fine and I like that you get a protective travel cover for the razor as well!</li>
    <li> I got this razor from bzzagent. This gets the job done especially when you use it with shaving gel. Its the best razor so far that I ever used.</li>
    <li> Received as a sample and it has replaced the razor I was using previously.  Shave is closer and my legs are less irritated.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of the BZZ campaign. I really liked this razor. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin. I dropped it once and the blade fell off, and it&#x27;s not too challenging to put it back on. I am really glad that I was able to trial this razor and will buy it in the future!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor! No razor burn and it hangs perfectly in the shower. I have sensitive skin and this one doesn&#x27;t ever bother me until it&#x27;s time to change blades.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try for free through a Bzzagent Campaign.  It&#x27;s a decent disposable razor.  Its quite lightweight and feels nice in my hand.  The strip is very moisturizing and my legs feel very smooth after using it.  It&#x27;s very easy to change the cartridges.  My only complaint is that I seem to nick myself more using this razor than others - not sure if its because I hold it differently, or the blades are too sharp, or what.  But, all in all, I would purchase this razor and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a bzz campaign for free :) I love this razor!  I get a close shave without all the razor cuts or bumps.  I definitely have a new friend now!</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical when it comes to razors, however this one worked like a charm. Glides smoothly on my legs and arms with no nicks or cuts.  I didn&#x27;t use Skintimate though...I always use hair conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times so far and each times I have been pleased with the end result. Since I am not a hairy person once a month seems to suffice...a 4pk of blades lasts about a year. For me it is economical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jurseenae&lt;br /&gt;I am a BZZ Agent</li>
    <li> I am someone who no matter the weather I have the worst skin you could imagine.  Constantly dry and itchy!  I started using the schick hydro silk sensitive razor this past winter and it has made such a difference.  I feel like not only does my skin look and feel better but I am not having to constantly shave.  This is the closest shave and definitely worth the price.  I have fallen in love and will never go back to my old razor.</li>
    <li> It is dermatological tested and contains hypo allergic moisturizing serum. The 5 blades gets every hair and leaves a smooth finish. The pivoting head handles curves well, and the infused Shea butter leaves the skin smooth without bumps. I am a buzz agent and happy to have tried and reviewed this item.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It is by far the best i&#x27;ve ever used. I will never go back to another razor again. I&#x27;m always stocked up on these because my stores seem to run out when i need them. I got to try this razor a few months ago. Blew me away. It glides right over my skin, no nicks, cuts, razor burn. Everything you love about a razor, trust me, get this one!!</li>
    <li> I first received this razor as a sample from BzzAgent and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. It provides such a close shave without the irritation. I have become a repeat user of this product and love how I get the perfect results every time.  #GotItFree #IMABZZAGENT</li>
    <li> I am a buzz agent and was excited that I was selected for this campaign. As soon as I received my kit in the mail, I tried out the new razor and absolutely love it. I have very sensitive skin and this razor was gentle on my skin but yet gave a good close shave. I purchase razors for my 3 daughters and they love the razor as well. We will definitely be a family making a permanent change to this razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a buzz campaign, and I&#x27;m so glad I did because it&#x27;s my new razor! I was using various Venus razors before I got this one and no matter how fancy it was or how many blades it had, I still had red bumps after shaving my bikini line. I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s even possible, but with this one I just don&#x27;t get them, period. I haven&#x27;t thought about using bikini zone or worried about it at all since I got started using this razor -- it&#x27;s a game changer and I love it!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a BzzCampaign.  I really liked how it gave me a close shave and my skin felt so smooth and silky.  I usually do not use razors as I am concerned about knicks but this razor did not give me any worries at all as it glided along the skin and left me with a close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for years and none of them last this long (MONTHS!) and feel this good during and after using! I originally got this free from Bzzagent and I&#x27;m so happy I did because I&#x27;ve found my razor!</li>
    <li> This razor is a pretty good steal. I use to use the Venus brand I was always scared to try new things but bzzagent gave me the Schick hydro silk sensitive to try for free in exchange I leave my honest opinion on the product. In my eyes it shaved equal or maybe even better then the Venus embrace and kept my legs smooth for a good amount of time. I did not get razor burn that I sometimes get cause my legs are sensitive the only down fall is when I shaved my arm pits it was a little tender. But in all this is a great deal and a great razor!</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with sensitive skin and finding products that don&#x27;t irritate it. The Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor was a great option when shaving my legs and it didn&#x27;t let me down. I received it as part of the BzzAgent campaign. It didn&#x27;t knick or cut my legs during shaving, and it left my skin silky and smooth afterward, along with no redness or bumps. Recommended for those with the same problems or if you are just looking for a great razor.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this new Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor!!! It is so simple to use, and easy to hold on to, even with shaving cream all over your hands.  Its angled just right, and works perfectly on my sensitive legs and under arms.  I would recommend anyone to get it.</li>
    <li> the Schick hydro razor is great!  I love the fact that it glides so smoothly over my skin.  I was really impressed with the overall ease of the handle and blades.  very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Seriously, one of the best razor I&#x27;ve used in a while! i received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign and was very glad! The 5 blades cut close to the hair follicle and with the help of a built in gel cream make it the perfect razor, even on the go. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a little over 4 months and i&#x27;m happy to say i&#x27;m still using to this day. Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy the THIS razor today!</li>
    <li> I received a free razor through my BzzAgent Campaign and I absolutely loved this razor.  I replaced my former razor with this one because it caused less irritation and got a closer shave.  After shaving, my legs can go a few days without shaving instead of half a day with my former razor.  The razor is a bit pricey but worth the time it saves in the long run.  The handle and case are great as well.</li>
    <li> Five blades gives such a close shave! I usually use the cheapie plastic double blade razors and have to go over the same area a few times (leaving wonderful razor burn) but this was quick and left my legs smoother than usual. It came with a plastic suction cup holder but I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay on my shower wall. I actually have never been able to get suction cups to stay so it may just be my bathroom, it would be awesome to have the holder though. I used the razor with their moisturizing shave gel which probably helped with the great shave. Such a small investment to pamper yourself! With a toddler I get to take a full, long, uninterrupted shower twice a week and it feels great to have such a nice razor and step out so smooth without red bumps. Small luxuries!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free to try through BzzAgent. I was pretty excited to receive my package in the mail and test out this new razor.  I am a Venus user. I have probably used every razor known to man (even the ones used by men) but I always come crawling back to the Venus wondering why I ever strayed in the first place. It is the only razor I have ever found that didn&#x27;t leave my legs looking like I just walked through a mile of thistle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor.  First I will say that the razor does do what it says. My legs ended up smooth. It did not irritate my skin at all. No red spots or scraps.  No itching through out the day like some razors can cause. Very much like my beloved Venus. But that is where the similarities end. For starters, the water activated moisture strip, a big selling point for this product, became very slimy and slippery.  It made the razor seem dull. It also has a short life span. My usual razor typically lasts a week. This razor was spent after shave two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while in the end my legs were smooth and irritant free, I think I will be sticking with my old trusty razor.</li>
    <li> I received the shick hydro sensitive razor in a bzzkit. I figured all razors are alike I used the same one for twenty years.I now have a new razor the shick hydro sensitive razor has a nicley designed handle which makes it easy to hold on to in  the shower even when your hand are wet and soapy</li>
    <li> I got this razor primarily for my wife, as it a woman&#x27;s razor, though I have used it on my face from time to time.  Aside from the fact a leg and armpit razor too big for the mustache area, the razor does a good job getting rid of even coarse beard hair.  My wife has been similarly impressed with it&#x27;s work in more traditional uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few brief drawbacks of the item.  Like many people we keep the razors for use in the shower.  Two problems make this difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  The included suction cup razor holder sucks in every way except sticking to a wall.  It is not well designed and half the times putting the razor back in the holder leaves it dropping to the tub floor.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  The gel used to provide a nice clean shave seems to react to both heat and water, leaving a gooey, slick mess at the head of the razor, shortening the razor&#x27;s life and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fix those issues and it&#x27;s 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I received this from BzzAgen and the first time I used the razor it was horrible.  I used it with conditioner because that&#x27;s how I usually shave my legs and I wanted the comparison to be fair.  The rubber around the blades made it impossible to glide it across my legs and it felt more like it was scraping my legs (like the whole first layer of skin + hair) instead of just shaving them.  It burned a lot when I rinsed them off too.  My legs were very red afterwards and a bit rashy, but no razor bumps.  As far as the closeness of the actual shave was concerned it did not work any better or worse then my old cheap disposable razors and my legs were still stubbly (probably because i was too afraid to press down very hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the second attempt I used the Skintimiate Shave Gel and it made a huge difference.  It glided much more easily but I still don&#x27;t think the rubber should be around the blade.  After the first swipe and  the lotion is gone it sticks to the skin again.  It was a much closer shave but my skin still burned and I was still red and blotchy when I got out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only really good thing I can say about it is that so far it has lasted me through 6 shaves without showing much wear.  My others razors would have needed to be thrown out after the second.  I haven&#x27;t done a price comparison to see if it would save me anything, but if it did that would be the only reason I would start using it regularly.</li>
    <li> Watch out: The package says &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not! Stinks, in fact. Schick, people who buy fragrance free products don&#x27;t want fragrance, period.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a super smooth finish and your skin feeling super moisturized then look no further.  I have used every razor out there and never had my legs feel as smooth and soft as they did after using the Schick.  Let&#x27;s not forget how amazing it is that the shave is so close that you don&#x27;t need to feel like you have to shave your legs before bed so you don&#x27;t cut the sheets to shreds.  I will never use another razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using men&#x27;s razors for years, they tend to be more reasonably priced, last longer, shave better, and be all around better. I decided to try out the female-marketed equivalent of my men&#x27;s razor of choice, Schick Hydro 5 (Sensitive) and it was a nightmare. I had to go over the same spots several times, I broke out in razor burn and acne on my legs, and all the other places that require shaving were basically impossible to effectively tackle with this razor. My skin is very sensitive and all razors leave me a little itchy for a couple hours after, but these make me itch for DAYS. It&#x27;s just not a good time. My brother, who also uses the men&#x27;s Schick Hydro 5 razors, came to visit recently and forgot his razor, so I let him have the extra blade that comes in this pack because I&#x27;d switched back to my usual blades (I warned him and told him my gripes but he still insisted that a crappy razor was better than nothing) and he also had difficulties using this razor. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> These razors give such a nice smooth shave but at a high cost of major irritation and nicks.</li>
    <li> What woman will turn down the chance to try a new razor? Especially when it&#x27;s a Schick razor. Schick is, after all, the holy grail of disposable razors and has been a mainstay in my household since as far back as I can remember. So when BzzAgent offered me a chance to try Schick&#x27;s new Hydro Silk Sensitive Care razor for free, I jumped at it -  literally. My legs couldn&#x27;t get my butt in my desk chair fast enough to accept the challenge. Which makes sense, since my legs are the test subject. And the testing couldn&#x27;t come at a better time with Spring around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, after a grueling winter full of snow and ice and personal neglect, my legs are in desperate need of a little TLC. This usually requires the use of a power hedge trimmer, a sand blaster, and lots of lotion. Not pretty, but it gets the job done. However, with Schick&#x27;s 5 Curve-Sensing blades and skin guards, I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn, cuts, or dry skin anymore. The Hypoallergenic Moisturizing Serum infused with Shea Butter leaves my legs feeling silky smooth and so healthy looking they actually glow. My legs have never looked this good before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my legs lately too, from both men and women. People just want to touch them because they can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m not wearing nylons. Even my little niece, who&#x27;s only five years old, couldn&#x27;t resist cuddling up to my legs during a movie night recently. Now that&#x27;s what I call huggable legs!</li>
    <li> Pleased with my order.  Product was as described and delivered in timely manner -- packaged well.</li>
    <li> Horrible razor. It tore up my legs. I haven&#x27;t cut myself in years and after my first use I had scrapped off the skin on my shin and cut myself around the ankles. I tried a new blade and still ended up with cuts and razor burn. I&#x27;m switching back to the Quattro, which I&#x27;ve never had trouble with.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m sold!!! Best razor EVER!!  I got a disposable one when I bought my regular pack of Schick Quatro, and loved it. So I wanted to switch to these, and boy I&#x27;ll never use another razor. They glide so smoothly over the skin, and afterwards my legs feel so soft and hydrated.  Absolutely the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had to change the blade in months, and still getting a great clean shave.  Price is great, and refills are affordable.  Highly reccommend, and also recommend it&#x27;s men&#x27;s Schick Hydro 5 for men.  My husband loves his!</li>
    <li> I  met someone recently who said his father has always used razors either for or partially for women because they are so gentle. When I got the silk, I decided to give this MY test...and then another test. So first it got my test -- the guy test. I do bleed easily and in 1990 had a near fatal accident where I had 13 stitches in my upper lip and 13 on my chin. One area near the chin is hard to shave totally, it always looks a little dark. I used this razor and was VERY happy with how it shaved my face...gently but truly thoroughly. I was about to write this review..and then decided to give it to my foster son&#x27;s daughter Kayla, who&#x27;s 18 1/2. She LOVED it as well. So Schick has a double appeal product here: a guy who cuts easily can use it on his face and be extremely happy with its gentleness and precision. And a young woman can use it and feel it&#x27;s one of the best razor&#x27;s she has ever used. I&#x27;m sure Schick doesn&#x27;t market it it that way but it is a cross over product!</li>
    <li> I got this a part of a Bzzagent campaign and it&#x27;s by far the best razor I have Ever used. I have sensitive skin and this leaves no cuts or irritation.</li>
    <li> I hate to yell, but when I say &amp;#34;BUY THIS RAZOR&amp;#34; I mean, seriously, do yourself a favor and buy the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor, like TODAY. I received a sample through BzzAgent, and I fell in love with it the first time I used it. I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be careful what razors I use, and it was nice knowing I didn&#x27;t have to worry over whether this razor would make my skin look like that of a red, scaly lizard (like other razors have in the past). And I can go several days in between shaving because it&#x27;s a close shave that lasts a long time, and it also leaves your skin feeling oh so smooth and sexy. (Yes, my husband loved it too. *wink*) So yeah, I have to yell ... BUY THIS RAZOR!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought that it was good for the most part, I don&#x27;t believe it keep my legs moist enough. Could have used more cream to hydrate. But overall I was pleased. It cut similar to a mans razor which I was impressed by. I have corse hair and I usually use a mans razor. This did the trick!</li>
    <li> I got this item for FREE for being a BzzAgent. I was so excited to try this as I have sensitive skin and after shaving I always have red blotches. This razor was the BEST yet. Not only did it leave my skin soft, but I didn&#x27;t get any red blotches or irritated skin. I will ABSOLUTELY use this again.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Easy grip so i can hold it with soapy hands:) I have very sensitive skin so when i used this i was a little iffy about it but its GREAT! I suggest this razor to anyone who suffers from iritated skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors i have ever used. Lengthens the time in between shaves and leaves my legs feeling smooth and silky. I even payed full price for these the other day at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Love this razor! My legs are smooth and nick free. Very happy with the gel that is in the razor part that helps to shve</li>
    <li> I have used disposable razors for years and never thought the price was worth the results of a more expensive razor, until I tried Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor as a part of a bzzagent campaign where I got it for free.  I was instantly hooked and have continued to purchase the razor and refills for my shaving needs.  The serum and moisturizers help protect my skin during shaving and hydrates the skin at the same time - no more little red bumps for me!  The only downside to this razor is that the razor blade head is pretty big, but with 4 razors that&#x27;s expected and well worth it! I definitely recommend this item to anyone with sensitive skin, or anyone just looking for a good razor in general!</li>
    <li> leaves my legs super smooth! the blade also has lasted much longer than my other razors. I haven&#x27;t had to change the blade in 2 weeks. definitely recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this product, I received a free razor as a BzzAgent.  The razor left a smooth, long lasting shave.</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor kit from a Bzz campaign and I love this razor.  When I first signed up to recieve it I didn&#x27;t realize that this was the same razor my sister was using and while I was home I used it and fell in love.  Once I received the kit I was stoked to find out it was the razor I&#x27;d been wanting to buy.  It&#x27;s a great razor and the best I&#x27;ve used yet.  My legs feel silky smooth after using it and the cartridges last a long time.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I get razor burn super easy! This razor is by far one of the best I have ever used. Shaves nice and close with no razor burn when I get out of the shower. I will continue using this Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor and recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Every time I find a razor I love, it ends up not working as well after a couple of weeks. This razor has been consistently perfect. My skin is soft and I have had no razor burn from it. After 20 years of shaving, I am FINALLY happy.This is going to be the razor I stick with for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and with other razors I was I my able to shave once, maybe twice a week. With this razor I was able to shave every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been known to purchase men&#x27;s razors for shaving my legs because they seem to give a closer shave with less cuts than women&#x27;s disposable razors. Enter the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor. I will NEVER buy another men&#x27;s razor ever again. My legs are so smooth after using this razor. No irritation, no cuts, no red bumps. It also gave a great shave to my very sensitive arm pits, and that&#x27;s always the true test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is designed so that it won&#x27;t slip out of your hand and your hand doesn&#x27;t cramp up while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the best designed razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using disposable razors that seemed like after 1use I had to throw it away. I received mine from Buzzagent and believe me Im in love. The closeness of the shave was great. It was not irritating to my skin. I will continue to use this product..</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a part of a BzzCampaign. I was very pleased with the way it made my skin feel. i dry shave often, and actually did not experience the rash or redness. I recommend this product to people that i talk too. Definitely worth the purchase</li>
    <li> Love this razor , I have thick leg hair and it shaves smooth first time over , will deff be using this for a long time</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor from Bzzagent to try and I was a bit skeptical. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I really did have sensitive skin on my legs that would need a special type of razor for. I immediately replaced my old razor with the Schick. The first time I used it, it was amazing. I got such a close shave with no cuts. My skin seemed to feel better and less bumps after shaving than normal. Maybe I do need a sensitive razor. It wasn&#x27;t until I had used up all my free blade cartridges and I pulled out a disposable razor that I had in my linen closet. My legs were cut up, bumpy/razor rash and after shaving, I still felt the hairs. It was horrible. My legs were in rough shape. I am picking up a pack of Schick Sensitive Razor blade next time I am at the store. I am never using anything other than this razor again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever purchase.  It is light and does not give razor bumps. I have brought for my whole family even the men version.  I will never get another brand. I&#x27;m sold</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a BzzCampaign and it is fantastic if you have sensitive skin. As an added bonus, it leaves a smooth, close shave. Plus, the cartridges seem to last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I received this through BzzAgent and was looking forward to try it because I am always on the hunt for the perfect razor. This is GREAT for sensitive skin, I often end up with cuts ALL OVER my legs when I shave (I&#x27;m a sloppy shaver) and this cut down on nicks big time. There&#x27;s also no razor burn or any bumps afterward and my legs feel so smooth. It&#x27;s a really nice razor and I like it and often take it on vacation because I then don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving cream or anything. Becasue of the moisture strips it&#x27;s perfect for those quick shaves before heading to the beach or pool and you don&#x27;t have to worry about irritation. What I didn&#x27;t like about this razor is the price (why must women&#x27;s razor cost so much!? I&#x27;m going broke trying to have smooth legs) and it does seem to dull fast. I had $4 off coupons so that made me buy it again also if it&#x27;s at Sam&#x27;s Club. While it&#x27;s not my Holy Grail razor (I&#x27;m not sure one exists) it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Iam a Bzzagent and i recieved my Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor through Bzzagent for free ive always used disposable razors and once i recieved this from them i no longer use disposable razors in dosent leave razor bumps like disposable ones do and leaves my skin feeling softer then ever ive recommened this razor to many of my family members and friends and this is why i rate it a 5 star review the price is deffiently good for the quality happy shaving everyone</li>
    <li> I love this razor - for someone that hates shaving because my skin is so sensitive and I get rashes everywhere,  this razor is perfect.  My skin is smooth and feels great.  It really is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I received it because I joined BzzAgent and they sent it for free.  I love both.</li>
    <li> I received the razor and cartridges as part of a BzzCampaign and I&#x27;ve been more impressed the longer I&#x27;ve used it.  Recommend A++</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzz Campaign, and really liked it! I&#x27;ve been a disposable razor user for years, and have sensitive skin. I like that I can use this one without needing to worry about too much dryness after, and can grab it for a quick touch-up without needing any shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I received this as a bzzagent campaign, and have gifted and passed out coupons. The resounding reply was phenomenal!  This razor is great!  Super close shave even in your ahem... Lady areas.  No raised bumps or irritation like other razors leave behind.</li>
    <li> Okay, I am a big Venus Embrace fan and have been using it loyally for years after experimenting with tons of razors. The Schick Hydro Silk in my opinion is almost as good as my Venus. The handle is great as it has such a nice grip without any slipping. The shave is a perfect, one stroke and nothing left but silky smooth skin. My legs are not dry and remain moisturized for hours after without any extra lotion.  This works wonderful with Skintimate which is another plus as that is all I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent and Got it Free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I got this in place of the Venus (it was cheaper).  It leaves a great smooth finish but I feel if I need to shave more often with this razor than the Venus razor and I need to replace the razor more frequently.  All in all, worth it if you want a good razor but need to save a few pennies.</li>
    <li> I am a member of BzzAgent and got this razor as part of a trial and I must say I am in love.  Having sensitive skin this razor has done wonders for me.  It is no longer a necessity for me to put lotion on my legs as soon as I get out of the shower in order to avoid my legs turning red and burning after I shave.  Before this razor that was not an option. After using this razor just one time I was hooked and told my mom I found my new razor and do not see myself switching anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;The design of the handle is wonderful and it fits into my hand wonderfully without getting slippery.  I don&#x27;t know about you but I hate when I am shaving and the razor just falls out of my soapy hand; well that has yet to happen to me with this razor and I have been using it for 4 months now.  The one time I did drop it as I was putting it down on the ledge of my tub the cartridge did not even pop off.  My other reusable razors would always have the cartridge pop off when they fell and I would have to put it back on.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of trying this razor I would say go for it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I am very careful about the razors I use and i was skepitical about this as well but to my suprise this razon work like a dream my legs were very smoot the cut was alot closer making my shave last longer and to my liking it did not cause razor burn or any other type of break outs.. I am a happy customer who continues to use my Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor on a regular basis&lt;br /&gt;#IMABZZAGENT #GOTITFREE</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, period!  The closeness of the shave is incredible and it&#x27;s perfectly smooth on the first shave, no nicks or cuts.  The handle is easy to hold and it&#x27;s best designed just right.  This is my razor from now on, and it&#x27;s not too expensive either!</li>
    <li> When I first received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor from BzzAgent, I was skeptical. I don&#x27;t necessarily have sensitive skin and the handle was hard to use. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting anything shaved. However, once I felt my legs after shaving I was AMAZED! My legs have never been so smooth and I was wrong- they are sensitive! Usually I have to wait a week between shaves or I get those irritating little red bumps. Not with the Hydro Silk! I can shave every day with this thing and have smooth legs all the time without the irritating red bumps. I don&#x27;t typically buy refills for razors and opt for the disposables instead but since I tried this razor, I won&#x27;t be going back to disposables! I definitely recommend these to anyone- sensitive skin or not!</li>
    <li> Received it as a part of campaign from Bzzagent. The razor is pretty good in terms of its flexibility of handles and sharpness of blades.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzz Campaign for free! I can honestly say that this is the very best razor I have ever used! I&#x27;ve been shaving for at least 25 years and have never used a razor this great!&lt;br /&gt;First, it give the smoothest and closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the moisture strip on it lasts through multiple shaves. Easily at least 7 shaves!&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s the only disposable razor I&#x27;ve ever been able to use more than 3-4 times without it giving me major nicks and razor burn. I consider my legs to be sensitive when it comes to razor burn and this razor is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m generally a cheapskate when it comes to healthcare products but this is one item I will definitely splurge on from here on out! It is worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this new razor! I have been struggling with my skin, especially on my legs due to a auto-immune disorder for a few years now. I have had a hard time finding the perfect razor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the moisture around the razor razors, along with so many other &amp;#34;sensitive care&amp;#34; razors. NOTHING COMPARES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new and will stay my GO TO razor of choice!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! my legs are left smooth and silky and no nics! it is so close of a shave i can go 2 days longer than normal now</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of my BuzzAgent campaign - free to try out. This is a great razor. I often get razor burn from many other razors I&#x27;ve tried and this one was great! No irritation for my sensitive skin and the design is so comfortable in your hand. Schick has outdone themselves!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent. I really like this razor it worked well for my sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts with this razor which is surprising because there was one by schick that always gave me cuts and I try to avoid those.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this razor through BzzAgent and I am glad I did! Not only does it have a cool design but it leaves my sensitive skinned legs feeling soft, smooth, and silky while keeping them really hydrated! Have already bought another one to keep on hand and am planning on buying refills as well!</li>
    <li> Love it! This razor has taken over for all other razors in my life ! I have very sensitive skin &amp; this razor allows me to have sexy smooth legs in place of bumpy irritated legs!</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars. The Schick Hydro silk sensitive is a great razor.  Leaves the skin smooth and soft and there are no razor burns or irration. I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a bzz campaign and now I use this razor exclusively.  I have very sensitive underarms and this razor works great!</li>
    <li> I received the razor as a part of a BzzCampaign and is amazing!!Leaves skin very smooth and free of redness.&lt;br /&gt;Recib&amp;iacute; el producto como parte de agente bzz, es incre&amp;iacute;ble, muy buena, deja la piel muy suave y libre de enrojecimiento.</li>
    <li> Love the results I&#x27;m getting from this razor! A few months ago, I was  introduced to this particular razor through a campaign from Bzzagent. It has been a real treat for my legs, it leaves them feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be worth the price but after trying it with my BzzCampaign I completely changed my mind. This is the only razor I will use now, I love the smooth soft feeling I have after every shave and not having red bumps is a huge plus. I definitely feel that the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor is worth the price and I will be getting more of them in the future.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor from BzzAgent and I #gotitfree too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not way I&#x27;m giving this razor 5 stars, it gets five stars because of how amazing it is. I have been using this razor since the beginning of this year and I will never change it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had sensitive skin, bad enough that I would shave and then be embarrassed because of all the red bumps in my legs. I would  normally get really dry ashy legs and have to use lots of lotion or oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since using this razor I have not had one red bump, no rash and lotion after is not always required. The five blades on the razor give you a great close shave and I swear you do not have to shave as often either! I love shaving so much now that I have incorporated my arms!</li>
    <li> I Love this Razor!!  Usually I have to shave over the same areas 2 or 3 times before it feels smooth enough for me and I ALWAYS get knicked here and there!  With this razor I only have to shave once and its sooo smooth and NO KNICKS!! I will definitely will e buying more of these!!!</li>
    <li> I received this free to try from bzzagent, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I love the way my skin feels after using this razor, smooth and silky! I started using this to test it out but I have since replaced my previous razor. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This razor is a plus plus. Sleek handle design with good grip. The head is flexible and gives a good close shave. Love the suction cup for hanging in the shower to keep dry</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and I got this razor in a BzzKit a  few months ago.  I was perfectly okay with the one I was using and had recently bought two new 8-packs of blades for that one, a Schick Quattro Titanium.  Since trying the Schick Hydro, however, I have totally abandoned that shaver in favor of the Schick Hydro.  No shaver I have ever used has given me a closer shave and my legs are like silk!  The handle is awesome and does not slip out of my hand.  I am left handed and sometimes I have a problem maneuvering shavers but this one is great.  Now what to do with all those blades for my old razor...</li>
    <li> I love this razor ! It gives me a smooth close shave and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out of my legs , it simply glides across my legs. Unlike , other razors it doesn&#x27;t knick my legs while I&#x27;m shaving or leave itchy red bumps . This razor is great for people with sensitive skin. Also,  I love the big wide handle , it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand when I &#x27;m using it. The Hypoallergenic Moisturizing Serum infused with Shea Butter next to the 5 Curve-Sensing  blades, helps to moisturize and rehydrate my legs. The razor didn&#x27;t irritate my legs like the other razors and products have that I used before. I recommend using Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor, it&#x27;s a great razor and keeps your legs looking fabulous and smooth!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used.It shaves close yet I didn&#x27;t cut myself once even on the first shave. No irritation to skin.My legs feel so soft. Better yet. I don&#x27;t have to shave as often.The handle makes shaving a breeze.Do yourself a favor and try this one. You will never use another razor ever!</li>
    <li> I always try to save money which always led me to cheap disposable razors. Since I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor, I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. It gets such a close shave allowing me to shave less often, and my legs don&#x27;t look dry after shaving.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor as part of a BzzAgent campaign product that I received. I found that it worked well for my sensitive skin. No red bumps or shave marks when I used it. I found it just a little difficult to use for the more delicate bikini area though. I&#x27;d highly recommend the razor, the quality is good and it&#x27;s good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Schick had always been my number 1 choice of razors for as long as I can remember.  I was a fortunate one who was able to try before buying it courtesy of  the bzz campaign . BzzAgent.com sent me the product as a test campaign and unfortunately I can&#x27;t not give them the A+ for it.  Schick had come along way with their products as for features and styles;  as well as sensitivity,  advanced technology on blades,  etc. This product definitely did not stand up to standards.  I broke out in a horrible rash immediately after using it.  I have the most sensitive skin ever,  and I&#x27;ve always been able to user their razors.  This one!  No way!</li>
    <li> I love everything about Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razors, MY daughter is always stealing my refills she and i agree we get a great clean/close shave with no knicks or breakouts.The handle is great to hold on love the style and comes already premoist which is another plus. We also love the cartridge refills. There is just enough last all month. never go out of date or get gross like the other brand.easy to store!  I RECIVED MY FIRST Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor FROM BEING A BUZZAGENT AND GOT IT FOR FREE</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try free from a BzzCampaign on my BzzAgent account. I was really impressed with how well the razor worked on my legs. It gave me a really close shave without the redness and irritation that I normally get from shaving. I would recommend this razor to anyone that wants a nice smooth, close shave wether they have sensitive skin or not. The design of the handle really helps to get around the knees without leaving knicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor as part of a BzzAgent campaign and although I had seen it in stores, it wasn&#x27;t until BzzAgent sent me a coupon to try it for free that I actually tried it.  The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is the moisture bar.  After several shaves, the moisture bar still kept my legs silky smooth after each shave.  It was a weird at first because the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive moisture bar seemed to leave a residue of sorts when compared to my current razor.  However, after a few shaves, the residue dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, this razor competitively priced to similar razors and gives a great shave</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a bzzagent campaign for free :) I&#x27;m in love with this razor!  It is the only razor I have ever found that leave my legs feeling super soft!! I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a bzz campaign for free and it is truly amazing razor!! no more bumps!!</li>
    <li> got this as a gift for a female friend, and she said it&#x27;s her new favorite razor of choice. when asked why for this review, she said the handle made all the difference. easy to grip and the moisture strip left her skin soft and not dry.</li>
    <li> My husband actually used this before I even had the chance - he was caught without any blades for his own razor, so used this instead! He said it worked just great! I claimed it for my own and have been using it for a couple of months now. I love the ergonomic handle - makes it very easy to hold while shaving in the shower. The blades have held up very well, and I haven&#x27;t needed to replace them as often as some other razors. This razor is very gentle and I&#x27;ve had zero problems with skin irritation. Great razor!</li>
    <li> I have really tried tons and tons of razors so I was excited to find this one! I was able to test it out from BzzAgent.com. This was the first razor that left me feeling really soft and smooth without having to use any shaving gel. Also, my legs would still feel smooth even without putting lotion on afterwards. I literally have like 10 un opened packages of different brand of razors that I&#x27;m not going to use because I&#x27;d rather pay more money and get a new one of these!</li>
    <li> This is a very good, high-quality razor. It doesn&#x27;t require the use of soap or foam to leave the skin smooth and silky. A great product, overall.</li>
    <li> After being a loyal user of the Gillette Fusion for years, I recently received the Schick Hydro Silk free as part of being a BzzAgent. I have tried all brands on the market and was never fully satisfied with a razor until now. The closest I ever came to perfection was the Gillette Fusion for men. I liked the 5 blades and felt the other options for women didn&#x27;t capture a close enough shave. I&#x27;m so thrilled I was able to try the new Schick product because not only does it capture a close shave like a men&#x27;s razor, it also has a built in moisture shield to preserve the softness of a women&#x27;s leg. I have noticed that I&#x27;m able to go longer without changing the cartridge than other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past as well. The product is highly recommended and worth the money- finally a razor that includes all of a woman&#x27;s needs in one!</li>
    <li> The blade doesn&#x27;t swivel as well as I thought it would. I had to shave over the area on my legs multiple times to make sure I was getting good coverage.</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free because I am a BzzAgent. I was actually really surprised how well this worked. I have very sensitive skin, and get razor burn basically every time I shave. I have no problems with this razor!&lt;br /&gt;It shaves very close and leaves your skin feeling very smooth. On the top and bottom of the cartridge it has little moisturizing dots that activate when they get wet. It helps the razor to glide smoothly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a very nice shape so it is easy to hold onto and doesn&#x27;t make your hand hurt after you are done using it.&lt;br /&gt;Changing the cartridge is very easy as well. You just push the sides of the handle in and it pops right off, put on the new one and release the sides, you are ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor for everyone, especially for people with really sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Amazing razor its by far the best I have ever used!! The moisture strip us the best and combined with skintimates shave gel you will not get a better shave than that!</li>
    <li> Nice razor nice moisture shaves great got this razor free from bzzAgent and love it  no nicks or cuts with the razor</li>
    <li> I totally love the Schlick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor! My daughter and I Bob have sensitive skin and even in the winter, our legs were rash free!</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a part of BzzAgent, it was absolutely wonderful! I have very sensitive skin and have tried many products but nothing seems to help. I tried this one being skeptical but I was proven wrong! This razor has a great moisturizing system and it actually stays on your skin. I had no red bumps or irritation at all! I would recommend this razor to anyone and especially anyone that has sensitive skin! #BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, and this razor is definitely moisturizing, smoothing, and gentle. I highly recommend it. I received it for free to review it because I am a BzzAgent. (I also recommend being a BzzAgent!)</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor and refill cartridges free because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent.  At first I was unsure I&#x27;d like the razor because I&#x27;ve been a Schick Intuition user for years.  After using the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor, I was won over.  First, it fits so well in my hand unlike the clunky Intuition, I was able to maneuver it over my legs easily and without dropping it.  It glided over my skin and gave me a smooth, close shave comparable to, or better than the Intuition.  The cartridges seem to last a bit longer than the Intuition cartridges too.  Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor to anyone who wants a close shave that leaves your skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzzagent promotion and I will never switch to any other razor!  It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Loved how it made my legs no bumps after shaving. The stripe got kinda slimy but rinsed off and good to go. Bzzagent sent to me to try and loved it. Will continue to use!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the Venus razor by Gillette.  I was given a free Hydro Schick to try through a testing company.  I was pretty skeptical but from the very first use, I was hooked!  I LOVE THIS RAZOR!  I like the way it feels when using it, the ergonomics of its handle, the way the blades remove the hair, everything!  I will never go back to using the Venus razor as long as this product is available.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product!!  I have sensitive skin an other razors for sensitive skin would irritate my skin, but not this razor it is fabulous! This is a must try product!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this as part of bzz agent so it was free, but I have since bought another to leave in my gym bag! This is the best razor ever and leaves my skin super smooth and irritation free. It glides over your skin even with out using shaving cream or anything but water.</li>
    <li> Great razor for my sensitive skin, love the grip handle. Left my legs feeling really soft afterwards. Hardly and razor bumps after use.</li>
    <li> I received my Schick hydro from being a Bzz agent. I love the smooth silky feeling of&lt;br /&gt;my legs when I used this razor. It wass the best razor I have ever used and I would recommend it to any and everyone.Even for those women with very sensitive skin like myself. I give this product an A++++.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzz Campaign and I absolutely love it. Its the smoothest, closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only razor that doesn&#x27;t give me bumps. Love it!</li>
    <li> This razor is definitely worth it... I have never been so worthy of a product until I was given the chance to.try it out now. It is so sleek and convenient :) thank Schickâ™¡</li>
    <li> I used the Venus for YEARS - and this is now my new favorite!! I love these! Im ready for summer!&lt;br /&gt;I received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a BzzAgent campaign to test out. The razor itself is designed nicely and wont slip out of your hand while shaving. The hydrating strip on the razor actually works and helps to soothe your skin while shaving. Having sensitive skin makes this razor a MUST!! The blades are long lasting and don&#x27;t dull very easily. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received this razor through BzzCampaign to try. I have used the Intuition for years. Well, no more. I get a really close shave with this razor and do not break out in unsightly bumps anymore. The handle fits in my hand great and it as not as bulky as the Intuition was. Great razor!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this razor because I was chosen as a part of a BZZCampaign.  The razor and cartridges came for me to sampleand provide my honest thoughts.  I have to tell you that I loved it.  I used to use Gillette but the way these cartridges contact the skin I just could not go back.  So, months later, I am still a convert.  Thanks BZZ for picking me and Schick for a great product!</li>
    <li> I loved this razor more than the other ones I have used. It is also for sensitive skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> This razor worked great! I received it as part of a bzz campaign through bzzagent.com. I&#x27;m so glad I did because it replaced my normal razor. I usually use the Venus brand but after this, I won&#x27;t go back. It left a smooth finish with zero! cuts, nicks or scrapes. Venus did a pretty good job, but this one does an EXCELLENT job!</li>
    <li> I got this razor to try out as a part of a BzzCampaign. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes as I have extremely sensitive skin and generally just avoid shaving for as long as I can. I really love this razor. I think it&#x27;s fully converted me from the Venus. It definitely shaves close and the smoothness, for me, lasts at least two weeks before noticeable growth. The head is covered in a sort of glide-y serum and it really does help with keeps things moisturized and reducing nicks and bumps. I&#x27;m sure this sounds like a parroted review, but I am being serious about the ridiculous sensitivity of my skin. Most sensitive skin products don&#x27;t do well with my skin and still irritate it, but this razor works surprisingly well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it also makes my armpits smooth, too. ^_^</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a BzzCampaign because I have very sensitive skin and nick easily when shaving. Not only did have very minimal nicks in the last few months I&#x27;ve been using the razor, but I also found it to be the easiest shaving process ever due to the handle of the razor! It was smartly designed with a place to put your thumb, that allows you to apply pressure in an even way, even around the boney parts of your legs. I never knew a handle could make that much of a difference but it does! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample set of Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive from Bzz Agent and was blown away. The smoothest shave I have ever had. Converted!!!</li>
    <li> I received a hydro silk sensitive razor as part of a campaign BzzAgent.com and I loved it. As women we get busy and sometimes we need to shave and in a hurry we sometimes skip the shaving cream. Skipping the shaving cream is not good for our skin and it&#x27;s not something I recomend, but it happens. Well this razors hydro gel takes away that worry because unlike it&#x27;s competitors...this razor delivers on the gel leaving your legs soft and moistarised. If you&#x27;re always taking one of your man&#x27;s razors because their blades shave better...once you try this razor, you will never steal his razor again...but he might steal yours.</li>
    <li> This has already replaced my other razor. No scratches, no cuts, just a smooth shave. It feels really soft and it has a comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor is the only razor I have used since receiving a free sample through Buzz Agent.  This razor provides a silky smooth shave with absolutely no irritation.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from bzzagent for free to test out and I fell in love. I love the moisture strip and how close it gets.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this razor since getting iit in my bzz agent kit and have not stopped using it since. It lasts for a very long time and gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a razor. And the way it leaves my skin feeling soft is a great plus</li>
    <li> I am a buzz agent and got this product for free and let me tell you it changed my world.  I used to use Venus razors and they were good but I was not a 100 percent satisfied. They worked great for the first week but then the soap would dry out of fall off.  With the sensitive Razor, that all disappeared!!! It is such a close shave!  It comfortable and I don&#x27;t see as many red bumps and I used to.  MUST USE!!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a BzzCampaign and really liked it.  For being a disposable razor it felt to be of a much better quality than the other razors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor in the running now. I love when I am able to get this kind and use it.</li>
    <li> These are the worst razors I have ever used! The moisturizing strip becomes all gooey and slimy when wet and I have never before had so many nicks on my legs from a razor. Even cheap disposable single blades hurt me less than these. Unfortunately, straight in the trash for me. Should have sent them back with a complaint. Hate to think of the poor bunnies and other animals these were tested on... they are very painful...</li>
    <li> The handle perfectly shaped. Love the rubber, comfortable grip.  The color is super cute, and looks great in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I received my razor as part of a BzzCampaign for BzzAgent.  I loved it.  I always seemed to have bumps and some redness after every shave no matter what I did.  I just came to accept it.  But no more.  I&#x27;m not one to spend a lot of money or believe in spending a lot of money for a product.  But every so often I come across a product that is worth it.  This is one of them.</li>
    <li> I got a free razor as part of a bzzCampaign and I love it! It makes my legs super smooth and never gives me razor burn! the shave lasts longer as well.  I definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> it gives a close shave and leaves my skin so very smooth i really really love this razor it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> I am a BuzzAgent and experienced the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor through one of their campaigns. I have always used an unmentionable razor with disposable cartridges containing 3 blades for at least 10 years. I never thought I&#x27;d switch. Once I tried the Hydro Silk razor I was hooked. It left my skin so soft, so smooth with no nicks or cuts. I love the handle design and how light it is. I love how it comes with a shower hanger so it is always there. I have permanently switched brands to the Hydro Silk and tell others about it. Really, really great product; well worth the cost and very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This razor brand is notorious for quality razors, however I have to say that they have come back to the market with a razor catering to the majority of us who have Sensitive shave needs. No greater experience and smooth last shave can be achieved without using the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive razor</li>
    <li> I always thought all razors were the same and shave numbs were something I just had to live with if I shaved my legs to close togather, like 2 days in a row! Not with this razor. I used it and it was good, then I used my old razor once. And realized just how good this razor is! Not irritated skin or shave bumps on my legs! So glad I got this as a free sample for BzzAgent!! This is my razor of choice now!!</li>
    <li> Received this razor free from a BzzCampaign.  This razor is amazing!  Loved the close shave, no nicks, no bumps and skin felt so smooth!  I have VERY course hair!  This is a perfect razor!  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a smooth finish with no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only razor that I will purchase going&lt;br /&gt;forward.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love everything about this razor! I replaced my cheap disposables with it. I have never seen better results with any other razor. I get a closer, smoother shave with no irritation. The moisture band on the top makes my skin soft, I just love it!</li>
    <li> These razors are awesome!!!! Sometimes when you shave, it almost feels like you are dragging or pulling the razor over your legs, even when they are new.  These just g-l-i-d-e....so smoothly you dint even think they are working. But, boy do they work. Skin like satin. My daughter won&#x27;t use any other razor anymore.</li>
    <li> I love Schick razors. They always seem to last longer and do a better job than other brands.  With this one, I was impressed with the comfortable grip and how it didn&#x27;t cause as many nicks or bumps on the sensitive areas.  Will definitely be buying more of them!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as a part of a BzzCampaign.  I traditionally use the Gillette Venus razor out of sheer convenience. It takes little time and I&#x27;m lazy. Sometimes, I have an occasion that requires more than convenience, it requires smooth legs. I tried this razor thinking it was going to be like every other razor that said it helped with irritation. Well this one actually did much to my surprise. It still requires more effort than the Venus but it&#x27;s worth it. I got married in February and this is the razor I used on the day before my big day! This razor might be more expensive than some of the cheaper quality ones, but I think it&#x27;s worth the purchase. I liked that the razor came with 2 replacement cartridges as opposed to the one other razors typically come with when you actually purchase the whole razor.</li>
    <li> Good razors, but they seem to dull out pretty quickly. For the price of these razors you would think they should last a bit longer than they do. I also seemed to notice that the quality of the blades wasn&#x27;t the same from one cartridge to the next. The first one I used was fantastic, I got a nice smooth shave out of it. The second one didn&#x27;t seem to do as well. It would skip over my legs and not give me as smooth of a shave as the first. They may have just been a fluke, but it&#x27;s enough to keep me from wanting to buy more as they are pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> Great razor. And it comes with an extra blade, which is the expensive part of shaving!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, and so far I prefer it to any other razor I&#x27;ve tried, including the Gillette Venus and Schick Quattro. In particular, I noticed less razor burn with this razor than with either of those, even in sensitive places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Reusable body (replace the head). Reusable razors are much better than disposables and 100% worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;+The moisturizing stuff is very nice. Even when I don&#x27;t use soap or shaving cream on an area, the razor works smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;+I almost never get cuts or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;+5 blades. I get a really close and smooth shave, and don&#x27;t typically have to make multiple passes to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;+Blades last pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;+The head is flexible, so I can generally (still carefully) go over ankles and knees and stuff, without cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The coating on the strips got a little goopy the first time I use each set of blades. It;s not a problem, but it seems like an unusual amount of the coating comes off in the first use.&lt;br /&gt;-The plastic mount that suctions to the shower wall doesn&#x27;t stick to the shower wall very well. And the razor falls out. So I just put the razor in the shower caddy now.</li>
    <li> I recently discovered these razors and they&#x27;re amazing. I have sensitive skin and I get razor burn easily, which I&#x27;ve dealt with for years trying razor after razor. I finally tried this one and its amazing. The aloe strip lasts for a decent amount of time. And it&#x27;s so smooth to shave with. Love the 5 blades. Leaves my legs feeling silky smooth and not irritated.</li>
