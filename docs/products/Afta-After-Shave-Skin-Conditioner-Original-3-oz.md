      <li>It is soothing and it has a friendly scent.  </li>
      <li>I used to use Gillette aftershave gel in warm season and Nivea Soft lotion during winter, but after I bought a bottle of Afta on closeout somewhere</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance... not harsh.  </li>
      <li>After trying lots of shaving products, I discovered that the local drug store/grocery store didn&#x27;t offer any after shave products I liked...</li>

      <li>i used it for the first time yesterday morning</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more when need to.</li>
      <li>I easily washed the residue off my hands and went back to my table.</li>

      <li>It really seems to help.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Very soothing for a baby face.  </li>
      <li>After that closeout purchase I checked most local big stores - Target, Kmart, Kroger, few more, but none of them had Afta!</li>
      <li>It works really well, leaves fresh feeling, prevents razor rashes and couple of pea size drops enough for the whole face after shaving.</li>
      <li>Classic fragrance and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>More musky or harsh to the nose.</li>
      <li>Other Mennen products are still there, but not Afta Original.</li>
      <li>I love this aftershave and it is hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not so heavy as Nivea, it&#x27;s light lotion.</li>
      <li>Afta has been in my medicine cabinet for nearly 50 years.</li>
      <li>Lately, I have not been able to find it at Wal-Mart or in drug stores.</li>
      <li>I tend to use this during the cold windy winter months because it moisturizes my face very well and smells manly and good.</li>
      <li>had this older type afta shave only the newer one for electric shavers. .</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but none of the major stores in our area carries this anymore.</li>

<li> Hard to find--</li>
<li> I hope it will stay on the market, at least online market.</li>
<li> Expensive?</li>
<li> also i noticed people say it protects your skin against the wind and weather like the sun and cold</li>
<li> just stinging, smelly, girly, drying, evaporating crap.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this product for the last 40 years. It contains no alcohol and is soothing to the skin after shaving rather than bracing. Lately, I have not been able to find it at Wal-Mart or in drug stores. Other Mennen products are still there, but not Afta Original. It was a little more expensive online, but since I couldn&#x27;t find it elsewhere, I ordered five 2-packs, which should last awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this aftershave and it is hard to find in stores. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> After trying lots of shaving products, I discovered that the local drug store/grocery store didn&#x27;t offer any after shave products I liked...just stinging, smelly, girly, drying, evaporating crap.    But on vacation in Charleston SC, I happened to go to a nice restaurant on a golf course. The bathroom was actually the golfers&#x27; locker room. In the sink area was a variety of men&#x27;s products that I&#x27;d never seen before. Afta after shave was one of them. After smelling everything, I applied afta and really liked the smell and texture of it. Withouth being over-powering, I smelled like a man and not like cheap English Leather. I easily washed the residue off my hands and went back to my table. My wife and waitress immediately both gave me compliments on the smell. I just smiled.    After a couple hours, I noticed my wife was leaning on me so she could smell it. It still had its scent and it was still moisturizing my face! That&#x27;s amazing compared to most moisterizing products.    Here&#x27;s to the gentlemen. Living well is the best revenge.</li>
    <li> This is the only aftershave productmy husband uses that agrees with both of out allergies. Now Amazzon is the only place we can find to purchase it, as the store we were using is no longer carring this product.[[ASIN:B0000530HH Afta After Shave, Original, 3-Ounces (Pack of 6)]][[ASIN:B000RLX8CE Mennen Afta Original After Shave Skin Conditioner 3 FL OZ (Pack of 2)]]  However I only bought the two (2) pack.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product, I had a problem squeezing with my bad hand and can only look ahead to what it will be like when it is close to empty.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for sixty years.</li>
    <li> This after shave has a nice clean smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. It&#x27;s also helps with dry, flaky skin. Glad I got it and will get some again, Hopefully they still make it.</li>
    <li> As well as the pre Electric shave by Mennen my son tried this to help ease acne cuts and inflammation when he shaves. It really seems to help. Hard to find-- so keep stocking it please.</li>
    <li> Works well for shaving allergy. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great ffor your face after shaving. Makes your skin very smooth and no burning.</li>
    <li> First found this in America and brough some home - once supplies ran out we hunted around to find it and this was the best value we could find.  Very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor and figured now that I&#x27;m going into my sixth decade on the planet it might be a good idea to try one. I remembered my father using AFTA when I was younger. I like the smell and feel of the conditioner. Even though I discovered the $100 razor isn&#x27;t for me I still find myself using the product even when I use a blade. The same silky smooth feel and comforting conditioner helps after every shave. Don&#x27;t know if I buy a different razor, such as a foil, but in either case I know I return to AFTA as a late-life user.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Afta Electric PreShave lotion not the Skin conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Walter</li>
    <li> I used to use Gillette aftershave gel in warm season and Nivea Soft lotion during winter, but after I bought a bottle of Afta on closeout somewhere I decided that it feels better. It smoothes skin better than Gillette Gel and it&#x27;s not so heavy as Nivea, it&#x27;s light lotion. It works really well, leaves fresh feeling, prevents razor rashes and couple of pea size drops enough for the whole face after shaving. Did I mention that my wife just loves scent of Afta and always notices when I used it saying how good I smell? After that closeout purchase I checked most local big stores - Target, Kmart, Kroger, few more, but none of them had Afta! Fortunately I found it here, but it seems department stores in my city just don&#x27;t carry this product. I hope it will stay on the market, at least online market. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> With the shipping charge, it cost me $81 for only three, but as each is a pack of two, to my surprise, six were delivered to my apartment here in Kobe, Japan. Expensive? A little, but well-worth it for me. Great feeling, great fragrance!</li>
    <li> I use Afta to help keep the razor burn away, especially during the summer months.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but I like the scent of Afta.  It is not as overpowering as some after shave products on the market and it is certainly not as strong as cologne. Until someone comes up with something better, I will continue to use it after every shave. I just hope Mennen never drops this product from their line of skin care.</li>
    <li> I tend to use this during the cold windy winter months because it moisturizes my face very well and smells manly and good.</li>
    <li> Thanks!  How great is it to order this through Amazon as this product isn&#x27;t commercially easy to find any longer at the corner drug store.  Glad you&#x27;re stocking it!</li>
    <li> Great item been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Have used this since I started shaving. No sting, great scent. Unfortunately, not available in musk scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but none of the major stores in our area carries this anymore. I&#x27;ve used it for years. You can&#x27;t beat the soothing feeling it gives after a shave. Unlike any other aftershave product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it would smell like.  More musky or harsh to the nose.</li>
    <li> i used it for the first time yesterday morning the thing is if i get irritation it shows up the day after i shave and on my neck so i cant shave everyday. But I shaved off 5 days growth and used this stuff and today i had close to no irritation i didnt shave but that just shows how good it is on the skin. also i noticed people say it protects your skin against the wind and weather like the sun and cold it says nothing on the bottle about it. The smell is decent nothing special not over powering anyone who has irritated skin after using this should use this and do what i did and switch to a dye and sentless shave cream it helps alot</li>
    <li> husband loves this product. but will last a long time. can give as a gift if needed. great scent. thanks</li>
    <li> Classic fragrance and not overpowering.  Soothing and not greasy so can really go wrong with this gentle product.  Will definitely buy more when need to.</li>
    <li> Me enviaron dos frascos de after shave y dos de prelectric lotion cuando han debido enviar cuatro after shaveque es lo que se ordeno.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 20 years.  Very soothing for a baby face.  Love the fragrance... not harsh.  Happy I can get it on the internet as our local stores are constantly out of this product.  Many thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Hawaii Golfer</li>
    <li> Was very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> It is soothing and it has a friendly scent.  I have used and enjoyed this product for years; unfortunately, the local stores no longer carry this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the afta shave I&#x27;ve been looking all over for no one had this older type afta shave only the newer one for electric shavers. .</li>
    <li> This product would be great if it did not contain alcohol.  It has a  very good smell and is cheap.</li>
    <li> Afta has been in my medicine cabinet for nearly 50 years. 50 years! You can understand my concern when it began to disappear from store shelves, never to reappear. Thank goodness for Amazon though! I hope it is never taken out of production (unlike some other things I thought I could depend on).</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted, the pictures and description were perfect, shipped very, very quickly, packed extremely well, I will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly this reduced my razor bumps, it also feels good on your face. Keeps it smooth, and smells good so that&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and its my first choice for after shave conditioner.  I can no longer find the product in stores in my area so I get from Amazon. This product has a great smell and leaves your face feeling great. Highly recommended.</li>
