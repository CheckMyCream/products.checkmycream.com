<li> It&#x27;s one of the very few for which it&#x27;s true that you need to use only a little at a time.</li>

<li> and it&#x27;s dry</li>

<li> and it&#x27;s just past my shoulders.</li>
<li> , I have a painful time trying to get to that point because it&#x27;s next to impossible to try and comb through my hair right after I&#x27;m done washing it.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find in this area.</li>
<li> AND I BROKE OUT IN A PAINFUL PIMPLE ON SCALP THE DAY AFTER USING IT.</li>
<li> Hate flyaway hair.</li>

    <li> I BOUGHT THIS CONDITIONER FROM NEUTROGENA THINKING IT WOULD BE HEALTHIER. IT&#x27;S MOISTURIZING BUT IT&#x27;S GOT PRESERVATIVES AND DYES AND IT MADE MY SCALP SORE AND I BROKE OUT IN A PAINFUL PIMPLE ON SCALP THE DAY AFTER USING IT. I DONT THINK ITS HEALTHIER AT ALL SO I&#x27;LL STICK WITH AVON AND AUSSIE.</li>
    <li> ,,,,,nice having in in the shower rack!</li>
    <li> I tried this at a hotel that I was visiting. It was one of those sample bottles that hotels put out for guest. It really makes my hair soft and manageable. JMC</li>
    <li> This truly is a good conditioner that rinses clean and leaves hair feeling soft.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a moderate conditioner that rinses out well and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy fragrance behind.  Neutrogena products are always a safe bet.</li>

    <li> I ran out and was using other products.  Everything arrived quickly...plan on ordering again.  Great product, doesn&#x27;t make the hair flat.</li>
    <li> MOST AMAZING. I just use this no shampoo and my curls where are usually unruly and just perfection.</li>
    <li> While I like how this stuff works after I&#x27;ve combed my hair and it&#x27;s dry, I have a painful time trying to get to that point because it&#x27;s next to impossible to try and comb through my hair right after I&#x27;m done washing it. My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it and it&#x27;s just past my shoulders. I consistently have this problem every time I use it. Bottom line...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have medium to long hair.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; very good packaging</li>
    <li> Sad that this has been discontinued - this stash should last me for a while.</li>

    <li> I have used the Neutrogena Clean shampoo and conditioner for as long as I can remember, but can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores.  Is the product the reason I have no gray hair at 61 when no one else in my family has that luxury?  Who knows, but I still love how my hair feels and looks.</li>
    <li> This has been my favourite conditioner for a long time.  It&#x27;s one of the very few for which it&#x27;s true that you need to use only a little at a time.</li>
    <li> i like this stuff, my hair ends up nicer and easier to style than when i use some of the more common cheap store-bought conditioners.  i use it with [[ASIN:B0058DBV20 Neutrogena Clean Volume Body Enhancing Shampoo, 10.1 Ounce (Pack of 2)]].  i don&#x27;t know what more i can say about conditioner.  it smells decent?  i&#x27;m a guy, btw.  my girlfriend uses it sometimes too, she says she likes it.  so there you go.  great for boys and girls.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever found. Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find in this area. Just glad that Amazon carries it at a great price!</li>
