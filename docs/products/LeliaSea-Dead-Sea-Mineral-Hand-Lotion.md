      <li>I love your hand lotion.  </li>
      <li>all of which, of course, leads to more wear and tear on my hands.</li>

      <li>I know many that claim to be non-greasy and then they are not when you use them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My poor hands can’t get a break. In the winter, the cold dry air seems to suck the moisture right out of them. Now that the weather is warming up, I’m busy working outside, cleaning up the yard and deck, planting in the garden- all of which, of course, leads to more wear and tear on my hands. I’m determined to keep my hobbies AND my soft, pretty hands, so I continue on in my quest for the perfect hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest one I’m trying is LeliaSea Hand Cream From The Dead Sea. The unique formula incorporates natural minerals from the Dead Sea. I think it’s cool that this cream has been endorsed by luxury hotels. It is offered in VIP suites at the Las Vegas Venetian (where I’ve stayed and oh my gosh, beautiful) and 20 other luxury chains. It makes sense that out of ALL the choices buyers for high-end hotels are presented with, they would choose the very best for the clientele.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is a thick, rich formula which immediately hydrated my skin and gave it a surface silkiness. I didn’t experience any unpleasant stickiness or greasiness, it absorbed quickly into my skin. I also didn’t notice any sort of scent, which is nice in a hand cream. I don’t want my hands clashing with my perfume or scented body products. This was definitely a soothing experience for my over-worked hands. I’m pretty sure I heard my fingers making happy little “ah!” sounds after being quenched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that they offer a 30 day money back guarantee. More companies should stand behind their products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> The smell is quite good and my mom just loves the hand cream a lot! Great product ~</li>
    <li> As a user of Hand Creams for years,the choice to ordering LeliaSea was the right one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s silky touch and pleasant fragrance ,made LeliaSea one of the best hand cream among  variety of Dead Sea products by other makers.&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most (among others...) is the fact that this Hand Cream absorbs into the skin fast !!&lt;br /&gt;Good product,go for it !!!</li>
    <li> Being a beauty and skincare blogger I&#x27;m constantly trying and testing out a wide variety of products.  One of my favorite products to test out (besides masks of course) is hand cream!  I cannot even tell you how many hand creams I have tested over the years.  I&#x27;m fairly picky about my hand creams, however, I also like a variety of hand creams to choose from.  Sometimes I want a light hand cream that absorbs quickly and other times I want a nice and thick hand cream that will just sit and kind of marinate on my hands and then eventually soak in.  I also like a hand cream that falls somewhere in between.  Where I am and what I am doing always influences what kind of hand cream I use.&lt;br /&gt;This Hand Cream by LeiaSea has been my one and only &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; Hand Cream for several weeks now!  Which is kind of amazing since I have about 5 different ones that I use on an everyday basis.  It just provides the perfect amount moisture to my overly dry hands without feeling greasy and also leaves them feeling incredibly soft and silky.  I also really like the light, fresh scent and a little goes a long way so that is a bonus too!  I&#x27;ve also been using it on my feet and it has really helped soothe and heal my dry, cracked heels.  The Leliasea Hand Cream definitely gets a 5-Star rating from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive some of these products complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
    <li> Dead Sea Mineral Hand Cream by LeliaSea is incredible. I love it from the moment I put a dime size on my hands. My hands were left feeling soft and supple. The cream is not sticky or greasy at all and that is a major plus for me. Dead Sea Mineral are a gift from the sea that does amazing things for the hands an I don&#x27;t have to reapply often.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love anything with dead sea minerals in them! Just the benefits of the dead sea minerals alone does so much for your skin in any form. I guess you could say I am a collector of anything with dead sea minerals in it! So, I saw this and HAD to review it and I am glad I did! This is a superb piece in my dead sea mineral collection. I have a lot of mud masks or cleanser with the minerals but I dont have any hand creams. I really love this. Its not greasy at all. Some lotions say they are non greasy but we all know that most times, they are still really greasy! This time, they are NOT lying! It sunk into my skin in seconds and left it smooth and SO soft immediately. I have to say, I am really impressed. It has a light almost barely there fragrance like you just washed your hands. Your skin stays hydrated and soft for a long time after using it. I think its awesome how they were a luxury hotel lotion brand and now are partnered with Amazon to sell on there! I know personally I have tried a lot of hand creams in hotels and i take them home because you can never find them to buy them yourself but the hotels always have the best hand creams! Well, now you can!! I find it hard to believe there is a hand cream out there better than this. I have tried A LOT of hand creams and this is by far the best I have ever used! I highly recommend this to anyone! ** I got this product free to review in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> So far so good, as I have not been using this a lot yet.  Frankly, I like Dead Sea products and was once gifted with Seacret&#x27;s hand cream with Shea Butter but when I went to get more I was rather shocked at the price (even on Amazon).  The Lelia seems just as good, and a little of it certainly goes a long way.  And it is about half the price of the Seacret.  It helps my hands too, but I use it primarily on the scars of my two knee operations over the past year and I believe it helps the healing process.  Ask me later after I&#x27;ve used it a while.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I feel the difference. It&#x27;s only been two weeks, but very night I put it on, and every morning I like the way my hands feel more and more.</li>
    <li> If you are considering trying LeliaSea Dead Sea Mineral Hand Lotion, but have never tried a Dead Sea skin product before and are skeptical, then you don&#x27;t know what you are missing out on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, every single Lotion, regardless of brand, that I have owned from the Dead Sea smells the same.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but it smells AMAZING.  Very similar to the scent you get when you roll down your windows about 30 minutes from the Outer Banks. You can just SMELL the ocean.  In this case, you can just smell the salt, the minerals, and it is a nice beachy kind of smell, not dead fish smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the natural high mineral salt content in any product that comes from the Dead Sea-this lotion included- this is a great product to use if you have dry cracked hands (or feet), eczema or psoriasis.  The minerals just go in and heal dermatitis issues, and my husband says his face just FEELS better when he applies this lotion on his eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from severely dry skin for my whole life, and nothing moisturizes my skin as well as this tube of lotion.  I realize that results will vary per person, but if I were making a statement based on my sole experience, I would say this stuff will cure anything dry that ails your skin!  I am not an expert, that is just my opinion based on how well my dry cracked hands are looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Disclaimer:  I received product for promotional price in exchange for review.  All opinions and information stated here are exclusive to my personal research over the years for my own benefit and are 100% honest********</li>
    <li> You wrote: I love this lotion. The smell is fantastic, and my hands felt soft for a long time after I put it on. Thanks!</li>
    <li> First, I should say I am not really a hand cream person. I love moisturizing creams and oils of many types, but I usually find hand cream to heavily perfumed, too thick and too waxy. It works well when the skin on the hands is parched, but I don&#x27;t usually like the greasy feel or having everything I touch smell and taste perfumed. Sadly, the skin on my hands gets dry and chalky sometimes due to my dislike of most hand creams and frequent hand washing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying that, I do like this hand cream by LeliaSea. The texture is thinner and easily absorbed. It is perfumed more than I prefer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed my food tasting like the perfume or anything like that. It is a light, moisturizing cream that keeps my hands soft and smooth. This is one of my favorite hand creams though I would love an unscented version. The scent is lovely though, it makes me feel as if I visited a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of LeliaSea Dead Sea Mineral Hand Cream for review purposes. All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!!!! Don&#x27;t buy!!!! Doesn&#x27;t seem organic!!!! strong perfume smell!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very picky about hand lotion I like this one a lot.it is quick absorbing,long lasting and hydrating.I like the scent it is light and fades fast.I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good cream, smooth and smells wonderful !</li>
    <li> LeliaSea  is a nice quality hand cream. It goes on smoothly and the fragrance is light and lovely.  It absorbs into my skin almost immediately, which is fantastic. This is a keeper! I highly recommend LeliaSea hand cream for softer hands.</li>
    <li> Light perfume smell but I actually really love the clean scent. I use it at work everyday!</li>
    <li> What I want from a hand cream is: 1. To softens and moisturize my skin, and 2. To leave a nice scent on my hands. This one does both jobs perfectly! I love the smell of this, and I&#x27;m one of those picky people when it comes to hand creams!</li>
    <li> Thank you for this hand cream. I am realy appriciate Amazon)) thanks again</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Feels very nice.  Not sticky at all.  Is there another scent?  Does anyone know?</li>
    <li> My hands are extremely dry, scaly, and rough.  I love your hand lotion.  I have been using it faithfully at night.  It has become a nightly ritual I look forward to doing right before I get cozy.  I do see a difference in the appearance and feel of my hands.  My cuticles are healthier.</li>
    <li> The bird feeder provides an opportunity observe the birds up close all year long.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I ordered a few products from multiple companies the day I ordered this hand cream and it was among the first to arrive. Super fast shipping and the scent is incredible! Love this product and the company is fast. Win/win. This hand cream is a bedside nightstand keeper and I will order more when it runs out. Mmmm....silky.....</li>
    <li> I have really dry hands; especially my cuticles. My cuticles are so dry that I chew on them; which in turn makes them drier! I have a love hate relationship with hand lotion. I hate hand lotion that leaves any type of film on my hands. If it leaves my hands feeling greasy? Forget about it! I’ll wash the lotion off within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This hand cream doesn’t leave my hands feeling greasy in the least. It absorbs all the way and quickly!! Nothing greasy and no sticky film either. This is a light and airy hand cream with a very light and pleasant scent. The cream says it’s unscented, but due to the natural ingredients inside there is a light scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;My hands feel silky smooth. My cuticles are looking soooooooo much better after just one week of use!!&lt;br /&gt;LeliaSea comes in a small 1.7 oz bottle which is perfect for tossing in your purse. Soft hands anytime. All the time!!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> DEAD-SEA-Mineral Hand Cream by LeliaSea • LIMITED TIME SALE • Smooth and Non-Sticky Hand Lotion • Instantly Heal Dry, Cracked Hands • Relief for Eczema and Psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;I simply love hand creams, especially ones that smell fresh and clean. I know many that claim to be non-greasy and then they are not when you use them. But this one just absorbs into the skin leaving it silky smooth and so nicely fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can see why, they say it is endorsed by luxury hotel chains. With this quality of a skin cream, I cannot imagine a luxury hotel not wanting it.. It contains Dead Sea Salt, which contains vitamins and minerals including magnesium, calcium and potassium, all which our bodies needs to stay healthy and smooth. The tube is the perfect size to carry around in your purse, in your car. Or if you are like me you will want to keep it next to you so you have it on hand at all times. I handle a lot of paper and products so I do not want my skin to be crispy dry and this is just what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was really disappointed. The tube was tiny and it wasnt cheap. However, my husband said that this stuff helped his psoriosis on his hands. Since he uses it everyday multiple times it is just too expensive to keep buying.</li>
    <li> This cream is unbelievably soft and silky.  The only complaint I might have about it is that it doesn&#x27;t work on my psoriasis (that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work on yours - mine is just a really resistant type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that customer service for this product was more than excellent!!  When I mentioned that it didn&#x27;t work on my psoriasis, even though I thought it was so soft and silky, they immediately offered to refund my money, no other questions asked.  I like the fact that they&#x27;re a small company, trying to make a go of it amid all these giants and would like to do anything I can to support them.  I encourage anyone with dry hands to try out their products - it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING!!!  Works great and makes your skin feel great too!!</li>
    <li> This cream is the best, it made my hands so soft. I leave the bottle at work and it goes on smoothly and is non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter thinks I am a hand cream junkie because I am constantly trying new creams. I think I can stop looking after purchasing this cream.</li>
    <li> Really great natural hand moisturizer! It seems to go above and beyond - I can feel the difference!</li>
    <li> love it! this hand cream is the perfect one for me....is not greasy and it smell real good... I&#x27;m a bus driver and all my passengers as soon they enter the bus start telling me a lot of compliments cause the smell is so great that they always ask me what is the name of my perfume and I always tell them that is my hand cream....plus that ...love it !! because and I can&#x27;t use nothing that leaves a feeling of grease on my hand because that can be too slippery on my steering wheel  and I&#x27;m a 100% safe driver so that&#x27;s why I love this hand cream. I can use it every time when I want. I recommended to everybody!</li>
    <li> Love it.. It is amazing and i will definitely order it again</li>
    <li> This is great hand cream,will be buying it again,thank you</li>
    <li> Very effective hand cream--has a great feel and is non-greasy.  I love that you only need to use a small amount since I apply it frequently during the day (after doing dishes, housework, washing hands after dog grooming, etc etc.). Smell is very nice, faint and light scent.  I like that I can use my iPad right after applying this hand cream!  Although it did not heal a spot of exema on my finger (had to resort to an Rx to tackle that), it did make my finger feel better and alleviated some of the drying effect of the prescription.  It&#x27;s expensive but I expect that the tube will last quite a while since you don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
    <li> My hand feel softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> The scent of this hand lotion is absolutely divine, and it fits perfectly in my purse for on the go!</li>
    <li> this cream is absolutely wonderful</li>
    <li> Seems to work immediately and has a pleasant scent. I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand lotion, I have ever used. I bought it because of the Dead Sea mineral salts. There is only one place to get it, is The Dead Sea in Israel. The salts and minerals are good for many things.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother. She says she &#x27;loves it&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Do you suffer from dry hands? LeilaSea has the ultimate answer! Their Dead Sea mineral hand cream (that is found in the Las Vegas Venetian resort rooms) provides immediate results and my hands feel amazing! Do most hand creams you use tend to be on the oily and greasy side? Or have you had to use an excessive amount just to get results? And what about those times we&#x27;ve had to constantly reapply a lotion (e.g. after washing up)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LeilaSea&#x27;s Dead Sea Mineral Hand Cream is the perfect answer to all those hand cream problems and promises the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- INSTANT relief for dry hands, cracked skin, eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dead Sea deep mineral goodness - without the bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 100% Money Back Guarantee (Love it or it&#x27;s Free!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For under $10 USD you can get your own 1.7 fl.oz. hand cream that is the perfect size for your purse.  Amazon ships your hand cream in a plastic bag and recommends massaging a small amount of the cream into your hands until fully absorbed. You will be impressed with how far a little does go meaning that your 1.7 fl.oz. bottle will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like to apply a small (&amp;#60;dime sized) dollop of the cream after my morning shower and again before going to bed in the evening. LeilaSea claims there is a &amp;#34;soft, fresh scent&amp;#34; and I found it to be extremely minimalistic and does not clash with any perfume I am wearing nor overwhelm anyone&#x27;s sensibilities. So if you, friends, are looking for a new hand cream may I wholeheartedly recommend LeilaSea&#x27;s hand cream from the Dead Sea? And heck, what&#x27;s to lose because if you don&#x27;t like it, you can get your money back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was gifted the LeilaSea Dead Sea Mineral Hand Cream in exchange for a fair and honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the cream on my hands, not too oily, good absorbing. The tube is a little bit smaller than I expected, as described though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and wonderful liked it very much</li>
    <li> my hands showed a difference after just two uses.  It leaves you feeling silky without feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> The hand cream has made my hands extremely soft. I only need to use a little portion and it lasts long.  What I love about the cream is it does not make my hands greasy. I will continue to purchase the hand cream on Amazon and I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love luxurious bath and body products but not the high price tag that goes along with them? Try this hand cream. It smells heavenly. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy. It absorbs quickly and truly makes your skin feel like silk. It&#x27;s even clearing up the psoriasis on my hands better than coal tar does. But isn&#x27;t nasty and goopey and vile smelling like coal tar is.&lt;br /&gt;LeliaSea makes excellent dead sea mineral products!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands. I have tried numerous products. I like this product,. You don&#x27;t need but a small amount to rub in and it absorbs fast. It smalls very pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy. I like it.</li>
    <li> I have severe joint psoriasis that gets worse during the summer months.My dr laughs at me and says its s posed to be right opposite and get worse during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;Its been hard to actually find a lotion to keep it at bay, And a lotion that will moisturize enough to where the dead skin doesn&#x27;t pop right back out once applied. This lotion is wonderful for me in the sense that it covers well,helps the itching and has actually showed some signs of helping clear up my psoriasis. Its extremely smooth in texture and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Great product if you have skin issues.</li>
    <li> Have to give it more time.</li>
    <li> This lotion properly hydrates my skin, and it even smells good!</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream! I purchased this about a week ago, and I love this cream. I usually have to apply lotion to my hands everytime I wash them. Since I have started using this cream I have noticed that my hands feel soft and and still moisturized after washing. I don&#x27;t know if it is due to the lotion but my nails have also been doing much better, healthier all the way around. This cream also has a very light, nice scent, and I am very sensitive smells (sets off migraines).&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase more, one for my purse and one for my home. They are small bottles but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like this hand cream and will be purchasing more of Leilasalts products!</li>
    <li> wonderful smooth texture and long lasting softness</li>
    <li> This hand cream is lovely so far. It&#x27;s non-greasy, lightly fragranced, &amp; moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I really liked the hand lotion. I would recommend it to anyone that wants a non greasy cream for hands and elbows.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00VV3UV2W Dead Sea Mineral Hand Cream by LeliaSea Smooth and Non-Sticky Hand Lotion &amp;#x2022; Instantly Heal Dry, Cracked Hands &amp;#x2022; Relief for Eczema and Psoriasis]]&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s the first time I have bought and like it very much.
