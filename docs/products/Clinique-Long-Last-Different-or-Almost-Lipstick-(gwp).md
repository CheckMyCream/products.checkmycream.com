      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s wonderful product!</li>
      <li>Cute and perfect since I wanted to try this since middle school!</li>
      <li>Some lipsticks are magic for your lips-</li>
      <li>I have used it for many years</li>
      <li>I use a lip stain underneath and this on top, and I love the results.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more like a gloss than a lipstick.</li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>No chapped lips and the color is so healthy looking.</li>
      <li>Just wish it were a bit more nourishing on my lips.</li>
      <li>And it feels great on, it&#x27;s not thick and sticky like a gloss, and is lighter than lipstick, it feels more like a lip balm.</li>
      <li>This is great for everyday and applied heavier, looks beautiful for evening.&lt;br /&gt;Quick</li>
      <li>Great sheer color and a nice shine.</li>
      <li>Love this smooth moisturizing lipstick.</li>
      <li>It moisturized my lips very well &amp; has a good amount of lasting/staying power.</li>
      <li>Perfect purse size, fast shipping and my new obsession.</li>
      <li>Glides on the lips easily.</li>
      <li>Dark Honey for the win!</li>
      <li>Feels light weight.</li>
      <li>look; the color , texture and ability to shape to your lips is fantastic.</li>
      <li>cheaper and more enjoyable than other tubes of colored chemical wax - good for starters, not to go gaga over</li>
      <li>This lipstick is more of a gloss and adds just the right amount of color.</li>
      <li>Even my daughter&#x27;s who are darker than my pasty white self love it!!</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and smooth, it&#x27;s not overpowering and looks very natural on my olive/tan skin tone.</li>
      <li>Small sized perfect for travel..</li>
      <li>And this size is perfect to carry in a small makeup bag in a purse.</li>
      <li>I love the color of this stuff, and the smaller sample size was a great way to try it without having to invest in a whole tube.</li>
      <li>It basically enhances the color of your lips in an awesome natural and sheer way.</li>
      <li>Great for use on dry lips.</li>
      <li>why did I wait so long before trying this amazing lipstick?!</li>
      <li>This has a good color, which will show up differently on every person depending on the pigmentation of their lips.</li>
      <li>I am now going to buy the full size lipstick.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more like a very tinted gloss than lipstick, so</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good compromise if you&#x27;re not big on lipstick but need some color.</li>
      <li>goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel dry even though it&#x27;s got AMAZING staying power.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color, but nothing special.</li>
      <li>but with enough color to tint the lips nicely after 2 coats.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more natural than overdone looking in my opinion.</li>
      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s nice to have it available on Amazon for such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Sheer rich color that blends with most skin tones.</li>
      <li>this gives just the right amount of color.  </li>

    <li> Love it....great color, moisture, and wear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color, but nothing special. The seller did a good job getting it to me on a timely manner though.</li>
    <li> Good quick delivery and nice product quality.</li>
    <li> Does not last; rubs off easily.</li>
    <li> A great product!  Sheer but with enough color to tint the lips nicely after 2 coats.  Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Really like this- it&#x27;s more like a very tinted gloss than lipstick, so it&#x27;s more natural than overdone looking in my opinion. The color is complimentary whether you have pasty white winter skin or tan summer skin. After a couple of purchases I realize now I need to see if they make a larger size, I seem to go through this pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Cute and perfect since I wanted to try this since middle school!</li>
    <li> good moisture and color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m newly obsessed with this lipstick. I read on a blog about it (I have zero instinct when it comes to cosmetics) and couldn&#x27;t resist the color. It&#x27;s not like typical lipstick, it&#x27;s closer to a balm, but it goes on like a dream and feels like silk. You can deepen the color if you layer it, but it&#x27;s gorgeous just as is. I&#x27;m exceptionally pale and this color is in no way too dark or heavy for me. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever not have this in my life now.</li>
    <li> Small sized perfect for travel.. Fast ship .</li>
    <li> Love this smooth moisturizing lipstick.</li>
    <li> Wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I ordered the travel size Black Honey. I give this item a thumbs down- its a spineless lipstick with little pigmentation. If you want some color, be prepared to stand there and layer on for some time. Some lipsticks are magic for your lips- they instantly give you this come hither look; the color , texture and ability to shape to your lips is fantastic. But not Black Honey. It&#x27;s wishy washy. It cost too less for me to return it. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this lipstick since it first appeared. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone it doesn&#x27;t look great on: ivory to ebony, wether warm or cool undertone.</li>
    <li> Perfect purse size, fast shipping and my new obsession. I am not a huge makeup person in general, and I am cheap. However this always looks classy and I can swipe it on lips without looking. Works better than Chapstick and no dry or gummy feeling like other lipsticks.  Doubles as cheek color in a pinch. I have also sent this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Not as expected. I was kind of disappointed. I have a wheatish skin tone and the product works more like a lip balm.</li>
    <li> After using so many lipsticks through the years and spending so much money on them, this is marvelous.  It feels so good on your lips and lasts awhile, even after eating.  I bought this size for my purse and have the regular size for my home use.</li>
    <li> This is EVERYTHING! I have used it for many years and I love this small size!</li>
    <li> I love the color of this stuff, and the smaller sample size was a great way to try it without having to invest in a whole tube. It also fits well in my purse. I&#x27;m really happy with it. Just wish it were a bit more nourishing on my lips. It tends to dry them out like a lipstick.</li>
    <li> At first glance the shade seems way too dark, but this is by far my favorite lipcolor overall! I keep multiple tubes (make up bag, purse, office desk drawer) so I have one everywhere I go. It goes on nice and smooth, it&#x27;s not overpowering and looks very natural on my olive/tan skin tone. It does need reapplied throughout the day, but not too bad.  Plus I&#x27;m so confident with the color and coverage that I don&#x27;t need a mirror to put it on! Overall, it&#x27;s wonderful product!</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful, semi,-sheer, and I think it would look good on any skin tone. The color is smooth and not sticky, doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my lips, and lasts pretty well. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> The best lip gloss ever!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I keep seeing rave reviews on the color. It is a nice color ( i am light skinned and this works good on me). But I have purchased another lipgloss stick that is just as good and is half the price.</li>
    <li> Nice color and goes on nice and lasts quite a while</li>
    <li> No chapped lips and the color is so healthy looking. I feel naturally beautiful! This is my favorite lip product now! Muah!</li>
    <li> this gives just the right amount of color.  It goes on smoothly and feels good too!</li>
    <li> Great sheer color and a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I love the color! I&#x27;m very fair skinned, so I was nervous about trying this, but it is very sheer, and looks great on!</li>
    <li> Its not one of those 12 hour lip colors. This is a great color . The closest thing to the long departed Black Midnight they had in the 80&#x27;s. But! It will deposit unevenly if you drag it too quick or your lips are dry in some spots. I put a lipfinity type color on and use this on top for a slight rich red like top coat.</li>
    <li> I WAS NOT SURE I WOULD BE SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT WHEN IT ARRIVED BUT THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT. THE COLOR IS GREAT, IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY, VERY EASY TO APPLY, ALSO THE EASY TURN CARTRIDGE IS A GREAT IDEA. I GIVE THIS PRODUCT FIVE STARS. THANK YOU FOR THE SAMPLE.</li>
    <li> cheaper and more enjoyable than other tubes of colored chemical wax - good for starters, not to go gaga over</li>
    <li> i like it alot but i though it was gonna be lighter</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE lip color hands down.  I may occasionally have to reapply, but this product&lt;br /&gt;has made my lips smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> I really like this color, it is super simple but the more layers you use the darker it gets, I just like to use it as a tinted darker balm. Looks great on my skin tone, I&#x27;ve heard great things and I def would be down to try the other colors as well! Dark Honey for the win!</li>
    <li> The color looked dark when i initially look at it but once i put it on, the color was just right.  Not dark and not light. Truly a lovely and  bautiful color. Glides on the lips easily.</li>
    <li> Love this color. It&#x27;s subtle enough to wear everyday, but still makes me feel glamorous.</li>
    <li> Does not come on dark</li>
    <li> I really like this color!</li>
    <li> Always my favorite!! color goes with everything.</li>
    <li> this color looks great on anyone</li>
    <li> Sheer rich color that blends with most skin tones. Love this!</li>
    <li> Color is perfect...just a slight tint.  If I put it on too frequently throughout the day tho my lips dry out...but I have very sensitive lips.</li>
    <li> The color was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous, light, moisturizing color</li>
    <li> Omg. This shade is beyond perfect. Just dark enough to add color to my face but also not super heavy or cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I really like this lipstick. I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be a one size fits all color, and it is! I&#x27;m not much for wearing lipstick and have a hard time finding pretty shades. This almost lipstick is perfect and the color is very flattering.</li>
    <li> So, I have what you might call a &amp;#34;Jack White Bisque&amp;#34; level of pastiness when it comes to my skin tone. I blind people with my reflective glare when I walk in the daylight. It&#x27;s intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Honey looks just as good on me as it does on my friends who possess varying levels off melanin. It&#x27;s also more on the subtle side if you don&#x27;t want to commit to an intense lip.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try it and I really like it.</li>
    <li> Love it! It feels lightweight and looks natural. I have fair skin, green eyes, and dark red/brown hair. It adds just enough color to make my lips pop but not too much for an everyday look. Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the color you see on the stick. It really doesn&#x27;t come out that dark.</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite clinique lipcolor. It is not as dark as it looks as the prodeuct has a sheer quality to it. Many of my friends have tried it, or already have their own that I have seen their friends try out, and I can honestly say that I have not seen a single complexion that it looks bad on!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It used to come in a pretty skinny silver tube but the product is the same inside this red plastic tube. The color makes my lips look like a darker shade of my natural color but it&#x27;s more like a gloss than a lipstick. Not sticky or excessively wet but it makes my lips very smooth and shiny. The color is just right. It looks much darker in the tube than it actually goes on. Great for use on dry lips.</li>
    <li> My new go to lipstick.  Don&#x27;t let the name fool you, it&#x27;s light enough for every day, but still can be worn at night. Great size for the purse.</li>
    <li> This is the same lipstick as the stuff in the silver skinny tube, just different packaging (smaller size). Fits into the most impossibly small handbag &amp; is flattering (forgiving) on almost any skin tone. My favorite Clinique product (&amp; I have tried many) hands down. This price is so good, it&#x27;s usually $15+ for the regular one. I wondered if it was replica makeup at 1st coz of such a reasonable price but it&#x27;s real (authentic Clinique). It&#x27;s the same. This color looks scary dark in the tube so don&#x27;t let that put you off this color, it&#x27;s really very sheer &amp; a neutral medium rosy brown (MLBB), definitely not garish just really classy. It moisturized my lips very well &amp; has a good amount of lasting/staying power. When it wears off, it wears off evenly so u don&#x27;t have a noticeable ring of color on ur lips. This is a must-have makeup staple in my bag. I&#x27;ve gone thru ~probably 5 tubes of Black Honey since I discovered it in prep school &amp; it&#x27;s nice to have it available on Amazon for such a reasonable price. And fast shipping! You don&#x27;t have to make a trip to the Clinique counter it&#x27;s so convenient &amp; I can shop in my PJs (LOL). There is nothing bad I can say about this lipstick!!</li>
    <li> why did I wait so long before trying this amazing lipstick?! goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel dry even though it&#x27;s got AMAZING staying power. If you&#x27;re on the fence about spending a lot on a full size tube, try this little one. I am now going to buy the full size lipstick.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting this kind of lipstick for a while, but I don&#x27;t wear make up often and while it&#x27;s not horribly expensive, it is a little pricier than other lipsticks and I just couldn&#x27;t see myself paying around $20 for something I would hardly use, plus there was the fear I would end up not liking it, as well. So I when I saw they had a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; tube, for a good price, I felt it was perfect for me (and it is). It&#x27;s a really dark color in the tube, but when you put it on, it&#x27;s actually a sheer &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; that adjusts to the pigment in your lips, so the color is not only unique but goes well with any skin tone. And it feels great on, it&#x27;s not thick and sticky like a gloss, and is lighter than lipstick, it feels more like a lip balm. I have lots of lipstick laying around that I ended up not liking once I put it on, I will continue to buy this one.</li>
    <li> LOVE!! Its a perfect kinda translucent berry tone. Just a bit of color so the lips aren&#x27;t nude but not full on lipstick color. It&#x27;s a good compromise if you&#x27;re not big on lipstick but need some color. Feels light weight. And this size is perfect to carry in a small makeup bag in a purse.</li>
    <li> Soft on lips but color doesn&#x27;t show anything on my lips. I&#x27;m Asian and have dark pink lips</li>
    <li> This has a good color, which will show up differently on every person depending on the pigmentation of their lips. It is very moisturizing, but not particularly long lasting. However, it touches up well and looks beautiful while it stays on!</li>
    <li> ðŸ‘„fell in love!!! its now my favorite lipstick, I will order a dozen more! recomend for a natural look...ðŸ’„! zxxxx</li>
    <li> An awesome classic. Just remembered it after maybe 20 years. It looks dark, like a 90s shade of brown, but it is not at all. It basically enhances the color of your lips in an awesome natural and sheer way. I am so glad I bought this again!</li>
    <li> Many years ago, Clinique had a product called lip stain that I loved. Recently, someone recommended this product, and the name &amp;#34;Almost Lipstick&amp;#34; sounded promising. I use a lip stain underneath and this on top, and I love the results. This looks really dark in the tube, but it seems to adjust to match your own lip color. It is smooth, creamy, and kind of translucent. The tube is small, however.</li>
    <li> One of the reviews was right, hardly any color on me. It was a little disappointing. But it works good as moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Always wanted to try this color but it costs too much at Clinique to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; if I decided I didn&#x27;t like it.  It&#x27;s the perfect lipstick.  Goes on smooth, feels great!!! Not too glossy and not sticky at all.  It&#x27;s a sheer color and  is perfect with so many skin tones. Even my daughter&#x27;s who are darker than my pasty white self love it!! It&#x27;s my go to color from now on.</li>
    <li> I had known if this product for years and finally bought it. I&#x27;m so glad I did! This lipstick is more of a gloss and adds just the right amount of color. It is a very flattering color that moisturizes. I took off one star because the color does not last. I keep it in my pocket for touch ups.</li>
    <li> This is great for everyday and applied heavier, looks beautiful for evening.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Purchased because of all the hype. Disappointed, I didn&#x27;t like how it didn&#x27;t actually seem to moisturize or help my lips, and the color would settle into the dry skin or lines on my lips. Not flattering.</li>
    <li> Great color and moisture but did not last very long</li>
    <li> Nice, easy-to-apply color that you can layer if you want darker.  Flattering, with not too much gloss.</li>
    <li> Not the color that is featured in the photo</li>
