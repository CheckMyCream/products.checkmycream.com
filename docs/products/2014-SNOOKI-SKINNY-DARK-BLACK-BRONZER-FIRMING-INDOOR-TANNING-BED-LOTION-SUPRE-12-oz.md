<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Noticed after the first time I used that I was more tan than before. I tell everyone to use this tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Good but I don&#x27;t like the after smell...</li>
    <li> smells good works good</li>
    <li> Great lotion, works great!</li>
    <li> Smells great! I haven&#x27;t noticed it working better than my other lotions but it definitely smells nice after you get out of the tanning bed! I hate the burnt person smell you normally get and this stuff still smells nice! Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> Ordered this noticed the smell was off it was totally fake! Snooki normally has great products please beware!</li>
    <li> This lotion stinks! It doesn&#x27;t spread on very easily like other lotions and therefore you have to use more of it.  Plus I felt like it left me stinky and sticky.  The bed itself was sticky when I got out of it and it was like trying to buff wax off a car.  I also didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my colour when I was done like I do with other lotions.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the product</li>
    <li> Missed the return window by 3 days!!  I ordered the lotion a bit early bc I&#x27;m a planner and didn&#x27;t start using it right away. Well after a couple of weeks I have a rash all over my body. Small red bumps everywhere. It smells nice and feels nice... Until your body turns all red and bumpy. Not sexy.  Now I&#x27;ve wasted money and I look diseased.... Or worse.</li>
    <li> Smelled great and made my skin soft. Didn&#x27;t see much color.</li>
    <li> Loved it! I got excellent dark color and it kept my skin soft and didn‚Äôt have the icky bronzer smell! Im definitely going to invest in this product again!</li>
    <li> This stuff,  is great for tanning.  It really get u tanned.  I highly recommend buying on Amazon cause salons charge too much for the lotions.  I always buy online.. Good product..</li>
    <li> I bought this Lotion off of Amazon and the &amp;#34;sold by&amp;#34; said Authentic Tanning Products. The lotion did not have a pleasant smell, it smelled like cheap self tanner sold at Walmart. However, the lotion did moisturize my skin and help me tan more quickly. Consequently, the tan didn&#x27;t last past my shower 24 hours after I tanned. The lotion also had an unpleasant after tan smell. I would not recommend by this product from &amp;#34;sold by&amp;#34; Authentic Tanning Products or any lotion sold by them for that matter. it could have just been expired, I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
    <li> this is the best of snooki line so far it go&#x27;s on great and smells really good and it gives great color .</li>
    <li> I so far really like this product, some people have said there&#x27;s was fake but mine was the real deal. I kinda like the smell.. It&#x27;s like a juicy couture type smell.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! I used a lotion from her first line a couple years ago and loved it. I took a break from the tanning bed for a long while and as soon as I decided to start laying again I saw she had a new line of lotions and I HAD to try this one. It&#x27;s very hard for me to tan because I&#x27;m so freckley and naturally pale and this stuff works wonders for me! Buy it! :)</li>
    <li> Really like this lotion. It does exactly what it says it will do!  My tan looks great and the firming quality shows!  This is a great deal for the price and quality!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with any snooki products. Love the smell and texture of the lotion, it&#x27;s not watery and absorbs quickly. There&#x27;s no greasy feeling afterwards either</li>
    <li> I am in love with I will be trying more of her tanning lotions and will be re ordering this one</li>
    <li> This is probably the best tanning lotion I have ever used!! So happy that it includes firming!! It smells great, tones and this is the darkest I have ever been!  My skin even feels soft!  I use to use Jenny&#x27;s (JWows) but Nicole&#x27;s kills it!!</li>
    <li> It stinks, and I do not think it was a good batch. I had to mix other tanning lotions in with this one to make the scent bearable. I will not purchase again. I contacted the seller, and they wanted me to return the product on my own dime. They should pay for return shipping since I did not get Snooki&#x27;s lotion. This was a horrible batch.</li>
    <li> Eh....wasn&#x27;t wowed. No Tanning results...makes skin silky soft though!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all, I&#x27;ve used other products and have been able to tan. After I leave the saloon I look the same. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful but is alright as far as tanning/bronzing goes.</li>
    <li> I like it, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I&#x27;ve tried others I like better.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the results of this tanning lotion!!  I really liked the smell of this lotion!!  Excellent</li>
    <li> up until now, I have had great success ordering my lotions from Amazon. Everyone I have ever ordered have come in some type of shrink wrap or been wrapped to where I know it hasn&#x27;t been tampered with. Not the case with this, first clue was there was no wrapping at all just in a plain box and lid was loose. Next clue, when I smelled it, it barely had any scent at all, it smell straight up like self tanner. My daughter and I tried using it but both hated it, we smelled exactly like the self tanners from years ago even after showering. I have no doubt that this was tampered with. I bought samples elsewhere and compared the two and now I am sure this is not the authentic stuff.  So sad since I&#x27;ve always had a great experience ordering online. Oh and the upc code sticker that comes on the bottles was completely worn and faded, no doubt the bottle has been in water or been washed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this product at all</li>
    <li> The lotion does its job; moistuizes and leaves a slight stain on application. I don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this bronzer. It gives me the dark, deep tan that I want without spending a long time in the tanning bed. It smells wonderful and goes on like silk!</li>
    <li> Just received my lotion yesterday in the mail and tried it last night at the tanning salon. Love this lotion! The smell is AHH-MAZ-ING! And I got great color after using it for the first time. I use the Snooki Ultra dark Leg Bronzer for my legs and this lotion for the rest of my body! Both products are outstanding!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!  I cam go in a basic bed and get a great tan . And the fact that it protects my tattoos from fading is awesome !!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells awful. Tan acceleration is nothing special. Not my favorite!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and the lotion works amazing.</li>
    <li> I was warned that when you order these tanning bed lotions on line with Amazon you don&#x27;t really know if its the original authentic product and I didn&#x27;t believe it but they were absolutely  correct!  I used it once and I broke out in major red bumps on my body and I showed the employee who works there and she said this is not the correct color of the product or the way it smells.  So I threw it away. I wasted $26.10 on a fake product and I knew this was too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reluctant to do business with amazon due to this experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jill DeProto&lt;br /&gt;jill@riverhomes.com</li>
    <li> Tried this one and I&#x27;m a very advanced Tanner seems most are watered down, don&#x27;t last etctc&lt;br /&gt;BUT this one was real, gets you very dark, better then other snooki, Pauly d etc etc black storm, paint it black, jwow, list goes on but this one works does what it says and came shipped like never touched or opened before yeaaaaaaaa:-)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy again, don&#x27;t tan then jump into hot tub asap after thou or it yet any lotion will come off this does continue to darken over hours And bronzers so immediateely, light fresh smell not greasy it&#x27;s grand Slam for me!</li>
    <li> Has an odd smell but did help me tan just not as quickly as I was hoping</li>
    <li> she loved it said it makes her skin feel and smell great also it only took 3 uses for a full tan</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like any other tanning lotion nothing fancy. Not to many bronzers. But in all okay. Prolly will go with something different.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It smells good and you build a nice golden colored tan within just a few sessions. The firming and toning serum isnt bad either! :P</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!!  üòçüòçüòçüòç it is the best tanning lotion I ever used!! I like that it doesn&#x27;t have tingle because if my daughter touches me when I have tingle on it gives her a red rash.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It smells good. It makes you dark. What else could you ask for in a tanning lotion. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have used better by this line and gotten a little darker off others, but it does its job ok.</li>
    <li> Why the bad reviews? do you people not know how to tan and how tanning works? Of course you will get burnt, of course you won&#x27;t see color immediately on some people. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad, not too sure what y&#x27;all are smelling... I am fair skinned and part native american so i get color very quick after i BUILD A BASE TAN. i used this lotion to BUILD A BASE TAN. I was BURNT YES for a few days, but after my BASE TAN/SKIN COLOR developed, i had no problems with this lotion. i use it all the time. It makes my skin look great, a non fake tan color, and the fact this retails for $90 at salons and barely $30 on amazon its a steal. I have used several lotions before and none compare to this. So thankful for this lotion.</li>
    <li> fast shipping...love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the tanning lotion was supposed to smell the way it did.... But it smelt like burnt rubber and I felt super greasy when I was done tanning. I&#x27;ve tried other things from the Snooki line and they smelt &amp; felt great.... Maybe this lotion was old???</li>
    <li> Love it is all I can say</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! I love all the Snooki products I&#x27;ve tried so far. Love the body wash, lotion, leg tanning lotion and body tanning lotions. Never disappointed . Smells great before and after tanning and you notice a nice bronze color :)</li>
    <li> I received this quickly and the tanning lotion works great. This is definitely a deal too, good price! Helps me tan quicker and smells amazing (:</li>
    <li> The bottle was in a ziplock bag, with a piece of tape over the part that u squeeze the lotion out of... I don&#x27;t think that is a proper seal.</li>
    <li> The smell is tolerable after using, it did take a bit for me to notice some color from this lotion though. For the money it does a decent job, but I tan rather easy and think a better bronzer would work better.</li>
    <li> I love love love this tanning lotion! I will def buy again &amp; I have recommended to my family &amp; friends!</li>
    <li> Love this, it smells good and i could tell a differnce by rhe 3rd time i tanned! I highly reccomend this!</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple times already and I do not think its anything spectacular but it does have a nice fragrance</li>
    <li> Excellent product, hello beautiful tan.  Product works great!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and exact product we wanted!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but that&#x27;s all! This lotion has is a joke!  I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and it&#x27;s like tanning with regular skin lotion!  Absolutely no bronzer#</li>
    <li> I love all the Snooki tanning lotions. This has a great scene not too strong and works great!</li>
    <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend, wasn&#x27;t quite sure if he&#x27;d like it but he&#x27;s overall very satisfied.  He&#x27;s used it twice and a shade darker, the smell isn&#x27;t over bearing which is something he was looking for.  But it still covers the after tan smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gets you dark.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this lotion! It works as promised and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in color after a few uses in an instant bed. It smells amazing and I&#x27;ve struggled with cellulite and I&#x27;ve actually seen an improvement after using this lotion. I always hated washing my hands before getting into the bed with other lotions but with this one I don&#x27;t even have to worry about orange hands! It&#x27;s more than worth the price you pay.</li>
    <li> Ive tried so many different lotions and this one got me a definite color with just 4 uses! I will definitely buy this product again. The smell is great too!</li>
    <li> Smells good and works good , didn&#x27;t notice any streaking , would recommend to any tanner looking for a new lotion</li>
    <li> This has given me quick color without liking orange. I love the snooki line. I have it 4 stars because the greasy feeling afterwards but that goes away fairly quick,</li>
    <li> I love all Snooki products.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Used it twice and you can see how dark I got.</li>
    <li> Hate the the after smell, smells like the jergens lotion. Stains my hands. I feel there is not much color to it</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely horrible. I bought tanning lotion at Walmart and it already works better than this</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for about 4 years and this lotion is by far one of my favorites now.  It gives you a nice bronzed color without being orange.  The smell is also nice, a little strong but I love it.  If you appreciate tanning you will love this lotion.</li>
    <li> Works fast really like it.</li>
    <li> The item itself arrived on time and in perfect shape.  However I&#x27;m not impressed with the tanning this has done and the skinny part is not coming into play at all.  The scent wasn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve had other Snooki lotions that had a better scent.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I read review after review from a ton of different websites regarding this product, so I decided to order it. I don&#x27;t know if the stuff I ordered off of here is a knock off or what, but its horrible. The sample I used in the tanning salon gave me great, LASTING color, even after 1 use. I have been using the stuff I bought here almost daily for a couple weeks, and have barely gotten any color. I LOOK like I have color for a few hours after tanning, but it literally ALL washes off when I shower. I understand some time needs to pass so the color can settle before showering or whatever, but even if I wait till next morning to shower, it still all washes off. Totally bummed, but I learned my lesson. Will never order tanning lotion from Amazon again, and I normally order everything from here. By the way, I do not work for a tanning company or have any affiliation with any tanning products. I am just a chick that works behind a desk and likes to look tan.</li>
    <li> Recieved it super fast, love it!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works just as good. Love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion works well. It will get you darker, or it did me. Just not my absolute favorite. The scent is good though, doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt skin at all, good aroma!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other snooki lotions that work better and also have a more pleasant smell. Not horrible, but her old lotions were better.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. But I definitely prefer the more expensive Snooki lotion. This doesn&#x27;t get you as dark as quick. But still works ok!</li>
    <li> When receiving the lotion it was opened and poured out all over the bottle plus I feel the lotion was not the actual product because I compared the lotion I bought to the actual lotion sold in the tanning salon and was completely different color and different smell. Was not the same lotion. Was not pleased with product at all.</li>
    <li> This product works fairly well. It&#x27;s nothing special. I haven&#x27;t noticed any toning. And it smells awful. The texture is thick and kind of sticky</li>
    <li> Love this lotion smells good scent is not too strong . Would recommend to anyone also good moisturizer for skin. Has firming and toning components too</li>
    <li> Highly Recommend, It gives u a nice sun kissed glow without looking fake. the product smells great and doesnt streak. It also leaves your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I love everything by Snooki!</li>
    <li> It has a heavy smell that seemed hard to wash off. The end result was ok.</li>
    <li> Only bad thing i can say is the lotion has a weird texture.</li>
    <li> This arrived earlier than expected. I got it the day after I ordered it! I was very pleased with that. And I can&#x27;t even tell you how awesome this lotion smells!! It is a light scent, smooth lotion that goes on very easily. I will absolutely order this again! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Go Snooki!!  I have to admit that I doubted this but went ahead and bought it as I have a hard time achieving tan legs. I love this solution!!  It smells good. It doesn&#x27;t make me smell stinky after tanning. I like this lotion a lot!  Noticed better results on my legs after 2 tanning sessions.</li>
    <li> A huge fan or anything by SUPRE TAN. Snooki&#x27;s lotions all have a great flirty fragrance, which is what I love. This lotion also has caffeine so its energizes and tones my skin while im in the bed. It has natural bronzers and DHA bronzers, which is the best of both worlds. I got instant color as soon as i exited the salon and the color lasted on me for almost 2 weeks, I recommend this lotion for anyone who is a advanced tanner, if you are just starting out I would recommend going with her Pure or Black Bronzer. Def be buying this product again!!!</li>
    <li> Simply put....This stuff works!!!</li>
    <li> Did not like this, the smell was not good at all and it didn&#x27;t get you as dark as it portrays on the bottle. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Product came in a timely matter. lotion was shrink wrapped which was nice. The smell is not my favorite but as you tan it fades to a much more pleasant fragrance. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this lotion gave me a true brown color! After one use my skin felt softer and it helped to blend out my stretch marks. In the bottle the lotion is a taupe color.</li>
    <li> in the salon I go to she wants $85 for this. When I told her that I pay the amount I paid she said it was probably tampered with. I doubt that because it has a seal on it love this product don&#x27;t need that much and it smooth and over your entire body would definitely buy it again recommended</li>
    <li> It is fake. I bought this from the tanning salon before so I know it&#x27;s not the real thing. Also there is a typo on the back of the bottle. Scammers. Get a life.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product ended up being packaged as Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotion; however, it was really a regular sunless tanning lotion (it smelt like Jergens Natural Glow to myself and to a few tanning salon managers/consultants).  I have purchased tanning lotions from Amazon for years.  This is the first time that I have ever had an issue with the lotion not actually being what I thought I purchased.  I look forward to actually trying Snoozi&#x27;s Skinny Dark Black Bronzer lotion because it seems to be a great tanning lotion.  Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t going to be this time!</li>
    <li> I have used this item twice since I purchased so far and can see color immediately, it does like it says and will continue to color throughout the next several hours. So far, seems to protect tattoos. Does seem to make me look firmer as well. Subtle smell- great product.</li>
    <li> Love it!! It&#x27;s way cheaper then the salons and it smells good ,great lotion and  very happy with it will definitely get more when I run out!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!! I&#x27;m very pale so getting a tan is hard for me! I started using this product and people commented about how dark I was looking. Smell is a very sweet strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
    <li> The smell could be better but leaves skin feeling soft. Over all worth the money I have for it on here.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. Gets me tan super fast. No streaking at all. Smells fantastic. The best thing is that my skin is so soft and smooth after using it. I will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Heavy sweet smell if that makes since. The smell lingers all day. Results after day 3 are great considering I am a natural red head gone blonde with a snooki tan! Haha!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! First of all the bottle is so adorable and the cap is bejeweled. c&#x27;mon can it get any cuter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is that the lotion smells and feels amazing. it smells light and sweet and goes on smooth. It doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks and it has zero after tan odor. all you smell is the light sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tattoos so I love this lotion because it doesnt fade them.</li>
    <li> The only con I have is I wish this had a bit more of a strong scent.  That&#x27;s it! Otherwise, awesome lotion and great price!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad, doesn&#x27;t turn you orange.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like the other snookie lotions i have(cheetah print bottles) but it smells very clean And works fabulously!!!!!</li>
    <li> I usally buy from designer skin but I decided to try this product and I love it!! smell is very fruity and works great...no streaking or oily!! will be buying again soon!</li>
    <li> I would say this is a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; lotion or something to use right when you are starting to tan. I needed something to make my base darker and this is not working. The smell (or lack thereof) is really nice though</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product... review were get.  The first time I used product and got out of the sunbed the smell was horrible, tried for couple of minutes to see if it would fade away but nope... just got stronger after about 30 minutes had to go shower to get smell off.  Wasted my money !!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t real impressed with this one. Expected more. I definitely like the black bottle alot better. This lotion is a dud.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite snooker lotion I have tried yet! You can see a huge difference after a 1 time use and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells good, looks good, saw a result in just two tans, prices on amazon are the tits and who the hell doesn&#x27;t like anything with Snooki on it?!</li>
    <li> Loved the way it worked and the smell!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion for myself and a friend as well. And by doing this I also got free shipping, which was a plus. This lotion works great! I have been using the Snooki lotion for about a week now and I can see a big difference! Def worth the money you pay and it is also cheaper than the salon price!</li>
    <li> It works &amp; smells really really good! I like it! I would advise anyone to try it. For real. Lol.  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the different Jersey Shore brands of tanning lotions. This one, like all the others, was great. It doesn&#x27;t have an outrageous tanning smell like a lot of lotions do. It also gives a very nice bronze glow--not orange or streaky at all. Just remember to wipe your hands off after spreading it on. I would definitely buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell and feeling of this, although a little disappointed in the darkening effects.  I would order again, though.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my color that actually lasted. Right out of the tanning bed, you can see a slight difference but once you shower, it washes off. Definitely can tell there is self tanner in it. Won&#x27;t recommend to anybody and won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  My tanning salon told me to be careful with ordering lotion online - I opened a bottle that they had and it is the Same exact stuff, Looks the same, Smells the same.  The bottle I bought even had more in it - I&#x27;m assuming they have given samples out of the one at the salon.  I will ABSOLUTELY be buying this stuff again and online!!!!  I have used it twice and can already see the color difference!  LOVE IT :)</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this product. I trusted the Snooki Tan Lotion brand. It went on thick and it was so sticky. After I got done tanning the tanning bed reeked and so did my body. I had to go home and take two showers in order to get the smell off my skin. Do not waste your money or tanning time.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, smells good, keeps my skin soft and provides a good tan coverage.</li>
    <li> This lotion applies easily and penetrates your skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. The scent is nice and light.</li>
    <li> Has a good smell but the bronzers are weak and I have tanned several times with no noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve loved all of her lotions until now:(</li>
    <li> This stuff was awesome. I work in a tanning salon that doesn&#x27;t sell Snooki products; that&#x27;s why I bought it online. This stuff gets you darker and smells good. I bought from TheeTanMan.</li>
    <li> Just got the lotion not too long ago and it seems like it has given me more darker color in a couple of uses in high powered beds. I will purchase again I always switch up my lotions so my body doesnt get too use to 1.</li>
    <li> No scent, haven&#x27;t actually used it yet.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell!!!  Don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere if you tan outside of your home. Smells okay in the bottle, potent chemical smell after exposure. Thought it was my body chemistry and the lotion not mixing well- Let 2 of my friends use it, same results. Would not recommend. Gave it 2 stars because the bronzer is decent.</li>
    <li> Too Sticky &amp; Stinks like burnt skin!</li>
    <li> I received a fake product. It smelled of fake tanner and BURNED my skin. This has to be illegal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s either a fake or this product is so cheaply made. Has a self tanner in it. It turned me orange and stinks really bad.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this tanning lotion! highly recommend. very fast delivery! i could not be happier! thank you so much this was such a great birthday gift</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!  First, some background.  I am of Scandinavian descent, and live in a northern plains cold weather state.  You couldn&#x27;t find a paler body than mine unless you were to round up an albino.  Seriously,  when I go outside in the spring in my jean shorts I have to be careful not to blind passing motorists with the reflection from my legs.  I always loved the beautiful orange hue that made Snooki a megastar, but I knew that given my genetic makeup and geographical challenge it was never going to happen for me. (that and the fact that our summers here are approximately 60 days long, and it is impossible to sit outside and tan because of the mosquitos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold, I discovered the Snooki Bronzer.  No way, I said.  this is to good to be true.  Is there a product out there that would give a 55 year old overweight scandinavian man the healthy Mediterranean glow he had always desired?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is true.  I purchased my first bottle and raced to the local tanning salon (which is located in a service station and video store..and they also sell bait and broasted chicken).  I stripped down to my speedo and oiled myself up.  After a few days people stopped me on the street to compliment me.  It was working!!  (one note, though, make sure your doctor knows that you don&#x27;t have Hep C)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion but am only giving it four stars because I&#x27;m not sure what the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; aspect is supposed do.  It&#x27;s a great bronzer; I&#x27;m okay with the smell, and I love how it feels on my skin.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any firming though.</li>
    <li> One star need I say more</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this lotion! Great color even after only tanning for 2 days.  It doest stain your clothes. Just a heads up that it smells like cologne but it&#x27;s a good smelling cologne so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I like the thickness of the lotion as it keeps your skin soft. But not the darkness I expected. I wouldn&#x27;t tell you not to try it as everyone&#x27;s idea of dark is different. But I think I&#x27;m gonna  go back to my other lotion.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion</li>
    <li> This was my second time ordering this product and I absolutely LOVE it so I decided to rate it. The price is a steal and both times I ordered it, it arrived earlier than the expected delivery date which is always nice. I love snooki but even if I hated her I&#x27;d still purchase this product over and over again that&#x27;s how good it is. It smells great and gives you instant amazing color that continues to develop hours after you&#x27;ve tanned. This lotion leaves my skin so smooth and makes my tan last longer. I&#x27;m 25 and have been a tanner since I was 15 so I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY tanning products and this lotion is by far in my top three. I highly recommend this and will order this again and again!</li>
