      <li>I am satisfied with the product for the most part.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>There are periods of time when more eyelashes fall out than others</li>
      <li>Eyelids are more itchy than with latisse or revitalash.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love it♡</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is as though my eyebrows have reappeared like magic...</li>
      <li>And both of those products worked much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve come back and bought 3 more as gifts for friends and family!!!</li>
      <li>I find it works best when you apply it at night - either directly after taking off your makeup and washing your face, or right before you go to sleep.</li>
      <li>But after I applied RapidLash to them for a month, they are looking much fuller, and areas that remained hairless after the overplucking have now started to grow a good amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this  for eyebrows; It makes a  significant difference in growth.</li>
      <li>It works fine, at a fraction of the cost of the brand name prescription product.</li>
      <li>By four months both my lashes and eyebrows have filled in.  </li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about a month and am seeing a difference more in length of my lashes not so much volume.  </li>
      <li>I love Rapid Lash, it really does work.  </li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t  always arrive full.</li>
      <li>It is fine but exactly what I was using for just eyelashes.</li>
      <li>They were super red/blood shot looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other similar products before but RapidLash gives the best and most consistent results.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about this product..</li>
      <li>Takes time but its worth it</li>
      <li>I apply it every night right on the rim and it never irritates me.</li>
      <li>and I have been applying it since the first week of January.</li>
      <li>it is pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing better for short or sparse lashes.  </li>
      <li>questions for this asked if the product caused irritation, I answered no, but when I first started using it, I was using too much</li>
      <li>But from my experience, RapidLash helps the process go much faster</li>
      <li>my wife has not noticed much of a difference in her eye lashes or brows.  </li>
      <li>This really work, I got mine at Costco</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real changes.</li>
      <li>I have to say I have longer lashes,and really have no complaints.</li>
      <li>Nothing much comes out.  </li>
      <li>it is that much more apparent that the lashes have definitely been affected positively by this stuff!&lt;br</li>
      <li>When your eyelashes get much longer, perhaps it is more noticeable to you when a few fall out.</li>
      <li>Have an extra tube that will go in the trash most likely.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical but I am soooo happy I bought it.</li>
      <li>New in a box will take time to review will keep you posted.</li>
      <li>Eventually they fall out and new ones grow.</li>
      <li>I never thought my eyelashes could be this long but thanks to this stuff they have grown so much!</li>
      <li>My upper lashes are almost twice their original length and definitely thicker.</li>
      <li>Also, obviously, because the general length of the lashes is now longer, it may take more time for the brand new lashes to catch up than it previously did.</li>
      <li>its as if it is old.</li>
      <li>Both my mother and I use it and it has lengthened our eye lashes considerably.</li>
      <li>It seemed like it was old</li>
      <li>even use it on my 8 year old and hers are longer them mine</li>
      <li>Been using for nearly a month.</li>
      <li>My guess is the conditioner delays shedding so they have time to thicken and lengthen naturally.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>It takes about a month to really notice the results but now they&#x27;re obvious.</li>
      <li>Well worth every cent I spent.</li>
      <li>..saw a small amount of change on lashes, not much, packaging is super cheap and looks unprofessional.  </li>
      <li>Because they are new lashes, they are pointing in all different directions.</li>
      <li>There is enough on the brush when you put it on the first eye, but then you have to swirl it around and around and around to get enough on it for the 2nd eye.  </li>
      <li>I even found one wild lash that curlicued and was a third longer than the others.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it for a few days and went back to using it, being more careful to not over saturate the eyelash line.  </li>
      <li>Also, I had practically no lashes on my lower lid and after applying RapidLash for some time, I now have a normal amount of lashes there - some of which are quite long</li>
      <li>This new bottle bought a month ago is almost dry.  </li>
      <li>After I did eyelash extensions for three times over 5 months last year, my eyelashes ended up very short, almost barely there.</li>

<li> she thinks maybe she needs to keep applying it for at least another month to see any real results.</li>
<li> they are the almost as long as when I was a teenager and started mucking about with make up.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as I continue to see these results.</li>
<li> This makes my eyelashes SO long that I get compliments all the time.</li>
<li> Tiny whisps became true lashes and a small gap in my lower lash-line is filling in slowly.</li>
<li> My lower eyelid appears to be a little red in the morning following the application.</li>
<li> The only issue is often the packaging comes almost empty!</li>
<li> to sparse but very long.</li>
<li> so it could not be closed</li>
<li> This order, however, the product seems to be empty.  </li>
<li> rough rubbing of eyes, etc.</li>
<li> Have used the product before and it works as expected.</li>
<li> My eyebrows never really recovered.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been told by other users that eventually they will fill in and fan outward.</li>
<li> At 53 my lashes and eyebrows were thinning due to menopause</li>
<li> I have been using a long time and it usually works.  </li>
<li> Before this I used Lashlove which also showed results but not like rapidlash and rapidlash is half the price of my previous product.</li>
<li> I never had long thick lashes although mine are quite dark.</li>
<li> It does tend to be irritating, so I only use it every other day, but still get the results!</li>
<li> It take a few weeks</li>
<li> Felt like I had been crying a lot.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now.</li>
<li> this was a waste for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product religiously since I purchased it. Nothing!!! It must be that each person reacts differently to different solutions. Latisse has worked for me. I think you get what you pay for bc this was a waste for me.</li>
    <li> It reddens the rim of my eyes</li>
    <li> This makes my eyelashes SO long that I get compliments all the time. It does tend to be irritating, so I only use it every other day, but still get the results!</li>
    <li> New in a box will take time to review will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I love this  for eyebrows; It makes a  significant difference in growth. The only issue is often the packaging comes almost empty! its as if it is old. Has anyone else experienced this issue?  The product doesn&#x27;t  always arrive full.</li>
    <li> It works.......really!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My lashes are longer than ever. Every once in a while I find my lashes need a break from the serum. I quit for a month or so and then start again. No need for false lashes here! (I have not noticed any improvements in the thickness of my eyebrows though.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years.  I have to say I have longer lashes,and really have no complaints. And I put it on during the day instead of night. .still no issues.</li>
    <li> RapidLash Eyelash Serum seems to be living up to my expectations.  I have been using it for about a month and am seeing a difference more in length of my lashes not so much volume.  I am satisfied with the product for the most part.  The problem is I did order the RapidLash and Eyebrow Serum combination, but only received the eyelash one.  I am anxious to try it on my eyebrows so I will be placing an order for the eyebrow serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using a long time and it usually works.  This new bottle bought a month ago is almost dry.  Nothing much comes out.  I still put it on rim.  After 3 weeks nothing has happened.  Definitely something wrong.  However, i have to say it always worked before</li>
    <li> I love Rapid Lash, it really does work.  Both my mother and I use it and it has lengthened our eye lashes considerably.</li>
    <li> my wife has not noticed much of a difference in her eye lashes or brows.  i don&#x27;t either.  she thinks maybe she needs to keep applying it for at least another month to see any real results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazinggggg!! I was skeptical but I am soooo happy I bought it. I never thought my eyelashes could be this long but thanks to this stuff they have grown so much! Buy it if you want your best lashes imaginable!</li>
    <li> I recently received my RapidLash. I am extremely disappointed because it seems as if the product is almost &#x27;empty&#x27;</li>
    <li> I bought it with a doubt but it works! I noticed the difference in one month.</li>
    <li> I use on my eyebrows and lashes and have noticed a big difference!</li>
    <li> I got the wrong order</li>
    <li> (This is Janelle in my fiance&#x27;s account) This stuff is amazing!  I have been using it on my eyelash line for fuller lashes, as well as my eyebrows, which were thinning out towards the outer parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is as though my eyebrows have reappeared like magic...it is pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are fuller and longer...When I use mascara it is that much more apparent that the lashes have definitely been affected positively by this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The questions for this asked if the product caused irritation, I answered no, but when I first started using it, I was using too much and it was seeping into my eyes at night, which gave me really badly irritated eyeballs for a day.  They were super red/blood shot looking. Felt like I had been crying a lot.  I stopped using it for a few days and went back to using it, being more careful to not over saturate the eyelash line.  It has not caused me anymore irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will def be purchasing this again when I am out of this tube...I am so thankful for this product!</li>
    <li> Very very great !!!&lt;br /&gt;i love it♡</li>
    <li> I just started using it but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely made my lashes longer in 2 weeks!! Will order again.</li>
    <li> This really work, I got mine at Costco you get 2 3ml. tubes for 49.99$&lt;br /&gt;I even use it on my 8 year old and hers are longer them mine lol</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple years and love it!</li>
    <li> I got a rash under my eye after I apply it. Maybe not suitable for me :(</li>
    <li> It is fine but exactly what I was using for just eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It seemed like it was old</li>
    <li> Made my lashes to longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it is very good. It did not change the color of my lids, it did lengthen my lashes and I can even get away with not wearing mascara.</li>
    <li> Have used the product before and it works as expected.</li>
    <li> I love RapidLash! I&#x27;ve used other similar products before but RapidLash gives the best and most consistent results. My upper lashes are almost twice their original length and definitely thicker. Also, I had practically no lashes on my lower lid and after applying RapidLash for some time, I now have a normal amount of lashes there - some of which are quite long too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also works on eyebrows. During the 90s, makeup artists constantly overplucked my eyebrows as thinner, ultra-groomed eyebrows were the fashion then. My eyebrows never really recovered. But after I applied RapidLash to them for a month, they are looking much fuller, and areas that remained hairless after the overplucking have now started to grow a good amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply RapidLash once a day. I find it works best when you apply it at night - either directly after taking off your makeup and washing your face, or right before you go to sleep. I don&#x27;t apply it during the day as it might affect any mascara you apply over it and cause it to flake. Take care not to let eye cream mix with the RapidLash gel as it can prevent the gel from working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some reviews about how after several months of using RapidLash, some users felt it stopped working and they began to lose lashes instead. This has nothing to do with the quality of the product. Eyelashes don&#x27;t last forever. Eventually they fall out and new ones grow. When your eyelashes get much longer, perhaps it is more noticeable to you when a few fall out. Also, obviously, because the general length of the lashes is now longer, it may take more time for the brand new lashes to catch up than it previously did. There are periods of time when more eyelashes fall out than others - be it the cause of nature or because of make-up/mascara removal/rough rubbing of eyes, etc. Hair falls out and it grows back. That is just what it does! But from my experience, RapidLash helps the process go much faster and the end results are amazing.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed. I see growth and volume. No doubt about it!  Definite repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great. Takes time but its worth it</li>
    <li> At 53 my lashes and eyebrows were thinning due to menopause so I tried Rapid Lash. I started seeing results at around two months. By four months both my lashes and eyebrows have filled in.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as I continue to see these results.</li>
    <li> Been using for nearly a month. I haven&#x27;t seen any real changes. Definitely feel cheated</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks.  My lower eyelid appears to be a little red in the morning following the application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and never had a problem.  The product works great if there is anything in the tube when you get it.  This order, however, the product seems to be empty.  There is enough on the brush when you put it on the first eye, but then you have to swirl it around and around and around to get enough on it for the 2nd eye.  I feel I was short-changed by this vendor.</li>
    <li> After using regularly for a couple months. Not any changes. Eyelids are more itchy than with latisse or revitalash. And both of those products worked much better. Have an extra tube that will go in the trash most likely. Going back to revitalash</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It works fine, at a fraction of the cost of the brand name prescription product. The brand name product Latisse requires a prescription and costs $150. I paid $25 for this!   I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now. My lashes have gone from non-existant (Asian lashes!) to sparse but very long. Because they are new lashes, they are pointing in all different directions. I&#x27;ve been told by other users that eventually they will fill in and fan outward.</li>
    <li> It works! My lashes are definitely longer. It takes about a month to really notice the results but now they&#x27;re obvious. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;m on my second tube now. Before this I used Lashlove which also showed results but not like rapidlash and rapidlash is half the price of my previous product. It lasts about 2 months. Everyone thinks my lashes are fake. I&#x27;ve come back and bought 3 more as gifts for friends and family!!!</li>
    <li> All I can say is it works!</li>
    <li> You will never have Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s extra-long, double-rows, but your own lashes _will_ improve. My guess is the conditioner delays shedding so they have time to thicken and lengthen naturally. Tiny whisps became true lashes and a small gap in my lower lash-line is filling in slowly. I even found one wild lash that curlicued and was a third longer than the others. (Kinda hated to pluck the plucky eccentric)</li>
    <li> Nothing better for short or sparse lashes.  It take a few weeks then you&#x27;ll be amazed at the change.</li>
    <li> I never had long thick lashes although mine are quite dark. After I did eyelash extensions for three times over 5 months last year, my eyelashes ended up very short, almost barely there.This product worked after THREE months. But hell it worked!! they are the almost as long as when I was a teenager and started mucking about with make up. Would i recommend it? i couldn&#x27;t be happier! I apply it every night right on the rim and it never irritates me. It dries up immediately. Well worth every cent I spent. and I have been applying it since the first week of January.</li>
    <li> I PAID XTRA FOR BOTH THE EYEBROW &amp; EYELASH SERUM &amp; ONLY RECEIVED THE EYELASH SERUM!! UGH!!!!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this product..thick ugly brown liquid..burnt my eye when it accidentally got inside..cap broke after awhile so it could not be closed..saw a small amount of change on lashes, not much, packaging is super cheap and looks unprofessional.  Not my cup of tea and would not repurchase</li>
    <li> l  like it  works well</li>
    <li> This product actually works!  I was a sceptic, but my lashes are thicker.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it works yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product if you are consistent..Make your eyelashes fuller and longer. Don&#x27;t expect false eyelashes look if you have small eyelashes to begin with but you will definitely see improvement.</li>
