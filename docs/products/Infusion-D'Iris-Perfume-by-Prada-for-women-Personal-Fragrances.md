      <li>So the wife is twice as happy with the deal!</li>
      <li>Great Product and Product is as described!!!</li>

      <li>Arrived satisfactory and in excellent order!  </li>
      <li>Great gift and smells wonderful!</li>
      <li>This perfume is a joy to wear.</li>
      <li>LOL I believe that you should never smell someones perfume unless you are in close contact</li>
      <li>And of course, I think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>scent is now a happy member of my dresser glass perfume tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>

      <li>My girlfriend gets compliments on it, which always makes a woman happy.  </li>
      <li>Smells great &amp; luxurious.</li>
      <li>However, it is still a very nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>She loves the fragrance and the value was amazing!</li>
      <li>It still smells great, but not as good as the parfum (smells soap-ier).  </li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, I have had a surprising number of compliments on the fragrence.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>She loved it.</li>
      <li>Good price, too.</li>
      <li>My fave perfume and good price.</li>
      <li>I loved it and decided to try it out on me.</li>
      <li>I have both this and the Absolue edition of this and while both of these are based on the note of iris, this one is a lighter one - not shorter-lasting, but a greener and herbier one compared to the gorgeous and buttery head-turning &amp;#34;big guns&amp;#34; of the absolue versions.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>I Love, Love, Love this scent!!!  </li>
      <li>It has the perfect balance of floral and cedar for a fabulously fresh scent that is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Nice parfume good deal</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and I will buy it again!</li>
      <li>I love this perfume!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon could have better control of your sellers!</li>
      <li>My favorite perfume, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them!  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is amazing.  </li>
      <li>The resulting olfactory sensation evokes a memory of being caught in a warm rain in a cedar wood with the ground covered with blooming irises.</li>
      <li>I think it smells nice on her.</li>
      <li>This is the kind of smell I would expect to find in an eighty year-old woman&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
      <li>Treat someone to  something nice for Valentines Day.</li>
      <li>Great Fragrance - quick delivery</li>
      <li>I love both of them, each in their own way.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled, it kinda puts me in the mind of my Balenciaga,both smell heavenly.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, shipped quickly and for free, authentic Prada at a great price.</li>
      <li>It is a very light, floral scent that stays with you.  </li>
      <li>In my OWN words this is most feminine, fresh and sexy fragrance out there!</li>
      <li>The clarity of the notes of orange leaf, cedar, incense, tangerine, and obviously, the Iris, that blend perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is one of two favorite perfums..</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a gift.  </li>
      <li>Piercing and striking, Prada Infusion d&#x27;Iris is able to adapt to the woman, expressing all his strength, with freshness, sensuality and lighting.</li>
      <li>But a lovely fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.....</li>
      <li>The scent on that piece of paper lasted longer and smells better than the perfume.  </li>
      <li>Finally found the perfect perfume!</li>
      <li>LOVE this scent.  </li>
      <li>Moms love this kinda stuff.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>and I just love it.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Love this perfume...</li>
      <li>love it.  </li>
      <li>I get so many compliments everywhere</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>What more is there to say.</li>
      <li>Though classified as a floral scent, Infusion D&#x27;Iris is much more sofisticated and unlike anything else you can find in a department store.</li>
      <li>Prada Infusion d&#x27;iris is the best and it lasts so very long...</li>
      <li>When I sprayed a bit more than ususal, it releases a strong alcohol smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant smell and not too much.  </li>
      <li>This is real and the whole process was perfect.</li>
      <li>Fits in my purse, makeup bag and easy to take on travel.</li>
      <li>Received this product very quickly (within 24 hours of ordering).</li>
      <li>When I spray the perfume on my body, the most recognizable top notes are iris, cedar and incense, balanced by greenery.</li>
      <li>The rep did a fantastic job of selling the scent and mystic of the Prada line of perfumes and colognes.  </li>
      <li>If you want something different from the crowd, Prada Infusion D&#x27;iris is great</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s light, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up for a long-lasting fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s BLUE GRASS (all purpose day scent), JOY by Patou, Chanel 5, L&#x27;Air du Temps and Cuban baby  </li>
      <li>Smell of cheap soap ...</li>
      <li>IT IS A CHEAP COPY.</li>
      <li>I have always thought clean smelling was better than a scent that was too strong or simply did not smell good on me.</li>
      <li>I too thought that the scent didn&#x27;t last all day until I realized that when I had occasion to hug people after leaving work I still received compliments on how great I smelled.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend loves the freash, clean, and light scent of the product.</li>
      <li>Nice, soft, feminine, not overpowering or strong, but doesn&#x27;t fade away either.</li>
      <li>The product was great , My problem was it took to long to get to me.</li>
      <li>When wearing Infusion D&#x27;Iris, the first compliment is the one I get most often.</li>
      <li>I first bought this fragrance about a year ago and I love it.  </li>
      <li>But for people who LOVE the real scent, you will notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I contacted Amazon and they offered a full refund immediately.  </li>
      <li>It is light and fresh, not too sweet</li>
      <li>Other than that, great price and service.</li>
      <li>Warm, pleasant and light, but long lasting.</li>
      <li>It is a light scent that is warm enough to do well in the winter months as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those loyal gals.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re looking at trying something new</li>
      <li>the first time I smelled it on a client I knew I had to have it!</li>
      <li>Which is great if you work in a tight environment.</li>
      <li>It has a very light and natural, old-fashioned botanical scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a head turner because I&#x27;m always being told that I smell amazing even hours and hours after spraying.</li>
      <li>This was a birthday present for my wife and she was thoroughly thrilled with it.  </li>
      <li>Reminded me and my daughter of the Gloria Vanderbilt perfume that was a favorite of my 86 year old mother in law.</li>
      <li>His is nice but does not last</li>
      <li>I really love the clean fruit mixed with the heady incense sorts of layers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Prada Infusion D&#x27;Iris for a little over a year and I just love it.  It is a very light, floral scent that stays with you.  I work in an office with a number of people who are affected by colognes and I have never had a single complaint.  As a matter of fact, I have had a surprising number of compliments on the fragrence.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of smell I would expect to find in an eighty year-old woman&#x27;s bathroom. I can only describe the odor as \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; and very much like baby powder.</li>
    <li> Though classified as a floral scent, Infusion D&#x27;Iris is much more sofisticated and unlike anything else you can find in a department store. It has that \\&quot;small boutique\\&quot; feel. When I spray the perfume on my body, the most recognizable top notes are iris, cedar and incense, balanced by greenery. The resulting olfactory sensation evokes a memory of being caught in a warm rain in a cedar wood with the ground covered with blooming irises. Warm, pleasant and light, but long lasting. On occasion, I can feel it linger thru the following morning, while I undress for a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a difference when someone says to you \\&quot;you smell so good\\&quot;, vs. \\&quot;your perfume smells so good\\&quot;... When wearing Infusion D&#x27;Iris, the first compliment is the one I get most often. The perfume does NOT overwhelm the person. Which is great if you work in a tight environment. Your co-workers will thank you ;o).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can think of is that the scent is now gaining in popularity. My consolation is that its prevailing notes do seem to change significantly depending on the individual wearer&#x27;s body chemistry (unlike Eternity, for example, which is VERY recognizable, regardless on whom it is). It is a light scent that is warm enough to do well in the winter months as well. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was passing by at a departmental store when the SA gave me a small card with this fragrance on it. Of course I didn&#x27;t rest until i went back for the full bottle. Unfortunately, after a few months of light use our love affair waxed cold, and I just could not understand why I always shied away from using it. I discovered it had this old smell :( same one that I associate with my one time favorite as well- Chanel No. 5. My sister loves the Prada so I gave it to her.</li>
    <li> Arrived satisfactory and in excellent order!  It&#x27;s a pleasant smell and not too much.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of possitive compliments.  I refered them to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Prada perfume for my wife for Christmas.  She loves the fragrance and the value was amazing! Treat someone to  something nice for Valentines Day.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, shipped quickly and for free, authentic Prada at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I agree with the reviews below except on one point. I too thought that the scent didn&#x27;t last all day until I realized that when I had occasion to hug people after leaving work I still received compliments on how great I smelled. LOL I believe that you should never smell someones perfume unless you are in close contact otherwise you have on too much.</li>
    <li> What a waste of 70 bucks!  Bought this perfume after sniffing a sample in a magazine.  The scent on that piece of paper lasted longer and smells better than the perfume.  What a disappointment!!!  It smells nothing like the swatch and it feels like your are spraying yourself with febreeeze!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Girlfriend.  2nd bottle.  She loves it.  The first bottle was a smaller one (1.7 oz) purchased from a Prada store from a visiting Prada rep.  The rep did a fantastic job of selling the scent and mystic of the Prada line of perfumes and colognes.  Now that we know, this larger bottle (3.4 oz) was a much better value through Amazon.  My girlfriend gets compliments on it, which always makes a woman happy.  And of course, I think it&#x27;s great.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff.  As a life long user of White Diamonds, I got a sample in a store recently and my husband loves this even more.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and I will buy it again! This was my third time purchasing this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is amazing.  At first it seems quite light, but on the skin it releases different notes throughout the day and it is very long-lasting. It&#x27;s my new signature scent.  I get tons of compliments.  Will buy another one when it finishes.</li>
    <li> Not too overpowering but stays with you. Others ask what I&#x27;m wearing</li>
    <li> This is one of two favorite perfums.. why else would I order it?  some requests for posting should ask if it is for a gift or for yourself?  Is it the first you have used or are you trying it out?</li>
    <li> I Love, Love, Love this scent!!!  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t stay smelling great very long.  Within an hour or two, the smell is gone.  There aren&#x27;t words to describe the perfume itself, it&#x27;s just so much different from anything else which is why I got it.  If you want something different from the crowd, Prada Infusion D&#x27;iris is great just be warned that it doesn&#x27;t stick very long.</li>
    <li> Many complain that their product is fake.  The problem is when shopping for perfume or cologne you must select \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; as your only seller.  If you buy direct from amazon the product is not fake.  The others ARE fake because they buy the fake cologne from LA or other parts of the US; like this small cologne stores in the mall.  Hope this helps!  Now about the perfume: My girlfriend loves it.  It smells great and lasts almost all day.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> Finally found the perfect perfume! Smells great &amp; luxurious. Will definitely reorder again.</li>
    <li> Moms love this kinda stuff. Buy it for her. She&#x27;ll smell nice and still be that evil witch.</li>
    <li> Original fragrance, not old. Good product. Will keep buying it from Amazon. Bought one in another site that was cheaper, ended up with a fake fragrance. Returned it and got a refund, here no problem at all.</li>
    <li> The product was great , My problem was it took to long to get to me.It was a gift , and it was given late. It took like 9 days to get.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again from dealer. But know now how long it takes to Get</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Does not have the strength of the real Prada. I say real.......because this smells like a knock off.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years.  When I saw the price difference between here and Nordstrom (almost half off) I bought a bottle without reading any reviews.  Immediately upon opening the box and looking at the packaging, I was suspicious.  I opened it and used it for a day and as soon as it was on my skin I was absolutely convinced that this is not the real Prada perfume I know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very close scent, so if it is worth it to you to have something similar without it being authentic, then I would say go for it.  But for people who LOVE the real scent, you will notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed, because be aware YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS.  However, I contacted Amazon and they offered a full refund immediately.  With any luck they&#x27;ll remove the listing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product last week, arrived on time and properly. However ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I picked up the box of the perfume, I realized that the plastic that wraps around the box was open at the bottom. I have started to suspect.&lt;br /&gt;When I pulled the glass I saw that the color was a little dubious, grabbed a paper and tested perfume .... TERRIBLE!! Smell of cheap soap ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have to say, trying to get my money back, but I see my defeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon could have better control of your sellers!</li>
    <li> love it. saw it in sephora for $10 more expensive, knew that prime would have me covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this scent. it&#x27;s classic, soft, and romantic. i will forever be wearing this.</li>
    <li> Nice parfume good deal</li>
    <li> This was a birthday present for my wife and she was thoroughly thrilled with it.  What more is there to say.</li>
    <li> I tried to complain and return this perfume but never got a response. The perfume was fake. It had a bogus and obviously counterfeit label and the perfume inside was water with no real smell. As above I tried to address the problem but was ignored.</li>
    <li> its no what i wanted its other fragance</li>
    <li> Reminded me and my daughter of the Gloria Vanderbilt perfume that was a favorite of my 86 year old mother in law. Enough said. It had to go back.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume...the price was awesome..I recommend it..smells great and great price...almost half of original price can&#x27;t beat that Ty.</li>
    <li> I first bought this fragrance about a year ago and I love it.  It has a very light and natural, old-fashioned botanical scent.  It is light and fresh, not too sweet and I get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those loyal gals. When I love a perfume, I stick to it and only add one to my dresser top (and use) every blue moon. I&#x27;ve used Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s BLUE GRASS (all purpose day scent), JOY by Patou, Chanel 5, L&#x27;Air du Temps and Cuban baby  violets perfume since, I was a teenager. When I discovered Chanel 22 in the nineties, I added that as my fave perfume, and it continues to be my fave, though pricey and hard to find. My newer daytime casual perfume (less favorite than BLUE GRASS, but second to that) is Philosophy&#x27;s INNER GRACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past summer, I decided I wanted to try scents (a risky business for me due to asthma/allergies/sensitivities, hence my sticking to tried and true). I ended up buying this one after going back three times to test it. I really love the clean fruit mixed with the heady incense sorts of layers. The phrase Prada Infusion d&#x27;Iris brings to mind is \\&quot;holy spring\\&quot;. The incense/woodsy notes makes me think of a timbered chapel and the green and fruity notes make me think of full-blown iris-graced, leafy late spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lovely scent that starts out really sharp/bright/strong, but calms down into something muskish/fresh and light and floral, but with sensual underpinnings from that musky/woody/incensey layer. It&#x27;s not a super long lasting scent, but it&#x27;s beautiful. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the scent of Iris or the sensuality of incense/muskiness, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is now a happy member of my dresser glass perfume tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
    <li> This is not authentic prada infusion diris the packaging is similar but the actual perfume is not the same in anyway.</li>
    <li> But a lovely fragrance. I miss the old time fragrances that use to last for the whole day. His is nice but does not last</li>
    <li> Prada Infusion d&#x27;iris is the best and it lasts so very long...I usually wear my office clothing twice before dry cleaning it and it could be 2 months before I wear the blouse again and can still smell the Prada. These people that are saying the scent does not last may be purchasing the eau toilette instead of the parfum or their body chemistry is so that scents do not last long on them. This is by far my fav!!! the first time I smelled it on a client I knew I had to have it! It&#x27;s definitely a head turner because I&#x27;m always being told that I smell amazing even hours and hours after spraying.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever discontinue it. I get so many compliments everywhere I go whenever I wear it, people just rave about it; men &amp; women. Nice, soft, feminine, not overpowering or strong, but doesn&#x27;t fade away either.</li>
    <li> WOW! How can I praise this fragrance? In my OWN words this is most feminine, fresh and sexy fragrance out there! I am a BIG perfume lover and I have tried and still do try every fragrance out there. This one remains in my TOP 3 for several years now. I am a female in my late 20&#x27;s and honestly I have progressed from poison like smelling scents to fresh and clean floral scents and absolutely love this one. The scent lingers on for long long time and after you put it on, about a minute later it starts smelling even better once it diffuses a bit in the air. My other top two along with this one are Chancel Tendre and Cashmere Mist and they are all in the same category. The design of the bottle is extremely simply and classy and it&#x27;s not bulky at all unlike some other 3.4oz bottles. Fits in my purse, makeup bag and easy to take on travel. I usually stock up on this before it&#x27;s even finished and I wear it nearly every day! Always getting complements on the scent too wherever I go.</li>
    <li> This is the wife&#x27;s favorite perfume..... I purchased this for her birthday.... searched other websites and local stores and they mostly sell at full retail which is way, way more than this size was priced here. In fact this 3.4 ounce size was actually less than the retail price of the 1.7 ounce version (what she had before). So the wife is twice as happy with the deal!</li>
    <li> Great gift and smells wonderful! Super fast shipping, Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend. She loved it.</li>
    <li> The perfume is sophisticated and long lasting. The seller got it to us quickly and packed the box with goodies, such as coupons, a free tote, and product samples. What a treat.</li>
    <li> Paid $50 for it when it was sold on their website for $110.  Nice scent, not strong.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Received this product very quickly (within 24 hours of ordering). However was sad to see the condition of the container upon opening. The face plate of the perfume had fallen off and based on the quality now leads me to believe this is a knock off. Smells very similar to the real perfume but i&#x27;m rather certain this is fake. Very sad :(</li>
    <li> Great Fragrance - quick delivery</li>
    <li> Packaging was printed off center and sideways... I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a gift.  The perfume is very likely a knock-off. The fragrance was not entirely the same and doesn&#x27;t last quite as long. However, it is still a very nice fragrance. I will probably just pay more for the real thing in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It has the perfect balance of floral and cedar for a fabulously fresh scent that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent.  This is one of my favorite scents. Although it was not the perfume rather the Eu de toilet , the scent didn&#x27;t last as long. Other than that, great price and service.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot, but the label fell off the bottle</li>
    <li> This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled, it kinda puts me in the mind of my Balenciaga,both smell heavenly. I got mine from Macy&#x27;s,I just can&#x27;t trust buying perfume from here after reading some of the comments.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a scam like some have said, but it is definitely NOT eau de parfum, as it is described. It is eau de toilette, which is a big difference.  There&#x27;s no way the price could be that low for eau de parfum, so I suspected it might not be correct (but was hopeful!), and when it arrived today, sure enough, what I received was not what was described. The seller definitely needs to change the description, as right now it&#x27;s false advertising.  It still smells great, but not as good as the parfum (smells soap-ier).  The scent lasts, but not a long time.</li>
    <li> My fave perfume and good price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> love it.  I get lots of compliments.  not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I found I received this fake Prada perfume. It smells different from what I had and cheap. When I sprayed a bit more than ususal, it releases a strong alcohol smell. Try to return it but Amazon says it is inflammable and does NOT allow me to return. Worst experience at Amazon!</li>
    <li> Piercing and striking, Prada Infusion d&#x27;Iris is able to adapt to the woman, expressing all his strength, with freshness, sensuality and lighting. The clarity of the notes of orange leaf, cedar, incense, tangerine, and obviously, the Iris, that blend perfectly.</li>
    <li> People who complain that they  can&#x27;t smell it after 20 seconds are olfactorily challenged. It is not a fake - I&#x27;ve tried it on many times previously at ULTA, and it has exactly the same composition and sillage and duration. It is the real thing.  I have both this and the Absolue edition of this and while both of these are based on the note of iris, this one is a lighter one - not shorter-lasting, but a greener and herbier one compared to the gorgeous and buttery head-turning &amp;#34;big guns&amp;#34; of the absolue versions. I love both of them, each in their own way.</li>
    <li> I smelled this at Christmas time when my daughter received it as a gift. I loved it and decided to try it out on me. I am very picky about my scent. I have not worn a scent for several years. I have always thought clean smelling was better than a scent that was too strong or simply did not smell good on me. Few people could be bothered with this scent. This perfume is a joy to wear.</li>
    <li> Oooof, truly awful base note.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the freash, clean, and light scent of the product. I think it smells nice on her. It&#x27;s perfect because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, which triggers my allergies sometimes, the lightness of this product prevents that; however with that said, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. Maybe four hours. It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re looking at trying something new that&#x27;s light, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up for a long-lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them!  Good price, too.</li>
    <li> SCAM!!! THIS IS NOT PERFUME. IT IS A CHEAP COPY. THE SCENT DOES NOT LAST AT ALL!!! WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WANT MY MONEY BACK!</li>
    <li> After purchasing multiple bottles of this eau de parfum spray, I began wearing Candy, but have returned again. Love it--it is subtle but present, an olefactory joy</li>
    <li> I broke the bottle I had at home and missed it so much that I had to replace it.  This is a long lasting scent that I really enjoy and I do get complimented on it whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Product is as described!!!</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to order perfume via Internet because of possibility of a fake.  This is real and the whole process was perfect.</li>
