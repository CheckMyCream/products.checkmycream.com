      <li>but I&#x27;m thrifty when it comes to makeup and even more so on something I&#x27;ve never tried before.  </li>
      <li>I have added mascaras on top of this already placed product with no problems either.</li>
      <li>I love it and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Save your money and get a better product.</li>
      <li>My mom seems to like this much better than I do -</li>
      <li>The mascara doesn&#x27;t run and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>The instructions (English version) were easy to understand and worked great!</li>
      <li>well worth it!!</li>
      <li>Affordable, easy to use and creates longer/thicker eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Easy to wash off.  </li>
      <li>When I do, I wear CoverGirl Outlast 24 hour mascara because it&#x27;s easy to put on and easy to take off.  </li>
      <li>At 66 my natural lashes are almost non existent but with this product my eyes, and full appearance and attitude have improved greatly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to apply it correctly.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>but I really have NO idea!!!</li>
      <li>I have decent eyelashes on their own, but wanted to try this to see what it was all about.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>I was originally going to give this set 3 stars,  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge or anything all day, but as soon as I put water on my eyes in the shower or washing my face,  the fibers come off right away and easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of talk about it and decided on this one due to so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>I love this item so much</li>
      <li>BUT it does not give full lash effect.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t hold for full day, though.</li>
      <li>I thought this might be the same as it has good reviews but was dissappointed.</li>
      <li>not bad.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
      <li>This mascara works better than the $30.00 transplant gel &amp; natural fiber mascara</li>
      <li>I really liked it, wish direction were in English</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>but for the price  it is worth it</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad it worked for so many other people.  </li>
      <li>I first curled my eyelashes with a very good eyelash curler made for asian eyes (Shiseido) and followed the instructions provided by Amazon because the instructions given with the mascara is in a different language.  </li>
      <li>Works well paired with the right mascaras.</li>
      <li>I am buying another of these right now, just to ensure I keep a backup.  </li>
      <li>At night I jump in the shower and it comes right off</li>
      <li>I still stand by this product but wanted to add a little more since I have managed to use the product more now.</li>
      <li>she has very short, very light lashes.</li>
      <li>Better than expected, fast and easy.</li>
      <li>If the directions are followed exactly as stated in the packaging, then you should not have any issues with clumping or fall out of fibers.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m most definitely buying it again ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</li>
      <li>Just like with regular mascara, in order to avoid spider legs look, I made sure to brush through my lashes.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more and tell my friends.</li>
      <li>,  however, by the third time I used it,  I realized I was putting on waaaay too many fibers.</li>
      <li>The instructions are in a different language,  but there are so many tutorials and reviews online and on YouTube</li>
      <li>The fibers do not go floating into your eyes during application and while it is not waterproof, as the packaging claims, it is most definitely water-resistant.  </li>
      <li>First off, this is the first fiber lash mascara I have tried.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m just not a heavy eye makeup user and it&#x27;s all new to me. :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is ok...I tried to go with a &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; fiber lash product as far as the price goes. I honestly think I would get the same effect if I just applied coat after coat of my regular mascara. This stuff does not build like I wanted it to. It does however seem to curl the lashes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I do already have fairly dark lashes that are an average length I would say. My mom seems to like this much better than I do - she has very short, very light lashes. So for someone like that, I think this would be great!! If you&#x27;re like me though - I think Younique is probably the way to go for us.</li>
    <li> Lost my lashes to the false eye clusters.  Once I used the Xtreme Lash Amplifeye to grow them back, the Relian Mascara set let me have thicker fuller lashes.  Love them both?</li>
    <li> Good product....it does what it will do....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few friends try to sell me the Younique lashes but I&#x27;m thrifty when it comes to makeup and even more so on something I&#x27;ve never tried before.  I am really nearsighted and my glasses make my eyes look small so I wanted something to give them some oomph but not damage my lashes like false lashes and glue do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product yesterday.  Since I was already made up and at work, I took this into the bathroom for a quickie application.  It wasn&#x27;t the best job, but I did have noticeably longer lashes when I was done.  A few rogue fibers made their way into my eyes but I knew that would happen with my hurried application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home I removed all makeup then reapplied the lashes.  Gel, fibers, gel.  No fibers in the eyes that way.  I didn&#x27;t say anything about having it on, but my son noticed that the lashes made my eyes pop behind my glasses and was surprised to see that it was a mascara and not falsies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I put it on gel, fibers, gel, fibers, regular waterproof mascara.  No fibers in the eyes and it holds up through accidentally rubbing my eyes, steam from cooking, and a few tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 13-odd dollars, you&#x27;re getting an insane deal!  My only gripe is the instructions being written in Chinese, but I&#x27;m sure English instructions can be  Googled or you can read other reviews.  I will definitely buy more and tell my friends.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t run and it&#x27;s ok. It didn&#x27;t help me to enlarge my lashes at all and it does not hold the curl of my lashes. The fibers stick to the lashes in the middle and not in the edge as it shows in the picture making my lashes look clumpy and stick all together. I&#x27;ve tried Younique before and it worked well. I thought this might be the same as it has good reviews but was dissappointed. I couldn&#x27;t return it as I am out of the country.</li>
    <li> I really love this! If you apply it correctly, it doesn&#x27;t clump at all and the look is SO natural. The fibers don&#x27;t itch or bother me all day like a set of false lashes would. It has a bit of a weird smell but it&#x27;s not bad at all. I let my mom try it and she ordered her own because she loved it too. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> The fiber tube was dry..will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Initially goes on very well but in a short period of time it begins to flake.  Not one I would use again.</li>
    <li> Worst fiber mascara ever</li>
    <li> I was doubtful when I ordered this product but after receiving it I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled! The instructions (English version) were easy to understand and worked great! At 66 my natural lashes are almost non existent but with this product my eyes, and full appearance and attitude have improved greatly.  I&#x27;m happy to have eye lashes again!</li>
    <li> I do not like the way false eyelashes look and have never tried them.  I would recommend this as a nice alternative.  However I found the product flakes off a little and was very messy to clean off when I wanted to remove it.</li>
    <li> I think it made my lashes look goid</li>
    <li> I ACTUALLY CANNOT GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION ON THIS PRODUCT!  I don&#x27;t know if this is how this product should be or not because I have no information! There are no instructions on how to use it. There is no paper insertion in the box nor instructions on the outside of the box. Basically I have 2 tubes and I don&#x27;t know how to use them! Very disappointing!!! I have also attached a picture of what was attached to the package the mascara was in. Very strange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked what I feel it should be but I really have NO idea!!!</li>
    <li> I only try it on...I didn&#x27;t wear all day because the fiber were falling off into my eyes. So I just wash it off.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I saw someone review it online and it does work! I think it may take more than one time to get a perfected look nonetheless it&#x27;s incredible what this product can do. I have very thin sparse lashes and I got them to look a lot longer but I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to get them to look wider. I&#x27;m sure I will eventually. For $10 this is a great deal! I&#x27;ve paid $8 for mascaras at drug stores that drag my lashes down but this keeps them completely up. I guess you have the option to keep adding the fibers if you want to keep going longer but the longer I got the faker my lashes looked. If I had stuck with applying it only once it would have probably looked a little more natural. I also tried it with adding these fibers and then applying another type of mascara over it and it worked too. I will probably keep this product stocked from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited Review: June 4, 2014- I still stand by this product but wanted to add a little more since I have managed to use the product more now. I have been able to use this mascara/fibers alone. I have added them on top of other mascaras with no problems. I have added mascaras on top of this already placed product with no problems either. I was just trying to get different looks going and was achieved. The only problem I did notice with this mascara is that if you don&#x27;t completely coat the fibers with gel, some of them (fibers) manage to escape into your eye and cause itching and irritation. I of course could not read this on my packaging seeing as it&#x27;s all written in Chinese. Just some FYI, I think consumers need to know.</li>
    <li> I like it but if I don&#x27;t do a final layer of regular mascara the fibers fall off throughout the day,</li>
    <li> Believe it or not this product actually grew my eyelashes ! I love it and I&#x27;m most definitely buying it again ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> love love love! I have long lashes!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars only because after a full day, I do notice that it starts to irritate my eyes. I work 10 hour days and find that about hour 9-10, my eyes are starting to water more than normal when using this product. When I come home from work, I have to immediately remove my eye makeup. If the directions are followed exactly as stated in the packaging, then you should not have any issues with clumping or fall out of fibers. Overall, I do like the product and most likely will purchase again in the future, it gives an effect similar to last extensions without the hassle.</li>
    <li> You put on the regular mascara then the fibers on tips of your eye lashes then mascara again and you visibly see them grow! It brightens up your eyes. It is not flaky like other people say and it does not feel heavy.They feel natural. At night I jump in the shower and it comes right off and I don&#x27;t see any racoon eyes when I get out. LOL...  I will buy again when this one is out. I believe this one is for keeps!</li>
    <li> If you have stick straight asian eyelashes like me that will not hold its curl then this is NOT the mascara for you.  I REALLY wanted to like this mascara because of all the great reviews, but for me it didn&#x27;t work.  I first curled my eyelashes with a very good eyelash curler made for asian eyes (Shiseido) and followed the instructions provided by Amazon because the instructions given with the mascara is in a different language.  I did not rush and I did what I normally do with my normal mascaras I use.  My lashes started to droop and lose its curl.  I am one to be very particular about how my lashes look like: no clumps, curled, lots of volume, separated, and long.  This mascara did not do it for me but I&#x27;m glad it worked for so many other people.  On to search for a new one!</li>
    <li> I really liked it, wish direction were in English</li>
    <li> Works real well, but must be careful not to get in eyes. Irritates. Don&#x27;t over apply. Didn&#x27;t hold for full day, though. Flakes off slightly throughout day. Wish instructions were in English. :/</li>
    <li> The fibers don&#x27;t adhere well to the brush so they seem to get on everything before they get onto my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Watched a youtube video on how to apply and its wonderful.  Lasts all day and comes off with warm water easily....I highly recommend this product.  Amazing price too!  Don&#x27;t hesitate...this stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> I actually am sending this back. The transplanting gel had a terrible odor almist eye burning.  Also not very impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> I have used better I bought in the store</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a slight learning curve to this, but I like it. It doesn&#x27;t clump up, as long as I comb through it. It&#x27;s important to apply it correctly. But at this point, I think it looks far more natural than Younique&#x27;s mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara&lt;br /&gt;If you like having a dramatic look and long thick lashes this is the mascara for you. It makes your lashes look so good. I just added two more to my cart!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! Save your money and get a better product. I see absolutely no difference on my eyelashes, to tell you the truth I think it just makes it worse. Once again don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Affordable, easy to use and creates longer/thicker eyelashes. This is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I was originally going to give this set 3 stars,  but I realized I had been applying it wrong. First off, this is the first fiber lash mascara I have tried. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of talk about it and decided on this one due to so many good reviews. The first time I tried it,  it came out horrible. It was clumpy and didn&#x27;t add length or volume. I was following the directions,  however, by the third time I used it,  I realized I was putting on waaaay too many fibers. I would apply the gel, then load on the fibers, then apply the gel again,  which resulted in too much product and my lashes stuck together and were clumpy. It did not look good at all. I tried again the next day and same thing. Finally,  the third time,  I applied the gel like with usual mascara then very lightly applied the fibers,  then put another coat of the gel.  What a difference! My lashes were clump-free and much longer. I repeated the process and they came out even better. The lighter I apply the fibers,  the better they look with the gel mascara.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with regular mascara yet because the gel one applies very thin and it looks like a regular and typical mascara,  but I plan to try another one. The instructions are in a different language,  but there are so many tutorials and reviews online and on YouTube that there&#x27;s really no reason to need those instructions. Also,  I don&#x27;t have to wait for the gel mascara to dry, so I apply one coat after the other without a necessary drying time. The reason I took off 1 star is because the description says it is waterproof, but it&#x27;s not at all. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or anything all day, but as soon as I put water on my eyes in the shower or washing my face,  the fibers come off right away and easily. Overall,  I would recommend it to anyone that wants longer lashes without having to use false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It did make them fuller and longer, just real flaky.  Easy to wash off.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy this brand again.  The instructions were in another language.  I don&#x27;t use everyday.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Younique brand!</li>
    <li> Love it...Will purchase more..does what it says.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Cheaper than Younique and just as effective. Watch a Youtube on how to apply, for those who say it doesn&#x27;t work. It can be subtle or extreme, its highly buildable.</li>
    <li> This mascara works better than the $30.00 transplant gel &amp; natural fiber mascara I bought a while back.  I almost did not try anymore of these mascaras because I figured if the expensive one was clumpy and fibers were dry and clumpy too, that the cheaper brand would certainly be that way.  I was wrong!  Glad that I tried this one before I decided not to use this kind of mascara again.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Too Faced &amp;#34;Better Than False Lashes&amp;#34; brand and loved it but hated the $35.00 price tag. I love this and prefer it over the Too Faced brand because the fibers are black instead of white and it blends much better with the transplanting gel. This gel isn&#x27;t very thick but could definitely be used alone as mascara. I recommend doing the steps quickly because it&#x27;s easier to blend the fibers and the mascara when the mascara is wet.</li>
    <li> Works well paired with the right mascaras. I use voluminous butterfly, relian, and then telescopic in carbon black. Works wonders on short sparse lashes. It was kind of a booger to remove.</li>
    <li> Definitely adds length and volume. Not quite as dramatic as the pictures though.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t really cause irritation..i have very sensitive eyes -- i kept thinking something was in my eye when it was just doing it&#x27;s job!  it&#x27;s a bit clumpy.  but i think that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be!  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I got this on a whim b/c my friend said i should get it.  not bad.  i&#x27;m just not a heavy eye makeup user and it&#x27;s all new to me. :)</li>
    <li> Better than expected, fast and easy. Took my nothing lashes and turned them into thick ,full and long! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! My lashes are pretty long already but they are so much fuller now. I get tons of complements! To make the fibers stay out I applied a coat of mascara and it worked out great!</li>
    <li> It wasnt anything like Mood Struck.  Save your money and buy the legit mascara.</li>
    <li> Takes getting used to applying</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. It&#x27;s not waterproof in the slightest and it hurts your eyes when the fibers fall in them.</li>
    <li> This suff is amazing works great arrived with in a week I can&#x27;t live with out it! I love this item so much I plain on having it auto shiped. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price well worth it!!</li>
    <li> Ive had my Relian Mascara for a week and im please. Ive been wearing false lashes for about five years which has taken a toll on my natral lashes. I love this product i dont wear make up to the gym but i figured its a good way to test the product. im a group fitness instructor so i sweat a lot i have not experienced the &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; the product really does hold up through all my sweating. It does not completely come off in the shower youll need make up remover wipes. The set makes your eyes really pop as if you had on false lashes.</li>
    <li> I  so love this mascara I have very short lashes now... yasssss love love love them will buy again extend lashes very well.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I don&#x27;t wear mascara on a regular basis.  When I do, I wear CoverGirl Outlast 24 hour mascara because it&#x27;s easy to put on and easy to take off.  I have decent eyelashes on their own, but wanted to try this to see what it was all about.  I put on a coat of my regular mascara, a coat of the transplanting gel, brushed on the fibers, then another coat of transplanting gel (which looks like black mascara to me).  Just like with regular mascara, in order to avoid spider legs look, I made sure to brush through my lashes.  I also only did one coat of each layer, but brushed through a few times to avoid separate my lashes.  I took a before shot (just mascara) on my left eye and after the Relian on my right eye.  I&#x27;ll post the pictures of those and the final product.  I&#x27;m also going to see how it holds up during a tennis match...I&#x27;ll bring remover with me just in case :-).  I will say that it feels \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; or thick on my eyes.  That could be because I&#x27;m not used to wearing mascara.  Update: I just played a 2 hour match in Georgia in August and sweated to death, yet the mascara stayed put.  Most waterproof mascaras can&#x27;t even stand up to the Georgia humidity, but this did.  Great deal! (Side note: I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup to play tennis, but I wanted to put this to a good test.)</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon delivered on time. This is a good product  I brought the cheaper one thinking it was dried up for ($5,??) The instructions are in Chinese.I watched you tube and I was putting it on wrong. I brought it the RElan for a little more to my surprise the instructions are I chinnes why the the Chinese get by without instructions in ENGLISH But will take our money . BUYER Beware</li>
    <li> Mascara is waterproof and lasts long BUT it does not give full lash effect.</li>
    <li> i like it but it dries out fast ....but for the price  it is worth it</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of fiber mascaras, and this is by far the best I have used.  The fibers do not go floating into your eyes during application and while it is not waterproof, as the packaging claims, it is most definitely water-resistant.  I am buying another of these right now, just to ensure I keep a backup.  This is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attached (scary) photo shows one eye with this fantastic mascara, and the other bare.  The eye that clearly that has mascara has only 2 coats.  Now, I should mention that the ends of my eyelashes are very blonde, so they are not nearly as short as the one eye may appear, but you can plainly see how well this product works.</li>
    <li> This product really makes ur eyelashes pop I brought some for my friends as well and they love it too</li>
    <li> good product. I recommend it to others. it really works and make your thin lashes look fuller</li>
    <li> I have used other products like yo unique and this is above and beyond amazing and half the price! I have used it for several days now and get consistent results. I apply about three coats to each eye once I put on my mascara. It helps to use a good mascara with a good brush for before and after. I love it and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I want to tell all my friends!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not horrible.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; but I can wash it off with only water. It makes my lashes slightly longer but not much more than cover girl eye lights, a normal non lengthening mascara.  I won&#x27;t buy it again but I like it enough to continue using what I have.</li>
